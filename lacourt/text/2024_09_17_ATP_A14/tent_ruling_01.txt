Legal Standard
 
Standard for Summary Judgment – The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Cal. Code Civ. Proc.¿§437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to¿any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge¿v. County of
Sacramento¿(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67 (“Juge”), citing¿FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima¿(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint,
the party moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(Cal.¿Code Civ.¿Proc.¿§437c(p)(2);¿Scalf¿v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v.¿Paetkau¿(1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿¿¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – The
causes of action brought against FCA in the TAC are: (1) Second Cause of Action
(Strict Liability), and (2) Third Cause of Action (Negligence).
 
FCA’s moving paper argument is
directed to both causes of action brought against it. 
 
FCA presents that a plaintiff
must prove that a defect in the product caused injury under both strict
liability and negligence and a manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when it
knows that an article placed on the market to be used without inspection for
defects proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being. FCA argues
that the facts of this case show that the seat was modified and, as such, (1)
the doctrine of superseding causes provides an affirmative defense as the
modification done by a third party was so highly extraordinary and so far
beyond the risk FCA should have foreseen that it would be unfair to hold FCA
responsible for the harm done to Plaintiff; (2) the facts in this case are
similar to Putensen v. Clay Adams, Inc. (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 1062 (“Putensen”)
as the driver’s seat was removed from the Subject Vehicle, retrimmed, rebuilt
with after-market replacement parts, subjected to a sloppy repair/manipulation
of underlying suspension wiring, and reinstalled with bots that were hand-tightened
to torques that were below FCA’s specifications and, as such, the Putensen
holding should apply; (3) modification in this case has been so substantial and
unforeseeable as to constitute a superseding cause of injury as a matter of
law; (4) FCA is not responsible for harm caused by another manufacturer’s
product and the person or entity who modified the seat is tantamount to a
manufacturer for purposes of liability; (5) there is no causal link between the
alleged defect and Plaintiff’s injuries as the seat at the time of the incident
was not FCA’s seat for the purpose of liability; (6) FCA had no duty to warn of
the dangers of the seat as the seat was modified and inadequately torqued after
FCA’s control; and (7) the Subject Vehicle’s Owner Manual states that consumers
should refer to the available service manuals, before attempting any repair
procedures themselves, and the service manuals lay out the torque
specifications for the Subject Vehicle.
 
The facts relied upon in FCA’s
argument sections are: UMF 41 (see Motion for Summary Judgment at 12:17, 14:1,
17:25), UMF 42 (see id. at 12:19, 17:27), UMF 37 (see id. at
17:28), and UMF 24 (see id. at 19:13), UMF 23 (see id. at 19:15).
The UMFs rely on counsel for FCA, Gregory Gilmer (“Gilmer”)’s declaration and
relevant exhibits. That is, the evidence relies on Gilmer’s statements
regarding the availability of service manuals (Decl. Gilmer ¶ 18), torquing (id.
at ¶ 14), allegations (id. at ¶ 31), discussion of what occurred with
the Subject Vehicle (id. at ¶ 38), and suspension (id. at ¶ 39); service
manual; and the declaration William R. Tighe (“Tighe”) provided for Johnson
Controls’ Motion for Summary Judgment. 
 
Plaintiff has filed objections
based on Gilmer’s foundation as to his own statements and to the use of Tighe’s
declaration.
 
FCA’s replies and concurrently
filed documents do not discuss these objections.
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiff.
As to the Subject Vehicle’s specifications, that matter appears to need
specialized knowledge. Gilmer does not establish the foundation for his
knowledge of the fact asserted in this statement or a basis for such
statements. As to Tighe’s declaration, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1115
provides: “The caption of a declaration must state the name of the declarant
and must specifically identify the motion or other proceeding that it supports
or opposes.” Tighe’s declaration was intended to support FCA’s Motion for
Summary Judgment and Gilmer provides no legal basis for the Court to consider
it for this instant motion.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains
Plaintiff’s objections. To the extent that Plaintiff has provided objections
that are not encompassed by the Court’s analysis, ante, the Court does
not rule on them as they are not material to the disposition of this motion.
(See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473c(q). 
 
As FCA’s arguments are premised
on the evidence objected to, with the exception of the service manual exhibit,
FCA does not meet its burden on this Motion for Summary Judgment. 
 
The Motion for Summary Judgment
is DENIED. 
 
The Court notes that FCA, in
Reply, filed objections to the Declaration of Naresh Kar (Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration). The Court makes no ruling as to these objections as they are not
material to the disposition of this motion. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
473c(q).
