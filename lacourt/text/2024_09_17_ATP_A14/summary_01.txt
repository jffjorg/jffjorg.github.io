And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying FCA US LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment. The motion was based on FCA US LLC's argument that it is not liable for the injuries sustained by Brenna Romines due to the modifications made to the vehicle by a third party. The Court found that FCA US LLC did not meet its burden of proof and that the evidence presented was not sufficient to support its claims. The Court also sustained Plaintiff's objections to FCA US LLC's evidence and denied FCA US LLC's motion for summary judgment.
