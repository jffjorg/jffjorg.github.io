And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a case involving Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC and Plaintiff Andrea Cervantes, who is acting as the administrator of the estate of Robert Stewart, Jr. The case revolves around the issue of standing, as the Plaintiff has not alleged that she is the borrower under the loan or that she can step into the shoes of the borrower.

Carrington has demurred to the First through Fourth Causes of Action, and the Judge has reviewed the Complaint and the First Amended Complaint. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not made any changes to the allegations regarding standing and that the Complaint does not include any factual allegations as to the Plaintiff's standing.

The Judge has previously granted leave to amend, citing California law that allows for leave to amend where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. However, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not made any changes regarding standing and that this will be the final time leave to amend is given.

The Judge sustains Carrington's demurrer and orders the Plaintiff to file an amended pleading within 30 days.
