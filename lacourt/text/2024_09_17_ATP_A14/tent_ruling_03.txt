 Case Number:  23AVCV01217    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  A14 The Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by Defendant
General Motors, LLC is unopposed. 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740,
747.) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power¿(2006)
144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.¿ (Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.¿ (Id.)¿
The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
¿ 
A general demurrer admits
the truth of all factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged
pleading, regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff’s
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿ A
general demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact
or law alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations
contrary to facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ.
Proc.¿§430.10(e), the party against whom a complaint has been filed may object
by demurrer to the pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion
to sustain a demurrer if there is a reasonable probability that the defect can
be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003) 31
Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified (Dec. 23, 2003).)¿¿ 
¿ 
-----¿ 
¿ 
The Court may, upon a
motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper,
strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The Court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. §
436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)¿¿ 
¿ 
-----¿ 
¿ 
Before filing a demurrer or
a motion to strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that
is subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an
agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§430.41 and §435.5.)¿ The Court notes that the requirement has been met. (See
Decl. Sandra Habib ¶ 2.)  
 
i.                   
Demurrer
The Demurrer is to the Fifth Cause of Action for
Fraudulent Concealment and is based on: (1) barred by the statute of
limitations, (2) fails to state facts relevant to the elements of the claim,
and (3) fails to allege a transactional relationship giving rise to duty to
disclose. 
The Court has reviewed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”). 
It
is unclear to the Court from the pleadings whether the statute of limitations
applies. The FAC does not detail the repair history of the vehicle (see FAC ¶¶
28, 33-35, 38, 42, 44, 48, 51, 70), nor do the pleadings detail when the defect
was discovered (see FAC ¶ 13 [“Defects and nonconformities to warranty
manifested themselves within the applicable express warranty period, including
but not limited to transmission defects, engine defects; among other defects
and non-conformities”]; compare with Exh. A [bumper to bumper warranty is three
years or 36,000 miles]). The Court cannot make a determination as to whether
any tolling of the statute of limitations applies as there are no facts to determine
whether the repair doctrine or delayed discovery rule apply. Regarding class
action tolling, there are no alleged facts that allow for a reasonable
inference that Plaintiff is a member of a class action lawsuit in federal court
that would toll the statute of limitations for the claims of unnamed class
members until the class certification issue is resolved.
Accordingly,
a defect appears on the face of the pleadings and the Demurrer to the Fifth
Cause of Action is SUSTAINED.
ii.                 
Motion to Strike
The
Motion to Strike punitive damages in the Prayer. It appears that the punitive
damages are based on the Fifth Cause of Action (Fraudulent Inducement –
Concealment). 
As
the Court has sustained the Demurrer, there is currently no basis for punitive
damages within the FAC.
Accordingly,
the Motion to Strike is GRANTED. 
iii.               
Leave to Amend 
Leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976), 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under
California law leave to amend is liberally granted, “leave to amend should not
be granted where, in all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette
v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial
court does not abuse its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave
to amend¿if either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no
liability exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and
previous unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a
claim.” (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857,
889.)¿¿¿¿
As
the TAC is unclear, there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
The
Court grants leave to amend.
 
Defendant
General Motors, LLC is SUSTAINED with Leave to Amend. 
Plaintiff
Christina Buco is to file an amended pleading within 30 days of this Court
