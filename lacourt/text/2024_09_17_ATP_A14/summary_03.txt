And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant General Motors, LLC is unopposed. The Judge has reviewed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and has determined that the demurrer is sustained due to the lack of sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. Specifically, the FAC does not detail the repair history of the vehicle or when the defect was discovered, making it unclear whether the statute of limitations applies. The Judge has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages, as there is no basis for them based on the FAC.

The Judge has granted leave to amend, allowing Plaintiff Christina Buco to file an amended pleading within 30 days. The Judge has noted that the requirement for meeting and conferencing has been met, and that the parties have attempted to reach an agreement through a filing of an amended pleading.

The ruling is that the Defendant General Motors, LLC is sustained with leave to amend, and the Plaintiff Christina Buco is to file an amended pleading within 30 days.
