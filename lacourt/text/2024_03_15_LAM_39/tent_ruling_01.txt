v. Rolling Hills Covenant Church, et al.
Case No.
23STCV21002
Motion to Compel
Arbitration
Special Motion to
Dismiss
 
THIS HEARING IS
BEING CONTINUED.
THE PARTIES SHOULD
NOT APPEAR TODAY.
 
            Plaintiff
Daniel A. Burgoyne (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against his employer, the
Rolling Hills Covenant Church, and certain officials (collectively,
“Defendants”) asserting causes of action under the Labor Code, as well as
claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful
termination, and defamation.  Defendants
now move to compel arbitration, which Plaintiff opposes.
 
            Both
parties have requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  (See Plaintiff’s Request to Present Oral
Testimony, dated February 6, 2024; Defendants’ Sur-Reply, date March 8,
2024.)  The Court believes that an
evidentiary hearing is necessary in order to assess the credibility of the
witnesses.  Therefore, the Court orders
as follows:
 
            1.         The Court advances and vacates the
hearing on Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration (currently set for March
15, 2024).  
 
            2.         The Court advances and vacates the
hearing on Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP motion (currently set for April 19, 2024).
 
            3.         The Court orders an evidentiary hearing
on the motion to compel arbitration so that the Court may assess the witnesses’
credibility.
 
            4.         The Court shall hold a motions setting
conference on May 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
The Court will schedule the evidentiary hearing/motion to compel
arbitration and the hearing on the Anti-SLAPP motion at that time.  
 
            5.         The Court’s clerk shall provide
notice.
