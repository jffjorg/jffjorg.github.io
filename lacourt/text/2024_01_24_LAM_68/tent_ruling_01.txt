SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Albert Agdaian alleges the completion of a sale
of certain real property identified as 7373 Perigord Court, Tujunga, with an
unidentified third party. During the escrow period, the escrow officer paid
claim for $67,153 to defendant Renaissance Estates based on an apparent lien.
Plaintiff denies any such basis for the charge or approval of the payment by
the escrow officer, though Plaintiff concedes to some lien liability. 
 
On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Intentional
Interference with Contract, Conversion, and Declaratory Relief. Renaissance
Maintenance Corp. answered the complaint on November 4, 2022.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Renaissance Maintenance Corp. moves to compel
responses to Form and Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request for
Production of Documents (set one) from plaintiff Alejandro Estevez. Defendant
also moves to deem Requests for Admissions admitted. 
 
The court consolidates the four separately filed motions
into a single ruling. Defendant served Plaintiff with all items on October 31,
2023. [Declarations of Jonathan Davis, ¶ 2, Exhibits.] At the time of the
filing of the motions, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 6.]
 
Defendant filed notices of failure to file oppositions.
The court electronic filing system shows no oppositions on file at the time of
the tentative ruling publication cutoff. The unopposed motions are granted. Plaintiff
Albert Agdaian is ordered to serve verified responses to form special
interrogatories, and the request for production of documents, without
objections within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a-b),
2031.300, subd. (a-b).)  The request for
admissions is deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a-b).)
 
Sanctions in the amount of $1000 joint and severally
imposed against both counsel and plaintiff Albert Agdaian, and payable within
30 days of this order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c) 2031.300, subd. (c), and
2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Trial remains set for May 20,
2024.
