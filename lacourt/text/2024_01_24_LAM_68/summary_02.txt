And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and requests for admissions. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Rick Ladd, who is seeking a refund of property taxes allegedly improperly assessed by the County of Los Angeles. The court has denied the motion as to the documents request, finding that all non-privileged material was produced and that the plaintiff had access to the entire administrative record. However, the court has granted the motion as to the requests for admissions, finding that the defendant's responses were non-code compliant and that the plaintiff is entitled to code-compliant responses. The court has also denied the motion to compel further discovery beyond the administrative record, finding that the plaintiff's challenge to the administrative proceeding is limited to the issue of the tax refund.
