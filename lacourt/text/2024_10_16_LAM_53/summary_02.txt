And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by S. Michael Kernan and The Kernan Law Firm (Plaintiff's Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Renee Tab. The motion is unopposed, but the court finds that Plaintiff's Counsel did not provide sufficient notice of the hearing to the plaintiff. Specifically, the court notes that Plaintiff's Counsel did not serve all moving papers on the plaintiff within the required 16 court days and 5 calendar days before the hearing. As a result, the court denies the motion without prejudice, allowing Plaintiff's Counsel to refile the motion with sufficient notice to the plaintiff. The court orders Plaintiff's Counsel to give notice of this ruling.
