plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Peter L. Kaufman and
Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi, LLP, f/k/a Panish, Shea, & Boyle, LLP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Tax Costs
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Peter L. Kaufman and Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi, LLP,
f/k/a Panish, Shea, & Boyle, LLP (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on January
12, 2023, against defendants Prospect Funding Partners, LLC, Mark Berlin, Mark
A. Larsen, and Prospect Funding Holdings (N.Y.) LLC. 
On December 1, 2023, the court issued an order granting the motion to
quash service of summons filed by defendants Mark Berlin and Prospect Funding
Partners, LLC (“Defendants”) and ordered that this action was dismissed.  (Dec. 1, 2023 Order, p. 7:14-18.)  Defendants thereafter filed, on December 15,
2023, a Memorandum of Costs, claiming $2,394.59 in costs. 
Plaintiffs now move the court for an order striking the claimed (1)
$631.75 in costs to transcribe the deposition of Mark Berlin, and (2) $745 in court
reporter fees for that deposition. 
(Memo. of Costs, MC-010, ¶¶ 4, 12; MC-011, ¶¶ 4, 12.) 
“‘If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary.  On the other
hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.’”  (Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor District (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 211, 222 [internal citation omitted].) 
The court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden to show that the
claimed $1,376.75 in costs relating to the deposition of Mark Berlin and
incurred by Defendants were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation because Plaintiffs have submitted evidence showing that (1) Plaintiffs
purchased an electronic copy of the transcript to be emailed to counsel for
Defendants for their review, such that it was not necessary for Defendants to
purchase their own transcription of the deposition, and (2) Plaintiffs hired
the court reporter, such that (i) it does not appear that Defendants incurred
$745 in court reporter fees, and (ii) even if Defendants did incur those fees,
it was not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation since
Plaintiffs had already hired and paid for the court reporter.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)
[“Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation”]; Lowry,
supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 222; Linde Decl., Ex. 2, Berlin Dep., pp.
83:25-84:6 [discussing whether counsel for Plaintiffs would be able to provide
to defendant Berlin an electronic copy of the transcript for review]; Linde
Decl., Ex. 3, p. 1 [invoice addressed to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the amount of
$1,364.75, consisting of an original and certified copy of the transcript and
other reporter-related fees].) 
The court finds that Defendants have not met their burden to show that
the claimed $1,376.75 in costs relating to the deposition of Mark Berlin were reasonably
incurred by Defendants because Defendants did not file an opposition to this
motion presenting argument or evidence establishing that they were reasonably
necessary to the conduct of their litigation in this action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); Lowry,
supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 222.) 
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to tax the claimed
$1,376.75 in costs relating to the deposition of Mark Berlin.  (Memo. of Costs, MC-010, ¶¶ 4, 12.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Peter L.
Kaufman and Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi, LLP, f/k/a Panish, Shea, &
Boyle, LLP’s motion to tax costs. 
            The court orders that the following
costs are stricken from the Memorandum of Costs filed with the court by
defendants Mark Berlin and Prospect Funding Partners, LLC on December 15, 2023:
(1) $631.75 in deposition costs (section 4), and (2) $745 in court reporter
fees (section 12).
            The court orders plaintiffs Peter L.
Kaufman and Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi, LLP, f/k/a Panish, Shea, &
Boyle, LLP to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
