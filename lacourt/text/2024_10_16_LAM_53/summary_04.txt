And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the Complaint filed by the Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC against Nargiza Babadjanova and Express Document Solutions. The defendants had argued that the Complaint was uncertain and failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has overruled these arguments, finding that the Complaint is not ambiguous or unintelligible and that it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also rejected the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff lacks legal capacity to sue and that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as these arguments were not adequately supported by evidence or authority. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the Complaint within 10 days and has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
