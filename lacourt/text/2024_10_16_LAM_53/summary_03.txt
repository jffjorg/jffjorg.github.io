Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion to tax certain costs related to the deposition of Mark Berlin. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have met their burden to show that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, as they had purchased an electronic copy of the transcript and hired the court reporter. The Judge also finds that the Defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that the claimed costs were reasonably incurred. As a result, the Judge orders that the claimed costs of $1,376.75 be stricken from the Memorandum of Costs.
