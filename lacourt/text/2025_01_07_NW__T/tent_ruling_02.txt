[1] Despite the Court’s November 5,
2021 order staying the action, Plaintiff, without leave of Court, filed many
Doe Amendments starting on March 8, 2024, including adding Geiser as Doe 1.  Geiser defended against the action by filing
a Motion to Quash and a Demurrer.  The
Court ruled upon the two motions but subsequently vacated the orders on the
Motion to Quash and Demurrer on June 25, 2024 and set an Order to Show Cause
re: striking pleadings filed in violation of the November 5, 2021 stay.  On August 7, 2024, the Court struck the
pleadings filed since November 5, 2021, which included the March 8, 2024 adding
Geiser as Doe 1.
