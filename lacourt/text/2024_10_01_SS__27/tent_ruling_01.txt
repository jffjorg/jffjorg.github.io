Legal Standard
 
On receipt of an expert
witness list from a party, any other party may take the deposition of any
person on the list.  The procedures for taking oral and written
depositions set forth in Sections 2025.010, 2026.010, and 2028.010 apply to a
deposition of a listed trial expert witness except as otherwise provided. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.410.) 
The service of a proper
deposition notice accompanied by the tender of the expert witness fee described
in Section 2034.430 is effective to require the party employing or retaining
the expert to produce the expert for deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2034.460, subd. (a).)  If the party noticing the deposition fails to
tender the expert’s fee, the expert shall not be deposed at that time unless
the parties stipulate otherwise.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.460, subd.
(b).) 
Discussion
The present motion
concerns the deposition of Dr. Babak Samimi, Plaintiff’s expert witness. On
October 17, 2023, Defendant noticed Dr. Samimi’s deposition for October 30,
2023, when the trial was set for November 8, 2023. On October 30, 2023, the
trial was continued to May 15, 2024; expert discovery was to follow the new
trial date, setting a new an expert discovery deadline of May 1, 2024.
With the trial and
expert discovery continued, the parties tentatively addressed scheduling Dr.
Samimi’s deposition for January or February 2024 (Ex. C), but no specific date
was settled upon.  In any event, Defendant
did not serve a deposition notice for Dr. Samimi before the expert discovery
cutoff date of May 1, 2024, nor was any motion to compel expert discovery filed
prior to that deadline. It was not until August 22, 2024, that Defendant noticed
Dr. Samimi’s deposition for August 26, 2024 (Ex. G). On September 5, 2024,
Defendant filed the present motion to compel. Both the deposition notice and
the motion were served after the expert discovery cutoff date of May 1, 2024.
As to the expert
discovery cutoff, the record shows that despite the Court continuing the case
multiple times since May 15, 2024, expert discovery was not reopened after the
May 1 cut-off. On April 30, 2024, the trial was continued from May 15, 2024, to
July 2, 2024, with no mention of extending expert or fact discovery. On June 3,
2024, the trial was further continued from July 2, 2024, to September 10, 2024.
The tentative decision stated that all pretrial dates would not follow the new
trial date, as Plaintiff had not addressed the factors required to extend or
reopen discovery. On September 9, 2024, the court continued the trial again,
from September 10, 2024, to November 13, 2024. The order specified that
discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates would remain tied to the prior
trial date unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or pursuant to a court
order. The only court order related to expert discovery was the July 15, 2024,
order on Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s late expert designation, in
which the court reopened discovery solely for the limited purpose of allowing
Plaintiff to depose Defendant’s late-designated expert.
There is no ruling
indicating that expert discovery was reopened beyond May 1, 2024, to allow
Defendant to depose Dr. Samimi. Discovery cannot be reopened unless stipulated
by the parties or granted by the court through a motion, and no motion to
reopen expert discovery has been filed. Since May 15, 2024, the Court has
continued the trial several times, but the minute orders make no mention of
reopening expert discovery. Therefore, expert discovery remained closed as of
May 1, 2024.
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff has waived her argument regarding the expert discovery cutoff date,
but that is not the central issue here. Regardless of whether Plaintiff waived
this argument, the critical point is that, under California law, when a
discovery motion is heard after the discovery motion hearing cutoff date, the
court cannot grant a motion to compel unless it first rules on a motion to
reopen discovery (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging
Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588). In this case, no such
motion to reopen expert discovery was filed. Without reopening discovery, the
court is procedurally barred from considering a motion to compel. 
Furthermore, no
explanation has been provided as to why Defendant waited until August 2024 to
serve Dr. Samimi’s deposition notice and only filed a motion to compel shortly
thereafter, despite expert discovery having been closed for three months.
Defendant argues that Katherine
Smith, Plaintiff’s then-handling attorney, promised to provide dates for Dr.
Samimi’s deposition but failed to do so, and that, based on this alleged
misrepresentation, Defendant allowed the deadline to pass without filing a
motion. However, Plaintiff produced text messages from Ms. Smith stating that
no such representations were ever made. Despite Defendant’s objection to the
text messages, no email communication or any other evidence has been submitted
to support the allegation of such a promise. Based on the foregoing findings,
the motion is denied. The sanctions request is also denied.
