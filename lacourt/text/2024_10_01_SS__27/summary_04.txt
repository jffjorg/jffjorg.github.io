The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Alisa Gabay, regarding the plaintiff's request for admissions (RFAs) and form interrogatories. The plaintiff has taken issue with the defendant's responses, which mainly relate to the roles of other defendants in causing the incident. The judge has found that the defendant's responses are non-responsive and did not act with substantial justification in responding to the RFAs and form interrogatories. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the ruling. Additionally, the court will discuss the issue of sanctions with the parties due to the defendant's failure to comply with discovery requests.
