And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement, finding that the settlement of $50,000 between the Plaintiff and the Unruh Defendants is reasonable and in good faith. The judge considered the following factors in making this determination: the estimated value of the case, the parties' proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants.

The judge noted that the settlement amount is within the ballpark, considering that the estimated value of the case is around $600,000 and the Unruh Defendants' policy limit is $50,000. The judge also took into account that Jacob Unruh, the driver of the Camry, has no assets and the settlement represents the Unruh Defendants' policy limit.

The judge rejected the Falck Defendants' argument that the Unruh Defendants have not provided an allocation of the settlement funds, finding that allocation is not required in a typical one-plaintiff, multiple-defendants, personal injury action.

The judge's ruling is subject to modification based on any further submissions from the parties.
