And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Dr. Babak Samimi, the plaintiff's expert witness. The defendant did not serve a deposition notice for Dr. Samimi before the expert discovery cutoff date of May 1, 2024, and did not file a motion to compel until September 5, 2024. The court ruled that under California law, when a discovery motion is heard after the discovery motion hearing cutoff date, the court cannot grant a motion to compel unless it first rules on a motion to reopen discovery. Since no motion to reopen expert discovery was filed, the court is procedurally barred from considering the motion to compel. The court also denied the defendant's request for sanctions.
