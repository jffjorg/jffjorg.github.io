And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint, allowing the plaintiff to substitute Del Monte Foods as a Doe defendant and assert additional causes of action for strict product liability, negligent product liability, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and breach of implied warranty of fitness against Del Monte Foods.

The judge finds that the original complaint stated a valid cause of action against Del Monte Foods, and that the amended complaint relates back to the original complaint. The judge also finds that the defendant had adequate notice of the claim based on the original pleading, and that the amended complaint alleges facts sufficiently similar to those in the original complaint.

The judge cites several California cases in support of its decision, including Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-601, Garrison v. Board of Directors (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1670, 1678, and Idding v. North Bay Construction Co. (1995) 39 Cal. App. 4th 1111, 1114.
