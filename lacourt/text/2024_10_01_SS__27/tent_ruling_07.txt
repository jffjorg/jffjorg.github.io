CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV12335 MICHAEL CLAYTON
vs XPO LOGISTICS FREIGHT, INC., et al.
Moving Party: Defendant AMAROK LLC 
Responding Party: UNOPPOSED
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE
IS GRANTED
 
On May 31, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the present case, alleging that he was electrocuted by an
electric security fence. Defendants filed their answers in early 2024. The
trial is currently scheduled for November 27, 2024. Defendant Amarok LLC now
moves the Court to continue the trial to June 2025. The reason for the
continuance is to allow additional time for discovery. Plaintiff’s deposition
and independent medical examination (IME) have not yet been conducted. The
parties plan to attend mediation on January 27, 2025. Defendant’s request for
additional time to conduct discovery is reasonable given the limited amount of
time the parties have had for discovery thus far. The parties agreed to
continue the trial to June 2025. This is the first continuance request made by
the parties. Given these circumstances, the motion to continue the trial is
granted.
The new Trial Date is
set for June __, 2025, at
8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to June__, 2025, at 10:00
a.m. All case-related deadlines will follow the new trial date.
The June 2025 trial
date is to be considered firm.
