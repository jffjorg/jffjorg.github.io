Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The defendant's motion was to add two new defendants, L.A. Floors Removal & Concrete Plumbing and Jeffrey Frankel Plumbing Inc., and two new claims for equitable indemnity and contribution/apportionment of fault. The defendant claims that these new defendants were responsible for the spread of silica dust, which the plaintiff alleges was caused by the defendant's services. The plaintiff does not oppose the motion.

The judge has reviewed the defendant's declaration in support of the motion and finds that it satisfies the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. The judge notes that the defendant claims that it only learned the facts that required the proposed amendments during discovery, investigation, and in preparing for mediation on August 8, 2024. However, the judge cannot determine whether there was unreasonable delay.

The judge concludes that although delay alone may not justify denying leave to amend, it is also important to consider whether the opposing party was prejudiced by the amendment. In this case, the plaintiff has not shown prejudice, and the trial has been continued to March 24, 2025. Therefore, the judge grants leave to amend and allows the defendant to file its first amended cross-complaint.
