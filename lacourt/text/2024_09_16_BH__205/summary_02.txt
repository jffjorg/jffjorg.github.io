Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Alcima against Kim Gordon, Inc. and Kim Gordon. The demurrer argues that Alcima has not pleaded fraud with particularity, that Alcima's allegations contradict judicial admissions that it hired other defendants to perform construction work on the property, and that Alcima's fraud claim is barred by the economic loss rule.

The judge agrees that Alcima has not pleaded fraud with particularity and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge also rejects the other two arguments raised by Cross-Defendants for their demurrer.

The judge notes that Alcima's fraud claim fails to specify the representations that were made or to whom they were made, and that Alcima is required to identify the particular person to whom Gordon made the alleged representations or what relationship they had to Alcima.

The judge also disagrees with Cross-Defendants' argument that Alcima is judicially estopped from alleging that they performed work on the property because Alcima elsewhere alleged that other cross-defendants performed the construction work on the property.

Finally, the judge notes that while the economic loss rule provides that there is no recovery in tort for negligently inflicted "purely economic losses", there are exceptions to this rule, including where the contract was fraudulently induced.
