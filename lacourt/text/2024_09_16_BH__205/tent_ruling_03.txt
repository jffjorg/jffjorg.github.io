CASE
  NAME: Forwardline Financial, LLC v. Dragan Perovic 
CASE
  NUMBER: 
  23SMCV05874
 


COMP.
  FILED:  December 18, 2023
 



 
 
PROCEEDINGS:                          REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
MOVING PARTY:               Forwardline Financial, LLC  
RESPONDING PARTY:      Dragan Perovic 
 
BACKGROUND
This is a breach of
contract case.  PD Freight LLC (“Borrower”)
applied for a loan from Plaintiff Forwardline Financial, LLC, pursuant to a
Loan and Security Agreement (the “Agreement”). 
Defendant Dragan Perovic executed a personal guarantee whereby, if PD
Freight, LLC defaulted on the loan, he would be personally liable to
Plaintiff.  Borrower defaulted on the
loan, owing $29,921.58.
On December 18, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging claims for breach of contract, account
stated and open book account.  The
Complaint seeks damages in the amount of $29,921.58, plus interest at the rate
of 10% per annum, attorneys’ fees and costs. 

Plaintiff served Defendant by substitute
service on February 13, 2024.  Defendant was
obligated to respond within 30 days.  Defendant
did not do so.  Plaintiff successfully
requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s
Office on April 10, 2024.  Plaintiff requested
a default judgment on June 4, 2024.  Plaintiff
served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request
for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not
appeared.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
 
Default judgment against
Defendant for a total of $37,005.66, which is comprised of: (1) $29,921.58, for
damages, (2) $5,394.08 in interest, (3) $1,200 in attorneys’ fees and (4) $490,
for costs. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code Civ. Proc. § 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining
a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint seeks
compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from
the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter
the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the
complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or
monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional
evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request
entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively
establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.  (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also
allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)
 
Multiple specific documents
are required, such as:
(1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest
computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a
proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. §
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.) 
Here, Plaintiff has
properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a
default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff declares via declaration that there
have been damages in the amount of $29,291.58 as amounts owing under the loan
and guaranty.  A memorandum of costs in
the amount of $490 is set forth in Item 10 of the CIV-100 form.  The evidence submitted (the Agreement, the Guaranty
and the Statement of Account) is authenticated by further declaration.  Plaintiff seeks $1,200 in attorneys’ fees,
which is authorized under Civ. Code § 1717.5 and also supported
by declaration.  Plaintiff seeks
$5,394.08 in interest, from the default date of June 22, 2022 through and
including April 10, 2024, which calculation is supported by declaration.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served
Defendant more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default
judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void
or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military
status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess
of the amount stated in the Complaint, requested dismissal of doe defendants and
filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).  As
default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing
whatsoever from Defendant, default judgment is appropriate here. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
 
For the foregoing reasons,
Plaintiff Forwardline Financial, LLC’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED
as to Defendant Dragan Perovic.  Judgment
in the amount of $37,005.66 is awarded in favor of Plaintiff.
