And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the City of Temple City's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Guirong Chen from using, occupying, or maintaining a property in a manner that violates the Temple City Municipal Code. The property, located at 6059 Golden West Avenue, was found to be operating as an unpermitted short-term rental, and the City alleges that Chen has violated various sections of the Code, including installation of artificial turf, unpermitted construction, and planting of fig trees without prior approval. The City has established that it is reasonably probable that it will prevail on the merits, and Chen did not oppose the motion. Therefore, the Court grants the preliminary injunction, ordering Chen to cancel all future reservations for the property as a short-term rental and remove all advertising of the property as a short-term rental.
