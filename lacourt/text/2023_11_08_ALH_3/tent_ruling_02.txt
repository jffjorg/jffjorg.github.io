I.           
INTRODUCTION
On September 15, 2023, plaintiff City
of Temple City (“Plaintiff”) filed this complaint for injunctive and other
equitable relief against defendant Guirong Chen (“Defendant”) asserting causes
of action for public nuisance and public nuisance per se. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant is operating or allowing the operation of an unpermitted
short-term rental at the property located at 6059 Golden West Avenue, Temple
City, California 91780 (the “Property”). Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant
has violated various other sections of the Temple City Municipal Code (“TCMC”)
including, but not limited to, installation of artificial turf, unpermitted
construction, and the planting of fig trees without prior approval. On October
12, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining
Defendant and his agents, employees, servants, successors, or assigns, or
anyone acting on his behalf or in concert with him, from: (1) using, occupying,
or maintaining the Subject Property in a manner that violates the TCMC and (2)
using, listing, renting, or advertising the Subject Property for short-term
rental activity. Plaintiff further requests that Defendant, within 10 days of
service of the preliminary injunction order, cancel all future reservations for
the Subject Property as a short-term rental and remove all advertising, whether
via the Internet or otherwise, of the Subject Property as a short-term rental.
The motion is unopposed. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final
resolution upon a trial. (See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc.
(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) The status quo has been defined to mean the last
actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy. (14859
Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.)
Preliminary injunctive relief requires the use of competent evidence to create
a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for relief. (See, e.g.,
ReadyLink Healthcare v. Cotton (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) The burden of proof is on
the plaintiff as moving party. (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.)  The decision to
grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of
the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of
discretion. (Thornton v. Carlson (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.) 
A
violation of a valid ordinance may be enjoined. (City of Stockton v. Frisbie
& Latta (1928) 93 Cal.App. 277, 289–290; City of San Mateo v. Hardy (1944)
64 Cal.App.2d 794, 796; County of San Diego v. Carlstrom (1961) 196
Cal.App.2d 485, 491.) Where a governmental entity seeks to enjoin the alleged
violation of an ordinance or statute that specifically provides for injunctive
relief, the governmental entity need only establish that it is “reasonably
probable” that it will prevail on the merits. (IT Corp. v. County of
Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 71.) Once the governmental entity has done
so, there is a rebuttable presumption that the potential harm to the public
outweighs the potential harm to the defendant. (Id. at p. 72.) In other words, the Court must presume
that the harm the plaintiff would suffer if the requested injunctive relief is
denied outweighs any harm the defendant might suffer if the injunction is
issued, unless the defendant can demonstrate grave or irreparable harm. (Ibid.)

III.       
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for
public nuisance and public nuisance per se. When a law expressly declares
something to be a nuisance, the mere existence of that condition is a nuisance
per se and no inquiry beyond its existence is necessary to establish the
nuisance. (Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1206–1207; City of Costa Mesa v. Soffer
(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 378, 382.) No proof of a harmful effect is necessary where the
conditions violate a law. (See McClatchy v. Laguna Lands2 Ltd. (1917) 32
Cal.App. 718, 725). The declaration of Eric So, a building and code inspector
employed by Plaintiff, includes photos of the various violations of the TCMC
found on the Subject Property, screenshots of short-term rental listings on
Airbnb, and copies of the multiple citations issued to Plaintiff for the
foregoing violations. Based on the submitted evidence, Plaintiff has
established that it is reasonably probable that it will prevail on the merits. Furthermore,
as Defendant did not oppose the motion, Defendant has not shown that they will
suffer grave irreparable harm. Accordingly, Plaintiff has met its burden to show
that a preliminary injunction should issue.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary
injunction is granted.
