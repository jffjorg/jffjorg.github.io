And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants, Hand Made Productions, LLC and Christopher M. Kelly, seek to enforce a binding arbitration clause in a written agreement signed by the plaintiff, Laura Hand, in July 2019. The agreement outlines the operations of Hand Made Productions, LLC and states that all disputes will be settled by binding arbitration.

The plaintiff argues that the arbitration provision is not enforceable because it is not a written agreement to arbitrate, the arbitration provision is not conspicuous, and the provision is unconscionable. However, the judge has found that the arbitration provision is enforceable and has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration as to the plaintiff's breach of contract, business and professions code, fraudulent conveyance, and accounting causes of action.

However, the judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration as to the plaintiff's Labor Code section 229 claims, which relate to unpaid wages. The judge has found that Labor Code section 229 controls and allows the plaintiff to pursue those claims in court, regardless of the binding arbitration provision. The court will hear argument as to whether the Labor Code 229 claims should be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining matters.
