And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Lusardi's Construction's motion for summary adjudication against JSI Doors, Inc. regarding a claim for declaratory relief. The plaintiff, Abigail Miller, alleges that the hotel where she was injured denied her requests for reasonable accommodations and that the hotel and its amenities were inaccessible and/or dangerous. Lusardi's Construction is seeking indemnification from JSI Doors, Inc. for damages, arguing that JSI Doors, Inc. is responsible for the defective installation of the bathroom door.

The judge has ruled in favor of Lusardi's Construction, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding the existence of the subcontract, the indemnification clause in the subcontract, the scope of plaintiff's claims, and the scope of JSI Doors, Inc.'s work. The judge has also overruled JSI Doors, Inc.'s evidentiary objections and granted Lusardi's Construction's request for judicial notice of certain court records.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on November 1, 2024, to consider finalizing the tentative ruling.
