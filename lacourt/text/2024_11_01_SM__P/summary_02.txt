And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Biliack and his tenants in common v. D.A. BEEC-007, LLC and Anne Kihagi. The case revolves around a $2.8 million loan that was defaulted on, and the guarantor's alleged failure to honor its obligations. The Court granted a temporary restraining order on October 2, 2024, and set a hearing for November 1, 2024. However, the defendants filed a late opposition and a notice of related case on October 30, 2024, which deprives the plaintiffs of the opportunity to reply. Additionally, the defendants claim that personal service was only effected on defendant D.A. BEEC-007, LLC on October 24, 2024, which raises jurisdictional issues. Taking these considerations into account, the Court has decided to continue the matter to November 6, 2024, to allow the plaintiffs to file a reply and address the issue of jurisdiction.
