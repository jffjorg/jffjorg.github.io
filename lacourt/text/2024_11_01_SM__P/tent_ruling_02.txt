Biliack v. D.A. BEEC-007, Case no. 24SMCV02455
Hearing date November 1, 2024
OSC
Re: Appointment of Receiver and Issuance of Preliminary Injunction
Plaintiffs
David Biliack and his tenants in common sue defendants D.A. BEEC-007, LLC and
Anne Kihagi for breach of contract and breach of personal guaranty arising from
defendants’ default on a $2.8 million loan, secured by real property in Santa
Monica, and the guarantor’s alleged failure to honor its obligations. 
Plaintiffs
filed an ex parte application 10/1/24 for issuance of a temporary
restraining order and an OSC re: appointment of a receiver and issuance of a
preliminary injunction. The court granted the TRO on 10/2/24 and set hearing
for the OSC re: appointment of receiver and preliminary injunction on 11/1/24.
Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition 10/25/24. Defendants filed a late
opposition and a notice of related case D.A. Beec-007, LLC v. Diversified
Mortgage Co., Case no. 24STCV12943 10/30/24.
The
court notes defendants’ late filing deprives plaintiffs of the chance to reply.
Defendants also assert personal service was only effected on defendant D.A.
BEEC-007, LLC on 10/24/24. Decl. Nong para. 5; exs. 5, 6. If so, the court
lacked jurisdiction over defendant D.A. BEEC-007, LLC when it issued the
temporary restraining order. These considerations warrant a continuance. The
court will continue the matter to 11/6/24 to review the opposition, allow
plaintiffs to file a reply (due by 11/4/24 at noon PST) and address the issue
of jurisdiction.
