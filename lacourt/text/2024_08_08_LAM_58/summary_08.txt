And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint and their motion to strike certain requests for damages. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged fraud with specificity, and denied the motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's requests for attorney's fees, general damages for medical expenses and emotional distress, and punitive damages are legally recoverable. The judge has ordered the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for exemplary damages, finding that the plaintiff has successfully alleged a cause of action for fraud and is entitled to recover punitive damages under Code of Civil Procedure section 3294.
