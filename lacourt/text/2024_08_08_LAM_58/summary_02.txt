English-text summary:

The Judge has granted the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by the Defendant, Bunker Hill Tower Condominium Association and Seabreeze Management Company. The settlement was reached between the Plaintiff, Sanaz Afsar, and the Bunker Hill Defendants for $375,000 in consideration for a release of the settling parties and a dismissal of the action against the Bunker Hill Defendants. The Judge considered the factors outlined in Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, including the rough approximation of the settling defendant's proportionate liability, the allocation of settlement proceeds, and the recognition that the settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial. The Judge determined that the settlement was made in good faith and that no opposition was filed.
