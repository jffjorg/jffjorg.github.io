I.  Background
 
            This is an
action in which Plaintiff Jeanie Bryant alleges she was defrauded out of money
paid to Defendants Jon Allen dba Jon Allen Construction, Michael Zatorski dba
Ubuild Construction, David O’Brien, and Efrain Olalde, in exchange for promises
to build two tiny homes for her by September 13, 2022. On April 11, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Complaint for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) fraud—intentional
misrepresentation, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) deceit – Civil Code §§
1709-10, (6) conspiracy to commit fraud or other tort, (7) conversion, (8)
monies had and received, (9) breach of oral contract, (10) promissory estoppel,
and (11) Business & Professions Code § 17200.
 
            On July 5,
2024, Defendant Allen filed the instant demurrer. The demurrer is unopposed.   
 
II.  Discussion
 
Legal Standard
 
“The primary function of a pleading
is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation],
and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be
said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica
(2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)¿
 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal
sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of
America, N.A.¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether
“the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses
a complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.)
“The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿¿¿ 
¿
A general demurrer may be brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient
facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under section
430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of
the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
¿
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)¿¿
 
Meet and Confer
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.41(a), parties are supposed to
meet and confer in person or by telephone before filing a demurrer. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a).) Defendant Allen attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff and her former counsel but was unsuccessful. (Mackay Decl. ¶¶1-6,
Exs. 1-5.)
 
            First
and Ninth Causes of Action for Breach of Contract
 
First, Defendant Allen argues the
allegations in the complaint as currently pled fails to distinguish whether the
contract purportedly breached is oral or written. 
 
“Establishing that claim requires a
showing of “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.) “Further, the
complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or
implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985)
166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458–459.)¿
 
The Complaint alleges that on or
about March 17, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a written agreement
for the construction and purchase of two tiny homes. (Compl., ¶¶6-7.) The
Complaint further alleges that Plaintiff paid Defendants $120,000.00 in cash to
substantially remit the total cost of the construction and purchase in the
amount of $191,000.00. (Id. at ¶8.) The Complaint further alleges that
Defendant failed to perform under the agreement. (Id. at ¶¶17.) 
 
Although the allegations in the
first cause of action appear to allege the parties entered into a written
contract, the ninth cause of action is labeled “breach of oral contract” and
re-alleges the facts set forth in the first cause of action. (Compl., ¶¶72-73.)
Moreover, the ninth cause of action alleges that to the extent any of the oral
promise made required a writing, the writing is excused by estoppel and part
performance. (Id. at ¶77.) As such, the Complaint fails to indicate on
its face whether Plaintiff is pleading breach of oral or written contract. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to the first and ninth causes of action. 
 
            Second
Cause of Action for Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
 
Next, Defendant Allen argues that
the second cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a
cause of action because it is based on the same operative breach of contract
allegations. 
 
“The [implied] covenant of good
faith and fair dealing [is] implied by law in every contract. The covenant is
read into contracts and functions ‘as a supplement to the express contractual
covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct which (while
not technically transgressing the express covenants) frustrates the other
party's rights to the benefits of the contract.’” (Thrifty Payless, Inc. v.
The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1244.) As such,
“[i]f the allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract breach
and, relying on the same alleged acts, simply seek the same damages or other
relief already claimed in a companion contract cause of action, they may be
disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated.” (Careau
& Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
1371, 1395.)
 
The Complaint alleges that
Defendants violated the duty to act fairly and in good faith as described in
the paragraphs set forth in the first cause of action and common allegations.
(Compl., ¶21.) The Complaint alleges that Defendants violated the duty good
faith and fair dealing by making false promises and otherwise inducing
Plaintiff to pay $120,000.00. (Id.) 
 
As currently pled, these
allegations merely re-allege the acts set forth in the breach of contract
claims. (Id. at ¶¶9-11.) Duplicative causes of action are subject to
being stricken.
 
Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to the second cause of action. 
 
            Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action for Fraud 
 
            Defendant
Allen further argues that third, fourth, and fifth causes of action fail
because Plaintiff does not plead them with specificity. 
 
“The elements of intentional misrepresentation
“are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce
reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Aton
Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1245
(emphasis added).) 
 
By contrast, “[t]he elements of negligent
misrepresentation are ‘(1) the misrepresentation of a past or existing
material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3)
with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4)
justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.’” (National
Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services Group,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 (emphasis added).) 
 
Finally, pursuant to Civil Code
Section 1709, “One who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to
alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he
thereby suffers.” (Civ. Code, § 1709, see also Civ. Code, § 1710 (defining
“deceit”).) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be pled with
specificity not is a general or conclusory matter. (Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) However, “[l]ess specificity should be required of
fraud claims ‘when “it appears from the nature of the allegations that the
defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the
controversy,”[citation].’” (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System
& Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384.)
 
The Complaint alleges that
Defendants presented to Plaintiff that they would construct and deliver the two
tiny homes by September 13, 2022 in order to induce her to pay them
$120,000.00. (Compl., ¶29.) The Complaint alleges that Defendants knew their
representations were false at the time they were made with the intent to
defraud Plaintiff of $120,000.00. (Id. at ¶30.) The Complaint further
alleges that Defendants had no reasonable grounds to believe these
representations were true when they were made to Plaintiff. (Id. at
¶39.) The Complaint also alleges that Defendants represented to Plaintiff that
they would willfully discharge their duties under the agreement, which they
knew was false. (Id. at ¶¶45-46.)
 
These allegations are insufficient
to support the fraud claims are currently pled because they allege facts in a
conclusory matter without specifying which Defendants made what statements to
Plaintiff, when these statements were made, or even how these alleged
misrepresentations were communicated to Plaintiff. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of
action. 
 
            Sixth
Cause of Action for Conspiracy to Commit Fraud
 
Additionally, Defendant Allen
argues that the sixth cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action because there are no allegations that Defendants’
conduct was wrongful. 
 
“To support a conspiracy claim, a
plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1) the formation and operation
of the conspiracy, (2) wrongful conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy, and
(3) damages arising from the wrongful conduct.” (AREI II Cases (2013)
216 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1022 (internal citations omitted).)
 
The Complaint alleges that
Plaintiff was harmed by Defendants’ fraud and deceit. (Compl., ¶54.) The
Complaint alleges that Defendants’ are all responsible for the harm because
they conspired to commit fraud and deceit and to commit wrongful acts. (Id.)

 
As discussed above, the Complaint
fails to plead the fraud and deceit claims with the required specificity.
Likewise, a reasonable jury could infer on the face the Complaint what are the
actual wrongful acts of the Defendants’ to which they conspired against
Plaintiff. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action. 
 
            Eleventh
Cause of Action for Business & Professions Code Section 17200
 
Lastly, Defendant Allen argues that
the eleventh cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a
cause of action because it is based on the breach of contract and fraud claims,
which Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead. 
 
“To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff
must show either an (1) ‘unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or
practice,’ or (2) ‘unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.’” (Adhav
v. Midway Rent A Car, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954, 970.) A plaintiff
alleging unfair business practices under these statutes must state with
reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the
violation.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 619.) “An ‘unlawful’ business practice or act within the meaning of the
UCL ‘is an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at
the same time forbidden by law.’” (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation
of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351.)
 
             The Complaint alleges that the foregoing
conduct of Defendants constituted either fraud and/or breach of contract, and
other unlawful conduct. (Compl., ¶86.) 
 
As explained above, the Complaint
fails to (1) distinguish whether the parties entered into a written or oral
contract, (2) adequately plead breach of oral contract in the alternative, and
(3) plead the fraud claims with specificity. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to the eleventh cause of action. 
 
 
III. Conclusion
 
            The
Court therefore sustains Defendant Jon Allen’s Demurrer.  Plaintiff shall serve and file her amended
Complaint on or before August 30, 2024.
