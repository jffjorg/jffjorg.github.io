Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Defendant Jon Allen with leave to amend. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the factual allegations in the complaint. The judge finds that the complaint fails to plead certain claims with sufficient specificity, including the fraud claims and the breach of oral contract claim. The judge also finds that the complaint fails to distinguish whether the parties entered into a written or oral contract. As a result, the judge is sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff the opportunity to re-file the complaint with the necessary specificity.
