Tentative
Ruling:                  Plaintiff
fails to state a cause of action against Defendants.  if the complaint fails to state a cause of
action, a default judgment is erroneous and will be set aside on appeal. (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154; Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 282.)  Plaintiff’s request for default judgment must
therefore be denied.  
 

 
Background
 
            Plaintiff
holds a Deed of Trust as to real property located at 1912 Las Flores Drive, Los
Angeles, CA 90041 dated April 28, 2008, as Instrument No. 20080733829
(“Plaintiff’s DOT”).  Plaintiff’s DOT is
a second priority deed of trust against the property.  Plaintiff filed this action seeking to cancel
two other deeds of trust that were recorded prior to Plaintiff’s DOT:  (1) the deed of trust dated October 19, 1970
and recorded on October 21, 1970 held by Defendant American City Bank (“Cloud
DOT One”); and (2) the deed of trust dated February 19, 1982 and recorded on
February 26, 1982 held by Defendant Aetna Finance Corporation.  
 
            On January
30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for (1) cancellation of instruments and
(2) declaratory relief.
 
Discussion
 
            Legal
Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has failed to timely respond or appear. 
A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request
for Court Judgment and the following documents: (1) a brief summary of the
case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs
and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)
 
            A
defendant who defaults admits only facts well pleaded in the complaint. Thus,
if the complaint fails to state a cause of action, a default judgment is
erroneous and will be set aside on appeal. (Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154; Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201
Cal.App.4th 267, 282.)  “If the complaint
fails to state a cause of action or the allegations do not support the demand
for relief, the plaintiff is no more entitled to that relief by default
judgment than if the defendant had expressly admitted all the allegations. Such
a default judgment is erroneous, and will be reversed on appeal.”  (6 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th
ed. 2021), PWT, §223).)
 
            Plaintiff
fails to state a claim for cancellation of instrument 
 
            Civil
Code section 3412 states that a written instrument may be cancelled if “there
is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may cause serious
injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable.” “To prevail on a claim
to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the instrument is void or
voidable due to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a reasonable apprehension
of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the prejudicial alternation of
one's position.” (Thompson v. Ioane (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1180,
1193-1194.)
 
            Plaintiff
fails to plead any basis to cancel Cloud One DOT or Cloud Two DOT.  Defendants have therefore not admitted to any
facts that would entitle Plaintiff to the cancellation of either DOT.  
 
            Plaintiff
fails to allege any facts entitling them to a declaratory order finding that it
has priority over Cloud One DOT or Cloud Two DOT
 
            Plaintiff
fails to allege a declaratory relief cause of action.  “To be entitled to declaratory relief the
party need not establish a right to a favorable declaration.  A complaint for declaratory relief is legally
sufficient if its sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual
controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the parties under a
written instrument or with respect to property and requests that the rights and
duties of the parties be adjudged by the court.”  (Lockheed Corp. v. Continental Ins. Co.
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 187, 221.) 
“The complaint is sufficient if it shows an actual controversy; it need
not show that plaintiff is in the right.” 
(Id. at 222.)  
 
            Plaintiff
fails to allege an actual controversy with Defendants.  Plaintiff contends that “its right, title and
interest is first priority, paramount, and free and clear of all interest of
Defendant and all other parties, as of April 28, 2008, and at all times
thereafter.”  (Complaint, ¶15.)  However, Plaintiff fails to allege that
Defendants affirmatively dispute this position. 
Plaintiff alleges, “Plaintiff is informed and believes that each of the
Defendants may dispute Plaintiff’s contentions therein.”  (Complaint, ¶16.)  Plaintiff has not alleged an actual
controversy.  Plaintiff has alleged a possible
controversy.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
Request for Default Judgment is denied for failure to state a cause of action
against Defendants
