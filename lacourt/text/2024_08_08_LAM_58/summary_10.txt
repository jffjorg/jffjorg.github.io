And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Citizens Bank, N.A., has requested a default judgment against the defendants, American City Bank, et al. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against the defendants. Specifically, the plaintiff has failed to plead any basis to cancel two deeds of trust held by the defendants, and has failed to allege any facts entitling them to a declaratory order. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege an actual controversy with the defendants, and therefore the plaintiff's request for default judgment must be denied.
