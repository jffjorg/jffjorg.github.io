Tentative
Ruling:      The Court grants Plaintiff
Cipriana Mejia’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees in part and awards fees and costs in
the amount of $118,329.29. 
 

 
I.  Background
 
            This is a
Song-Beverly Act case. Plaintiff Cipriana Mejia (Plaintiff) purchased a 2015
Kia Sedona manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant). Plaintiff alleged that the vehicle contained or developed serious
defects and nonconformities during the warranty period. (Compl., ¶9.) Plaintiff
further alleged that Defendant failed to conform the vehicle to standard within
a reasonable number of attempts after presenting it for repair. (Id. at
¶23.) 
 
            On May 14,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for attorney’s fees, costs, and
expenses. Plaintiff also filed a Memorandum of Costs.  
 
            On May 31,
2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to tax costs.
 
Both motions have been fully
briefed by the parties. 
 
II.  Legal Standard
 
Attorney’s Fees 
 
A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A court may “reduce a fee award
based on its reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex case was
overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees
resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on inefficient or
duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the analysis must be
“reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of fairness. (Kerkeles¿v.
City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting
the analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award
to some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors
America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
 
Costs
 
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as
a matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a
statute expressly provides otherwise.”¿(Segal v. ASICS America Corp.
(2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)¿ “Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of expenses
that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032. Specifically,
subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are ‘allowable as
costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs, except when
expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides that ‘[i]tems
not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’”¿(Ibid.)¿ 
 
To recover a cost, it must be
reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)¿ On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. (Id.)¿¿¿ 
 
III. Discussion 
 
Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and Expenses
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees,
costs, and expenses as the prevailing party under Civil Code Section 1794(d)
and the parties’ settlement agreement. Plaintiff obtained a settlement of $70,500.00
from Defendant after five years of litigation wherein Defendant agreed that
Plaintiff would be prevailing party for purposes of a fee motion.  (Kirnos Decl., ¶30, Ex. D.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks a fee award in the
amount of $183,428.62 based on (1) $110,096.50 in attorney’s fees including
time to be spent on preparing a reply and attending the hearing on this instant
motion; (2) a 0.5 multiplier enhancement in the amount of $54,548.25; and (3) $19,783.87
in costs and expenses. 
 
Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees are
based on 287.2  hours of attorney time. (Kirnos
Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel identifies twenty-two attorneys and one
paralegal who worked on this case. The hourly rates of these attorneys and
paralegal ranged from $200.00 to $645.00. (Id. at ¶¶36-58.)
 
            Defendant
does not dispute that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees as prevailing
party under Civil Code Section 1794(d). However, Defendant argues the requested
fees are excessive, duplicative, and unreasonable. Thus, Defendant contends
Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees should be reduced to $59,450.00 or less.
Furthermore, Defendant asserts the hourly rates of Plaintiff’s attorneys and
the number of attorneys assigned to the case are artificially inflated, arbitrary,
excessive and unreasonable given the non-complex nature of this case. As such, Defendant
argues the hourly rate should be set at no more than $350/hr for all attorneys.

 
            Defendant’s
Opposition includes a table addressing each of the time entries submitted by
Plaintiff, which Defendant objects to as being unreasonable and excessive.  
 
            Excessive
and duplicative time entries 
 
            Plaintiff
counsel expended 287.2 hours on this litigation, which was pending for
approximately five years and was litigated up until a week before trial was to
commence.  Plaintiff’s proposed lodestar
total is $110,096.50.
 
·      
Unreasonably excessive time entries. Plaintiff’s
attorneys spent (1) 7.6 hours on reviewing the trial calendar and case file @
$349.30/hr for a total of $2,654.50. There is nothing indicating that reviewing
the trial calendar and case file would require 7.6 hours.  The amount billed is reduced from 7.6 hours to
3.8 hours @ $349.30.00/hr for a total of $1,327.34, a reduction of $1,327.16. 
·      
Duplicative time entries. (1) Counsel
RH spent 1.6 hours on October 5, 2023 preparing for hearing on motion to
compel deposition of Gavin Labeet, Counsel RH spent an additional 2.4
hours on October 6, 2023 preparing for and attending hearing on the motion @
$550.00/hr for a total of $2,200.00; (2) Counsel EK spent 0.4 hours on
January 19, 2023 drafting notice of deposition of Gavin Labeet, Counsel EK
spent an additional 0.4 hours on January 20, 2023 drafting notice of deposition
of Gavin Labeet @ $295.00/hr for a total of $236.00; (3) Counsel CWR
spent 2.0 hours on November 7, 2023 drafting trial brief @ $350.00/hr and 0.9
hours on February 28, 2024 to draft and revise the trial brief @ $375.00/hr for
a total of $1,037.50, Counsel DF spent 1.4 hours on February 29, 2024
finalizing the trial brief @ $250.00/hr for a total of $350.00, and Counsel
SW spent 13.2 hours preparing the trial brief @ $645.00/hr for a total of
$8,514.00; and (4) Counsel SS spent 2.3 hours on August 5, 2022 drafting
mandatory settlement conference (MSC) brief, 1.6 hours on August 11, 2022 preparing
for MSC, Counsel SS spent an additional 2.2 hours on September 12, 2022
drafting a MSC brief @ $325.00/hr for a total of $1,982.50, Counsel THS
spent 3.1 hours on September 27, 2022 preparing for MSC @ $500.00/hr for a
total of $1,550.00, Counsel EEK spent 3.4 hours on January 22, 2024
drafting MSC brief @ $295.00/hr for a total of $1,003.00, and Counsel JKM
spent 2.6 hours on March 4, 2024 preparing for MSC @ $495.00/hr for a total of
$1,287.00.
·      
The amount billed for preparing and attending
the hearing on the motion to compel deposition of Gavin Labeet is reduced from
4.0 hours @ $550.00/hr to 2.0 hours @ $550.00/hr for a total of $1,100.00, a
reduction of $1,100.00.  
·      
The amount billed for drafting the notice of
deposition of Gavin Labeet is reduced from 0.8 hours @ $295.00/hr to 0.4 hours
@ $295.00/hr for a total of $118.00, a reduction of $118.00.
·      
The amount billed for drafting, revising, and
finalizing the trial brief is reduced from 17.5 hours @ $540.00/hr to 10.0
hours @ $540.00/hr for a total of $5,400.00, a reduction of $4,501.50. 
·      
The amount billed for drafting the MSC brief and
preparing for MSC is reduced from 15.2 hours @ $404.32/hr to 6.5 hours @
$404.00/hr for a total of $2,628.08, a reduction of $3,194.42. 
            
In total, the requested fees are
reduced by $10,241.08 due to excessive hours and duplicative time entries. This
leaves a balance of $99,855.42 ($110,096.50 – $10,241.08.)
 
            Hourly
rates
 
            The hourly
rates to be used in computing the lodestar must be “within the range of
reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for
comparable work.”  (Children's
Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta´ (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783; PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095  (“The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work”). 
Particularly where it is difficult to obtain evidence of market based
rates for the same type of work, the courts look at fees charged for cases
requiring similar skills.  (The
Utility Reform Network v. Public Utilities Com. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 522,
536–537; Prison Legal News v. Schwarzenegger (9th Cir.2010) 608 F.3d
446, 454–455 (“all attorneys in the community engaged in ‘equally complex
Federal litigation,’ no matter the subject matter”).  
 
            In
determining the reasonable rate and reasonable hours, the Court looks to that
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” 
(PLCM Group, Inc., supra, 22 Cal.4th at 1095; Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1132 (“the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable
legal services in the community”).  “A
reasonable trial court might determine that the ‘similar work’ or ‘comparable
legal services’ related to insurance defense litigation, rather than to civil
litigation in general. Were the court to so conclude, it could view the
relevant ‘market’ to be that of insurance defense litigation and litigators,
rather than general civil litigation. The “market rate” for such services might
be limited accordingly. Again, we emphasize that such determinations lie within
the broad discretion of the trial court.” 
(Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691,
702–703.)
 
            The burden
is on the fee applicant to produce evidence that the requested rates are in
line with those prevailing in the community for similar work.  (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson
(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1019.) 
“Affidavits of the plaintiffs' attorney and other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community, and rate determinations in other cases,
particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney, are
satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”  (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)
 
            The trial
court is not required to adopt counsel’s opinion as to the “market rate” for
services of the type performed.  (Syers
Properties III, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at 702.)  The trial court may accept the actual rate
charged as the reasonable rate.  (Id.)

 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel consisted of twenty-two attorneys and one paralegal who performed work
at hourly rates of $200.00, $250.00, $270.00, $275.00, $295.00, $325.00,
$345.00, $350.00, $375.00, $390.00, $395.00, $400.00, $415.00, $425.00,
$450.00, $495.00, $500.00, $550.00, $595.00, and $645.00.  (Kirnos Decl., ¶¶35-58.) Counsel Kirnos
attests to his experience and knowledge regarding Song-Beverly litigation. (Id.
at ¶35.) Counsel further attests to the background and experience of the other
attorneys and paralegal who assisted him in this case. (Id. at ¶¶36-58.)
However, in reviewing the attorney’s backgrounds and the market rate charged
for similar services according to the Court’s own experience, the hourly rates
charged above $575.00 by Counsel SW are excessive. Those hours billed at $595
and $645.00 are recalculated at the hourly rate of $575.00 as follows:  
 
·      
Scott Wilson (SW).  17.4 hours @ $595.00 for a total of $10,353.00
reduced to $10,005.00, for total reduction of $348.00.
·      
SW. 13.8 hours @ $645.00 for a total of $8,901.00
reduced to $7,935, for total reduction of $966.00.
 
            In total,
the requested fee award is reduced by $1,314.00 for excessive hourly
rates.  Applying this further reduction
to the balance of $99,855.42, yields the total attorney’s fees total:  $98,541.42.
 
Multiplier
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            “The
purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether
the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.”  (Santana
v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 351.)
 
            “Perhaps
the most common multiplier applied, at least where a plaintiff prevails, is a
modifier for the contingent nature of the representation.”  (Id.) 
The court may not consider the contingent nature of the representation
in both setting the lodestar and applying a modifier.  (Id.) 
 
            Another
factor considered by a court in applying a multiplier is the “result
obtained.”  
“The ‘results obtained’ factor can properly be used to
enhance a lodestar calculation where an exceptional effort produced an
exceptional benefit.”  (Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 582.)  “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a
fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court
determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk
or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned
lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.”  (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)   
 
            Plaintiff
fails to present any facts that would require a multiplier to compensate
counsel for their services at fair market value. First, the case was not
particularly complex case as it did not involve any novel legal issues. Next, the
lodestar presented by counsel, as adjusted by the Court, fixes the fee at fair
market value. Therefore, no justification to apply a multiplier exists.  
 
            Costs
 
            Plaintiff
includes a request for an award of costs in the amount of $19,783.87. Defendant
filed a separate motion to tax these claimed costs. The motion to tax costs is addressed
more thoroughly below. 
 
            Motion
to Tax Costs
 
Defendant argues that $14,118.55 of
Plaintiff’s claimed costs must be stricken or in the alternative, taxed on the
grounds that (1) the deposition costs are not allowable under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1033.5(b); (2) the service of process costs were not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation; (3) the expert witness costs
are not reasonable in amount; (4) the court reporter fees were no reasonably
incurred by Plaintiff; and (5) the travel expenses and court appearance are not
properly claimed as a cost in this action. 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks $7,806.65 in
deposition costs for the notice of subpoenas and taking of deposition of
several party and non-party witnesses. Despite Defendant’s assertion that
deposition costs are not allowable, Code of Civil Procedure Section
1033.5(a)(3) expressly states: “Taking, video recording, and transcribing
necessary depositions, including an original and one copy of those taken by the
claimant and one copy of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are
allowed” are allowable costs. Furthermore, Plaintiff contends the deposition
subpoenas for the dealership personnel, i.e., service advisors and technician
were necessary for Plaintiff to obtain testimony regarding the communications
she had with various employees about the defects with the Vehicle and repair
orders. Moreover, Plaintiff presents evidence that depositions costs are for
transcripts of depositions that actually took place and the corresponding
invoices. Similarly, service of process fees are allowable costs under Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1033.5(a)(4). Plaintiff seeks $1,038.70 for service of
process fees for the service of the summons and deposition subpoenas. As
discussed above, Plaintiff explains the deposition subpoenas for the dealership
personnel were reasonably necessary to ensure they would provide testimony concerning
Plaintiff’s Vehicle repair history. 
 
Likewise, Plaintiff seeks $4,487.50
for court reporter fees, which are allowable costs under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1033.5(a)(11) as established by statute. Defendant argues
these claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation,
unreasonable in amount, and not properly claimed. However, Plaintiff asserts
the court reporter was used for motions deemed important in efforts to preserve
the record in case of appeal and Defendant stipulated to the use of these
reporters. Additionally, Plaintiff has presented invoices to support these
costs were actually incurred. Plaintiff also seeks $3,736.00 for expert witness
fees, which are allowable under Civil Code Section 1794(d). (See Jensen v.
BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.) Plaintiff
further contends that her expert witness Thomas Lepper was hired as a counter
to Defendant’s own expert, was deposed, and provided critical testimony
regarding how the defect substantially impaired the use of the Vehicle, and the
value or safety of the Vehicle. Moreover, Plaintiff submitted the invoices from
Mr. Lepper demonstrating the claimed costs were actually incurred. 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff seeks $459.80 for
travel expenses and court appearances, which are neither expressly allowed or
prohibited costs. Plaintiff argues that these costs were necessary because this
Court requires in-person appearance for Mandatory Settlement Conferences and
using her own attorneys for the court appearances would have been more
expensive. Also, Plaintiff has provided evidence that these costs were actually
incurred. 
 
The Court denies Kia’s motion to
tax costs.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff
is awarded attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $118,329.29.  Defendant Kia is ordered to pay this sum to
Plaintiff’s counsel on or before September 13, 2024.
