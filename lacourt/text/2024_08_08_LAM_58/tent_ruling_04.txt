II.  Discussion
 
Legal Standard
 
The Private
Attorneys General Act is “a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee
to recover civil penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be
sought by state labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756,
AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism for private
enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 986.) The statute incentivizes aggrieved employees by providing 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties, while the remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws…and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)  
 
            “The
superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part [Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) 
 
            “[A]
trial court should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair,
reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor
law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor
laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) A court should consider factors used in evaluating
class action settlements, such as the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the
risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of
further litigation, and the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Other factors
that may be useful in determining fairness include whether (1) the settlement
is the result of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is
experienced in similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is
small.  (Nordstrom Com. Cases
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 224, 245.)  In considering
the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and
necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.) 
 
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
 
Plaintiff filed proof of service 
that the proposed settlement and supporting declaration were electronically
served on the Labor and Work Force Development Agency on June 5, 2024, in
compliance with Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2). (POS, 6/10/24.)
 
Fair, Reasonable & Adequate
 
The Court finds the overall proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all concerned parties and is not the product of fraud, collusion,
or overreaching. 
 
Here, the parties attended a day-long private mediation on March 25, 2024,
with Daniel J. Turner. (Hawkins Decl., ¶8.) 
Prior to the mediation, the parties exchanged informal discovery.  This included information on payroll, time
keeping sampling, personnel and employment documents for approximately 35
percent of the purported Aggrieved Employees, along with Defendant’s policies
and relevant data points.  (Id. at
¶¶7-8.)  This demonstrates that the
settlement was a result of arms-length bargaining.
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff’s counsel avers based on the information and
documents provided through formal and informal discovery, Plaintiff assessed
the maximum value of the PAGA claims to be released by the settlement to be
approximately $899,500.00 at the rate of $100.00 penalty for approximately
8,995 pay periods at issue for the Aggrieved Employees. (Hawkins Decl., ¶11.)
However, Plaintiff and his counsel concede that the existence of numerous
disputes in this case make the outcome uncertain. (Id. at ¶10.) For
example, Defendant argued that no penalties prior to the PAGA notification
should be awarded because the violations were not intentional. (Id. at
¶19.) Counsel avers this argument presented a risk that some or all of the PAGA
penalties sought may not be awarded. (Id. at ¶20.) Counsel also
recognizes that “litigating a complex PAGA action is inherently expensive” and
“there is a real possibility that Plaintiff would recover nothing” had the case
not settled. (Id. at ¶18.)
 
As to the maximum exposure, Counsel asserts that Defendant argued that PAGA
penalties cannot be stacked, and at most just one PAGA penalty can be awarded
to an aggrieved employee in any one pay period. (Hawkins Decl., ¶21; Labor Code
§ 2699, subd. (f)(2).) Counsel avers that Defendant further argued that it is
unlikely that a significant number of current and former employees would travel
to participate in trial where in aggregating any material exposure, Plaintiff
would need to prove each violation as to each person and for each period for
which recovery is sought. (Id. at ¶22.) Similarly, even if Plaintiff
prevailed at trial, a trial court has considerable discretion to reduce the
penalty award. As such, Counsel asserts that Defendant could argue persuasively
for the trial court to exercise such discretion. (Id. at ¶23.)
 
Experience of Counsel
 
James Hawkins attests to his and
his firm’s experience in wage/hour class action litigation since approximately
2003 or 2004. (Hawkins Decl., ¶¶30-31.)  Specifically, Counsel avers to having
litigated over 200 PAGA actions. (Ibid.) Counsel further avers several
of his cases resulted in settlements ranging from six figures to
multimillion-dollars.  (Id. at
¶32.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees and Litigation Costs
 
Plaintiff requests $71,666.66 in attorney’s fees and $13,000.00 in costs.
 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (g)(1) provides “[a]ny employee who
prevails in any action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs . . . .” (Lab. Code, § 2699(g)(1).)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff is represented by experienced counsel. The
fee requested, $71,666.66, represents 33.333% of the gross settlement.  
 
As to costs, Counsel provides itemized billing statements. (Hawkins Decl., ¶38,
Ex. C.) The total incurred was $10,570.96 including the transcript of
Christopher Gate’s deposition ($1,461.96); expert analysis fee ($3,350.00); and
mediation services fee (¢2,625.00). The Settlement Agreement indicates that the
parties agreed to cap the costs at $13,000.00. 
(Id. at ¶2, Ex. A.)  The
Court awards this amount.
 
Accordingly, the Court awards $71,666.66 in attorney’s fees and $10,570.96
in costs.
 
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
Plaintiff requests $10,000 as a service award for his time and effort
exerted on behalf of the aggrieved employees. 
(Gifford Decl., ¶ 13.)  He avers
to compiling documents for his attorneys, reviewing many documents with his
attorneys, conducting and participating in responding to information for
mediation and informal discovery requests, participating in several telephone
conferences with his attorneys and their representatives, preparing for his
deposition, having his deposition taken, participating in mediation and the
settlement approval process, and expended approximately 53 hours prosecuting
this case. (Esquivel Decl., ¶¶13-14.)
 
Given that the original net settlement amount was $28,208.34 to the entire
class, the Court find that a $10,000 service award for approximately 53 hours
of work is reasonable under these circumstances.  
 
Settlement Administration Costs
 
The parties have agreed to engage Apex Class Action LLC (Apex) as the
third-party settlement administrator and requests court approval of $7,500.00
for administration costs. (Hawkins Decl., ¶39, Ex. D.) Phoenix will conduct
data analysis, perform skip-tracing as necessary, calculate and disburse
payments, provide tax reporting, re-issue checks, and perform other
administrative tasks. (Ibid.)
 
Counsel submits Apex’s bid for settlement administration, reflecting the $7,500.00
in costs, which are capped at that specified amount. The bid contains an
itemized statement of the various tasks that Apex will undertake. The Court
approves the requested $7,500.00.
 
Release
 
The Court finds the release under the Settlement Agreement is fair and
reasonable. The release states: “All Aggrieved Employees will be bound by a
release of all claims for civil penalties that were alleged or could have been
alleged in the Operative Complaint under PAGA for Labor Code claims that arose
during the PAGA Period for meal period violations and failure to pay premiums;
rest period violations and failure to pay premiums; failing to properly
maintain and submit accurate itemized wage statements; failure to maintain accurate
records; failure to timely pay wages during employment; failure to pay minimum,
regular, and overtime wages; failure to reimburse; and failure to timely pay final
wages and waiting time penalties associated therewith..”  (Hawkins Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.)  
 
Plaintiff’s counsel release states: “PAGA Counsel release on behalf of
their present and former attorneys, employees, agents, successors and assigns
the Released Parties from all claims for PAGA Fees incurred in connection with
the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Period facts stated in the Operative
Complaint and the PAGA Notice.” (Hawkins Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.)  
 
Explanatory Letter
 
Plaintiff sent an explanatory letter regarding the proposed PAGA Settlement
to the Aggrieved Employees. (Hawkins Decl., ¶2, Ex. B.)  
 
 
III. Conclusion
 
            The
Court therefore grants Approval of PAGA Settlement.
