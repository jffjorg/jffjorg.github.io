* Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 states that a party to an action may seek a determination of good faith or a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors.
* The court must consider the following factors to determine whether a settlement is in good faith:
	+ A rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability
	+ The amount paid in settlement
	+ The allocation of settlement proceeds among defendants
	+ A recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial
	+ The financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants
	+ The existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interest of the non-settling defendants

**Application to Facts**

* Settling parties: Plaintiff Sanaz Afsar and Bunker Hill Defendants
* Terms of settlement: Bunker Hill Defendants will pay Plaintiff $375,000 in settlement and assign the causes of action in its cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant VNH Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a C2C Restoration

**Conclusion**

* Bunker Hill Defendants' Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
