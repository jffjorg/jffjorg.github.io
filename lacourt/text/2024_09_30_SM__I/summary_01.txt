And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer, which challenges the cross-complaint's allegations of breach of contract and fraud, is sustained. The cross-complaint alleges a series of loans and related documents, but the latest maturity date of the latest loan is February 2017, and the statute of limitations on breach of written contract is four years. The judge finds that the statute of limitations expired no later than February 2021, and the cross-complaint was filed in August 2021, after the statute expired. The judge also notes that the cross-complaint does not allege the date of breach, but that it does attach the notes and contracts, and that the cross-defendant is entitled to rely on those documents to make its case on demurrer. The judge grants 30 days' leave to amend the cross-complaint, and sustains the demurrer.
