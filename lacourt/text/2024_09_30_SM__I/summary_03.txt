And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which was previously heard for a summary judgment hearing. The court has now taken the matter under submission and has denied the motion for summary judgment. The parties have submitted their FSC materials, including trial briefs and a joint exhibit list, but have not yet filed a witness list. The court agrees with the parties' submission that the case should be bifurcated, with Phase I determining whether there is a prescriptive easement and a nuisance cause of action, and Phase II being tried to a jury for the interference cause of action. The parties are required to file jury materials by October 7, 2024. The court has deemed the case ready for trial, but the exact start date will be determined at the hearing on September 30, 2024.
