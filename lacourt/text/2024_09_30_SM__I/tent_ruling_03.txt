 Case Number:  22SMCV02010    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The FSC order was given on July 25,
2023.  The matter was here for a summary
judgment hearing recently.  The court
took the matter under submission and issued its ruling denying the motion on
September 24, 2024.  At that time, the
court urged the parties to assume that the motion would be denied and to
prepare accordingly.  On September 25,
2024, the following FSC materials were submitted: (1) Plaintiff’s trial brief;
(2) Defendant’s trial brief re: bifurcation; (3) Defendant’s trial brief re:
easement; (4) Joint exhibit list.  The
court has not received a witness list (with time estimates), which is required.  However, if it is filed TODAY the court would
be inclined to allow it.  There is no
deposition chart, but that is not a problem so long as no one is planning to
use deposition testimony other than for impeachment.  There are no jury materials. 
 
The court agrees with what is implicit in the parties’
submission.  This case ought to be
bifurcated.  Phase I will be the
equitable phase and it will determine whether there is a prescriptive easement
and also determine the nuisance cause of action.  Phase II will be for the interference cause
of action and will be tried to a jury. 
The parties will need to file by Monday, October 7, 2024, the jury
materials—jury instructions and jury verdict form.  The parties may also submit a jury
questionnaire if they would like one.
 
Given the bifurcated nature of the case, and assuming a
witness list is filed by close of business today, the court deems the case
READY FOR TRIAL.  Whether and when trial
will begin will be discussed at the hearing today.  The court notes that it is starting a trial
today, so this case may need to trail that case.  The court might also have other cases that
are ready for trial today and, if so, the court will determine priority of
those cases this morning.
