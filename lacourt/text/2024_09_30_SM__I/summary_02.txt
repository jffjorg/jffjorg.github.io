And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the lack of response to a final status conference (FSC) order issued on December 19, 2022. The court assumes that the case has settled, but will confirm this with counsel. If the case has not settled, the court will need to discuss what to do. The matter is not ready for trial, and the trial date is vacated. The court may set a new trial setting conference (TSC) for October 7, 2024, but notes that it may be unavailable due to trial commitments. If the case has not settled and the court is inconvenienced, sanctions may be imposed on the parties and their counsel.
