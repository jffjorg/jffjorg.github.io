 Case Number:  22SMCV00922    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The FSC order was given on December 19,
2022.  However, the court has received no
FSC materials.  The court assumes that
this is because the case has settled. 
The court will confirm its understanding with counsel.  If the case has not settled, then the court
will need to discuss what to do. 
Plainly, the matter is not ready for trial.  If such is the case, the court would set a
TSC for October 7, 2024, at 8:30 am.  It
might be the case that the court is otherwise engaged in trial as of October 7,
and the days that follow.  If so, the
parties will avoid sanctions (assuming the case has not settled) because by
luck (not skill) it did not cause the court or other litigants
inconvenience.  Were that not the case,
the court would impose sanctions on the parties and their counsel unless, of
course, the case settled.  If the case
settled, that would be an excellent reason not to file FSC materials.
 
In either case, the trial date is VACATED.
