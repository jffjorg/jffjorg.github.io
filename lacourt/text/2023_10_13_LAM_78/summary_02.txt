And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Mahmoudiani's motion for an assignment order and an order restraining judgment debtor. Mahmoudiani seeks to assign the rights to payment of commissions from Samsami and Acosta to pay off a judgment entered in his favor. The court finds that the assignment order is not vague and is permitted under California Code of Civil Procedure section 708.510(a). The restraining order is necessary to ensure the judgment is paid and to prevent the judgment debtors from assigning or disposing of the right to payment of their commissions. The total judgment that may be collected is $52,921.59. The court notes that Samsami disputes the judgment amount and interest calculation, and also argues that the assignment order is vague and would amount to wage garnishment. However, the court finds that Samsami's evidence fails to show that the commissions are her only source of income or that she cannot meet her financial obligations without the commissions.
