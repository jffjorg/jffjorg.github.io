  Case Number:  19STCV23920    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  JAQUELINE NEWBY,Plaintiff;  vs. CHRISTOPHER OLMSTEDDefendants.  Case No.:  19STCV23920 Hearing Date:  October 13, 2023    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSELCounsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over a case. (Avenida San Juan Partnership v. City of San Clemente (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1267.) There are a number of exceptions to the rule, such as the collateral matter exception. (Id.)As the Court understands it, a trial court is not to take any action that might interfere with the appellate process. Here, the purpose of the motion to be relieved is unclear as there is not any on- going litigation in the trial court and the case is currently on appeal.The motion contains no mention of the appeal or Counsel’s status with respect to that appeal. Counsel has the ability to file a motion to withdraw as attorney of record in the Court of Appeal. (Rule 8.36(c)(1).) The moving party is to provide notice.
