And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The court notes that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over a case, except in certain exceptions such as the collateral matter exception. Since the case is currently on appeal and there is no ongoing litigation in the trial court, the purpose of the motion is unclear. The court suggests that counsel has the ability to file a motion to withdraw as attorney of record in the Court of Appeal and must provide notice.
