English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Enforce Settlement, as well as the Motions to Seal filed by both parties. The judge finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement, but failed to comply with its terms. The judge determines that the parties have a valid claim for breach of contract and grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

The judge also finds that the proposed sealing of the Settlement Agreement and related documents is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. Therefore, the judge grants the Motions to Seal filed by both parties.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 2.550 and 2.551, as well as case law, including Weddington Prod., Inc. v. Flick, Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe, and others.
