BACKGROUND:
 
On March 16,
2022, Plaintiffs American Patriot Brands, Inc. and GH Group, Inc.
(“Plaintiffs”) filed their Complaint against Defendants Element 7,
Inc.; Robert Divito; Josh Black; Element 7, LLC; Element 7 CA, LLC; Sigra, LLC;

LLC; E7 Lompoc LLC; Element 7 Chula Vista One LLC; Element 7 SF2 LLC; E7
Salinas LLC; Element 7 San Luis Obispo LLC; and Element 7 Hesperia LLC
(“Defendants”). The causes of action arise from the Parties’ business
relationships, interactions, and transactions. 
 
On
June 3, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Element 7, LLC filed its
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants American Patriot Brands, Inc., Robert
Y. Lee, Christopher Herghelegiu, Brian Pallas, and J. Bernard Rice. 
 
On
July 27, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Element 7, LLC filed its Amended
Cross-Complaint. 
 
On
June 13, 2023, Defendants filed Judicial Council Form CM-200, Notice of
Settlement of Entire Case. 
 
On
September 21, 2023, the Court dismissed with prejudice this case and retained
jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement,
including judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
 
On
January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Motion to Enforce Settlement Via Entry of
Stipulated Judgment (“Motion to Enforce Settlement”). In support of their
Motion to Enforce Settlement, Plaintiffs concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of
Michael Forman; and (2) Declaration of Kyle Kazan. 
 
On
January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Motion to File Documents Under Seal Pursuant
to CRC 2.550, 2.551(d) (“Plaintiffs’ Motion to Seal”). In support of
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Seal, Plaintiffs concurrently filed: (1) Notice of
Lodging of Documents Conditionally Under Seal Pursuant to CRC 2.550, 2.551(d);
and (2) Proposed Order. 
 
On
January 26, 2024, Defendants filed their Opposition to the Motion to Enforce
(“Opposition”). In support of their Opposition, Defendants concurrently filed:
(1) Declaration of Robert DiVito; and (2) Declaration of Nicole S. Phillis. 
 
On
January 26, 2024, Defendants filed their Motion to File Settlement Agreement
Under Seal Pursuant to CRC 2.550, 2.551(d) (“Defendants’ Motion to Seal”). In
support of Defendants’ Motion to Seal, Defendants concurrently filed: (1)
Declaration of Nicole S. Phillis; (2) Notice of Lodging of Confidential
Settlement Agreement Conditionally Under Seal Pursuant to CRC 2.550, 2.551(d);
and (3) Proposed Order. 
 
On
February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Reply in support of their Motion to
Enforce Settlement. Plaintiffs concurrently filed Objections to Declaration of
Robert DiVito. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Preliminary Issues
 
        The Court first considers the Motion to
Enforce Settlement. The Court then concurrently considers Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Seal and Defendants’ Motion to Seal. 
 
        Also, Defendants’ Motion to Seal is
scheduled to be heard on February 22, 2024. However, the other motions are
scheduled to be heard on February 8, 2024. All three motions consider similar
issues of law and fact, and the Parties have indicated that Defendants’ Motion
to Seal will not be contested. 
 
        Given that all of the same issues should
be heard and considered at the same time, the Court ADVANCES the February 22,
2024 hearing to February 8, 2024. Any party that wishes to contest this may do
so at the hearing on February 8, 2024.

    Legal
Standard
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a
summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod., Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) In deciding motions made under Section 664.6, judges
“must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
C. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiffs move the Court to enter judgment
in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants. (Motion to Enforce Settlement,
p. 10:4–7.)
 
Plaintiffs argue: (1) that the Court only has
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement; (2) that Civil Code section 1511 is
inapplicable because the Court need not find a breach of contract to enforce a
stipulated judgment; (3) that Defendants missed the deadline to pay the
settlement amount; (4) that there is no admissible evidence that Plaintiffs
breached the settlement agreement or prevented Defendants from complying with
its terms; (5) that Defendants have not provided any information which suggests
that Defendants have the ability to pay the settlement amount; and (6) that
even if a third party had agreed to invest in Defendants, they still would have
missed the deadline. (Motion to Enforce Settlement, pp. 5:24–25, 6:14–15, 7:10,
8:9–10, 9:1–2, 9:9–10.)
 
Defendants disagree, arguing: (1) that the
Court has discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which does
not apply where conditions to stipulated judgment are not met or the enforcing
party is in breach; (2) that Plaintiffs cannot enforce a settlement agreement
they have materially breached; (3) that Plaintiffs materially breached both the
Settlement Agreement’s non-disparagement clause and implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; (4) that Plaintiffs offer only paltry, non-credible
evidence; (5) that Plaintiffs’ attempt to attack Defendants’ ample evidence
fails; (6) that Plaintiffs apply the wrong standard under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 for breach; (7) that Plaintiffs have not and cannot
show satisfaction of the condition precedent to entry of stipulated judgment;
(8) that Plaintiffs prevented Defendants’ performance to manufacture a
“default”; (9) that Defendants missing the optional early payment is not a
“default”; and (10) that even if Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 applies
here (which, according to Defendants, it does not), the Court should exercise
its discretion to deny the Motion based on the factual disputes and equities.
(Opposition, pp. 11:19–21, 13:12, 14:2–3, 15:12–13, 17:3, 18:2–3, 18:17, 19:8, 20:20–21.)
 
Plaintiffs disagree with these arguments in
their Reply, with the notable argument that Defendants have not provided any
admissible evidence. (Reply, p. 1:9.)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs arguments. 
 
It is undisputed that the Parties have a
valid and binding settlement. Further, on the bases of hearsay and speculation,
the Court has sustained all of Plaintiffs objections. Thus, Defendants have not
provided any admissible evidence that would explain why they have not complied
with section 3 of the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of section 6
of the Settlement Agreement, it is clear that time is of the essence and that
it would now be appropriate for judgment to be entered in favor of Plaintiffs
and against Defendants. 
 
The Court determines that the
Parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. The Court shall enter
judgment that will conform with the written settlement agreement. 
 
D. 
    Conclusion
 
The Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. 
 
 
III.     Motions to Seal
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
A
party that requests that a record or portion of a record be filed under seal
must file a motion or an application for an order sealing it. The motion must
be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1); Savaglio
v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 597–601.) All parties
that have appeared in the case must be served with a copy of the motion or
application. Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party that already possesses
copies of the records to be sealed must be served with a complete, unredacted
version of all papers as well as a redacted version. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(2).)
 
The
moving party must lodge the record with the court in a separate envelope when
the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it
or it has been lodged previously. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4) and
(d).) The lodged record is conditionally under seal pending the judge's
determination of the motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(4).)
 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), a judge may order that a record be
filed under seal only if the judge expressly finds facts that establish all the
following:
 
(1)      
There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record.
 
(2)      
The overriding interest supports
sealing the record.
 
(3)      
A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.
 
(4)      
The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored, and
 
(5)      
No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)
 
In
ruling on a motion to seal, the court must weigh the competing interests and
concerns. This process necessitates (1) identifying the specific information
claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2) identifying
the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3) identifying and
accounting for countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, to prevail on his or her motion,
the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be
withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id. at p. 904.)
 
The
California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of
access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV),
Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) The court further noted
its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing
and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.” (Id. at
1210.) There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id.
at 1217.) This presumption may apply to seemingly private proceedings. (Burkle
v. Burkle (2006) 135 Cal. App.4th 1045, 1052 (divorce proceedings).)
Therefore, it is up to this Court to determine if that presumption has been
overcome.
 
Courts
must find compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of
less-restrictive means, before ordering filed documents sealed. (Hurvitz v.
Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc.
v. Super. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1208-1209 n. 25; Champion v.
Super. Ct. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.) A compelling reason could
include to protect confidential trade secrets, which “have been recognized as a
constitutionally protected intangible property interest.” (DVD Copy Control
Ass’n, Inc. v. Bunner (2003) 31 Cal.4th 864, 878, internal citations
omitted.)
 
A
proposed sealing must be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest,
such as by sealing portions of pleadings or redacting text. (In re Marriage
of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1052, 1070.) An application to seal
must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify
sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)
 
A
“contractual obligation not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest”
is sufficient to justify sealing the requested documents so long as the moving
party establishes that disclosure of the information will result in substantial
prejudice. (Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 110 Cal.
App. 4th 1273, 1283–84.)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiffs move the Court to seal portions of
their Motion to Enforce Settlement and the entire Settlement Agreement attached
as an exhibit. Defendants move the Court to seal portions of their Opposition
to the Motion to Enforce Settlement and the entire Settlement Agreement
attached as an exhibit. 
 
        Regarding the Settlement Agreement, the
portions of the Motion to Enforce Settlement that discuss it, and the portions
of the Opposition to the Motion to Enforce Settlement that discuss it, the
Court finds: (1) that there exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) that the
overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) that a substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; (4) that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and
(5) that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest. 
 
C. 
    Conclusion

 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Seal is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Seal is GRANTED.
