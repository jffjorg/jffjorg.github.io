And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Complaint filed by the defendant is sustained. The plaintiff, Anahid Golnazarian, filed a Complaint against the defendant, Stepane Kasimian, alleging a breach of contract. However, the judge found that the Complaint does not state a valid cause of action for breach of contract because it does not allege the existence of a contract between the parties. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's allegations of a breach of contract are based on a contract between the defendant and the Department of Motor Vehicles, rather than a contract between the parties. The judge has given the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the Complaint at the hearing scheduled for February 8, 2024.
