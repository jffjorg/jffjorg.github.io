And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and overturns the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the plaintiff cannot recover on a failure to prevent claim when the underlying discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims fail. The judge agrees with the defendant, citing cases such as Trujillo v. North County Transit District and Dickson v. Burke Williams, Inc. These cases hold that a plaintiff cannot recover on a failure to prevent claim when the jury does not find actionable discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. In this case, the jury found no actionable discrimination, retaliation, or harassment in the separate FEHA claims, and the judge finds that the jury's finding of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in the failure to prevent claim is inconsistent with the jury's findings on the separate FEHA claims. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's JNOV motion and overturns the jury's verdict.
