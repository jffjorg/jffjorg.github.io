 Case Number:  22STCV06679    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of Private Attorneys General Act Settlement.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Arturo Retama
San Agustin (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for: “Civil Penalties Pursuant to
The Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), Labor Code Section 2698, et
seq.” The Complaint alleges various wage-and-hour violations against Fresh
& Ready Foods LLC (“Defendant”).
Now, Plaintiff brings a
motion requesting an order approving the parties’ proposed settlement, pursuant
to the Private Attorney General Act, Labor Code section 2698, et seq.
(PAGA). 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Judges are to apply an
appropriate standard of review of PAGA case settlements, by inquiring whether
settlements are “‘fair, adequate, and reasonable’” and “meaningful and
consistent with the purposes of PAGA….” Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021)
72 Cal. App. 5th 56, 64. 
“If parties in a PAGA
lawsuit agree to settle, the ‘proposed settlement shall be submitted to the
[LWDA],’ and the ‘court shall review and approve [the] settlement.’” ([Labor
Code] § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) Although our Supreme Court has stated that this
provision ensures that ‘any negotiated resolution is fair to those affected’…,
California courts have not determined the standards by which a trial court
reviews and approves a proposed settlement.” Starks v. Vortex Indus., Inc.
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 1113, 1124. Accord Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549 (“PAGA settlements are subject to trial court review
and approval, ensuring that any negotiated resolution is fair to those
affected.”).
In that regard, settling
parties commonly advocate grafting class-action rules onto the legislative
procedure, which involves somewhat analogous procedure. Fundamentally, a PAGA
representative action is not fully a class action, because there is no
collection of individual claims in a PAGA action, but instead a representative
action on behalf of the state. Kim v. Reins Int'l California, Inc.
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 73, 87.
ANALYSIS
According to the motion,
Defendant will fund a non-reversionary, common-fund settlement of $651,000.00
that includes: Payments to the California Labor and Workforce Development
Agency (“LWDA”) and the aggrieved employees, attorneys’ fees and costs, and
settlement administration costs. Kogan Dec. ¶ 21. The amount reportedly
represents a fair and reasonable monetary recovery for the LWDA and the
aggrieved employees, considering the disputed claims. Kogan Dec. ¶ 22. Further,
counsel seeks $217,000.00 in attorneys’ fees, representing one-third of the
gross settlement amount, on the grounds that it is fair compensation for
undertaking complex, risky, expensive, and time-consuming litigation on a
contingency fee basis. Motion, 14:2-3. Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel
requests $14,373.94 in costs, as an amount that is reasonable and actually incurred
in this litigation. Kogan Dec. ¶ 61, Exhibit 3. Further settlement specifics
are listed on pages 3 through 4 of the motion.
The settlement is based
upon counsel’s legal research, investigation and payroll data, and follows
mediation. Kogan Dec. ¶ 18. It also is based upon considering the risks of
proceeding with litigation. Kogan Dec. ¶ 38.
The parties calculated an
amount based upon an accurate formula. Kogan Decl. ¶ 24. For example, as to the
claim of alleged failures to pay minimum and overtime wages, Defendant’s
maximum PAGA exposure amounts to $3,043,100. Kogan Dec. ¶ 26. 
Hence, the Court finds
that the subject PAGA settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and meaningful
and consistent with the purposes of PAGA as to all of the affected employees.
CONCLUSION
The Court, having
considered all applicable factors, grants the motion.
