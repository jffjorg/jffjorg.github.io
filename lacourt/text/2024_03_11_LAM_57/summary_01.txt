And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a preliminary decision regarding the upcoming court hearing. The plaintiff, Helen Kim, has moved for judgment on the pleadings, which means she is asking the court to dismiss the defendant's claims without having to go to trial. The judge has granted this motion, but has given the plaintiff leave to amend her complaint if necessary. The judge has also ordered the defendant to produce unredacted bank statements, balance sheets, and profit and loss statements from 2019-2023, as the redactions are not warranted. The judge has deferred a ruling on the defendant's motion to bifurcate the alter ego claims until the final status conference in the case. Finally, the judge has continued the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel further responses to March 14, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
