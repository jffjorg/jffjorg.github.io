  Case Number:  21STCV42748    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  57  Helen Kim's motions for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs' allegations that Helen Kim is the alter ego of Helen Kim Law, APC are granted with leave to amend.  The Court is giving Plaintiffs leave to amend because it is possible that Plaintiffs'  complaint can be amended to state alter ego allegations with sufficiency.  The Court is basing that conclusion on its disposition of the Plaintiffs' pending motion for issue and monetary sanctions related to alter ego discovery.  While the Court is declining to impose issue or monetary sanctions against Helen Kim,  the Court is granting the motion along the lines of requiring the Defendants to produce unredacted bank statements, balance sheets,
and profit and loss statements from 2019-2023.  The Court does not believe that the redactions are warranted.   Defendants must produce unredacted documents responsive Plaintiffs within 7 days of today's order.   In turn, Plaintiffs are directed to file and serve an amended complaint within 14 days of today's order.The Court is deferring ruling on the Defendants' motions to bifurcate the alter ego claims until the final status conference in the case.The Court is continuing the hearing on Defendants' motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories to March 14, 2024 at 1:30 p.m.   The Court could have declined the motion on the ground that it impermissibly combines three separate motions into one.  The Court is exercising its discretion to consider the motion in the interest of moving this remarkably contentious and time-consuming case to conclusion.
