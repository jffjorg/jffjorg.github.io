[1] The DRA states
that is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).  Slater’s argument that the FAA is
inapplicable because the relationship between Slater and VOALA does not involve
interstate commerce is mistaken.  Parties
to an arbitration agreement are free to choose that the agreement should be
governed by the FAA, even if the parties’ relationship does not involve interstate
commerce.  (Valencia v. Smyth
(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 179.)   In
any event, Slater does not show that the outcome of VOALA’s motion to compel
arbitration would be different if the FAA were inapplicable.
