And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint. The ruling states that the demurrer as to the claims of plaintiff Ethello Hall, Jr. is moot because he has dismissed all of his claims against the defendants.

The judge sustains the demurrer as to the fraud claims of plaintiff LikeWhoa, LLC with leave to amend because the complaint contains no allegations as to fraudulent statements made by the defendants to LikeWhoa.

The judge sustains the demurrer as to the fraud claims of plaintiffs Lopez and Coulter with leave to amend because the complaint fails to plead the fraud claims within the three-year statute of limitations. The judge holds that Lopez and Coulter have failed to plead their fraud claims within the ambit of the "discovery rule," which postpones the accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers or has reason to discover the cause of action.

The judge overrules the demurrer as to the plaintiffs' claims for breach of fiduciary duty, declaratory relief, and an accounting. The judge also denies the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot because the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants on the fraud claims of Lopez and Coulter, but against them on the other claims.
