And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants VOALA's motion to compel arbitration of Monique Slater's claims under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). Slater alleged that VOALA discriminated against her on the basis of her race and disability, but VOALA argued that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration according to a Dispute Resolution Agreement (DRA) that Slater executed at the commencement of her employment. The Judge finds that the DRA is enforceable despite Slater's claims that she did not agree to and accept the DRA, citing case law that authenticates handwritten signatures and finds that Slater's nonrecollection of signing the DRA does not render the DRA unenforceable. The Judge also rejects Slater's argument that the DRA is unconscionable, finding that the agreement is fair and that VOALA did not present Slater with a "take it or leave it" choice. As a result, the Court stays proceedings in this case pending the outcome of the arbitration.
