```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no factual issues regarding the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs had alleged that the City's enforcement of Proposition L, which restricts the construction of new billboards in Pomona, is unconstitutional. However, the judge found that the City has met its burden to establish that the plaintiffs' claims are outside the statute of limitations for an as-applied challenge. The judge also found that there is no pattern of the City's impermissible application of Proposition L, as the Regency Billboards were previously not encompassed by the law's restrictions and the City is currently litigating their removal. As a result, the judge has granted the City's motion for summary judgment.
