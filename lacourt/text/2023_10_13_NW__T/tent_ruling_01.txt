[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Shingkei Thomas Ho’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED
and the alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication is MOOT.
Introduction 
Defendant Shingkei Thomas Ho (Defendant) moved for summary
judgment (MSJ) and alternatively for summary adjudication (MSA) against
Plaintiff Jeffrey Mohamed Abed’s (Plaintiff) Complaint.  Defendant’s MSA placed into issue the first
cause of action (COA) for motor vehicle negligence and the second COA for
general negligence.  Plaintiff’s
opposition was due September 29, 2023 and none was filed.
Discussion  
Defendant asserted that there is no triable issue of fact as
to the elements of breach or causation for either COA.  Defendant provided facts to show that
Plaintiff caused the accident and Defendant did not act negligently/breached
the duty of care in the operation of his vehicle.  (Defendant’s Separate Statement of Facts
(DSSF) 2-6.)  Per the Court’s discovery
order of May 16, 2023, Plaintiff admitted to the fact that Plaintiff caused the
accident wherein Plaintiff was injured and Defendant did not negligently
operate his vehicle.  (Id.)  Based upon these judicially admitted facts,
Defendant met his initial burden of proof on the MSJ to show that there is no
triable issue of fact as to breach and causation.  The burden shifted to Plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of fact exists. 
Plaintiff’s failed to file an opposition and failed to meet the burden of
proof.
The MSJ is GRANTED. 
The alternative MSA is MOOT.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
