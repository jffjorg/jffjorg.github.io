And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment (MSJ) and renders the alternative motion for summary adjudication (MSA) moot. The defendant, Shingkei Thomas Ho, moved for MSJ and MSA against the plaintiff, Jeffrey Mohamed Abed, citing no triable issue of fact regarding breach and causation in the accident. The defendant provided facts showing that the plaintiff caused the accident and that the defendant did not operate his vehicle negligently. The plaintiff failed to file an opposition and failed to meet the burden of proof. The Court's discovery order of May 16, 2023, judicially admitted facts that supported the defendant's position. As a result, the MSJ is granted, and the MSA is moot.
