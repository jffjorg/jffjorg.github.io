  Case Number:  23PSCV03844    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Rebecca
Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Rebecca
Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo is a visually
impaired and legally blind individual. Defendant Yilay LLC (Yilay) is a
California limited liability company that operates a commercial website
available to the public.
As
early as November 2023, Castillo visited Yilay’s website multiple times and
alleges the following barriers to access existed: (1) graphics, links, and
buttons on the website were mislabeled or lacked alternative text (alt-text)
for screen-reading software to read out; (2) multiple pages contained insufficient
navigational headings; (3) the website contained an inaccessible video; and (4)
the checkout system for pickup orders was inaccessible.
On December
11, 2023, Castillo filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against Yilay
and Does 1-10, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA). On December 15, 2023, Castillo’s process server
served Yilay with substitute
service in Irvine.
On February 8, 2024, the Court entered default
against Yilay
after they failed to file a timely answer. On July 26, 2024, Castillo
submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for July 31, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Castillo
seeks default judgment against Yilay in the total amount of $9,074, including $8,000
in damages, $570 in attorney fees, and $504 in costs.
In
addition to $4,000 in statutory damages for the alleged violations, Castillo
also seeks $4,000 in deterrence damages. Generally, a plaintiff may obtain
statutory damages for UCRA violations “if the plaintiff personally encountered
the violation on a particular occasion, or the plaintiff was deterred from
accessing a place of public accommodation on a particular occasion.” (Civ.
Code, § 55.56, subd. (b).) To establish that a plaintiff was deterred,
plaintiff must establish that plaintiff had actual knowledge of the violations
and that the violations would have denied plaintiff “full and equal access” on
that occasion. (Civ. Code, § 55.56, subd. (d).)
Courts
have awarded deterrence damages in addition to statutory damages for UCRA
violations when plaintiffs seek damages for one encounter with violations and
one instance of deterrence. (See, e.g., Johnson v. Guedoir (E.D.
Cal. 2016) 218 F.Supp.3d 1096, 1103.) But courts have declined to award
additional deterrence damages when plaintiffs fail to establish they were
deterred on a specific occasion and instead rely on a conclusory claim
that they were deterred from patronizing a business. (Filardi v. Starbucks #
8709 (C.D. Cal. July 5, 2018, No. 5:18–CV–00404–ODW–SP) 2018 WL 3303316,
*4; Ho v. BSG Sunflower Investments, LLC (C.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2017, No.
8:17-cv-00863-JLS-JCG) 2017 WL 11633694, *7.)
Here,
Castillo alleges Castillo faced barriers when Castillo visited Defendant’s website on November
13, 2023. Further, Castillo makes the general and conclusory allegation that
Castillo has been deterred from Defendant’s physical storefront because she
could not order food online, but failed to allege a specific instance of
deterrence. (FAC, ¶ 42.) Thus, the Court declines to award $4,000 in deterrence
damages, but instead reduces the requested amount to $2,000.
Because
the court finds Castillo has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS
Castillo’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Castillo’s
application for default judgment in the total amount of $7,074.00 is GRANTED
(Damages of $4,000 + Deterrence Damages of $2,000 + Attorney’s Fees of $570 +
Costs of $504).
