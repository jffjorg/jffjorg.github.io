[1]           Defendants
challenge the timeliness of Plaintiff’s opposition based on its titling its
motion a “petition to compel arbitration.” However, simply titling the document
does not convert it into a petition governed by Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.6. Rather, California Rules of Court section 3.1103 states that a petition
to compel arbitration is a law and motion proceeding. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1103(a)(2); Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1667, 1670, [petition to compel arbitration is determined in manner of motion
where factual issues are submitted on affidavits or declarations, or on oral
testimony in court's discretion].) Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b), provides special filing and service timing requirements for
other law and motion issues identified in California Rules of Court section
3.1103 – such as a writ of attachment — but provides no special timing requirements
for a “petition to compel arbitration.” Furthermore, while Defendant places
emphasis of on the timing of a response required to the filing of petition
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.6, Defendant ignores Code of
Civil Procedure section 1290, which states that proceedings under this title
are governed when a proceeding is “commenced by filing a petition.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.) Here, the proceeding was commenced by the filing of a
complaint. Thus, Defendants’ reliance on the fact that it titled its motion a
“petition” is not well taken. The opposition is timely. 
 


[2]           Plaintiff
asserts that “Defendant’s agreement contains a number of terms blatantly aimed
at favoring the employer.” (Opp. 11:21-23.) But only one issue is identified.
(Opp., 11:24-26.)
 


[3]           The
reply notes that Plaintiff has not brought any PAGA claims such that this
unconscionability analysis is merely “hypothetical” and need not be addressed
by the Court. However, as several California courts have explained, when
determining whether a contract is unconscionable, courts must analyze the
contract “as of the time [it] was made.” (A & M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp.
(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 473, 487; see also American Software Inc. v. Ali
(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1391[“[t]he critical juncture for determining whether
a contract is unconscionable is the moment when it is entered into by both
parties-not whether it is unconscionable in light of subsequent events”].) Thus,
even if irrelevant to Plaintiff’s specific claims, the Court must conduct this
analysis.
