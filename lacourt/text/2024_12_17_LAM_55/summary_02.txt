And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition to establish a claim to escheated property filed by Estate Research Associates (Petitioner) on behalf of Little Eddie Muchakaneyi (Claimant), the sole heir of Eddie Talents (Decedent). The Petitioner is a California corporation licensed to investigate missing and unknown heirs cases and has located Claimant, a child of Decedent who resides in Zambia. Claimant has assigned 20% of his interest in the escheated funds to Petitioner.

The court finds that Petitioner is an assignee of Claimant's 20% interest in escheated funds and that Claimant is the sole heir of Decedent. The court orders the Controller of the State of California to distribute the $379,267.62 deposited by the Estate of Eddie Talents as follows: $75,853.52 (20%) to Estate Research Associates and $303,414.10 (80%) to Little Eddie Muchakaneyi through an electronic bank transfer.

The court concludes that the Petitioner's petition to establish a claim to escheated property is granted.
