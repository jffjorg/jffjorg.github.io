And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the pleading. The plaintiff filed a complaint with a missing attachment and later filed a first amended complaint (FAC). The court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the amendment and that it is warranted. The proposed second amended complaint (SAC) is defective and the plaintiff is ordered to file a corrected SAC within five days.
