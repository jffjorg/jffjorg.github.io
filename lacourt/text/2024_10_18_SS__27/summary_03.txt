And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The petition was filed by Alexander Mora and Victoria Mora, minors, and seeks approval of a settlement agreement with Erika Murillo, et al. and Ruben Martinez.

The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimants and their guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The court has reviewed the proposed orders and identified several deficiencies, including the need to remove Medi-Cal lien language, clarify costs, and include reimbursement to medical providers.

The court also reviewed the settlement amounts and distributions, which total $5,000 for each claimant. The court found the settlements and attorney's fees to be fair and reasonable.

Based on the review, the court grants the petitions filed on October 17, 2024. The court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Compliance of Payment for a future date and orders the moving party to give notice.
