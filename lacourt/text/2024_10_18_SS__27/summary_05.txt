And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's Counsel Muammar Reed's motion to be relieved as counsel. The reason for seeking to be relieved was not provided, making it impossible for the court to assess whether the withdrawal is proper. Additionally, the proof of service shows electronic service, but no email address was listed for the Plaintiff, and the proof of service conflicts with counsel's declaration. As a result, the court is uncertain whether the Plaintiff received notice of the motion and has denied the motion. The parties are advised to submit by email or appear remotely/in person for oral argument on the hearing date, October 18, 2024.
