And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge reviews the petition to approve a minor's compromise and finds the settlement and attorney's fees fair and reasonable. However, the petition contains a deficiency in Item 8a(2), which is an incorrect amount that does not add up to the total. As a result, the court conditionally grants the petition, but only upon the filing of an amended order that addresses this deficiency at least 5 days before a new court date. If the deficiency is not fixed, the court may impose sanctions. The court sets a non-appearance case review for the new court date, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
