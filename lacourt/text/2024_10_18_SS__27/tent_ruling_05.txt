MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
Hearing Date: 10/18/2024 at 1:30
p.m.
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV33740
SERVANDO CHAVEZ vs SEAFOOD CITY SUPERMARKET
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Muammar Reed
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Insufficient
 
Ruling: DENIED
 
Attorney Muammar Reed represents Plaintiff. Reed moves
to be relieved as counsel. Counsel did not cite any reason for seeking to be
relieved, so the Court cannot assess whether the withdrawal is proper.
Furthermore, the proof of service shows that the motion and notice of motion
were served on Plaintiff through electronic service, but no email address was
listed for Plaintiff. The proof of service also conflicts with counsel’s
declaration in MC-052, which states that the motion was served on the client by
mail. It is uncertain if Plaintiff received notice of the present motion. Thus,
the present motion is denied.
