And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant City's supplemental expert designation. The Court finds that the supplemental designation attempts to add an expert on subjects already designated by the City in its original exchange, which is an impermissible use of supplemental designations. The Court notes that the supplemental expert, Stewart Shanfield, M.D., is an orthopedic surgeon, same as previously designated expert Jeffrey Korcheck, M.D., and will testify on the same subject matter. The Court concludes that the supplemental designation is not permissible under CCP §2034.280 and grants Plaintiff's motion to strike.
