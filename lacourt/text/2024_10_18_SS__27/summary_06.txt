And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel deposition and requests for sanctions in the case of Emily Wilson vs. Joseph Anthony Corrado, et al. The motion was unopposed and the judge has granted it. The plaintiff had served a notice for Defendant Corrado's deposition, which was initially set for May 2, 2024, but was later rescheduled multiple times due to Defendant Corrado's refusal to appear. Despite confirmation of the deposition date, Defendant Corrado cancelled the deposition less than an hour before the scheduled date. The judge finds that Defendant Corrado did not act with substantial justification and sanctions are appropriate. The judge orders sanctions in the amount of $1,500 against Defendant Corrado and his counsel, payable to the plaintiff within 20 days. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing to argue.
