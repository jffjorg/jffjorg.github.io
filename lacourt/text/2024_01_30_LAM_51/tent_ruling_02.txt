The Opposition filed to the FAC, and the assertions made at the hearing on the
demurrer to the FAC.

Wickline concerned a patient harmed
by a third-party payor (there, Medi-Cal) implementing a cost containment
program that affected the treating physician’s medical judgment. (Wickline v. State of California (1986)
192 Cal.App.3d 1630, 1632-1633.) The physicians did not challenge the Medi-Cal
Consultant’s reduction of a request for an additional 8 days of in hospital
care to 4 days. (Id. at pp.
1644-1645.) The Court ultimately found the treating physicians liable for the
plaintiff’s harm because, even though Medi-Cal only approved a certain number
of additional days for in-hospital treatment, there were no facts that
Medi-Cal’s authorization corrupted the treating physician’s medical judgment. (Id. at pp. 1635-1648 [“While we
recognize, realistically, that cost consciousness has become a permanent
feature of the health care system, it is essential that cost limitation
programs not be permitted to corrupt medical judgment.”]) There is no
discussion of out-of-network providers in Wickline.

 


[3] “Existing case law also provides that to have a
viable cause of action for wrongful
employment termination on the basis of a violation of public policy, that
the public policy must be clearly and statutorily defined.” (California Bill
Analysis, A.B. 1676 Sen., 7/12/1993, 8/17/1993, 8/23/1993, emphasis added.)
“According to the author, the bill is needed to codify state public policy . . . .” (California Bill Analysis,
A.B. 3390 Assem., 5/03/1994, emphasis added.) “This bill is sponsored by the
California Psychological Association to statutorily establish that it is the
public policy of this state that health care practitioners advocate for
appropriate health care for their patients, and that penalizing a health care
practitioner (e.g., terminating their
employment) principally for such advocacy violates public policy.
(California Bill Analysis, A.B. 3390 Sen., 6/27/1994, emphasis added.)

Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs did not allege that they had an
assignment from their patients. (Demurrer 9:2-3.) However, the SAC does allege
such an assignment. (SAC ¶ 13(l).) 


[5]If
Plaintiff sought to abandon this allegation at this stage, Plaintiff would run
afoul of the sham pleading doctrine.


[6] “The tort of negligent
interference with economic relationship arises only when the defendant owes the
plaintiff a duty of care.” (LiMandri v.
Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 348.) 


[7]
Parenthetically, the Court abandons its previous pronouncement that “duty is not a required element for the cause
of action for intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage.”
Duty, it appears, is always required for tort liability. (See Reporter’s
Notes of October 30. 2023 hearing.)
