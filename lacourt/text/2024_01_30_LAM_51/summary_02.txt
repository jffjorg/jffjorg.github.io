And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the opposition filed by the defendant to the FAC and the assertions made at the hearing on the demurrer to the FAC. In considering the case, the judge has looked to existing case law, including Wickline v. State of California, which established that cost limitation programs must not corrupt medical judgment. The judge has also considered the concept of public policy, as codified in California statute, and the need for a clear and statutory definition of public policy to support a cause of action for wrongful employment termination.

The judge has also considered the allegations made by the plaintiff, including the alleged assignment from patients, and the defendant's argument that such an assignment was not alleged. The judge has rejected this argument, finding that the SAC does indeed allege such an assignment.

Finally, the judge has noted that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff did not have a viable cause of action for negligent interference with economic relationship is also without merit, as the tort of negligent interference with economic relationship arises only when the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.

Based on these considerations, the judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the FAC should be overruled, and that the case should proceed to trial.
