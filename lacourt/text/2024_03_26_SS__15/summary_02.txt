```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Estee Lauder Companies Inc., granting their motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's punitive damages claim. The plaintiff, Claudia Ann Smith, alleges that she developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos from the defendant's products. The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacks clear and convincing evidence that the defendant engaged in malice, oppression, or fraud sufficient to impose punitive damages. The judge found that the plaintiff did not show a disputed issue about whether the defendant knew that its talc products were probably dangerous to consumers and yet continued to market them without warnings. The judge relied on the case of McNeal v. Whittaker, Clark & Daniels, Inc. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 853, which held that knowledge of the dangers of asbestos does not necessarily mean that the defendant knew that asbestos in talc would cause a high probability of injury. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary adjudication is granted.
