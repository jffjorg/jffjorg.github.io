English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Navistar, Inc. (the defendant) in a case brought by John Doomey and his wife Elizabeth (the plaintiffs) alleging that John Doomey developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in Navistar's products. The defendant contends that the plaintiffs have no evidence and cannot obtain evidence that John Doomey was exposed to asbestos from Navistar's products. The court finds that the defendant has shifted the burden to the plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. The court also notes that there is a disputed issue about John Doomey's exposure to asbestos from brakes supplied by Navistar. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
