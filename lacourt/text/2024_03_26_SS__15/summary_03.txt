And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted plaintiff Maria T. Lozano's motion for trial preference due to her age and health. The plaintiff is 79 years old and has been diagnosed with malignant epithelioid mesothelioma, which has significantly impacted her quality of life. She is in hospice care and has undergone chemotherapy, but her condition is in serious decline. The court finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. As a result, the court has set a trial date of July 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. and scheduled a status conference for April 17, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The parties are required to meet and confer on a trial setting order.
