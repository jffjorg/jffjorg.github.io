And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for trial preference filed by Gilbert Cornejo and Mary Cornejo, the plaintiffs, in their action for personal injury caused by asbestos exposure. The motion is based on Cornejo's diagnosis with malignant mesothelioma in July 2023 and his recent medical condition, which raises substantial medical doubt as to his survival beyond six months. The court has discretion to grant the motion if it finds that the interests of justice will be served by doing so. The defendants, Chattem, argue that the medical evidence presented is not sufficient to support the motion and that Cornejo's condition may actually improve with treatment. The motion is continued to April 16, 2024, for the plaintiffs to produce Cornejo's more recent medical records and for the defendants to file a copy of a 2023 article cited in their opposition.
