And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motions to compel and deem admitted filed by 401 South Hoover Property, Inc., et al. The motions were filed in response to the failure of Natassja Greene and Ami Miller to serve verified responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, as well as requests for admissions. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to compelled responses to the discovery requests and that the requests for admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted. The court also denies the defendants' requests for monetary sanctions, as the notices of motion failed to identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought and failed to specify the type of sanction sought.
