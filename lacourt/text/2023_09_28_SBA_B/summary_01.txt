And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motions to compel and deem admitted filed by 401 South Hoover Property, Inc., et al. The motions were filed in response to the failure of Natassja Greene and Ami Miller to serve verified responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, as well as requests for admissions. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to compelled responses to the discovery requests and that the requests for admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted. The court also denies the defendants' requests for monetary sanctions, as the notices of motion failed to identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought and failed to specify the type of sanction sought.

Summary:

The motions include requests to compel plaintiffs' responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents. Additionally, the defendants requested orders to deem admitted the plaintiffs' responses to requests for admission.

The judge granted the motions to compel and deem admitted in part, as plaintiffs failed to serve any verified responses to the discovery requests served on December 21, 2022. Plaintiffs are ordered to serve verified responses within 10 days of this ruling. The defendants' requests for monetary sanctions are denied due to insufficient specifications in the notices of motion. The defendants are required to give notice of this ruling.
