Wescom Central Credit Union’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint 

 
TENTATIVE RULING
      
            Wescom Central Credit Union’s Demurrer
to First Amended Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, in part. 
 
            As to the first and third causes of
action, the Court, on its own motion, orders these causes of action stricken,
without leave to amend, from the First Amended Complaint.
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June
21, 2022 and the First Amended Complaint on May 11, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. This action arises from the recordation of the notice of
default and notice of trustee’s sale and resulting trustee’s sale of
Plaintiff’s former real property located at 2705 145th St., Gardena, CA 90249.
Plaintiff alleges multiple violations of the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights Act
(“HBOR”). In the original Complaint, Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: 1.
Violation of Civ. Code 2923.5; 2. Violation of Civ. Code 2924(a)(1); 3.
Violation of Civ. Code 2924.9; 4. Wrongful Foreclosure; 5. Interpleader
Pursuant to CCP 386, et al.; 6. Unfair Business Practices; 7. Cancellation of
Written Instruments, Civ. Code 3412.  
 
                On August 23, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed the fifth
cause of action.
 
            On April 21, 2023, Defendant’s
demurrer to the first through third causes of action was sustained without
leave to amend. Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth, sixth, and seventh causes
of action was sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
            The FAC includes the following
causes of action: 1. Violation of Civil Code § 2923.5; 3. Violation of Civ.
Code § 2924.9; 4. Wrongful Foreclosure; 6. Unfair Business Practices Violation
of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.; 7. Cancellation of Written
Instruments, Civ. Code § 3412. (The out of sequence numbering is how it was set
forth in the FAC.)
 
            Meet
and Confer 

            Demurring Defendant set forth an
adequate meet and confer declaration in compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Declaration, Jonathan M. Beltram, ¶¶ 2-3.) 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 452(c)(d) and (h). 
 
Demurrer
 
            A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the
sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.)  Because
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each
cause of action.  (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
            Defendant demurs to the first, third, fourth, sixth,
and seventh causes of action on the ground that the causes of action fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
            As to the first and third causes of
action, the Court on its own motion, strikes these causes of action without
leave to amend. As noted above, the Court sustained the prior demurrer to these
causes of action without leave to amend. It was entirely improper for
Plaintiff to reassert these causes of action again.  Plaintiff and her counsel are admonished not
to continue to engage in this practice again at the risk of the imposition of
sanctions.
 
            Fourth Cause of Action for
Wrongful Foreclosure
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to
state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
The cause of action is based on the purported statutory
violations of the HBOR that were alleged in the first and third cause of
action. However, as noted above, the demurrer to the original Complaint’s first
through third causes of action was sustained without leave to amend. The Court
has stricken the first and third causes of action of the instant First Amended
Complaint. Thus, no underlying facts to support a cause of action for Wrongful
Foreclosure exists.
 
            Plaintiff also makes reference to
Civ. Code § 2934a(a)(1) which states: 
 
“The trustee under a trust deed upon real property or
an estate for years given to secure an obligation to pay money and conferring
no other duties upon the trustee than those which are incidental to the
exercise of the power of sale therein conferred, may be substituted by the
recording in the county in which the property is located of a substitution
executed and acknowledged by either of the following:
(A) All of the beneficiaries under the trust deed, or
their successors in interest, and the substitution shall be effective
notwithstanding any contrary provision in any trust deed executed on or after
January 1, 1968.
(B) The holders of more than 50 percent of the record
beneficial interest of a series of notes secured by the same real property or
of undivided interests in a note secured by real property equivalent to a
series transaction, exclusive of any notes or interests of a licensed real
estate broker that is the issuer or servicer of the notes or interests or of
any affiliate of that licensed real estate broker.”
 
While Plaintiff referred to this section, Plaintiff
alleges no facts to show a violation of this section. Plaintiff also refers to
Civ. Code § 2924a(e). However, no such statute exists.
 
“The elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of
action are: (1) [T]he trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or
willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a
mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale (usually but not
always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases
where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor
tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.”
Sciarratta v. U.S. Bank National Assn.
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 552, 561–562 (internal quotations and citations
omitted.)  Here, in addition to the
deficiencies noted above because Plaintiff has not alleged facts to demonstrate
that the foreclosure sale was void as opposed to voidable, Plaintiff is also
required to allege that she has tendered the amount of the indebtedness.
Plaintiff has failed to do so.  
 
            Thus, the demurrer to the fourth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
            Sixth Cause of Action for
Unfair Business Practices
 
            Defendant’s demurrer is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to state
a cause of action.
 
            “California Business and Professions
Code Sections 17000, et seq., and 17200, et seq., states [sic] that unfair
competition shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
practices.” Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 618–19. “By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business act or practice, the UCL
“borrows” rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules
independently actionable. [Citation.] However, a practice may violate the UCL even
if it is not prohibited by another statute.” Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
Com. v. Insomniac, Inc. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 803, 835. “The unfair
competition law is independent of the Unfair Practices Act and other laws. Its
remedies are “cumulative ... to the remedies or penalties available under all
other laws of this state” (§ 17205), but its sanctions are less severe than
those of the Unfair Practices Act. Prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited
to injunctive relief and restitution. (§ 17203; see ABC Internat.
Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Corp. (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1247,
1268 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 931 P.2d 290].) Plaintiffs may not receive damages,
much less treble damages, or attorney fees.” Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163, 179.
 
            Based on the underlying allegations
noted above, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate
unlawful, fraudulent, and/or unfair business practices on the part of demurring
Defendant. 
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the sixth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Seventh Cause of Action for Cancellation of Written
Instruments, Civ. Code 3412
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.
 
Civ. Code, § 3412 states: “A written instrument, in
respect to which there is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it
may cause serious injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable, may,
upon his application, be so adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or
canceled.”
 
Plaintiff merely recites, in a conclusory manner, the
elements of the cause of action noted above. (FAC, ¶¶ 72-74.)  However, as noted above, Plaintiff has alleged
no facts to demonstrate that the instrument is void or voidable, and, if left
outstanding, will cause serious injury to Plaintiff. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
