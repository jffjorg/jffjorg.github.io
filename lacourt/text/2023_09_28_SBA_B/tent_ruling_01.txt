Background
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint was filed on October 1, 2019. Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint was filed on February 6, 2023. Plaintiffs’ Second
Amended Complaint was filed on July 31, 2023. Plaintiffs allege the following
facts. Plaintiffs suffered bed bug bites after staying at Defendants’ hotel.
Plaintiffs allege the following causes of action: 1. Battery; 2. Negligence; 3.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; 4. Fraudulent Concealment; 5.

Motions to
Compel/Deem Admitted
 
CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
CCP § 2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(b)).
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 states:
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
 
Defendants served upon Plaintiffs Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Requests for Admissions, Set One on
December 21, 2022. Plaintiffs failed to serve any verified responses to the discovery
requests.  (Decls., Allison K. Howard.)   
 
Therefore, the motions to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, are granted.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve verified
responses within 10 days of this date.
 
The motions to deem Requests for Admissions, Set One, are
granted. Defendants’ Requests for Admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants’ requests for monetary sanctions are denied.

 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040 states, in relevant part:
“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought.” 
 
Here, the notices of motion fail to identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought, and failed
to specify the type of sanction sought.  Thus,
the requests for monetary sanctions are denied.
 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
