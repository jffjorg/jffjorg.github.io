And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Paulette Meader against Wescom Central Credit Union. The demurrer was sustained with 20 days leave to amend for the fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. The court struck the first and third causes of action from the First Amended Complaint, finding that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate statutory violations of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights Act (HBOR), and that the plaintiff's allegations of wrongful foreclosure, unfair business practices, and cancellation of written instruments were insufficient to state a cause of action.

The court granted the defendant's request for judicial notice and sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate unlawful, fraudulent, and/or unfair business practices.

The court also sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the written instrument is void or voidable and that, if left outstanding, it will cause serious injury to the plaintiff.

Finally, the court admonished the plaintiff not to continue to engage in the practice of reasserting causes of action that have been previously sustained without leave to amend.
