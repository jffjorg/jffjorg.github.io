The court finds that the contingency fee contract is not unconscionable and that Counsel is entitled to attorney's fees and costs incurred during litigation. The court also finds that Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel was not a breach of contract and that Plaintiff is obligated to reimburse Counsel for costs advanced on behalf of the client. The court concludes that the retainer agreement is binding and that Plaintiff does not have a valid basis to seek revocation of the agreement.
