Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gerardo Garcia Espinosa and Gemima Luna Reyes against Ford Motor Company. The case involves a breach of warranty claim for negligent repair. The defendant, Ford Motor Company, has filed a motion for a protective order to modify the Los Angeles Superior Court's model protective order. The defendant claims that their manuals contain trade secrets and confidential information and that these manuals were the product of time and significant cost and are unreleased and unique to Ford Motor Company.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for a protective order. The defendant had requested that the protective order be modified to include provisions such as defining affiliated attorneys, including videographers and litigation support companies, and requiring that the defendant's documents not be shown to competitors. The judge has declined to modify these provisions, stating that the generally accepted LASC Model Protective Order is sufficient to protect the defendant's confidential materials.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request to revise paragraph 7, which relates to the definition of affiliated attorneys, and paragraph 8, which relates to the use of confidential materials. The judge has further denied the defendant's request to revise paragraph 21, which relates to the destruction or return of confidential documents.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be finalized at the hearing on October 15, 2024.
