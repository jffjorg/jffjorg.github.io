And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike paragraphs from the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The paragraphs in question are alleged to be inadmissible character evidence and included to prejudice the jury. The judge found that the allegations provide background information for the defendant's claims and that the cross-defendants have not provided a sufficient basis for striking the allegations. The judge also noted that the court will not strike allegations simply because they may lead to an attempt to introduce evidence which may be subject to an objection. As a result, the cross-defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint within ten days of the entry of this order.
