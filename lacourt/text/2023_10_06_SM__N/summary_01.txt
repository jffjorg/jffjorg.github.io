And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to disqualify Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP from representing Julia Hakim and Said Hakim. The motion was brought by Defendant Michael Hakim and Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Papillones, LLC, claiming that Allen Matkins has a conflict of interest due to a prior attorney-client relationship with Michael. The Court found that Allen Matkins never rendered any legal advice or services to Michael, and therefore, there is no basis to conclude that an attorney-client relationship existed between Michael and Allen Matkins. The Court also found that Michael failed to provide any evidence that Allen Matkins received any confidential information about the subject matter of the present action. As a result, the motion to disqualify is denied.
