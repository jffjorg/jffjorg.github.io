  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem truth of matters
  in requests for admission admitted
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Christopher Lemole
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Deem Truth of Matters in Requests for Admission Admitted
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Christopher Lemole (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission, Set One, served on defendant Dean Scott-Smith (“Defendant”), and (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $961.65.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response that is in
substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with the Requests for Admissions, Set One, by mail on November
22, 2023.  (Hemming Decl., Ex. A.)  Defendant had not served responses on
Plaintiff as of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Hemming Decl., ¶ 4.)  Defendant has not filed an opposition or
other evidence with the court establishing that responses have since been
served. 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has not served responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, and therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The court
finds that $811.65 ((2.5 hours x $300 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a
reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with
this motion.  (Hemming Decl.,
¶¶ 8-9.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff
Christopher Lemole’s motion to deem the truth of matters specified in requests
for admission admitted. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b), the court orders that the truth of the
matters specified in plaintiff Christopher Lemole’s Requests for Admission, Set
One, served on defendant Dean Scott-Smith, is deemed admitted. 
            The court orders defendant Dean
Scott-Smith to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Christopher Lemole in the
amount of $811.65 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders to plaintiff
Christopher Lemole to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
