[1] The
court notes that Defendants contend, in reply, that Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Identification is irrelevant to this motion and that the subpoenas were invalid
when issued, such that the court should grant their motion.  (Reply, pp. 6:28-7:4.)  However, Defendants did not cite any
authority that would prohibit the court from evaluating Plaintiff’s operative
identification of trade secrets.  Thus,
the court has considered Plaintiff’s Second Amended Identification and the
evidence establishing that it satisfies the requirements of section 2019.210.
