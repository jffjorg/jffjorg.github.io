Background
 
On
September 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant Franklin Burns
and Does 1 to 50 for Negligence.
  
On
December 14, 2022, the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file a First
Amended Complaint to correct the Complaint by naming the true Defendant
Franklin Burns to “Franklyn Burns Living Trust Dated September 30, 1995”
(hereinafter “Defendant Trust”). 
 
On
May 24, 2023, Defendant Trust filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
(“MJOP”). On August 7, 2023, the court granted Defendant’s MJOP and
granted Plaintiff leave to amend. 
 
On  September 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging the same single cause of
action for negligence against Kimberly Rachel Anton, Successor Co-Trustee of
Franklyn Burns Living Trust Dated September 30, 1995; Michele Dorene Johnsen,
Successor Co-Trustee of Franklyn Burns Living Trust Dated September 30, 1995
(collectively “Defendant Trustees”) and Does 1 to 50.
On December 4, 2023, Defendant Trustees
filed a demurrer to the SAC. The Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. The matter is
now before the court.

Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Defendant Trustees demurrer to the single cause of action for
negligence alleged in the SAC for two reasons. 
First, they argue the negligence claim fails to state sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action against Defendants.  (CCP § 430.10(e).)  Second, and primarily, they argue the
negligence claim is barred by the statute of limitations. (CCP § 335.1.) 
 
Defendant Trustees contend that the claim is barred because, at
the time that Plaintiff filed the Complaint on September 2, 2021, she was aware
of the identity of trustee of the trust that owned the subject property. They
argue that Plaintiff’s attempt to now name the successor trustees of the trust
is barred because the statute of limitations has expired, and Plaintiff cannot
rely on the relation-back doctrine and amend the name of the defendant pursuant
to CCP § 474. (See Woo v. Superior Court (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 169, 179 [“[W]hen the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the
defendant's identity prior to filing a complaint, but has forgotten the
defendant's identity at the time of filing the complaint, the plaintiff must
review readily available information that discloses the defendant's identity to
invoke the section 474 relation-back doctrine;
otherwise, the plaintiff is not in good faith using section 474”].)


The SAC alleges that on January 26, 2006, Plaintiff “entered into
a lease agreement with Franklyn Burns, in his capacity as trustee of the
FRANKLYN BURNS LIVING TRUST DATED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995” who is the real owner of
the subject property located at 4569 Whittier Boulevard, Los Angeles. (SAC ¶
9.) Plaintiff was injured on or about September 2, 2019, when she fell ill due
to pests and toxic mold to which she was exposed in Defendant’s Property. (SAC
¶ 9.) Defendant Trustees take the allegations in  Paragraph 9 of the SAC as an admission that
Plaintiff knew that the owner of the subject property was a trust and not an
individual defendant named Franklyn Burns. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s attempt to
change the name of the defendant is barred. 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition does not dispute the above assertion.
Plaintiff states: 
 
The
naming of successor trustees does not fall within the purview of Code of Civil
Procedure section 474 as they are not ‘Doe’ defendants but rather they are the
successor in interest to the deceased trustee. Nor does the naming of the
successor trustees in the second amended complaint raise the issue of misnomer.

 
(Opp., at p. 10:24-28.) 
 
Plaintiff’s concession that the relation back doctrine does not
apply and rejection of the relief to fix a misnomer preclude Plaintiff from
obtaining relief under CCP §§ 474 and 473(a). (See Hawkins v. Pacific Coast Bldg.
Products, Inc. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1497, 1503
[“But where an amendment does not add a “new” defendant, but simply corrects a
misnomer by which an ‘old’ defendant was sued, case law recognizes an exception
to the general rule of no relation back”]; Clark v. Superior Court
(2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 289, 309 [accord].)
 
Plaintiff’s original Complaint alleges the following: 
 
“That on
or about January 6, 2026 [sic], plaintiff PATRICIA GALVEZ entered into a lease
agreement with FRANKLIN BURNS to lease the PROPERTY. Plaintiff remained a
tenant of Defendant from said date until November 2019. . . On or about
September 2, 2019, Plaintiff fell ill and was hospitalized due to exposure from
toxic mold present on Defendant’s Property.


(Compl. ¶ 9.) Accordingly, at the time Plaintiff filed her
original Complaint, on September 2, 2021, Plaintiff was not aware or had no
recollection that the true owner of the Subject Property was a trust rather
than an individual defendant. 
 
The record before the court reflects that on December 6, 2021,
Franklin Burns filed an Answer. On December 28, 2022, Defendant Franklin Burns
filed a MJOP asserting that the correct entity that owned the Property was the
Franklin Burins Living Trust Dated September 30, 1995. Plaintiff subsequently
filed the FAC, naming Defendant Trust, rather than the trustee as the
Defendant. The court granted Defendants’ second MJOP because Plaintiff failed
to name the trustee as the proper Defendant. (Order of 8/07/23.) 
 
The court found that the “misnomer” of the Defendant permitted
Plaintiff to amend the complaint to add the correct defendant, in this case,
the name of the current trustee(s). (See Mayberry
v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Sacramento (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 350, 352.)
“[A]n ‘exception to the general rule’ has been formulated, which permits
correction where the plaintiff has committed an excusable mistake attributable
to dual entities with strikingly similar business names or to the use of
fictitious names.” (Id. at 353; see also Canifax v. Hercules Powder
Co. (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 44, 57 [“It is well settled that a mere misnomer
sought to be corrected after the statute of limitations has run will not bar
the action.”].) Specifically, the court held: 
 
The court
finds that Plaintiff’s misnaming Defendant Trust rather than its trustee was a
misnomer and Plaintiff should be granted leave to amend the pleading to name
the correct defendant. The court notes that the trustee, Franklyn Burns, is now
deceased and that Plaintiff is currently engaged in discovery to ascertain the
identity of the current trustee. Moreover, it is also undisputed that Defendant
Franklin Burns filed an Answer on December 06, 2021, and had knowledge of this
action and Plaintiff’s allegations.
 
(Order of 8/7/23.) 
 
However, Plaintiff now takes the position that amendment due to
misnomer of the Defendant does not apply in this case. (Opp. at p. 10:27-28.)
Instead, she argues that the “law of the case doctrine” applies and bars
Defendant Trustees from re-litigating the issue of statute of limitations and
that amendment is permitted under CCP § 377.31. Neither claim has merit. 
 
Defendant Trustees correctly point out that “the law of the case
doctrine” does not apply to trial court orders. “‘As its name suggests, the
doctrine applies only to an appellate court's
decision on a question of law; it does not apply to questions of fact.’
[Citations.] Nor does the doctrine apply to rulings of the trial court.
[Citations.]” (Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz (2008)
170 Cal.App.4th 229, 248, fn. 23; see also Golden Door Properties, LLC v.
Superior Court of San Diego County (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733, 788
[“First, the law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply to trial court rulings”]; Lawrence v. Ballou
(1869) 37 Cal. 518, 521 [“The doctrine that a previous ruling has become the
law of the case has no application except as to the decisions of appellate [c]ourts”].) 
 
Therefore, the case of the law doctrine does not apply, and
Defendant Trustees may raise the issue of Plaintiff’s claims being barred by
the statute of limitations. (See Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980)
110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877 [If demurrer is erroneously overruled, the demurring
party may raise the point again at the next opportunity].) 
 
Secondly, Plaintiff fails to show that CCP § 377.31 applies.
Section 377.31 states: 
 
On motion after the death
of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow a
pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the
decedent's personal representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in
interest. 
 
Plaintiff is the person who
commenced the action, and she is not the decedent, thus section 377.31 does not
apply. Furthermore, if Plaintiff intended to invoke the provisions of CCP § 377.41,
it would also not apply to Plaintiff’s case. Section 377.41 states: 
 
On motion, the court shall
allow a pending action or proceeding against the decedent that does not abate
to be continued against the decedent's personal representative or, to the
extent provided by statute, against the decedent's successor in interest, except
that the court may not permit an action or proceeding to be continued against
the personal representative unless proof of compliance with Part 4 (commencing
with Section 9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims
is first made.


Here, there is no decedent, as the facts show that the defendant
entity is a trust. Moreover, to assert a claim against a decedent’s personal
representative or successor in interest, “the plaintiff must first file a claim
against the decedent's estate. The claim must be rejected in whole or in part
before the plaintiff may commence the action. [Prob. Code, § 9351; for
procedure for filing claim with the decedent's estate[.]” (§ 9:6. Instituting
or continuing action when defendant dies, Cal. Civ. Prac. Torts § 9:6.)
 
Additionally, when a party
against whom an action or proceeding was commenced dies, the court, on motion
after that party's death, must allow the pending action or proceeding against
the decedent that does not abate to be continued against the decedent's
personal representative or, to the extent provided by statute, against the
decedent's successor in interest. The court may not, however, permit an action
or proceeding to be continued against the personal representative unless proof
of compliance with Prob. Code, §§ 9000 et seq. governing creditor's claims is
first made. 


(§ 3:103. Substitution required, Cal. Civ. Prac. Procedure §
3:103.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to show that she complied with Probate
Code § 9000 et seq. prior to pursuing a claim against a decedent. 
 
As Plaintiff has rejected leave to amend under the basis of
misnomer of Defendant and has failed to articulate a valid basis for relief to
amend the pleading to correctly name the true Defendants, the Defendant
Trustees’ demurrer is granted without leave to amend as Plaintiff has failed to
show that the pleading is capable of successful amendment. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Trustees’ demurrer is
granted without leave to amend.
