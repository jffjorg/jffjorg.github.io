And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint off-calendar without prejudice. The defendant, Peter Bures, filed the motion on August 29, 2023, and the plaintiff, Citibank, N.A., filed its opposition on December 21, 2023. However, the defendant failed to indicate whether the proposed cross-claims are permissive or compulsory, and failed to attach a copy of the proposed cross-complaint to the motion. Additionally, the defendant failed to comply with the court's rules on formatting. As a result, the judge finds that the defendant has not met the preliminary procedural requirements to bring the motion, and the motion is being placed off-calendar without prejudice.
