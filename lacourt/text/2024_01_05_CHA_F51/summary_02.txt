And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action brought by Jose Antonio Mesa-Marentes and Maria Guadalupe Esquivel-Carreon against Pilot Travel Centers LLC, Doe 1. The defendants have demurred against the entire complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Pilot Travel Centers LLC for general negligence and loss of consortium. The judge also found that the complaint is not "so incomprehensible" that the defendant cannot respond to it, and therefore overruled the demurrer on this ground. However, the judge granted leave to amend, allowing the plaintiffs to cure the defects in the complaint.
