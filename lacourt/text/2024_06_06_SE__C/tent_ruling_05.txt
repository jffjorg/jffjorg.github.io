Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that
needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good
faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A
motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting
and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond
also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Defendants/Moving
Parties have shown that Special Interrogatories (set one), Form Interrogatories
(set one) and Request for Production of Documents (set one) were properly
served onto Plaintiff Justin Salinas on August 25, 2023. The deadlines to
respond have expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  These Motions were filed December 29, 2023— about
four months after service of the discovery. As of June 4, 2024, no Substantive Oppositions
have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
Declarations
in Opposition to these Motions were filed on January 5, 2024 and May 20, 2024.
The Declarations of Kenneth C. Yeager submitted in Opposition do not contain
any substantive arguments against granting the Motions. Rather, counsel for
Plaintiff states that he has “received no cooperation from [Plaintiff] in
responding to Defendant’s discovery.” (Yeager Decl., ¶2.) Mr. Yeager only
argues that no sanctions are warranted against him or his office. 
 
The Motions
to Compel are GRANTED, and Plaintiff
Justin Salinas is ORDERED to provide
verified responses and documents, without objection by no later than 15 days
from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended
by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it will be
tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this Court’s
order. 
 
No
sanctions are ordered because the motions are substantively unopposed. (CCP §§
2030.290, subd. (d); 2031.300, subd. (c).)
