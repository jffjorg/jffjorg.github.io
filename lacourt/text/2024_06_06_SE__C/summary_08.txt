And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is regarding the motion filed by Swiss Re Corporate Solutions America Insurance Corporation (Swiss Re) to discharge its liability on Bond #2343660, to fully cancel the bond, and to release and exonerate Swiss Re without exception. The Court has reviewed the case file and found that no proposed order was ever submitted for execution by AAA. As a result, Swiss Re has not been discharged and exonerated from this action with respect to Bond #2343660. The Court grants Swiss Re's motion and orders Swiss Re to submit a proposed order within 5 court days of the Court's issuance of a ruling. The Court will then sign the proposed order, to the extent that the terms of the proposed order are in compliance with this ruling.
