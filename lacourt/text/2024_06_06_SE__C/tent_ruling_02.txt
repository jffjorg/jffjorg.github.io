Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of June 4, 2024. 
 
Motions to
Compel 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that
needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good
faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A
motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting
and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond
also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff/Moving
Parties have shown that Special Interrogatories (set one), Form Interrogatories
(set one) and Request for Production of Documents (set one) were properly
served onto Defendant MANN INVESTMENT GROUP, LLC (“Defendant”) on January 18,
2023. The deadlines to respond have expired, and no responses of any kind have
been provided.  These Motions were filed January
8, 2024— about a year after service of the discovery. As of June 4, 2024, no
Oppositions have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
The unopposed
Motions to Compel are GRANTED, and Defendant
MANN INVESTMENT GROUP, LLC is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
As to the
motions to compel, no sanctions are ordered because the motions are unopposed. (CCP
§§ 2030.290, subd. (d); 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Motion to
Deem Admitted 
 
The
unopposed Motion to Deem Matters Admitted as to Defendant MANN INVESTMENT
GROUP, LLC (“Defendant”) is GRANTED. 
 
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  Unverified
responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to resolve the
matter informally is required. 
 
Here,
RFAs were propounded on or about January 19, 2023. 
 
To
the Court’s knowledge, Defendant has failed to provide any responses. 
 
Therefore,
the unopposed Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
are mandatory pursuant to the terms of CCP §2033.280(c). 
 
Sanctions
are GRANTED as requested in the total amount of $600.00. Defendant MANN
INVESTMENT GROUP, LLC and its counsel of record are jointly and severally
ORDERED to pay Plaintiff and their counsel of record sanctions in the total
amount of $600.00, payable within 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance
of this Order.
