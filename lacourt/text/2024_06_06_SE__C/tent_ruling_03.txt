Moving
Party to give notice.

Opposition filed as of June 4, 2024. 
 
“To
the extent authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose
[sanctions] against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process …” (CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both
misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).) Sanctions
which may be imposed for a misuse of the discovery process include “terminating
sanctions.” (CCP §2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff
seeks terminating sanctions on the basis that Defendant is refusing to
participate in the discovery process. Specifically, Defendant has failed to
comply with this Court’s March 28, 2023 Discovery Order. 
 
Defendant
does not oppose the instant Motion. 
 
It
is a commonly stated axiom that discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to
the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) However, a court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
discovery obligations. The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be
an admission that the claim or defense is without merit. (Id. at
794-795.) 
 
Defendant has failed to comply with this Court’s March 28, 2023
Discovery Order which included imposition of monetary sanctions.  A mandatory settlement conference scheduled
for March 18, 2024, was taken off-calendar because the Court did not receive a
brief from the defense.  No opposition to
the instant motion has been filed as of June 4, 2024.  It is undisputed that Defendant is unwilling
to comply with her discovery obligations or the orders of the Court.  
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted here. The
information sought by Plaintiff is important to this case, and trial is
scheduled for July 22, 2024.  Terminating
sanctions may include an “order striking out the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.” (CCP §2023.030, subd.
(d)(1).) The Court determines that striking Defendant’s Answer is appropriate
under the circumstances.  Defendant’s
refusal to participate in this litigation leads to the conclusion that lesser
sanctions would not be effective. 
 
The motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant’s Answer is STRICKEN.
