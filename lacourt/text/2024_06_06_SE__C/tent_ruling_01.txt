This case settled on April 14, 2022 at a Mandatory
Settlement Conference presided over by Judge Ann H. Park in Dept. SE-P. Based
on the Court’s April 14, 2022 M.O., the court reviewed and approved the terms
of the settlement, and retained jurisdiction under CCP §664.6. (See 04/14/22
M.O.) On July 15, 2022, the Complaint was dismissed without prejudice by the
Plaintiff pursuant to an oral request made in open Court. (See 07/15/22 M.O.)
The Court’s 07/15/22 Order states: “The Court retains jurisdiction to make
orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement, including judgment, pursuant
to [CCP §] 664.6.)” (Id.) 
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
(emphasis added.) (CCP. §664.6.) 
 
Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a Stipulated
Settlement. The parties requested that this Court retain jurisdiction over the
parties to enforce the settlement pursuant to CCP §664.6. Plaintiff has
attached a copy of the written agreement between the parties. (See Danna Decl.,
Ex. 1.) 
 
The Stipulated Settlement indicates that Defendant agreed to
make installment payments according to a detailed time-table agreed upon by the
parties. (See Gastelum Decl., Ex. D.) 
 
Defendant defaulted on May 14, 2023, and then again on
November 14, 2023. (Gastelum Decl., ¶5.) Defendant is in breach of the written
settlement agreement entered into by the parties. The Motion to Enforce the
Settlement Agreement is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §664.6. The Dismissal is set
aside. Judgment shall be entered against Defendant JESUS JIMENEZ in the sum of
$66,344.46.
