CASE

Plaintiff’s
unopposed Motion to Compel Defendant SANDY CERVANTES’ Responses to Request for
Production of Documents (set one) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of June 3, 2024. 
 
 
If a party
to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding
party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §
2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show
a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before
filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not
show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The
failure to timely respond also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff
has shown that Request for Production of Documents (set one), was properly
served onto Defendant Cervantes on July 18, 2023. The deadline to respond has
expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  This Motion was  filed October 31, 2023— about three months
after service of the discovery. As of June 2, 2024, no Opposition has been
filed to the subject Motion. 
 
Therefore,
the Motion to Compel is GRANTED, and
Defendant SANDY CERVANTES is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
No
sanctions are ordered because the motion is unopposed. (2031.300, subd. (c).)
