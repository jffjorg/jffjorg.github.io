And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The defendant's motion to compel responses from the plaintiff is granted. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, which were served on August 25, 2023. The deadlines to respond expired, and no responses were provided. The plaintiff's counsel only argued that the plaintiff did not cooperate with the discovery requests, but did not provide any substantive arguments against granting the motion. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses and documents within 15 days from the date of the order, without objection.
