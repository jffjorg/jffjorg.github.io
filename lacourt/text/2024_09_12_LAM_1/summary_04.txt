And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to transfer the action from the Central District to the North Valley District. The action was filed by plaintiffs Ernesto Luis Vargas, Oscar Luis, Ernesto Jr. Luis, and Maria Paula Aguiluz Ruiz against defendant Larry L. Kussin, alleging causes of action including violation of the warranty of habitability, private nuisance, and negligence. The defendant argues that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by transferring the action to the Chatsworth Courthouse, where the alleged causes of action arose. However, the court finds that the defendant has not met his burden of showing that witness convenience or the ends of justice would be served by a transfer, and therefore denies the motion.
