M HEINL vs ODET BEVERLY HILLS JEWELERS, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Change Venue
TENTATIVE RULING:       The
motion is taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of proper service.  Clerk to give notice.
On March 18, 2022, Plaintiff Glenn M. Heinl
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Odet Beverly Hills Jewelers
(“Odet”), Jay Leno (“Leno”), Ford Motor Co. (“Ford”), and L.A. County Board of
Supervisors (“County”). The complaint is handwritten and set forth on pleading
paper. The complaint references an advertisement and burglary. However, based
on the clarity of Plaintiff’s handwriting, the Court is unable to ascertain all
the allegations of the complaint. 
 
On April 12, 2022, Defendant Odet filed an answer to
the complaint.  
 
On July 7, 2022, after hearing, the Court sustained
the demurrer of Defendant County to the complaint with 30 days leave to amend.
(07/07/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On July 26, 2022, after hearing, the Court sustained
the demurrer of Defendant Ford to the complaint with 60 days leave to amend and
ordered Plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint by September 30, 2022, at
5:00 p.m. (07/26/22 Minute Order.)  
 
On September 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which is also handwritten and set forth on pleading
paper. 
 
After granting Plaintiff’s request for leave to file
a Second Amended Complaint (See 04/27/23 Minute Order), Plaintiff filed a
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on May 16, 2023. The SAC is handwritten and is
set forth on pleading paper. Plaintiff alleges a cause of action for conversion
against Defendants in the SAC. 
 
On June 26, 2023, Defendant Odet filed an answer to
the SAC. 
 
On June 28, 2023, a notice of case reassignment was
issued, and this action was transferred from the Honorable Terry Green to the
Honorable Cherol J. Nellon sitting in Department 14 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse
effective July 10, 2023.  
 
On July 27, 2023, the Court sustained the respective
demurrers of Defendant Ford and Defendant County to the SAC without leave to
amend. (07/27/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On September 19, 2023, the Court entered an order:
(1) sustaining the demurrers of Defendant Ford and Defendant County to the SAC
without leave to amend; and (2) dismissing the SAC against Defendant Ford and
Defendant County. (See 09/19/23 Order.) 
 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for
change of venue. 
 
On December 6, 2023, after hearing, the Court
sustained the demurrer of Defendant Leno to the SAC without leave to amend.
(12/06/23 Minute Order.)  
 
On January 4, 2024, Department 1 of this Court
placed the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to change venue off calendar due to a
lack of proper service and notice. (01/04/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed another motion
for change of venue. 
 
On January 19, 2024, at a non-appearance case
review, Department 14 vacated the hearing date on motion for change of venue
filed on January 16, 2024, due to the hearing on the motion being reserved in
Department 14 and not in Department 1. (01/19/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed another motion
for change of venue. 
 
On March 28, 2024, after taking the matter under
submission, Department 1 of this Court took Plaintiff’s January 23, 2024 motion
for change of venue off calendar for lack of proper service. (03/28/24 Minute
Order.) 
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed another motion for
change of venue; however, on May 8, 2024, at a non-appearance case review,
Department 14 vacated the hearing date on such motion because such motion was
to “be calendared and heard in [D]epartment 1.” (05/08/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On July 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion
to change venue.[1] The
motion was not filed with a proof of service. 
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed another motion for
change of venue, which is set for hearing on September 26, 2024 in Department
1.[2] This
motion also was not filed with a proof of service. 
 
On August 26, 2024, Defendant Odet filed an answer
to the SAC.

Motion to Change Venue 
 
Standard

 
The
Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases
between its districts and departments. (Code Civ. Proc. § 402.) LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) authorizes Department 1 to transfer civil cases from one judicial
district to another via a noticed motion on three enumerated grounds: (1) when
the case was filed in an improper district; (2) for the convenience of
witnesses; or (3) to promote the ends of justice.
(LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2).) A transfer under the Local Rules is discretionary.

 
Given
that the same language appears in both LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) and Code of
Civil Procedure section 397(c), Department 1 applies the case authority related
to Section 397. Accordingly, a party acting under the authority of Los Angeles
Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) bears the same burden of proof if it seeks
a district transfer. (See Lieberman v.
Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 396, 401.) That burden of proof calls
for affidavits that contain more than generalities and conclusions. (See Hamilton
v Superior Court (1974) 37 Cal. App.3d 418, 424.) Such affidavits or
declarations, like those for change of venue under Code Civ. Proc. section
397(c), should show the name of each witness, the expected testimony of each
witness, and facts showing why the attendance of said witnesses at trial would
be inconvenient or why the ends of justice would be served by a transfer. (See Stute
v. Burinda (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 11, 17.) Convenience to non-party
witnesses alone is the key to the success of the motion, and not the
convenience of parties or employees of parties. (Ibid.) 
 
According
to CCP § 397, the court may, on motion, change the place of trial in the
following cases:
 
(a)
When the court designated in the complaint is not the proper court.
 
(b)
When there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein.
 
(c)
When the convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted
by the change.
 
(d)
When from any cause there is no judge of the court qualified to act.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 397, subds. (a)-(d).) 
 
The
Motion is Procedurally Deficient  
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to change venue consists of a two-page handwritten pleading dated July
5, 2024. 
 
The
Court finds that there has been a lack of proper service of the motion. The new
motion is not accompanied by a proof of service and the time to file a proof of
service has expired. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1300(c) (“Proof of service of the
moving papers must be filed no later than five court days before the time
appointed for the hearing.”).) “[P]ro per litigants are not entitled to special
exemptions from the California Rules of Court.” (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.) Proper service and notice are required to satisfy
due process. (See generally, McMillin v. Eare (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 893,
913 (describing the “right to notice, which is an element of due process.”).)
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. However, absent evidence of proper notice and
service, the Court lacks jurisdiction to act. (See e.g., Lee v. Placer Title
Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 503, 509; Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion is therefore taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of proper service. The Court
cannot reach the merits of the motion until all interested parties receive
proper service and notice.
