GREGORY PINTO vs MAHA VISCONTI
Defendant’s Motion to Transfer
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendant’s Motion to Transfer is DENIED.  Clerk to give notice.
On July 12, 2021, Plaintiff Albert Gregory Pinto
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Maha Visconti (“Defendant”)
arising out of an alleged domestic violence incident. The complaint asserts
causes of action for: (1) domestic violence tort [Cal. Civ. Code 1708.6]; (2)
assault and battery; (3) negligence; (4) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
 
On May 26, 2022, Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint. Also, on May 26, 2022, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against
Plaintiff alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of fiduciary duty by an
attorney; (2) fraud; (3) constructive fraud; (4) extortion—civil; (5) assault;
(6) battery; (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) conversion;
and (9) negligent misrepresentation. 
 
On August 17, 2022, the Honorable Michael E.
Whitaker, sitting in Department 32 at the Spring Street Courthouse, issued an
order deeming this action as complicated and “[a]t the direction of Department
1,” this action was transferred and reassigned to the Honorable Helen Zukin in
Department 207 of the Beverly Hills Courthouse for all purposes except trial.
(08/17/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On September 7, 2022, the Honorable Helen Zukin,
sitting in Department 207 of the Beverly Hills Courthouse, accepted Defendant’s
peremptory challenge, and this action was reassigned to the Honorable Elaine W.
Mandel sitting in Department P of the Santa Monica Courthouse. (09/07/22 Minute
Order.) 
 
On September 26, 2022, Defendant filed a peremptory
challenge as to Judge Mandel. 
 
On September 28, 2022, Judge Mandel denied the
peremptory challenge on the grounds that “one was previously granted against
Judge Zukin on 09/06/22.” (09/28/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On March 20, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to
disqualify Judge Mandel. 
 
On March 21, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of
removal to federal court.  
 
On April 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of remand
from federal court. 
 
On May 19, 2023, the Court granted in part
Plaintiff’s motion to declare Defendant a vexatious litigant. 
 
On June 1, 2023, the Court entered an order deeming
Defendant a vexatious litigant and ordered that Defendant be subject to a
pre-filing order. The Court granted Defendant’s request for an evidentiary
hearing on whether she should be ordered to post a bond or have her
cross-complaint dismissed with prejudice. 
 
On June 23, 2023, Defendant filed an amended motion
to disqualify Judge Mandel. 
 
On June 30, 2023, Judge Mandel issued an order
striking Defendant’s June 23, 2023 statement of disqualification on the grounds
that it was insufficiently verified on its face and disclosed no legal grounds
for disqualification. (06/30/23 Order.) 
 
On July 11, 2023, Defendant filed a second amended
motion to disqualify Judge Mandel. 
 
On July 13, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to
transfer this case out of Santa Monica Courthouse. 
 
Also, on July 13, 2023, Judge Mandel issued an order
striking Defendant’s second statement of disqualification, which was filed on
July 11, 2023, finding that it was repetitive of the first statement. (07/13/23
Order.) 
 
Also, on July 13, 2023, Defendant filed a notice
indicating that the second amended motion for disqualification was taken
off-calendar. 
 
On July 18, 2023, Defendant filed a third motion for
disqualification. 
 
On July 20, 2023, Judge Mandel issued an order
striking Defendant’s third motion for disqualification. (07/20/23 Minute
Order.) The Court found that the third motion was identical to Defendant’s
prior statements of disqualification and the Court vacated the hearing on the
third motion for disqualification. (07/20/23 Order.) 
 
On July 27, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of
removal to federal court. 
 
On September 7, 2023, due to the lack of appearance
by Defendant and Defendant’s lack of communication with the Court, the Court
took Defendant’s motion to transfer, which was filed on July 13, 2023,
off-calendar. (09/07/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of
remand from federal court. 
 
On October 23, 2023, Defendant filed a substitution
attorney form indicating that Defendant was no longer represented by George E.
Murphy and was now self-represented. 
 
On November 20, 2023, Defendant filed the instant
motion to transfer. 
 
On December 4, 2023, after hearing oral argument,
the Court found that Defendant was unlikely to prevail on the merits of the
cross-complaint and Defendant was ordered to post a bond of $100,000 prior to
January 4, 2024, or the cross-complaint would be dismissed with prejudice.
(12/04/23 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On January 4, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of
removal to federal court.
 
On January 10, 2024, the Court held a status
conference and found that Defendant failed to post the required bond prior to
January 4, 2024, and the Court ordered the cross-complaint stricken and
dismissed with prejudice.  
 
On January 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition
to the motion to transfer. 
 
On January 12, 2024, the Court entered the operative
first amended order dismissing and striking the cross-complaint filed by
Defendant with prejudice. (01/12/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On April 26, 2024, Defendant filed a statement of
disqualification as to Judge Mandel. On April 26, 2024, the Court struck
Defendant’s statement of disqualification filed on April 26, 2024. (04/26/24
Minute Order.) 
 
On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for
summary adjudication, to which no opposition has been filed as of September 9,
2024. The hearing on the motion for summary adjudication is scheduled for
September 13, 2024 in Department P of the Santa Monica Courthouse before Judge
Mandel. 
 
Motion 
 
On November 20, 2023, Defendant filed the instant
motion seeking to transfer this action to the Ventura County Superior Court or,
alternatively, back to Judge Whitaker at the Spring Street Courthouse.  
 
Opposition
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion to
transfer should be denied because: (1) it is unsupported neither by evidence
nor any applicable legal authority warranting transfer; (2) this is yet another
frivolous attempt by Defendant to forum shop and/or remove Judge Mandel from
the case after Judge Mandel denied the prior motions for disqualification filed
by Defendant on identical grounds raised in the motion to transfer; and (3)
judicial economy of resources and efficiencies dictate that the matter not be
transferred to another judge or department. 

 
Reply
 
No reply brief filed as of September 9, 2024. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
Motion to Transfer 
 
Standard

 
The
Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases
between its districts and departments. (Code Civ. Proc. § 402.) LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) authorizes Department 1 to transfer civil cases from one judicial
district to another via a noticed motion on three enumerated grounds: (1) when
the case was filed in an improper district; (2) for the convenience of
witnesses; or (3) to promote the ends of justice.
(LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2).) A transfer under the Local Rules is discretionary.

 
Given
that the same language appears in both LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) and Code of
Civil Procedure section 397(c), Department 1 applies the case authority related
to Section 397. Accordingly, a party acting under the authority of Los Angeles
Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) bears the same burden of proof if it seeks
a district transfer. (See Lieberman v.
Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 396, 401.) That burden of proof calls
for affidavits that contain more than generalities and conclusions. (See Hamilton
v Superior Court (1974) 37 Cal. App.3d 418, 424.) Such affidavits or
declarations, like those for change of venue under Code Civ. Proc. section
397(c), should show the name of each witness, the expected testimony of each
witness, and facts showing why the attendance of said witnesses at trial would
be inconvenient or why the ends of justice would be served by a transfer. (See Stute
v. Burinda (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 11, 17.) Convenience to non-party
witnesses alone is the key to the success of the motion, and not the
convenience of parties or employees of parties. (Ibid.) 
 
“A
motion for change of venue or continuance shall be granted whenever it is
determined that because of the dissemination of potentially prejudicial
material, there is a reasonable likelihood that in the absence of such relief,
a fair trial cannot be had.” (Maine v. Superior Court of Mendocino County (1968)
68 Cal.2d 375, 383.) “This determination may be based on such evidence as
qualified public opinion surveys or opinion testimony offered by individuals,
or on the court’s own evaluation of the nature, frequency, and timing of the
material involved.” (Ibid.) “A showing of actual prejudice shall not be
required.” (Ibid.) 
 
“The
phrase ‘reasonable likelihood’ denotes a lesser standard of proof than ‘more
probable than not.’” (Williams v. Superior Court (1983) 34 Cal.3d 584,
588, citation omitted.) “[W]hen the issue is raised before trial, any doubt as
to the necessity of removal to another county should be resolved in favor of a
venue change.” (Ibid., citations omitted.) A court assesses the
following factors in determining whether a defendant will not receive a fair
trial: (1) the nature and extent of the publicity; (2) the size of the
population of the county; (3) the nature and gravity of the offense; (4) the
status of the victim and the accused; and (5) whether political overtones are
present. (Ibid.) 
 
The
Court Declines to Transfer the Action
 
Defendant
seeks to transfer this action to the Ventura County Superior Court or,
alternatively, to Judge Whitaker at the Spring Street Courthouse. The case is
currently assigned to Department P of
the Santa Monica Courthouse, which sits in the West District of the Los
Angeles Superior Court. (LASC Local Rules, rule 2.2(b).)
 
Defendant
argues that the case should be transferred because there is a reasonable
likelihood that Defendant would not be able to receive a fair trial before
Judge Mandel at the Santa Monica Courthouse. (Memo. of Ps and As at pp. 7-8.)
Defendant also argues that she is excessively popular in the Los Angeles
Superior Court judicial system; she does not reside in Los Angeles County
anymore; and Los Angeles County no longer has jurisdiction over her. 
 
Initially,
the Court notes that Defendant presents no evidence in support of the motion.
There is no declaration from Defendant or any person indicating that Defendant
will not be able to receive a fair trial before Judge Mandel. Defendant
presents no evidence showing that she does not reside in Los Angeles County and
Defendant presents no facts as to how this Court lacks jurisdiction over her. 
 
The
Court informs Defendant that “[i]n law and motion practice, factual evidence is
supplied to the court by way of declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) The Court acknowledges
that Defendant is currently self-represented; however, self-represented
litigants are held to the same standards as attorneys. (Kobayashi v.
Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 542.) 
 
Critically,
Defendant presents no evidence to satisfy the five factors articulated in Williams
v. Superior Court, supra, 34 Cal.3d 584, 588. Irrespective of such
fact, the Court finds that the Williams factors have not been met. There
is no evidence before the Court as to any publicity that this case has
garnered. The Court does note that Los Angeles County has a substantial
population. Thus, the mere size of the population of Los Angeles County goes against
transferring this action to Ventura County as “a major crime is more likely to
become embedded in the public consciousness” in a small community. (Williams
v. Superior Court, supra, 34 Cal.3d 584, 592.) The Court finds that
the nature of the offense does not warrant a transfer of venue as it is a
domestic dispute between the parties. This is a civil action and is not a
“crime[] . . . of utmost gravity.” (Id. at p. 593.) Next, the Court
finds that there is no evidence as to the social status of Plaintiff or
Defendant and this is not an instance where either of the parties has social
prominence in the community. (Id. at p. 594-95.) Lastly, the Court finds
that there are no political overtones in this case. (Id. at p. 595.) 
 
Thus,
weighing the Williams factors, the Court finds that transfer of this
action to Ventura County Superior Court is not appropriate. 
 
Defendant further contends that the case should be
transferred to the Ventura County Superior Court because it is a convenient
location. Since Defendant failed to present any supporting evidence in support
of the motion, the Court finds that Defendant has not substantiated her
argument as to convenience and has not met her burden. Further, the convenience
of Defendant is not relevant to a motion to transfer. 
 
As to Defendant’s request to transfer this action back to
Judge Whitaker at the Spring Street Courthouse, the Court denies such a
request. This action was transferred from Judge Whitaker by this department due
to this matter being deemed complicated. (08/17/22 Minute Order.) Moreover, in
any event, Defendant has not met her burden in seeking a district transfer. 
 
In sum, the Court denies Defendant’s request to transfer
this action to either the Ventura County Superior Court or to Judge Whitaker at
the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
