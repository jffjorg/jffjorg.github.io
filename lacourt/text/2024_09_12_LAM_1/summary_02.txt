And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the plaintiff's motion to change the venue of the case from the Los Angeles Superior Court to the Norwalk Courthouse off-calendar due to a lack of proper service. The motion was not filed with a proof of service, and the time to file a proof of service has expired. The judge notes that pro per litigants are not entitled to special exemptions from the California Rules of Court, and that proper service and notice are required to satisfy due process. The judge lacks jurisdiction to act on the motion until all interested parties receive proper service and notice.
