And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the complaint and a motion to strike the complaint. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and that the complaint is a sham pleading. The judge disagrees, finding that the plaintiff's claims are not time-barred because the alleged trespass and nuisance are continuing and can be remedied at a reasonable cost by reasonable means.

The judge also grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support a finding of malice, oppression or fraud. Finally, the judge gives the defendants 20 days' leave to amend their demurrer and motion to strike.
