 Case Number:  23SMCV00964    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   SOCAL LIEN SOLUTIONS, LLC,   Plaintiffs, v.  SUAREZ BUILD CONSTRUCTION, INC., et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV00964     Hearing Date:  August 14, 2024   ORDER RE:   CROSS-DEFENDANTS KIM GORDON,    INC. AND KIM GORDON’S DEMURRER   TO CROSS-COMPLAINT   This hearing is on Cross-Defendants Kim Gordon, Inc. and Kim Bordon’s demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.  Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before the filing of a demurrer the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)  Cross-Defendants submit the Declaration of Caroline Suzanne M. Henry, which fails to show the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person on the issues addressed in the demurrer.  It appears the parties only discussed an extension of time to respond to the Complaint, without ever meeting and conferring on the alleged deficiencies identified in the demurrer.  Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing on the demurrer to September 16, 2024 to allow Cross-Defendants the opportunity to comply with their meet and confer obligations.      DATED:  August 12, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
