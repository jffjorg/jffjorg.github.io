  Case Number:  22SMCV01773    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  MITRA H. BRAL,   Plaintiff, v.  KHOSROW SHOUMER, et al.,     Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV01773     Hearing Date:  August 14, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS KHOSROW SHOUMER    AND FARIBA SHOUMER’S DEMURRER    TO AND MOTION TO STRIKE FIRST    AMENDED COMPLAINT      BACKGROUND  This case arises from a dispute between neighbors.  Plaintiff Mitrah Bral owns her home located at 1207 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (the “Bral Property”).  Defendants Khosrow Shoumer and Fariba Shoumer, individually and as trustees of the Shoumer Trust, own the property next door, located at 1211 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills California 90210 (the “Shoumer Property”).    The facts as alleged in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) are as follows:  In 2020, Defendants began construction on the Shoumer Property.  (FAC ¶ 10.)  During construction, Plaintiff alleges Defendants began encroaching onto the Bral Property installing makeshift plywood fences, removing existing wood fencings, and destroying trees, vegetation and landscaping.  (Id. at ¶¶10-11.)  Defendants’ construction activities culminated in two block walls, a metal gate, and an artificial paver pathway that Plaintiff claims is encroaching on the Bral Property.  (Id. at ¶¶ 12, 13.)  Plaintiff claims she obtained surveys that confirm the wrongful encroachments.  (Id. at ¶14.) The operative complaint alleges three claims for: (1) trespass to land, (2) trespass to timber and (3) failure to abate artificial condition on land creating nuisance.   This hearing is on Defendants’ demurrer to and motion to strike the FAC.  Defendants argue that all of Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred because based on the judicially noticed facts, Defendants’ construction was completed on February 21, 2017; there is a three year statute of limitations for each of Plaintiff’s claims, so Plaintiff was required to have brought her claims by February 2020 but Plaintiff did not bring her claims until October 7, 2022, over two years after the statute of limitations had already expired.  Defendants also argue that the FAC is a sham pleading because it raises for the first time encroachments related to a metal gate and an artificial paver pathway, both of which were not mentioned in Plaintiff’s prior complaint or the declaration of Plaintiff’s surveyor.  Moreover, Defendants move to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages because they argue Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged malice, oppression or fraud.           MEET AND CONFER   Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer or motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)  Defendants submit the Declaration of Kelsey Solberg which fails to show the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person.  Instead, defense counsel called opposing counsel twice, and opposing counsel was unavailable both times.  (Solberg Decl. ¶ 3.)  Opposing counsel avers there was no voicemail, and no email requesting a meet and confer or detailing the grounds for the demurrer and motion to strike.  (Sandoval Decl. ¶¶  6-7.)  Notwithstanding, the Court cannot overrule a demurrer or deny a motion to strike on the grounds of an insufficient meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(4), 435.5(a)(4)).   REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  Defendants request judicial notice of (1) a May 31, 2023 Declaration of Mark Sandstrom, (2) a December 17, 2013 City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety Permit, (3) the May 16, 2014 City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety Permit, and (4) a July 21, 2017 City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety Certificate of Occupancy.  The Court grants the request as to the building permits and certificate of occupancy pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(c), 452(h) and 453.  But the Court denies the request as to the declaration as it is not a proper subject for judicial notice.  (Bach v. McNelis (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 852, 864-866 (the court could not properly take judicial notice of the truth of statements made in a declaration); Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882 (courts may not take judicial notice of allegations in affidavits and declarations in court records because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require formal proof).)    LEGAL STANDARD “[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents).)  For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)   The court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437.) Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) DISCUSSION Demurrer Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.  The Court disagrees.   In California, the¿statute of limitations for bringing a¿trespass claim is¿three years.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (b).)  The same¿three year statute of limitations applies to private nuisance claims.  (See¿Holdgrafer v. Unocal Corp.¿(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 907, 925.)  Plaintiff filed her complaint in October 2022, so her claims must have accrued by October 2019 or later to be timely.    Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claims accrued in 2017 when a certificate of occupancy was issued by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”).  Defendants argue that the date the certificate of occupancy was issued must be the date all construction was completed.  But that is not an inference that the Court can draw from the certificate of occupancy.  It could be that, as Plaintiff alleges, the construction was still ongoing as of 2020, and the wrongful encroachments took place in 2020 or later.  (FAC ¶10.)  On a demurrer, the Court is required to accept Plaintiff’s allegations as true. In any event, the Court concludes the alleged trespass and nuisance is continuing, and therefore, the claims are not untimely.  Whether a¿trespass or nuisance claim is barred by the statute of limitations turns on whether the wrongdoing is permanent or continuing in nature. (Starrh & Starrh Cotton Growers v. Aera Energy LLC¿(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 583, 592.)  “In general, a permanent nuisance is considered to be a permanent injury to property for which damages are assessed once and for all, while a continuing nuisance is considered to be a series of successive injuries for which the plaintiff must bring successive actions.”  (Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co.¿(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1216.)¿ “With respect to a permanent nuisance, the statute of limitations begins to run on the creation of the nuisance and bars all claims after its passage … .” (Id.¿at 1216–1217.) ¿By contrast, “each repetition of a continuing nuisance is considered a separate wrong which commences a new period in which to bring an action for recovery based upon the new injury.”  (Id.¿at 1217.)  Thus, if a trespass or nuisance is continuing, “‘an action may be brought at any time to recover the damages¿which have accrued within the statutory period, although the original trespass occurred before that period.’” (Polin v. Chung Cho¿(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 673, 678.)  The same principles apply whether the wrongdoing is characterized as a nuisance or trespass.  (Bookout v. State of California ex. rel. Dept. of Transportation¿(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1489.) When deciding whether a trespass or nuisance is permanent or continuing, the courts consider whether the circumstances of a structure’s construction “indicate an intention that the trespass shall be permanent” (Kafka v. Bozio¿(1923) 191 Cal. 746, 750) and whether a trespass or nuisance’s “impact may vary over time.”  (Field-Escandon v. DeMann¿(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 228, 234.)  Our Supreme Court acknowledged the “‘crucial test of the permanency of a trespass or nuisance is whether the¿trespass or nuisance can be discontinued or abated’”.  (Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp.¿(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1087, 1097.)  Under this test, sometimes referred to as the “abatability test” (see, e.g.,¿Beck, 44 Cal.App.4th at 1220), a trespass or nuisance is continuing if it “can be remedied at a reasonable cost by reasonable means.”  (Mangini, 12 Cal.4th at 1103.) Our Supreme Court applied a version of the abatability test to determine whether a physical structure constituted a continuing or permanent nuisance in¿Phillips v. Pasadena¿(1945) 27 Cal.2d 104, 107-108.  There, the Supreme Court held placement of a locked gate across a road was a continuing nuisance, as the gate “could have been removed at any time.”  (Id.¿at 108.) As in Phillips, here, the fences, block wall, and metal gate can be removed at any time.  Because property values have risen “to the point where even modest properties represent small fortunes,” the cost of relocating a boundary fence or wall pales in comparison to the property value, and thus “it is difficult to conceive of a case where relocation of a boundary fence or wall would be so costly as to render it a permanent encroachment.”  (Madani v. Rabinowitz (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 602, 609-610.)  Because the encroachments here can be removed at any time, they are a continuing nuisance, and Plaintiff’s claims are not untimely.    Defendants also argue that the FAC is a sham pleading because Plaintiff did not raise the issue of the metal gate and paver pathway in her original complaint or in the declaration of her surveyor.  But it can both be true that Defendants encroached on the Bral Property through a block wall as well as a metal gate and paver pathway.  The failure of the original complaint to refer to either the metal gate or paver pathway in no way contradicts the addition of these allegations in the FAC.  The sham pleading doctrine does not prevent a plaintiff from adding additional facts to a complaint as long as there is no contradiction with a prior iteration of the complaint.  (Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425.)  As to the declaration of Plaintiff’s surveyor, the Court has declined to take judicial notice of the declaration.  And in any event, the failure of the surveyor’s declaration to mention the metal gate or paver pathway does not contradict the new allegations.     Accordingly, the Court overrules the demurrer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint. Punitive Damages Defendant moves to strike Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages.  Defendant argues Plaintiffs have only made conclusory allegations that they are entitled to punitive damages without stating facts supporting a finding of malice, oppression or fraud.  The Court agrees.    “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.”  (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)  “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.”  (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166 (citations omitted).)  Allegations that merely plead the statutory phraseology are wholly insufficient to state a basis for recovery of punitive damages.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041.)  Conclusory characterizations of defendant’s conduct as willful, intentional or fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement of the necessary factual grounds for punitive damages.  (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)     Cal. Civ. Code section 3294 provides the basis upon which punitive damages can be recovered.  Punitive damages may only be sought where there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud: (c)(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended to cause injury to the plaintiff or   despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and   conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. (c)(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust   hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights. (c)(3) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a   material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the     defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.  (Civ. Code §3294.) Section 3294 was amended in 1987 to increase the burden of proof required in order to allege a punitive damages claim as well as to raise the level of misconduct necessary for an award of punitive damages.  The California Supreme Court has ruled that the insertion of the word “despicable” in §3294 created a “new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.”  (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.)  “Despicable” means conduct that is “so vile, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.”  (Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.)  “Such conduct has been described as having the character of outrage frequently associated with [a] crime.”  (Id.) Punitive damages are disfavored by public policy and are allowed only under the most extreme circumstances and in the “clearest of cases.”  (Woolstrum v. Mailloux (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 9.)  “To contain the generosity and emotionality of juries, appellate courts have set the threshold high in defining situations in which punitive damages can be given.  Conduct which may be characterized as unreasonable, negligent, grossly negligent or reckless does not satisfy the highly culpable state of mind warranting punitive damages.  Conduct which warrants punitive damages must be of such severity or shocking character [as] warrants the same treatment as accorded willful misconduct – conduct in which defendant intends to cause harm.”  (Id. at 10 (internal quotations and citations omitted).)  Here, the factual allegations in the complaint do not support a finding of malice, oppression or fraud.  Plaintiff does not allege fraud.  As to malice and oppression, in the absence of intent to injure (which Plaintiff has only plead conclusorily), both require a showing of “despicable conduct.”  (College Hospital v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 713, 725.)  Here, Plaintiff alleges Defendants erected fences, block walls, and a metal gate that encroached on her property and destroyed her trees and landscaping.  This is not “vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome conduct,” nor does it have the character of outrage frequently associated with a crime.   It is true that a trespass committed from wanton or malicious motives, or a reckless disregard of the rights of others, or under circumstances of great hardship or oppression, may result in an award of punitive damages.  (Haun¿v.¿Hyman¿(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 615, 620.)  But no specific facts are alleged in the FAC, beyond the conclusory allegations in paragraphs 28, 31, and 47, that Defendants acted maliciously with willful and conscious disregard when they allegedly trespassed onto Plaintiff’s property.   Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint, and GRANTS Defendants’ motion to strike with 20 days’ leave to amend.      IT IS SO ORDERED. DATED: August 14, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
