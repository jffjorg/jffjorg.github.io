And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Sebastian Richards, alleges that the defendants, Alina Landver and Landver Law Corporation APC, failed to comply with Rule 1.5.1 of the California Rules of Professional Responsibility and refuses to split the settlement proceeds with him.

The Judge agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is unenforceable because the fee-splitting agreements failed to comply with Rule 1.5.1. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for fraud because the plaintiff failed to plead with specificity and did not show justifiable reliance.

However, the Judge overrules the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for money had and received, finding that the claim is still viable despite the unenforceable fee-splitting agreements.

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the alleged conduct is not extreme or outrageous.

The Judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after an opposition is filed and the parties have an opportunity to meet and confer.
