PETITION TO APPROVE MINORS’ COMPROMISE
 
A.   
Legal Standards
A petition for
approval of the compromise of a minor’s claim is governed by Code of Civil
Procedure section 372, California Rules of Court, rules 7.950 through 7.955, and
Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600 through 3613. The petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition.” (Cal. R. Ct., 7.950.) Except for
petitions for expedited approval of a compromise as provided in California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, “the petition must be submitted on a completed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).” (Id.)
 
California Rules of Court, rule 7.951
provides that:
 
If the petitioner
has been represented or assisted by an attorney in preparing the petition for
approval of the compromise of the claim or in any other respect with regard to
the claim, the petition must disclose the following information:
 
(1)  The name, state bar number, law firm, if any,
and business address of the attorney;
 
(2)  Whether the attorney became involved with the
petition, directly or indirectly, at the instance of any party against whom the
claim is asserted or of any party's insurance carrier;
 
(3)  Whether the attorney represents or is
employed by any other party or any insurance carrier involved in the matter;
 
(4)  Whether the attorney has received any
attorney's fees or other compensation for services provided in connection with
the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the petition,
and, if so, the amounts and the identity of the person who paid the fees or
other compensation;
 
(5)  If the attorney has not received any
attorney's fees or other compensation for services provided in connection with
the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the petition,
whether the attorney expects to receive any fees or other compensation for
these services, and, if so, the amounts and the identity of the person who is
expected to pay the fees or other compensation; and
 
(6)  The terms of any agreement between the
petitioner and the attorney.
(Cal. R. Ct., 7.951.)
 
Further, California Rules of Court, rule
7.953, provides as follows: 
 
(a) Acknowledgment
of receipt by financial institution. In any case in which the court orders that
funds to be received by a minor or a person with a disability must be deposited
in a financial institution and not disbursed without further order of the
court, the order must include a provision that a certified or filed endorsed
copy of the order must be delivered to a manager at the financial institution
where the funds are to be deposited, and that a receipt from the financial
institution must be promptly filed with the court, acknowledging receipt of
both the funds deposited and the order for the deposit of funds. 
 
(b) Order
permitting the withdrawal of funds by a former minor. If, in the order
approving the compromise of a minor's claim, there is a finding that the minor
will attain the age of majority on a definite date, the order for deposit may
require that the depository permit the withdrawal of funds by the former minor
after that date, without further order of the court.
(Cal. R. Ct., 7.953(a))
 
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subdivision
(a) requires the court to use a reasonable fee standard when approving and
allowing the amount of attorney's fees payable from money or property paid or
to be paid for the benefit of a minor, unless the Court approved the fee
arrangement in advance. (Cal. R. Ct., 7.955(a)(1).) “The court must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and
must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. R. Ct., 7.955(a)(2).) In
a petition requesting court approval and allowance of attorney's fees, California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subdivision (c) requires the attorney to submit a
declaration that addresses the following nonexclusive factors applicable to the
matter before the court that the court may consider:
 
(1)  The fact that a minor or person with a
disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or person with a
disability.
(2)  The amount of the fee in proportion to the
value of the services performed.
(3)  The novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved and the skill required to perform the legal services properly.
(4)  The amount involved and the results obtained.
(5)  The time limitations or constraints imposed
by the representative of the minor or person with a disability or by the
circumstances.
(6)  The nature and length of the professional
relationship between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person
with a disability.
(7)  The experience, reputation, and ability of
the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
(8)  The time and labor required.
(9)  The informed consent of the representative of
the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
(10)  The relative sophistication of the attorney
and the representative of the minor or person with a disability.
(11)  The likelihood, if apparent to the
representative of the minor or person with a disability when the representation
agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the particular employment
would preclude other employment.
(12)  Whether the fee is fixed, hourly, or
contingent.
(13)  If the fee is contingent:
(A)  The risk of loss borne by the attorney;
(B)  The amount of costs advanced by the attorney;
and
(C)  The delay in payment of fees and
reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney.
(14)  Statutory requirements for representation
agreements applicable to particular cases or claims.
(Cal. R. Ct., 7.955(b),
(c).) 
B.     Analysis
Here, the Petitions are brought pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950. The
Petitions are verified and submitted on required Judicial Council form MC-350.
 
The Petitions seeks approval of an offer by
Defendant to settle Claimants’ claim for $10,000.00 as part of a $960,000.00
gross settlement to settle the entire action. (Petition, §§ 10-11, Attachment
11.) The Petitions seek approval for reimbursement of $60.87 in litigation
costs and $2,484.78 in attorney’s fees, for a net settlement amount to Claimants
of $7,454.35. (Id. at §§ 13-16.) 
 
The Petitions include all the required disclosures
of attorney’s interest set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 7.951. (See
id. at § 17.) As required by
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, the Petitions include a declaration from
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Christofer R. Chapman, addressing the factors applicable
in determining the reasonableness of the requested attorney’s fees and provides
a copy of the written attorney fee agreement. (See id. at §§ 13, 17, Attachments 13a & 17a.) The
Court finds that the requested attorney’s fees are reasonable, especially in
light of the fact that the retainer agreement provides for payment of
attorney’s fees of forty percent (40%). The Petitions indicates that
Plaintiffs’ counsel is representing or employed by other parties and specifies
the parties in Attachment 17e. (Id. at § 17e, Attachment 17e.)
 
The Petitions indicates that Claimants “suffered
from bed bug bites, lack of sleep as well as allergies including running nose
and coughs,” but has completely recovered from the effects of these injuries,
and that there are no permanent injuries. (Id. at §§ 6, 8.) The Petitions indicates that
Claimants were treated using over-the-counter treatments and were not treated
by a medical doctor for his injuries. (Id. at § 7.)
 
The Court finds that the Petitions contain a full
disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the settlement amount to Claimants and that the settlement amount to Claimants
are reasonable given Claimants’ injuries and lack of medical expenses. 
 
The Petitions request that the net proceeds be
deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial institutions in this
state, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. (Id. at § 18b.) As required, the
name, branch, and address of each depository are specified in Attachment
18b(2). (Id. at Attachment 18b(2).)
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Petitions are
GRANTED.
 
Each Minor’s Compromise will require a separate Order
Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351) and Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account
(MC-355).
