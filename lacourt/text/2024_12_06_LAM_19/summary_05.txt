And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the petitions for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor filed by several plaintiffs, including Dayjahne Marie Haywood, et al. against Bella Bark, LLC. The petitions seek approval of a settlement agreement for $10,000.00, which is part of a larger settlement of $960,000.00. The judge finds that the settlement amount is reasonable given the plaintiffs' injuries and lack of medical expenses. The judge also finds that the requested attorney's fees are reasonable. The petitions are granted, and each minor's compromise will require a separate Order Approving Compromise of Claim and Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account.
