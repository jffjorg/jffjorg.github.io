```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and denies the plaintiff's application to seal a declaration and confidential settlement agreement. The plaintiff failed to file a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing, as required by court rules. As a result, the court cannot rule on the request to approve the settlement. The court also notes that any settlement that does not provide for the administration of PAGA penalties to aggrieved employees may not be approved. The court sets a new hearing date for December 19, 2024, to discuss the settlement further.
