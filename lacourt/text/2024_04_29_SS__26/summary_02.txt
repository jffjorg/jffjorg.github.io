And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration. The Plaintiffs, Erica Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson, had filed a motion to reconsider the court's previous denial of their Motion to Reclassify. The Plaintiffs claimed that new and/or different facts regarding damages supported their motion. However, the court found that the new information presented was not sufficient to justify reconsideration of the previous ruling. The court also found that the Plaintiffs did not demonstrate diligence in presenting the new information, which was available since 2020. The court therefore denied the Motion for Reconsideration.
