ANALYSIS:
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Lexington
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for insurance subrogation
against Defendant Allen Trucking, LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Serve Summons and Complaint on
Defendant through the California Secretary of State on February 27, 2024. To
date, no opposition to the Motion has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10 provides that a
summons may be served on a corporation, if authorized, by any provision in
Corporations Code sections 1701, 1702, 2110 or 2111. Under Corporations Code
section 1702, this includes by hand delivery “to the Secretary of State, or to
any person employed in the Secretary of State’s office in the capacity of
assistant or deputy.” (Cal. Corp. Code, § 1702, subd. (a).) Service on the
Secretary of State’s Office is permitted if the corporation’s agent “cannot with
reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for personally
delivering the process . . . and it is shown by affidavit to the satisfaction
of the court that process against a domestic corporation cannot be served with
reasonable diligence upon the designated agent.” (Cal. Corp. Code, § 1702,
subd. (a).) 
 
Plaintiff has
demonstrated by affidavit its inability to serve Defendant despite reasonable
diligence. The only available address for Defendant is 200 W Chestnut
St. #205, Glendale, California.
(Motion, Van Susteren Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 2.) Defendant’s agent is Khachik
Eisagoolian. (Ibid.) Attempts to serve Eisagoolian at 200 W Chestnut
have been unsuccessful because a different family currently lives at that
address and does not know Eisagoolian. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. 3.) Nor is
there any other address associated with Defendant’s business, despite searches
of the US Department of Transportation, California Secretary of State, and
Linkedin. (Id. at ¶¶4-5.) Finally, Defendant’s corporate status is
inactive such that the possibility of effectuating service will be unreasonably
difficult. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. 2.) 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff has demonstrated the corporation’s
agent “cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for
personally delivering the process . . . and it is shown by affidavit to the
satisfaction of the court that process against a domestic corporation cannot be
served with reasonable diligence upon the designated agent.”
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Lexington Insurance Company’s Motion to Serve
Summons and Complaint on Defendant Allen Trucking, LLC through the Secretary of
State is GRANTED. PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS TO BE FILED
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
