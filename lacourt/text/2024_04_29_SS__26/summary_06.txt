And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Lexington Insurance Company, will be granted their motion to serve the summons and complaint on the defendant, Allen Trucking, LLC, through the California Secretary of State. The plaintiff has demonstrated that they have made reasonable efforts to serve the defendant, but have been unable to do so. The court finds that the defendant's agent, Khachik Eisagoolian, cannot be found at the address designated for personally delivering the process, and that service on the Secretary of State's Office is permitted. The plaintiff is ordered to file proof of service of the summons and complaint within 20 days of this order.
