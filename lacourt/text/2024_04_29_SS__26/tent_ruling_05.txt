ANALYSIS:
 
On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendants 631 Wilshire Boulevard,
LLC (“Defendant 631 Wilshire”) and BL 631 Wilshire CA, LLC (Defendant BL 631”).
(Motions, Mehrban Decl., Exh. A.) Despite
a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses
without objections, Defendants have not served responses. (Id. at ¶¶4-5
and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on January 24, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendants’ failure to respond
to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling it to
serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendants’ failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against each Defendant
and counsel of record in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney
time billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motions, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.)

Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz’s (1) Motion

Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Defendant
BL 631 Wilshire CA, LLC’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANTS
