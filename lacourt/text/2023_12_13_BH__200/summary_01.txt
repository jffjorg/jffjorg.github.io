And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions in limine filed by the parties and has made the following rulings:

* Motion in Limine No. 2: The court denies the motion and finds that the parties are entitled to know that Michael Velcherean will keep his agreement and not testify contrary to the first set of admissions.
* Motion in Limine No. 3: The court denies the motion and finds that the offer of prior counsel to arrange for the deposition of Bianca Marinescu was not a tantamount agreement to make her available for deposition.
* Motion in Limine No. 4: The court denies the motion and finds that the testimony of Michael Velcherean about Decedent's capacity on August 9, 2018 may be circumstantial evidence of her capacity the next day.
* Motion in Limine No. 5: The court denies the motion and finds that the statement of Yifan Liao may be admissible as a past recollection recorded.
* Motion in Limine No. 6: The court denies the motion and finds that the production of certain documents and videos by Michael Velcherean was not intentional withholding and does not require exclusion without showing prejudice.
* Motion in Limine No. 7: The court denies the motion and finds that Michael Velcherean is entitled to try to lay foundation for the introduction of Exhibit 62.
* OSC: The court discharges the OSC and treats the objection filed November 7, 2023 as an "answer" consistent with Probate Code section 8251.

The court has also granted in part and denied in part Motion in Limine No. 2, and denied the other motions in limine. The court will address the motions in limine and the motion for summary judgment at the evidentiary hearing.
