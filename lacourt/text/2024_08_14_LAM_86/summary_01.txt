And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Ladder Capital Realty III LLC v. Missouri Villas, LLC et al. (23STCV23848). The Plaintiff, Ladder Capital Realty III LLC, and the Receiver, Chris Neilson, have moved for an order approving the Receiver's Final Report and Accounting, approving the Receiver's fees and expenses, terminating the receivership, discharging the Receiver, exonerating the Receiver's surety bond, and approving the disposition of remaining receivership funds.

The Judge has found that the motion is not ready for final decision because the Plaintiff has failed to provide adequate notice to all parties who may be affected by the order. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to provide a supplemental declaration by August 22, 2024, which must contain information about the receivership accounting and a summary of the Final Receiver Report.

The Judge has continued the hearing to September 10, 2024, at 1:30 PM in Department 86 (Stanley Mosk Courthouse).
