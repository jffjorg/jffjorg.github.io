And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, which states that Defendant Humberto Gonzalez's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) is sustained without leave to amend. The SAC is stricken as to Defendants Beverly Hills Properties, LLC, Rochelle H. Sterling, Arianne Newman, Douglas Walton, Stacey Friedman, and Law Offices of Robert Shiri, APC.

The Judge found that the SAC does not allege any new or different facts against Gonzalez, and that the claims against him are barred by litigation privilege or res judicata. The Judge also noted that the SAC only names Gonzalez as to certain causes of action, and that the claims are based on the same allegations as the underlying small claims case.

The Judge further noted that Plaintiff Shahnaz Amirtalesh filed a late opposition to the demurrer, which failed to address the defects identified by the Judge. The Judge denied Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the SAC, and struck the SAC as to the dismissed defendants.
