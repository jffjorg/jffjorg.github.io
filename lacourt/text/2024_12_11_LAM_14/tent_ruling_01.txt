  Case Number:  23STCV03246    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  14 #11Case Background
This is a habitability case.
On February 14, 2023, a large number of Plaintiffs
filed their Complaint against Defendant Joseph Barbarosa. 
On August 1, 2024, Petitioners
Gabriela Rosas, Claudia Martinez, and Fabiola Frausto filed these petitions to
approve minor’s compromise.
Instant Pleading
Petitioners petition the Court to confirm minor’s
compromise for six minor Plaintiffs.
Decision
The petitions to confirm minor’s compromise will be
granted once Petitioners submit updated forms MC-351. The Court sets an OSC re:
proof of payment to the blocked account on January 31, 2025. The updated form
must be filed at least ten days before the next hearing date.
Discussion
Petitioners Gabriela Rosas,
Claudia Martinez, and Fabiola Frausto are the mothers and guardians ad litem to
Claimants Elias Leon Rosas, Brandon Leon Rosas, Alissa Leon Rosas, Leonardo
Lopez, and Ariel Vargas Frausto. The gross settlement allocated to each
Claimant is $10,000. Each petition for minors’ compromise is identical.
Plaintiffs’ counsel will receive 25% of the settlement
proceeds in attorney’s fees and seeks to recover $387.15 in costs for filing
and service fees. Plaintiffs’ counsel submitted a retainer agreement and a
declaration compliant with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b) as required by
form MC-350. The attorney’s fees and costs requested are reasonable. 
The net settlement amount of $7,440.26
will be deposited in a blocked account. Petitioners properly submitted
attachment 18b(2) to form MC-350 and form MC-355. The Court finds this
arrangement is reasonable and in Claimants’ best interests. 
The Court is satisfied that the proposed settlement is
fair and reasonable. 
Form MC-351 is incomplete. Petitioners
failed to specify who attorney’s fees are payable to in Item 8a. Petitioners
must submit updated forms.
Conclusion
The petitions to confirm minor’s compromise will be
granted once Petitioners submit updated forms MC-351. The Court sets an OSC re:
proof of payment to the blocked account on January 31, 2025. The updated form
must be filed at least ten days before the next hearing date.
