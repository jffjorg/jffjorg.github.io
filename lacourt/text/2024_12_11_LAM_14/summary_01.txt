And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court issued a tentative ruling in a habitability case filed by multiple plaintiffs against defendant Joseph Barbarosa. The petitioners, who are the mothers and guardians ad litem to six minor plaintiffs, seek to confirm a minor's compromise. The Court found that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, but noted that the forms MC-351 are incomplete. The petitioners failed to specify who the attorney's fees are payable to. The Court set an order to show cause (OSC) for proof of payment to the blocked account on January 31, 2025, and requires the petitioners to submit updated forms MC-351 at least 10 days before the next hearing date. The Court will grant the petitions to confirm minor's compromise once the updated forms are submitted.
