The plaintiff, Jorge Riegos Castillo aka Jorge Rios, filed a lawsuit against Lazy Dog Restaurant, LLC alleging various labor law violations. The defendant moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the plaintiff had signed an arbitration agreement on April 4, 2021. The plaintiff claimed that he did not sign the agreement, but the court found that the defendant had established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement. The court also found that the plaintiff did not raise any additional arguments in opposition to the motion. As a result, the court ordered the plaintiff to arbitrate and stayed the proceedings pending the completion of arbitration.
