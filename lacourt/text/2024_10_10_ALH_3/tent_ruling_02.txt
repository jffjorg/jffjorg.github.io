On March 7 and March 8, 2024, plaintiff
Sarah Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed motions to compel further responses from defendant
Glen John Apramian, M.D., Inc. (“Apramian Inc.”) to the following: 

-     
Request
for Admissions (Set One), Nos. 3 through 17; and 

-     
Request
for Production of Documents (Set One), Nos. 10 through 15, 17 through 35, and
38 through 42. 

 

Plaintiff also moves for orders
compelling Glen John Apramian, M.D. (Dr. Apramian”) to serve further responses
to the following:

-     
Request
for Admissions (Set One), Nos. 1 through 4, 9, 13, 18, and 19; 

-     
Form
Interrogatories – General (Set One), Nos. 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.2, 2.13,
4.1, 4.2, 12.1, and 17.1; and 

-     
Request
for Production of Documents (Set One), Nos. 5 through 11, 14 through 17, 19,
20, 22 through 24, 27, and 28.  

On July 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9, 2024,
Apramian Inc. and Dr. Apramian (collectively, “Defendants”) filed opposition
briefs. Defendants contend that the motions should be denied as moot because
they will have served supplemental responses by the date of the hearing. 

On July 15, 2024, the Court scheduled
the five motions to be heard on July 22, 2024. On July 22, 2024, due to
technological issues, the hearing was continued to October 10, 2024.   

On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
status report informing the Court that Defendants have not served supplemental
responses despite the representations made in their opposition briefs. Given
that supplemental responses have not yet been served, and that Defendants’
promises to serve responses are insufficient to deny Plaintiff’s motions and
requests for sanctions. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions for further responses are
GRANTED and Defendants are ordered to serve supplemental responses within 10
days. Based on an hourly rate of $300 and the fact that the motions and reply
briefs are largely identical, the Court reduces the amount of sanctions
requested by Plaintiff and imposes $600 in sanctions against Apramian Inc. and
$900 against Dr. Apramian, to be paid within 10 days of the date of this Order.
