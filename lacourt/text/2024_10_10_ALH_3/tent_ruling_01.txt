On October 31, 2022, plaintiff Perla
Mageno (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Pei Wei Asian Diner,
LLC (“Defendant”) alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. On August
7, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to strike Defendant’s answer. 
“[A[ corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) 
On September 12, 2024, the Court signed
an order granting defense counsel’s motion to be relieved, to be effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon Defendant. 
On September 13, 2024, the Court continued
the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to strike and ordered defense counsel to
serve the signed order on Defendant. 
There is no indication that the signed
order on Form MC-053 was served on Defendant as ordered by the Court.
Accordingly, the Court cannot find that Defendant is not represented by
counsel. Plaintiff’s motion to strike is therefore denied without prejudice. 
The Court sets an OSC re: Sanctions for
Failure to Serve Defendant with Order Relieving Counsel for October 28, 2024, at
8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. 
Dated this 10th day of October,
2024
