And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to strike Defendant Pei Wei Asian Diner, LLC's answer to Plaintiff Perla Mageno's complaint filed on October 31, 2022. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Defendant's defense counsel had previously moved to be relieved from representing the Defendant, and the Court granted this motion on September 12, 2024. However, there is no indication that the signed order was served on the Defendant as ordered by the Court. Therefore, the Court cannot find that the Defendant is not represented by counsel, and the Plaintiff's motion to strike is denied without prejudice. The Court has set an OSC re: Sanctions for Failure to Serve Defendant with Order Relieving Counsel for October 28, 2024.
