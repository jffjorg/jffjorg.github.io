Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) There is no meet and confer requirement for a demurrer in an
action for unlawful detainer. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(d).) 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the U.S. Department of
Labor Records filed for Mural Media LLC 401k Plan; (2) the Oregon Secretary of
State Certificate of No Record for Mural Media LLC; (3) The California
Secretary of State’s Records for Mural Media, LLC; (4) The Oregon Secretary of
State Certificate of No Record for Mural Media LLC 401k Plan; (5) a Certificate
of Certified Copy of the Computer Generated Report for Mural Media LLC from the
Oregon Secretary of State; (6) the September 3, 2024 Minute Order sustaining
Defendant’s demurrer in the action entitled Mural Media LLC 401k Plan v.
Maultsby, LASC Case No. 23STCV25631; (7) the July 29, 2024 Minute Order
sustaining Defendant ‘s demurrer in the action entitled Mural Media LLC 401k
Plan v. Maultsby, LASC Case No. 23STCV25637 (hereafter, the “Lead Action”);
(8) the May 13, 2024 Minute Order Sustaining Defendant’s demurrer in the action
entitled Mural Media LLC 401k Plan v. Maultsby, LASC Case No. 23STCV21301
(hereafter, the “First Action”); (9) Plaintiff’s July 16, 2024 Notice of Appeal
in the First Action; (10) Plaintiff’s August 12, 2024 Notice of Abandonment in
the First Action. 
 
Defendants’ Requests Nos. 1-5 are
GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c) (official acts); Requests Nos.
6-10 are GRANTED pursuant to subdivision (d) of that same section (court
records).
 
Defendant also requests that the
Court take judicial notice of additional documents in support of her reply. As
the materials cited are not relevant to the Court’s ruling, Defendant’s
supplemental requests are DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Procedural History
 
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff in this action filed a
complaint for unlawful detainer in the action Mural Media LLC 401k Plan v.
Maultsby, et al., Case No. 23STCV21301 (the “First Action.”) As originally
pled, the First Action alleged a single cause of action for unlawful detainer
arising from a Three-Day Notice to Quit allegedly served on
August 24, 2023. Plaintiff then amended the complaint in the First Action to
allege unlawful detainer based on (1) an August 24, 2023 Notice to Quit for
failure to permit inspection of Defendant’s unit; and (2) a February 29, 2024
Three Day Notice to Quit following a foreclosure sale. The Court sustained
Defendant’s Demurrer in the First Action without leave to amend on May 13,
2024, on the grounds that the August 24, 2023 notice was defective and could
not be cured by the second notice. (Defendant’s RJN Exh. G.) 
 
In the meantime, Plaintiff filed a
new action on October 20, 2023, entitled Mural Media LLC 401k Plan v.
Maultsby, et al. Case NO. 23STCV25637 (the “Lead Action”), alleging a claim
for unlawful detainer premised on an August 11, 2023 Three Day Notice to Quit
and an August 24, 2023 Three Day Notice to Quit, both for failure to permit
inspection of Defendant’s Unit. (See RJN Exh. G p.4.) Only the August 24, 2023
Notice was attached to the original Complaint in the Lead Action. (Id.)
Thereafter, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to allege unlawful detainer based
on (1) an August 24, 2023 Notice to Quit for failure to permit inspection of
Defendant’s unit; and (2) a February 29, 2024 Three Day Notice to Quit
following a foreclosure sale, though the text of the Amended Complaint stated
that the Three-Day Notice was actually given on March 1, 2024. (Id.) On
July 29, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint in the Lead Action without leave to amend, finding that, under the
doctrine of res judicata, the ruling in the First Action acted as a bar to the
claims pled in the Lead Action. (RJN Exh. G p. 5.) However, at the time of that
ruling, an appeal from the May 13, 2024 ruling in the first action was pending.
(Id.) The Court therefore abated the Lead Action pending resolution of
the appeal in the First Action, and ordered Defendant to prepare and submit a
proposed interlocutory judgment by August 30, 2024. (Id.) 
 
On August 12, 2024, apparently in
anticipation of filing this action, Plaintiff abandoned the appeal in the First
Action. (See RJN Exh. J.) On August 20, 2024, before the Court could enter the
interlocutory judgment, Plaintiff filed this action, alleging the substantially
identical facts and the same two causes of action for unlawful detainer, this
time premised on (1) an August 13, 2024 Notice to Quit; and (2) the same
February 29, 2024 Notice to Quit asserted in the First Amended Complaint in the
Lead Action. (See Complaint.). On September 13, 2024, this case was deemed
related to the Lead Action. 
 
Abatement
 
            Defendant
first demurs to the Complaint in its entirety on the grounds that the Lead
Action is another pending action on the same claims, and therefore this action
should be abated. 
 
“A plea in abatement, without
disputing the justness of plaintiff's claim, objects to the place, mode, or
time of asserting it and requires pro hac vice that the judgment be given for
the defendant, leaving it open to renew the suit in another place, or form, or
at another time.” (V & P Trading Co. v. United Charter, LLC (2012)
212 Cal. App. 4th 126, 133 [citation omitted].) The proper mode of abatement in
such a case is a stay of the action that may be lifted if and when the reason
for abatement dissipates. (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan,
Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 771 [“Where abatement is required, the
second action should be stayed, not dismissed.”]; see also County of Santa
Clara v. Escobar (2016) 244 Cal. App. 4th 555, 565 -568 [discussing
supporting authorities].)
 
            Defendant
contends that the Lead Action constitutes another action pending on the same
claims asserted in this action. Not so. Although the Complaint in this action
relies on substantially identical factual contentions, it is not premised on
identical Notices to Quit, as the first cause of action is instead premised on a
new Notice to Quit dated August 13, 2024. (See Complaint Exh. 2.)
Moreover, the Court abated the Lead Action on the grounds that it presented the
same issues as the First Action—namely, a claim for unlawful detainer on an
invalid August 24, 2023 Notice to Quit; and a claim for unlawful detainer on a
February 29, 2024 Notice to Quit that had not been asserted in the original
pleading in each action. (RJN Exhs. G, H.) In fact, the Court expressly stated
in the First Action that the February 29, 2024 Notice necessitated a separate
action for unlawful detainer. (RJN Exh. H. p. 3.) In filing this Complaint,
Plaintiff has done just that. The Court therefore does not find that the Lead
Action constitutes another pending action on the same claims such that this
action should be abated.
 
Capacity to Sue
 
            Defendant
also demurs to the Complaint in its entirety on the grounds that Plaintiff is a
retirement plan, not a limited liability corporation, and therefore has not
established that it has the legal capacity to sue. Indeed, Plaintiff has
expressly admitted in its opposition to this Demurrer that it is a retirement
plan, and not an LLC. 
 
            “‘A
pension plan […] is a formal plan or program whereby funds are accumulated to
pay for retirement income or other deferred income to employees of an employer,
payable at a future date, generally at the normal retirement age as specified
in the plan. The plan […] constitutes a separate entity from the employer[.]’”
(Coastline JX Holdings LLC v. Bennett (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 985, 1005
fn. 8 [internal citations omitted] [holding that profit-sharing plan
established subject to ERISA was not subject to claims by creditors of the
employer].) A limited liability company has the capacity to sue and be sued.
(Corp. Code § 17701.05(b).) 
 
            Mural
Media LLC, which is not a plaintiff here, is a limited liability company
organized in Oregon on December 31, 1996 and dissolved by the Oregon Secretary
of State on February 28, 2019. (RJN Exh. E.) Mural Media was never reinstated
in Oregon, and there are no active filings for the exact name Mural Media LLC
in Oregon. (RJN Exh. B.) Mural Media LLC registered as a foreign LLC to conduct
interstate transactions in California on March 30, 2000. (RJN Exh. C.) That
registration was terminated by the California Secretary of State on February
14, 2022. (Id.) 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendant has unsuccessfully raised this argument in other
proceedings. However, as Plaintiff has not separately requested judicial notice
of the rulings to which it refers, those issues are not properly before the
Court. Moreover, other trial court proceedings are not binding on this Court
except under the doctrines of issue or claim preclusion, neither of which are
asserted by Plaintiff. 
 
            Based
on the judicially noticeable materials presented by Defendant, the Court is
persuaded by Defendant’s position. Plaintiff affirmatively states that it is
not a limited liability company, but does not state, either in the Complaint or
in the opposition, the legal authority which empowers a retirement plan, as
opposed to its administrator, to sue and be sued in the same manner as a
corporation (Corp. Code § 17705) or a partnership or unincorporated
association. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 369.5.) The Court therefore finds that
Plaintiff has failed to establish its capacity to bring this action.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
            When a demurrer is
sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that
the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) California law imposes the burden on the party who filed the
pleading to demonstrate the manner in which they can amend their pleadings to
state their claims.  (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless
the [pleading] shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given." (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated the manner in
which the Complaint might be amended to cure this deficiency. However, as the
Court has sustained the demurrer on the basis that the Complaint fails to
allege the legal basis for Plaintiff’s capacity to bring this action, the
method by which the deficiency might be cured is readily apparent. Therefore, the
Court will grant leave to amend the Complaint to assert a basis for Plaintiff’s
legal capacity to sue and be sued. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to
amend.
 
            Plaintiff
shall have 30 days leave from the date of this order to amend the Complaint. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
