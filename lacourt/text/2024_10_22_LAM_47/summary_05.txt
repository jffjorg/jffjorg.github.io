And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint, but grants leave to amend the Complaint to assert a basis for Plaintiff's legal capacity to sue and be sued. The judge finds that Plaintiff, a retirement plan, has not established its capacity to bring this action. The judge also denies Defendant's requests for judicial notice of certain documents and finds that the Lead Action, which was abated, does not constitute another pending action on the same claims. The judge orders Plaintiff to have 30 days to amend the Complaint.
