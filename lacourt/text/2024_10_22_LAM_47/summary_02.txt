This is a tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber on a motion to continue trial filed by Plaintiffs Earl J. Washington and Lola Mitsuk. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiffs can refile a motion with specific evidence showing good cause for a continuance. The Court notes that it is disfavored to grant continuances, and that the Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to justify a continuance of unspecified length. The Court also references California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) and (c), which state that trial dates are firm and that continuances are only granted for good cause.
