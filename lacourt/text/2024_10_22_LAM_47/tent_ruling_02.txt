STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants have engaged in an ongoing campaign of harassment against them.
Plaintiffs assert claims for harassment, invasion of privacy, breach of
contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
Plaintiffs move for a trial
continuance of unspecified length. 

            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs move for a trial continuance of unspecified
length. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal Rules of Court Rule
3.1332(a).) Therefore, “continuances of trials are disfavored.” (Cal Rules of
Court Rule 3.1332(c).) 
 
            Plaintiffs
seek a continuance of unspecified length on the grounds that they have not had
an opportunity to conduct discovery, even though discovery has been propounded,
because of the pending Special Motion to Strike scheduled to be heard on November
8, 2024. California Rule of Court 3.1332(c) sets forth examples of circumstances
that constitute good cause. “A party's excused inability to obtain essential
testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts” is
expressly identified as good cause for a continuance. (Id. subd. (6).)
The thrust of Defendants’ motion is precisely that: Defendants have not been
able to obtain material evidence because of last-minute production by
Plaintiffs which revealed the existence of that evidence. Because Plaintiffs
have not specified the length of the continuance sought, however, the Court is
unable to determine whether good cause exists for a continuance. (See Rule
3.1332(c); Hernandez v. Superior Court (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1242,
1246.) 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Continue Trial is DENIED. This ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally proper
motion supported by evidence setting forth good cause for a continuance of
specified length. 
 
 
Moving Parties to give notice.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
