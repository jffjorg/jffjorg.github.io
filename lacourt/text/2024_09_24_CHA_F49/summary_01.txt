And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant The Matt Horn Group to the First Amended Complaint and has issued a tentative ruling. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to the First and Second Causes of Action, alleging negligence and conversion, respectively. These causes of action failed to adequately allege the required elements.

The Court did, however, sustain the demurrer with leave to amend as to the Third Cause of Action, alleging misrepresentation. While the allegations of misrepresentation were sufficient to plead the required elements, they failed to adequately allege that Defendant had knowledge of the falsity of the representation.

The Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend the Third Cause of Action within 30 days.
