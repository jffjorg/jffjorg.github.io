RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: OK 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court granting Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to the First and Second Cause of Action.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to the Third Cause of Action. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from alleged contractual fraud involving
the sale of a property located at 9862 Rincon Avenue, Pacoima, California 91311
(“Subject Property”).
 
On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff Rodolfo Arreola (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action.

 
On May 2, 2024, the Court
sustained a demurrer filed by Defendant on March 25, 2024. (05/02/2024 Minute
Order.) Subsequently, on June 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant The Matt Horn Group
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, alleging the following causes of action:
(1) Negligence, (2) Conversion, and (3) Misrepresentation. 
 
On July 10, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Demurrer to the FAC (the “Demurrer”). 
 
No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A general demurrer is
proper, and typically used, where the plaintiff fails to allege “facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.)
 
“The sufficiency of a cause of action is
evaluated by presuming all of the material factual allegations in the complaint
are true.” (Aubry v. TriCity Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal 4th 962, 966 –
967 (Aubry).) In ruling on a demurrer, a court may consider facts that
are properly subject to judicial notice.” (Arroyo v. Plosay, 225 Cal.
App. 4th 279.) In ruling on a demurrer, the allegations of the complaint must
be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.
(Glennen v. Allergan, Inc. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.) Nevertheless,
while "[a] demurrer admits all facts properly pleaded, [it does] not
[admit] contentions, deductions or conclusions of law or fact." (George
v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1112,
1120, 135.) Additionally, “[a] complaint otherwise good on its face is subject
to demurrer when facts judicially noticed render it defective.” (Evans v.
City of Berkeley (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 6.)
 
“It is error for a trial court to
sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any
possible legal theory. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7
Cal.3d 94, 103.) And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without
leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any
defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)” Aubry, supra, 2 Cal. 4th
at 967.)
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer
 
A
party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a).)
A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule
a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections 430.41 (a)(4).)
 
Defendant’s counsel, Gonzalo
Landaverde (“Landaverde”) attests that on June 27 and June 28, 2024, he
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff telephonically, and left voicemails
requesting a callback. (Landaverde Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) On June 28, 2024, Landaverde
also sent an email to Defendant. (Id. ¶ 5.) On July 2, 2024, Landaverde
attempted another meet and confer call. (Id. ¶ 6.) Landaverde claims
that all of his communication with Plaintiff was conducted in Spanish. (Ibid.)
Despite these efforts, no responses had been received from Plaintiff by the
time of the filing of the Demurrer. (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Therefore, the Court
concludes that Defendant’s meet and confer effort is sufficient.
 
B.    
First Cause
of Action – Negligence
 
'The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are
"(a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and]
(c) the breach was the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury
[damages]." (Laddv. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913,
917.) The absence of any one of the elements is fatal to a negligence claim.
(See Gilmer v. Ellington (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 190, 195.)
 
            “Ordinarily, negligence may be
alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury
occurred, but there are ‘limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is
permitted to state his cause of action, and ... the plaintiff must indicate the
acts or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not
recover upon the bare statement that the defendant’s negligence has caused him
injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
527.) However, there is no requirement that plaintiff identify and allege the
precise moment of the injury or the exact nature of the wrongful act. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
In the Court’s Minute Order
dated May 2, 2024, it determined that Plaintiff’s pleadings did not allege any
duty owed by Defendant other than the implied duty of performance under an agreement
to sell the Subject Property. (05/02/24 Minute Order.) Consequently, the Court
sustained the previous demurrer as to the First Cause of Action for Negligence,
noting that contractual duties do not implicate a cause of action for
negligence, as these are distinct causes of action. (Ibid.) 
 
            Despite the Court’s granting leave
to amend, Plaintiff’s FAC made no changes to the First Cause of Action. As a
result, the FAC fails for the same reason, specifically its deficiency in stating
a required element of the cause of action.
 
            Additionally, the FAC is Plaintiff’s
second attempt at alleging this cause of action for Negligence. Despite this
opportunity, Plaintiff has made no changes to address the identified
deficiencies, leading the Court to conclude that Plaintiff is unable to state
this cause of action.
 
            Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS without
LEAVE TO AMEND the Demurrer as to the First Cause of Action. 
 
C.   
Second Cause
of Action – Conversion
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over
the property of another.  The elements of
a conversion are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the
property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a
wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages. It is not
necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary
to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the
alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.”  (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451-452; see also Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb and
Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1135.)
 
“While money cannot be the subject of an action for
conversion unless a specific sum capable of identification is involved, it is
not necessary that each coin or bill be earmarked.” (Weiss v. Marcus (1975)
51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599.)  Funds deposited
in an escrow account by the plaintiff are identifiable specific sums and the
delay of releasing the funds can constitute a cause of action for conversion. (See
Greif v. Sanin (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 412.)
 
The Court’s
previous Minute Order determined that Plaintiff’s allegations were insufficient
to show either ownership or identification of the funds, failing to meet the
specificity standard required when pleading a conversion claim where money as
the subject of the claim. (05/02/24 Minute Order).
 
Despite the Court’s granting leave to amend, Plaintiff’s FAC
has made no changes to address the deficiencies in the Second Cause of Action.
Therefore, the FAC fails for the same reason.
 
Additionally, the FAC is
Plaintiff’s second attempt at alleging this cause of action for Conversion.
Despite this opportunity, Plaintiff has made no changes to address the
identified deficiencies, leading the Court to conclude that Plaintiff is unable
to state this cause of action.
 
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS
without LEAVE TO AMEND the Demurrer as to the Second Cause of Action. 
 
D.   
Third Cause
of Action – Misrepresentation
 
The FAC introduces a new claim for
Misrepresentation.
 
A claim for fraud must plead all of
the following elements: (1) misrepresentation; (2)¿knowledge of falsity; (3)
intent to induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.
(Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 128; Wilhelm
v. Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1332.)
Fraud actions are subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading.
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35
Cal.3d 197, 216.) Particularity requires facts that show how, when, where,
to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12¿Cal.4th 631, 645 (Lazar).)
 
A claim for negligent
misrepresentation must pleads the following elements: (1) Assertion of an
untrue fact; (2) Honestly made in the belief it is true; (3) But without a reasonable
ground for such belief; (4) defendant’s intent to induce plaintiff’s reliance
upon the representation; (5) plaintiff’s justifiable reliance upon the
representation; and (6) resulting damage. (Melican v. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 168, 182(Melican); County of Kern v.
Sparks  (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 11, 20; Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 173-74; Continental
Airlines, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 388,
402;  Apollo Capital Fund LLC v. Roth
Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 243; Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 185(Charnay), fn. 14 [requiring pleading particularity
with facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered] (underlines added);  Cadlo v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (2004)
125 Cal.App.4th 513, 519 [requiring pleading specificity]; B.L.M. v. Sabo
& Deitsch (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 823, 834-836 [relevant intent is to
induce reliance, not to deceive]; Byrum v. Brand (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 926, 940
[rejecting a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation based on unintentional
omission or concealment]; see CACI 1903.)
 
When reviewing a demurrer, a court
gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context. (Berg & Berg Enterprise, LLC v.  Boyle (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1034.)
 
Here, the FAC alleges that “On or about between the 1st
and the 15th of November of the year 2022, in the City of Porter Ranch, County
of Los Angeles, State of California, Defendants, who were authorized by, and acting
on behalf of THE MATT HORN GROUP Defendants, made verbal and written
representations to Plaintiff. The verbal and written representations were that
all Defendants had many years of experience in the real estate industry, and
that the Defendants would apply their expertise in the sell of the Subject
Property located at 9862 Rincon Avenue Pacoima, California 91331[.]” (FAC ¶ 9.)
Additionally, “The verbal and written representations were in fact false, but
that fact was not known at the time by Plaintiff.” (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that the above allegations satisfy the
pleading requirements for the first element of the cause of action, showing
“facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Lazar, supra, 12 Cal.4th at 645,
Charnay, supra 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 185.)
 
As to the second element of Defendant’s knowledge of
falsity, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to allege that Defendant made a
knowingly false representation. (Dem. at p. 5.) The Court agrees. 
 
The FAC only alleges that “Plaintiff
is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that Defendants, and each
of them have caused misrepresentation to plaintiff in the regard to the sell of
the subject property that was under sold according to the Real Estate Market
Value at the time that it was sold according to proof at the date of trial.”
(FAC ¶ 18.) This
allegation lacks factual support and includes only a conclusion of fact and
law. Therefore, the FAC is insufficient in alleging the required element of
Defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of the purported misrepresentation necessary
for a fraud claim. 
 
Alternatively, even if the FAC is
liberally construed to encompass a negligent misrepresentation claim, the Court
finds that it still fails to sufficiently state the required element that
Defendant’s belief in the truth lacked reasonable grounds. (Melican, supra,
151 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)
 
            Based
on the above, the Court SUSTAINS with LEAVE TO AMEND the Demurrer as to the
Third Cause of Action. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
The Matt Horn Group’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend as to the First and Second Causes of Action.
 
As to
the Third Cause of Action, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiff
is GRANTED leave to amend as to the Third Cause of Action within 30 days.
