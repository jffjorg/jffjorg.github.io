And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Joanna Gaspar, against the defendant, Cole Baber. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendant's subsequent response to the discovery requests was in substantial compliance with the relevant laws and that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to excusable neglect. The judge has granted in part the request for monetary sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $311.65 to the plaintiff's attorney of record. The judge has also denied the motion to compel responses, finding that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was not sufficient to warrant compelling the responses.
