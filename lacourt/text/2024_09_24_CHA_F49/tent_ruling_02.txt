MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03549

 
Motion
filed: 5/13/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Joana Gaspar 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Cole Baber 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court compelling Defendant to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and imposing monetary sanctions
against Defendant and his attorney of record, in the amount of $2,436.65.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED as moot. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and
Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General Negligence.
Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Joanna filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant’s
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Joanna
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel.  
 
Subsequently, Defendant filed an Opposition on August 28,
2024, and Plaintiff filed her Reply on September 4 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses and for a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
A.   
Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Plaintiff Joanna’s counsel,
Nima Sadeghian (“Sadeghian”), attests that on January 29, 2024, Defendant was served
with the first set of Special Interrogatories, to which responses were due on March
4, 2024. (Sadeghian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “2.”) Having not received any responses by
the due date, Sadeghian sent Defendant’s counsel a written meet and confer
letter on April 4, 2024, requesting that Defendant serve responses, without
objection, by April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Ex. “3.”) On March 28, 2024, Sadeghian
sent another meet and confer letter, again requesting written responses to
discovery.  (Id. ¶ 7, Ex. “4.”) Subsequently,
on April 18, 2024, Sadeghian sent an email to Defendant, granting an extension
to respond by May 2, 2024. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 8.) On May 14, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel emailed Sadeghian the discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 11.) 
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response.
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a),
the court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Firstly, the Court notes that
Plaintiffs’ Reply
does not contest that Defendant’s subsequent response is in substantial
compliance with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections.
 
Secondly,
the Court observes that the provision
in section 2030.290 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of
section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow
relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s
discretion in granting such relief is not unlimited and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of
relief intended by the statute so that substantial justice is served, not
defeated. Because the law favors that cases be tried and decided on their
merits, if there are any doubts whether relief should be granted, they must be
resolved in favor of the person seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)
 
Based on the declaration submitted by Defendant’s counsel
and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court, in its discretion,
finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated excusable neglect, thereby
justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude him from asserting any
objections to the interrogatories. The Court perceives no prejudice to
Plaintiff resulting from the delay, other than the need to pursue their case on
the merits.
 
Accordingly, the Court
DENIES the Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust....” Additionally, California Rules of
Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
Here, Defendant did not provide
responses to the Special Interrogatories within the timeframe set forth under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.260. Although Defendant has subsequently
served his untimely responses, the Court finds that it is appropriate to impose
monetary sanctions. 
 
Given that the instant Motion shares
significant similarities with several other motions, the Court determines that the
total and reasonable amount of attorneys’ fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $311.65, calculated at a
reasonable hourly rate of $250.00 for 1 hour reasonably spent, plus a $61.65
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiff Joanna’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED
IN PART.
 
Defendant
Cole Baber and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay
$311.65 to Plaintiff’s attorney of record within 20 days.
 
Moving
party to give notice.

MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03549

 
Motion
filed: 5/13/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Joanna Gaspar 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Cole Baber 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Defendant’s responses, without objection, to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and to impose monetary sanctions
against Defendant and his attorney of record, in the amount of $2,436.65.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and
Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle
Liability, and (2) General Negligence. Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer
to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Joanna filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One (the “Motion”).
Additionally, Joanna requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel.  
 
Subsequently, Defendant filed his Opposition on August 28,
2024, and Plaintiff Joanna filed her Reply on September 3, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to whom
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to
serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand may move for an
order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (b).) The party that fails to timely respond waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product, unless the Court, on motion, determines that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) the party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance, and (2) the party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Plaintiff Joanna’s counsel,
Nima Sadeghian (“Sadeghian”), attests that on January 29, 2024, Defendant was served
with the first set of Requests for Production of Documents, to which responses
were due on March 4, 2024. (Sadeghian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “2.”) Having not received
any responses by the due date, Sadeghian sent Defendant’s counsel a written
meet and confer letter on April 4, 2024, requesting Defendant to serve
responses, without objection, by April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Ex. “3.”) On March
28, 2024, Sadeghian sent another meet and confer letter, again requesting written
responses to discovery.  (Id. ¶ 7,
Ex. “4.”) Subsequently, on April 18, 2024, Sadeghian sent an email to
Defendant, granting an extension to respond by May 2, 2024. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 8.)
On May 14, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Sadeghian the discovery responses.
(Id. ¶ 11.) 
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response. 
 
Nevertheless, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a), the court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2021.240, and 2031.280. ¶ (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. 
 
Here, Defendant’s counsel contends that her
firm received the case file on March 28, 2024, after it was transferred from
the previous attorney. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 3.) A copy of the discovery requests was
subsequently provided to Defendant’s counsel on April 9, 2024. (Id. ¶
4.) Defendant’s counsel prepared the discovery responses and received
verification signed by Defendant on May 2, 2024 (Id. ¶ 9.) However, due
to an oversight, discovery responses were not sent by the paralegal on the due
date. (Id. Ex. “4.”) Responses to the Request for Production of
Documents were subsequently emailed to Plaintiff’s counsel on May 14, 2024. (Id.
Ex. “12.)
 
First, the Court notes that Joanna’s
Reply does
not contest that Defendant’s subsequent response, albeit untimely, is in
substantial compliance with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections.
 
Second,
the Court observes that the provision
in section 2031.300 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of
section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow
relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s discretion in granting
such relief is not unlimited
and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of relief intended by the
statute so that substantial justice is served, not defeated. Because the law
favors that cases be tried and decided on their merits, if there are any doubts
whether relief should be granted, they must be resolved in favor of the person
seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)
 
Based on the declaration submitted by
Defendant’s counsel and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court,
in its discretion, finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated excusable
neglect, thereby justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude him from
asserting any objections to the requests. The Court perceives no prejudice to
Plaintiff resulting from the delay, other than the need to pursue his case on
the merits.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“Except as provided in subdivision (d) [inapplicable here],
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust [...]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Additionally, California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A)
further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
Although the Court has relieved
Defendant from waiving any objections as previously addressed, it finds that
the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (c) are still applicable in this case. 
 
Given that the instant Motion shares
significant similarities with several other motions, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $311.65, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $250.00 for 1 hour reasonably spent, in addition to a
$61.65 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiff Joanna’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s request to monetary sanctions is GRANTED
IN PART.
 
Defendant
Cole Baber and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay
$311.65 to Plaintiff’s attorney of record within 20 days.
