And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to reopen limited discovery, which was filed on May 6, 2024. The Plaintiff sought to reopen discovery to examine Defendant California Box Company's (CBC) responses to Plaintiff's supplemental request for production of documents, which were served on January 19, 2024, just one day before the discovery cutoff date. The Plaintiff argued that the documents produced by CBC reek of fraud and evidence tampering, and that they appear to have been prepared during litigation.

The judge found that the Plaintiff did not show good cause for reopening discovery, as the declaration of Plaintiff's counsel did not state the necessity and reasons for the discovery, why the discovery motion was not completed earlier, or that Defendants would not be prejudiced if the motion was granted. The judge also noted that the declaration did not state that the memorandum at issue, which was produced in April 2022, was not previously disclosed.

The judge reminded the Plaintiff that facts are stated in declarations, and that the Plaintiff must provide sufficient showing under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2024.050 to reopen discovery. The judge also noted that the parties agreed to open limited discovery on February 29, 2024, and that the Plaintiff's motion was DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
