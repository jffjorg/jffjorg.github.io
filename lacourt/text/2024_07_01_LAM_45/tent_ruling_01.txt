IN PART. 
Background
            This
case arises from allegations of breach of contract and
fraud. On July 13, 2021, Plaintiff Amanda Raymond (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Heart of Christmas, LLC dba Future Sight Entertainment
(“Heart”), Tara Pirnia (“Pirnia”) (collectively, the “Defendants”), and Does 1
to 50, alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of
Contract; (3) Common Counts; (4) Fraud; (5) Fraud; (6) Fraud; and (7) Fraud. 
            On
July 5, 2022, pursuant to stipulation, the Court ordered the default of
Defendants Heart and Pirnia vacated. (07/05/22 Minute Order.) 
            On
July 8, 2022, Defendants filed a joint Answer to the Complaint.   
            Also,
on July 8, 2022, Defendant Heart filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff
alleging a single cause of action for Breach of Contract. 
            On
November 8, 2023, the Court granted the respective motions of Christopher
Gonzalez to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Heart and Pirnia. (11/08/23
Minute Order.) The Court granted a stay of discovery for 30 days until December
7, 2023, so that Defendants could obtain new counsel. (11/08/23 Minute Order.) 
            On
January 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed respective motions to compel Defendant Pirnia
and Defendant Heart to respond to Plaintiff’s Request to Produce Documents and
Things, and for Monetary Sanctions against Defendants Pirnia and Heart,
respectively. 
            On
March 29, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted: (1) Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Request to Produce Documents and Things against
Defendant Pirnia and Request for Monetary Sanctions; and (2) Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Responses to Request to Produce Documents and Things against
Defendant Heart and Request for Monetary Sanctions. (03/29/24 Minute Order at
pp. 1-2.) In addition to ordering that Defendants comply with such discovery order
within 30 days, the Court imposed sanctions against Defendants in the amount of
$970.15, payable within 30 days. (03/29/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) The Clerk was
ordered to give notice. (03/29/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) A Certificate of
Mailing as to the Court’s March 29, 2024 order was filed on March 29,
2024.  
            On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Evidentiary
Sanctions, Terminating Sanctions, and Monetary Sanctions (the “Motion”).
Plaintiff seeks an order that: (1) Defendants be precluded from introducing any
documents that were the subject of Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two, (2) the Answer of Defendants to the Complaint be stricken,
and (3) Defendants pay a monetary sanction to Plaintiff in the sum of
$1,640.00. (Not. of Mot. at p. 1:28-2:7.) 
            On
May 31, 2024, a Substitution of Attorney was filed indicating that Kaire J.
Boyd, Esq. and Thomas D. Georgianna, Esq. were now representing Defendant
Pirnia and she was no longer self-represented.
            Also,
on May 31, 2024, a Notice of Limited Scope Representation was filed indicating
that Ms. Boyd and Mr. Georgianna have an agreement that they would represent
Defendant Pirnia at the hearing on the motion for discovery sanctions and
related proceedings. 
            On
June 3, 2024, a Substitution of Attorney was filed indicating that Kaire J.
Boyd, Esq. and Thomas D. Georgianna, Esq. were now representing Defendant Heart
and that Defendant Heart was no longer self-represented.
            On
June 3, 2024, after a hearing in which both counsel for Plaintiff and
Defendants appeared via LA Court Connect, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex
parte application to advance the hearing date on the Motion and the hearing
on the Motion was advanced and continued to July 1, 2024. (06/03/24 Minute
Order.) Notice was waived. (06/03/24 Minute Order.) 
            Jury
trial is scheduled to begin on July 15, 2024. 
            As
of June 27, 2024, no opposition brief has been filed. Any opposition brief was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Given that Defendants have
failed to oppose the instant motion, an inference is created “that the motion
is meritorious.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.) 
Legal
Standard
            In California, discovery statutes “must be
construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly
improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)
“Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is
unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” (John B. v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186.) “Discovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” (Ibid.)
“When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not
appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable
inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden.” (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
 A misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) A misuse of the discovery process also includes disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) A
court may impose terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or
monetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery process.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Where an issue sanction is imposed, “designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An issue sanction may also involve “any
party engaging in misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An
evidence sanction involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated matters in
evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)  
A terminating sanction may be imposed by the court by one of the
following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) an
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; or (4) an order rending judgment by default against that party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)-(4).)  
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  (Ibid.)
Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.)  A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a
party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful. (Ibid.)   
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.” (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial court’s order
to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical.” (Ibid.) Trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s lack
of compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party
prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.) 
California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2023.030 provides that
“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.) 
Discussion 
a.      
Evidence in Support of the Motion
            In
support of the Motion, counsel for Plaintiff, John A. Tkach (“Tkach”), provides
a declaration. Mr. Tkach declares as follows: Defendants have disobeyed the
Court’s March 29, 2024 order by failing to respond to Set Two of Plaintiff’s
Request to Produce Documents and have failed to pay the monetary sanctions in
the amount of $970.15 as ordered by the Court. (Tkach Decl., ¶¶ 1-2; Exh. 1.)
Mr. Tkach attempted to secure compliance with the Court’s order by contacting
Defendants prior to filing the Motion. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defendants’
disobedience of the Court’s discovery order has been prejudicial to Plaintiff
in that trial is set to commence on July 15, 2024, and the requested documents
are solely in possession of Defendants. (Id., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff is
unable to secure the documents from any other source, and the documents are
necessary for Plaintiff to maintain her action for breach of contract and to
dispute any affirmative defenses that Defendants may assert at trial. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
            Counsel
further recounts his efforts to secure Defendants’ responses to Set One of
Plaintiff’s Request to Produce Documents through noticed motions; however, such
motions were deemed moot and counsel states that Defendants responded to such
discovery by providing inadequate responses. (Id., ¶¶ 8-14; Exh. 2.)
Counsel states that as of the date of the Motion, Defendants have not contacted
him. (Id., ¶ 18.) Counsel indicates that he has spent four hours preparing the
instant motion and anticipates spending one to two hours for the hearing on the
matter. (Id., ¶ 19.) Counsel requests monetary sanctions
in the sum of $2,370.00 plus costs under CCP § 2023.280(c). (Id., ¶ 19.) 
b.     
Analysis as to Terminating and Evidentiary
Sanctions 
            Initially,
the Court notes that in the memorandum of points and authorities, Plaintiff
contends that the Answer of Defendants should be stricken or, at a minimum,
Defendants should be precluded from introducing any documents or giving any
testimony as to the contents of any documents. (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities at p. 11: 17-22.) However, as to evidentiary sanctions, the notice
of motion only indicates that Plaintiff seeks to preclude Defendants from
“introducing any documents that were the subject of Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set 2.” (Not. of Mot. at p. 2: 1-2.) 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s request—in the memorandum of points and
authorities—to preclude Defendants from giving testimony as to the contents of
any documents set forth in her second set of requests for production of
documents is procedurally improper. The Court reminds Plaintiff that “[a]
request for sanction shall, in the notice of motion . . . specify the type of
sanction sought.” (Sole Energy Co. v. Hodges (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
199, 207.) Here, because the request to preclude Defendants from giving
testimony as to the contents of documents was not set forth in the notice of
motion, the Court DENIES such request. The only procedurally proper request
that Plaintiff made concerning evidentiary sanctions is to preclude Defendants
from introducing any documents that were the subject of Set Two of the Request
for Production of Documents. (Not. of Mot. at p. 2:1-2.) 
            Defendants
have disobeyed one order of this Court pertaining to discovery. The Court,
however, must take an incremental approach to sanctions and therefore the Court
does not find that terminating sanctions are appropriate at this time. The
Court cannot impose sanctions beyond that which is required to protect
Plaintiff’s interests. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
The Court therefore
DENIES Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
The Court does find that
monetary sanctions are insufficient to compel Defendants’ compliance with this
Court’s discovery orders. As such, the Court finds that the imposition of
evidentiary sanctions is appropriate. Plaintiff has been unable to obtain
relevant evidence due to Defendants flouting of the discovery process and the
orders of this Court by refusing to provide responsive documents.  
As such, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request that Defendants be precluded from introducing any documents
that were the subject of Plaintiff’s second set of requests for production of
documents. (Not. of Mot. at p. 1:28-2:2.)  
c.      
Monetary
Sanctions 

            Plaintiff argues that
a $60.00 filing fee was incurred for the Motion. (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities at p. 4:27.) The Court notes that counsel did not set forth his
hourly rate and that there is an inconsistency between the amount of sanctions
requested in counsel’s declaration and the notice of motion. Counsel’s
declaration states that Plaintiff seeks sanctions of “$2,370 plus the costs
under C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).” (Tkach Decl., ¶ 19.) However, the notice of motion
states that Plaintiff is seeking monetary sanctions in the sum of $1,640.00.
The Court will not award monetary sanctions greater than that articulated in
the notice of motion. 
            Given that the instant
motion is straightforward, is unopposed, and is not complex in nature, the
Court exercises its discretion GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions. The Court AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions in the sum
of $820.00, which includes the $60.00 filing fee. Monetary sanctions are to be
paid by Defendants to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this order.    
Conclusion
            Based on the foregoing, the motion for
evidentiary sanctions, terminating sanctions, and monetary sanctions is GRANTED
IN PART.  
            Plaintiff’s request for terminating
sanctions is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
            Plaintiff’s request for evidentiary
sanctions is GRANTED and Defendants are therefore precluded from introducing
any documents that were the subject of Plaintiff’s second set of requests for
production of documents. 
            Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $820.00 are
to be paid by Defendants to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this order.
It is so
ordered.
