Legal Standard
 
Standard for Striking or Taxing Costs – In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of
Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term prevailing party is defined by statute to
include: (1) the party with a net monetary recovery; (2) a defendant who is
dismissed from the action; (3) a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant recovers anything; and (4) a defendant as against those plaintiffs
who do not recover any relief against that defendant. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1032(a)(4).) Regarding parties dismissed, the term applies whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary. (Santisas, supra, 17
Cal.4th at 606.) A motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed
within 15 days after service of the costs memorandum. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A motion to strike challenges the entire
costs bill whereas a motion to tax challenges particular items or amounts.
Verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney
establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) To overcome that prima
facie showing, the objecting party must introduce evidence to support its claim
that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to carry out the
litigation. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
256, 266.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Allowable costs under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable
in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable
in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e.,
reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) If the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
(Ibid.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they
are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the
litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is
reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Ibid.) However, because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute, a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized. (Id.) Discretion is abused only when, in its
exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances
being considered.” (Ibid.)¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – Lozano
seeks to tax the following:
 
·        
Filing and motion fees in the following amounts:
Plaintiff’s Summons and Complaint in the amount of $19.22, Plaintiff’s posting
of Jury Fees in the amount of $161.39, Defendant Camacho Proof of Service in
the amount of $7.26, Defendant Lozano Proof of Service in the amount of $7.26, Opposition
to Ex Parte in the amount of $4.20, and Motions in Limine 1-7 in the amount of
$120.33;
·        
Deposition costs in the amount $1,001.76 for
Camacho;
·        
Service of process fees in the following amount:
Advance Imaging Center in the amount of $199.99, and additional cost as listed
in Attachment 5.d. in the amount of $2,557.25;
·        
Court reporter fees as to Steno in the amount of
$6,300.00;
·        
Interpreting fees in the amount of $495.00 for
Access Multilingua Services, Inc.; and 
·        
Other as attached in Attachment MC-025 the total
of $2,219.18.
 
The total amount of costs Lozano
seeks to tax is $29,226.68.
 
Lozano presents that Plaintiff
has not provided any documentation to substantiate any of her claimed costs and
highlights: (1) in Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1103,
the plaintiffs filed a Memorandum of Costs which included the worksheet as well
as the underlying bills; and (2) the Court has the power to disallow even costs
“allowable as a matter of right” if they were not “reasonably necessary;” and
to reduce the amount of any cost item to that which is “reasonable” (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245).
Lozano next argues (1) a review of Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs establishes
that a majority of the claimed costs are for fees that are not charged by the
Los Angeles Superior Court; (2) should any of these fees be attorney fees, they
should have been itemized in Item No. 14 of the Memorandum of Costs; and (3) as
the claimed costs are not “filing and motion fees” recoverable under section 1
of the Memorandum of Costs they should be stricken in their entirety. Lozano
presents that the deposition of Camacho was not necessary to the action as
Camacho was not at the scene of the incident, did not own any of the vehicles
involved in the accident, and was dismissed prior to the start of trial. Lozano
further presents that: (1) Plaintiff has not shown that service of process was
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation or that any one served
was called to testify; (2) the court reporter was unilaterally obtained by
Plaintiff and was not reasonably necessary to the litigation and, should a
court reporter be deemed necessary, the cost is excessive pursuant to Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(11) and the relevant statute is Cal. Gov. Code §
69948(a); (3) the interpreter was not qualified and Plaintiff has not provided
evidence of the Court authorizing the interpreter, Plaintiff being indigent, or
Plaintiff’s counsel being a qualified legal services project or pro bono
attorney; and (4) there is no explanation or documentation regarding the “other
cost” Plaintiff is attempting to claim. 
 
Plaintiff argues that she is
entitled to her costs as the prevailing party. Plaintiff presents that “[t] here
is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such
documents be attached to the
memorandum” and that only upon a Motion to Tax are costs placed in issue and
supporting documentation required. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) Plaintiff contends that her costs are proper; that
fees related to a courier service is reasonable and the location does not
matter; and that if a specific item of costs is not identified in the costs
statute, it is the in the Court’s discretion to award fees provided the fees
are reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. As to Camacho,
Plaintiff presents that (1) she had a good faith belief and understanding at
the beginning that Camacho was the vehicle owner due to the proof of insurance
form presented to Plaintiff at the scene of the incident and that Lozano and
Camacho share the same address; and (2) it was only at Camacho’s deposition
that Plaintiff discovered that Camacho was not an owner of Lozano’s vehicle. Plaintiff
further presents that Camacho’s verified discovery responses were not served
until after Camacho’s deposition. As to the interpreter, Plaintiff presents
that the interpreter was used at Camacho’s deposition as Camcho does not speak
English and needed an interpreter. Plaintiff argues that the fact that
subpoenaed parties did not show up at trial does not make the costs associated
with subpoenas unrecoverable and such subpoenas were necessary as Lozano
refused to admit the authenticity of any documents, including medical records
and bills. Regarding court reporters, Plaintiff presents that they are
authorized by statute and Cal. Gov. Code § 69948(a) applies only to court
retained reporters. Plaintiff contends that her other costs are necessary and
reasonable for trial.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposing
brief includes an argument related to prejudgment interest. Plaintiff’s filing titled “Brief in Support
of Request for Pre-Judgment Interest per C.C.P §998 and Civil Code §
3291” is a separate document and is not scheduled for hearing. As such, it is
not at issue in this motion.

1033.5(14))and (2) “[f]ees for the hosting of electronic documents if a court
requires or orders a party to have documents hosted by an electronic filing
service provider. This paragraph shall become inoperative on January 1, 2022[]”

Plaintiff has attached as Exhibit
E is a true and correct copy of the receipts/invoices in

fees” as sought in Section 1 of Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs. Exhibit E
shows:
 
·        
$454.22 for the filing of the Summons and
Complaint;
·        
$161.39 for the Notice of Posting of Jury Fees;
·        
$7.26 for the filing of Camacho’s Proof of

It is unclear what the adjustment
means on the Motions in Limine as the total due on the invoices that are marked
“PAID” say the total due is $0.00. No further information is given by Plaintiff
as to the meaning of the invoices involving the Motions in Limine. As
presented, it appears that Plaintiff has spent $630.13 on filing and motion
fees. The Court will inquire at the hearing.
 
 At this time to inclined to GRANT the Motion
to Tax as to filing and motion fees in the amount of $1,085.61.
 
     
ii.           
Deposition Costs (Item No. 4)
 
Deposition costs are allowed
under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, which reads in relevant part:
 
(a) The following
items are allowable as costs under Section 1032:
 
[. . .]
 
(3)(A) Taking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and
one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by
the party against whom costs are allowed.
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(3)(A).
 
The deposition of Camacho,
evidenced in the amount of $2,003.53 (additional $59.66 due to payment after
October 06, 2022), was reasonably necessary to the litigation as the deposition
determined that Camacho did not own or co-own the vehicle. (See Exh. F, Decl.
John Ksajikian at ¶ 3.)
 
The Motion to Tax as to
deposition costs in the amount of $1,001.76 is DENIED.
 
   
iii.           
Service of Process Fees (Item No. 5)
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5
provides that service of process fees are recoverable as follows:
 
(4) Service of
process by a public officer, registered process server, or other means, as
follows:
 
(A) When service
is by a public officer, the recoverable cost is the fee authorized by law at
the time of service.
 
(B) If service
is by a process server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with
Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, the
recoverable cost is the amount actually incurred in effecting service,
including, but not limited to, a stakeout or other means employed in locating
the person to be served, unless those charges are successfully challenged by a
party to the action.
 
(C) When service
is by publication, the recoverable cost is the sum actually incurred in
effecting service.
 
(D) When service
is by a means other than that set forth in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the
recoverable cost is the lesser of the sum actually incurred, or the amount
allowed to a public officer in this state for that service, except that the
court may allow the sum actually incurred in effecting service upon application
pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (c).
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(4).)
 
Exhibit G evidences service of
process in the amount of (1) $259.98 for “Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) for

All invoices are provided by On-Call
Legal. There is no presentation as to whether On-Call Legal is a registered process
server. The Court takes judicial notice of On-Call Legal’s  status as a member of the California
Association of the California Association of Legal Support Professionals,
National Association of Professional Process Servers, and Serve-Now Network of
Process Servers under Cal. Evid. Code § 452(h) as a facts and/or proposition that
is not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy. (See
On-Call Legal Website (2024) <https://www.oncalllegal.com/service/process-server-los-angeles-ca>
[as of Jul. 18, 2024]; see also National Association of Professional Process
Servers, Los Angeles Location (2024) <https://napps.org/process-servers/California/Los%20Angeles>
[as of Jul. 18, 2024] [showing registered process servers with On-Call Legal
listed as their address].) The Court provides notice of this judicial notice in
order to give each adverse party sufficient notice of the request, through the
pleadings or otherwise, to enable such adverse party to prepare to meet the
request. (See Cal. Evid. Code § 453(a).) Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
the amount actually incurred in effecting service under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(4)(B). The amount incurred by Plaintiff as presented is $2,811.23. As
with the previous invoices, ambiguity exists as to the invoice marked as “PAID,”
with an adjustment/payment of “-199.99,” and a total due of $0.00. The Court
will inquire at the hearing.
 
At this time, the Court is
inclined to GRANT the Motion to Tax as to service of process fees in the amount
of $46.01.
 
   
iv.           
Court Reporter Fees (Item No. 11)
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(11) allows the recovery of court reporter fees as established by
statute. 
 
As Plaintiff pointed out, Cal.
Gov. Code § Cal. Gov. Code § 69948 discusses phonographic reporters appointed
by the superior court. (See Cal. Gov. Code § 69941.) Plaintiff’s cited case, Urban
Pacific Equities Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 688 (“Urban
Pacific Equities Corp.”) remains binding precedent and states:
 
Although the fees
charged by court-retained reporters are fixed by statute ( Gov. Code, § 69947,
69948, 69950), there is no statute regulating the fees charged by private
reporting firms, and deposition reporters are free to charge all the market
will bear.
 
(Urban Pacific Equities Corp.,
supra, 59 Cal.App.4th at 691-92.)
 
Exhibit H provides the bills for
Steno, the reporter service used during trial, for $900.00 for services on
March 25, 2024; $1,800.00 for March 26, 2024; $1,800.00 for March 27, 2024; and
$1,800.00 for March 29, 2024. The total amount is $6,300.00. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Tax as
to court reporter fees in DENIED.
 
     
v.           
Interpreter Fees (Item No. 13)
 
At a necessary deposition, “[f]ees
of a certified or registered interpreter for the deposition of a party or
witness who does not proficiently speak or understand the English language” are
recoverable. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(B).) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, John
Ksajikian, has declared that Camacho did not speak English. (See Decl. John
Ksajikian ¶ 7.) 
 
Exhibit I indicates that Access
Multilingual Services, Inc. was used for Camacho’s deposition and Plaintiff was
billed in the amount of $495.00. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact
that Access Multilingual Services, Inc. utilizes certified interpreters and
translators under Cal. Evid. Code § 452(h) as a facts and/or proposition that is
not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy. (See
Access Multilingual Services, Inc. Website <https://www.accessmultilingual.com/>
[as of Jul. 18, 2024].) The Court provides notice of this judicial notice in
order to give each adverse party sufficient notice of the request, through the
pleadings or otherwise, to enable such adverse party to prepare to meet the
request. (See Cal. Evid. Code § 453(a).) The Court has analyzed the necessity
of Camacho’s deposition, ante, and has determined that the deposition
was necessary. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of the certified
interpreter used at Camacho’s deposition in the amount of $495.00. 
 
The Motion to Tax as to
interpreter fees is DENIED.

“Postage, telephone, and
photocopying charges, except for exhibits” are not allowable as costs, except
when expressly authorized by law. The bill for the copy service does not states
it is located at “MLK Jr. O/P C…” (See Exh. J.) As the copying was not for
exhibits, it is not recoverable.
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(b)(4) states: “Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed
upon application may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.” 
As this is a personal injury
case, the medical records of Plaintiff were necessary for the conduct of the
litigation. 
 
The Court finds that the
subpoenas were necessary to this litigation and, as such, so too are the
associated costs. However, there are seven charges for rush service in the
amount of $25.00 each. There is no explanation as to why the rush service was
necessary or why the subpoenas could not have been requested earlier. The Court
does not allow the rush service costs.
 
The checks for $15.00 each do not
state for what purpose they were made other than the notation that they have to
do with Medical and Billing records. The Court inquires at the hearing. At this
time, the Court is not inclined to allow recovery of these items. 
 
While the Memorandum of Costs
states that the Uber trips were related to bringing Plaintiff to trial, there
is no explanation for how the prices vary from $9.85 to over $100.00. This is
especially concerning when Plaintiff is attempting to recover for a hotel as
well. It has not been presented as to why a hotel was reasonably necessary for
Plaintiff to attend trial. That is, there has been no presentation as to why
Plaintiff needed an Uber or a hotel to attend the hearing. The Complaint is
devoid of facts related to Plaintiff’s location. The Court’s only insight to
Plaintiff’s location is that Plaintiff was in Palmdale at that the time of the
alleged incident. The Court inquires at the hearing. At this time, the Court is
not inclined to allow recovery of either the Uber trips or the hotel.
 
As to the criminal search in the
amount of $1.00, no billing has been provided for this contested cost, so the
Court does not allow recovery of this item.
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Tax as
to other costs is GRANTED in the amount of $710.61, bringing the total costs of
other costs to $1,508.57.
