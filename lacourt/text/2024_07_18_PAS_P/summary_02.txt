And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is a response to a demurrer filed by Defendant Pablo Martinez to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Jesus Manuel Guerra. The case arises from a slip and fall incident on May 20, 2021, on property owned by Defendant Martinez. The Court has previously sustained a demurrer to the original complaint and Plaintiff has filed an amended complaint.

The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied, and that Plaintiff has appropriately explained the change in allegations of ownership from the original complaint to the FAC. The Court notes that Defendant Martinez's demurrer is based on the argument that the FAC contains inconsistent factual allegations, but that these allegations are sufficiently explained by the information obtained through discovery.

The Court overrules Defendant's demurrer and orders Defendant to answer the FAC within 15 days.
