 Case Number:  23AHCV01999    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFF JOHN CHICHESTER’S MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
ADMITTED; AWARDING SANCTIONS                        
I.         
INTRODUCTION
This personal injury case arises from a vehicle colliding with a
cyclist. Plaintiff John Chichester (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on January 24,
2023, at Grand Avenue and Madeline Drive in Pasadena, CA, Defendant Claudia
Maddox (“Defendant”)’s vehicle struck Plaintiff. On or about August 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a personal injury complaint against Defendant alleging general
negligence and motor vehicle negligence. 
On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant by U.S. mail with three
sets of written discovery including the contested Requests for Admission, Set
One, with a deadline to respond by December 12, 2023. (Declaration of Marc
Appell, ¶ 2, Exh. 1.)  
Defendant filed an answer on December 5, 2023. (Appell Decl., ¶ 4)
On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff emailed the discovery requests to Defendant’s
counsel, Kineta Flowers, Esq. (Id.; Exh. 2.) On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel granted Attorney Flowers’ requested extension to respond to discovery because
of Defendant's “mild cognitive impairment” with the mutual agreement that
objections were waived. (Id., ¶ 6.) On January 10, 2024, Attorney
Flowers informed Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant’s condition deteriorated,
rendering Defendant unable to verify responses to the delivery requests on her
own. (Id., ¶ 7; Exh. 5.) By January 12, 2024, Attorney Flowers requested
a second extension as she determined whether Defendant’s daughter and caretaker
could obtain power of attorney to verify responses on Defendant’s behalf. (Id.,
¶¶ 7-8; Exh. 7.) Attorney Flowers declares that she discussed Guardian Ad Litem
with Defendant’s daughter, and mistakenly believed that a Durable Power of
Attorney would authorize Defendant’s daughter to substitute Defendant’s
verification. (Declaration of Kineta Flowers, ¶ 4.) 
Attorney Flowers stated that she believed Defendant’s daughter
would be appointed Guardian Ad Litem by 2/12, and that verified responses would
follow on February 13, 2024. (Appell Decl., ¶ 11.) That was not the
case. Plaintiff informed Defendant that a failure to provide verified responses
by February 22, 2024, would necessitate motions to compel. (Motion, p. 4.) On
February 27, 2024, Defendant served unverified responses on Plaintiff. (Opp’n.,
p. 2.)
On February 27, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to deem
the RFAs admitted and requested $3,317.26 in sanctions. (Motion, p. 2)  
On July 5, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition declaring that the
February 27, 2024, responses substantially complied with CCP § 2033.220, given
that verifications will be served on Plaintiff upon the Court’s grant of an
order appointing Defendant’s daughter as Guardian Ad Litem. (Flowers Decl., ¶
4.) The Court granted the order
appointing Ms. Molinelli as Defendant’s Guardian Ad Litem on July 11, 2024.
(7/11/24 Minute Order.) Also, on July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
The Court is not aware of any further meet and confer efforts or any responses
on behalf of Defendant. A hearing on the motion to deem RFAs admitted is
scheduled for July 18, 2024. A jury trial is set for July 15, 2025.
                      
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A.   
Requests for Admission
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
(“Code Civ. Proc.”), section 2033.280(b), a “party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with section 2023.010).”  The
court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)
             Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared .... CCP § 2033.250(a).
The Civil Discovery Act places the burden on propounding party to
take affirmative steps in deeming RFAs admitted, and also allows responding
party to serve before the hearing on the motion a proposed response that is
substantial compliance with section 2033.220. (CCP §2033.280; see also St.
Mary v. Superior Ct. (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 762, 776.)
B.   
Mandatory
Sanctions – Deem RFAs Admitted
Sanctions are
mandatory “on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to request for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)
Furthermore,
regardless of the reason for the delay in responding, monetary sanctions are
mandatory against a party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response necessitated the filing of the deemed-admitted motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
 
                   
III.         
ANALYSIS
Having reviewed the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court
makes the following rulings.
A.   
Request to
Deem RFAs Admitted is Granted
Plaintiff filed the pending motion requesting the Court to order
the truth of any matters specified in the RFAs to be deemed admitted by Defendant.
Specifically, the RFAs served by Plaintiff on November 27, 2023, asked
Defendant to admit the following: 1) Defendant was at fault, 2) Plaintiff was
not comparatively negligent, 3) Plaintiff was injured, and 4) Plaintiff’s medical
expenses are reasonable. (Appell Decl., ¶ 2.) As discussed above, Defendant’s initial
deadline to serve timely responses expired on December 12, 2023. (Appell Decl.,
¶ 3.)  After much correspondence,
Defendant’s response deadline was extended to February 22, 2024. (Appel Decl.,
¶ 13; Exh. 10.) Defendant provided unverified responses on February 27, 2024,
pending a granted Guardian Ad Litem appointment of Defendant’s daughter.
(Flowers Decl., ¶ 4.) It is undisputed that Defendant failed to serve timely
RFA responses.
In opposition, Defendant moves the Court to deny Plaintiff’s
motion because the RFA responses had an “excusable delay since the
verifications must be signed by Defendant’s adult daughter due to her mental
incapacity.” (Opp’n., p. 1.) Defendant argues that the unverified responses
served prior to the hearing on the instant motion substantially comply with CCP
§ 2033.220. (Opp’n., p. 2.) 
Defendant did serve responses on
February 27, 2024, the same day Plaintiff’s motion was filed. Nevertheless, the
Court notes that Defendant’s responses were not substantially compliant with
C.C.P § 2033.280 because they were not verified. (Appleton v. Superior Court¿(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Given that the responses to deem RFAs
admitted were untimely and unverified, the Court grants Plaintiff’s order to
deem the RFAs, Set One, admitted.
B.   
Sanctions are
Granted in a Reduced Amount
            Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions for
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the motions.  Defendant failed to serve timely verified responses,
necessitating the filing of the motions. The Court finds that the appointment
of Defendant’s daughter as Guardian Ad Litem does not create circumstances that
make the imposition of mandatory sanctions unjust.
A court must impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response necessitated a motion for deemed admission. (CCP §§ 2023.010- 2023.040)
Under CCP § 2033.280, a responding party may only avoid sanctions under by
serving a sworn response complaint CCP § 2033.280, prior to the filing of a
motion for deemed admission. [California Practice Guide, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, § 8:1377.2] 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel, Marc J. Appell, Esq., declares he has been a member of the Bar in good
standing since 199. (Appel Decl., ¶ 15) Based on a reasonable hourly rate,
Attorney Appell requests $3,250.00, for the costs of filing the motion and
preparing an opposition and reply, plus $67.26 in filing fees. (Appell Decl., ¶
15.) Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the
circumstances including Defendants delay through providing verified responses,
the Court finds the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work Plaintiff’s counsel with the pending motion against
Defendant is $3,317.26 reflecting 4 hours incurred at $650 per hour (3.00 hours
drafting the motion, 1.00 hour drafting a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition, 1.00
hour for hearing attendance, and the $67.26 filing fee). (Id.) 
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $3,317.26.  
                    
IV.         
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
The Court reminds parties that civil discovery is intended to be a
self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention. (See Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Ct. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 331; Clement
v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1291-1292.) 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Request to Deem Admitted by Defendant
the truth of any matters specified in the Requests for Admissions (Set One).
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions against Defendant in the  amount of $3,317.62, payable within thirty
days of this ruling.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
