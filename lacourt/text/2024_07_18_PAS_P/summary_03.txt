And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury case arising from a vehicle collision with a cyclist. The plaintiff, John Chichester, filed a complaint against the defendant, Claudia Maddox, alleging general negligence and motor vehicle negligence. The defendant failed to serve timely and verified responses to the plaintiff's requests for admission, prompting the plaintiff to file a motion to deem the requests admitted.

The judge granted the plaintiff's motion, deeming the requests admitted, and awarded the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,317.26. The judge also reminded the parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.

The case will proceed to a jury trial on July 15, 2025.
