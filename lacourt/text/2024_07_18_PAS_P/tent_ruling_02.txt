 Case Number:  23AHCV01104    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT
PABLO MARTINEZ’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT                         
I.         
INTRODUCTION
            This negligence
action arises from a slip and fall incident on property located at 21 Palmetto
Drive in Alhambra, California.  Plaintiff
Jesus Manuel Guerra (“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant Pablo Martinez (“Defendant”)
owned the property, Defendant Palmetto Villas, Inc. (“Palmetto”) managed the
property and Defendant Complete Landscape & Gardening Services maintained
the property.  Plaintiff, a resident of 21
Palmetto Drive, Unit D, alleges that on May 20, 2021, he slipped and fell while
walking on a pathway at the locations’ entrance.  Plaintiff further alleges that a puddle of
water and/or accumulated algae cause this accident.
            On May 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed a personal injury complaint alleging causes of action for
(1) general negligence as to all three Defendants and (2) premises liability as
to Defendants Palmetto Villas, Inc. and Pablo Martinez. On September 27, 2023, Defendant
Martinez filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint because Plaintiff only
alleged that Defendant owned unit D, not the site where the slip and fall
occurred. On January 17, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer with
leave to amend. (1/17/24 Minute Order)
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
On March 4, 2024, Defendant Pablo
Martinez (“Defendant”) filed the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC pursuant
to CCP § 430.10, concurrently with notice and Declaration of John Fu, Esq., (“Fu
Decl.”).
            On July 5,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendant’s Demurrer with the
Declaration of Thomas R. Burns, Esq., (“Burns Decl.”) and attached exhibits.
            Plaintiff
has not filed a reply.
            A hearing
is scheduled for July 18, 2024.

LEGAL STANDARD
A.   
Demurrer
Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides
for a demurrer on the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action.
A demurrer admits, provisionally
for purposes of testing the pleading, all material facts properly pleaded. Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
1239, 1247.
A demurrer is treated as “admitting
all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions,
deductions or conclusions of law.” Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.
The general rule on demurrer is
that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.
Questions of plaintiff’s ability to
prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214.
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.  A plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as
true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable” they are. Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del
E. Webb). Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted
by judicially noticeable facts. Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474. 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc. §452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.
A demurrer challenges defects
appearing on the face of the complaint or in judicially noticeable material but
cannot be based on evidence. “Speaking demurrers” are not permitted. Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
§7.8.
Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(f) provides
for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain.
Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a
defendant cannot reasonably respond. A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.

ANALYSIS
A.   
Demurrer
On September 27, 2023, Defendant
filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that it was a “sham
pleading” because the original complaint did not identify Defendant as the
owner of the entire property. Plaintiff’s original complaint states that “Plaintiff
is informed and believes …  Defendant
PABLO MARTINEZ was and is … the owner of Unit D located on the
Premises.” (Compl., ¶ 3, emphasis added.) On January 17, 2024, the Court
sustained Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint with leave to amend. (1/17/24
Minute Order)  The operative FAC states that
“Plaintiff is informed and believes … 
Defendant PABLO MARTINEZ was and is … the owner of the Premises.”
(Compl., ¶ 3, emphasis added.) 
On February 27, 2024, Defendant and
Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred on the issue of Defendant’s ownership
interest of the premises and did not reach a resolution, necessitating the
instant motion. (Fu Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A; Motion, p. 5.) Based upon this, the
Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.  
On March 4, 2024, Defendant filed
another Demurrer, moving the Court to sustain the demurrer based on the
argument that Plaintiff’s original and amended complaints contain inconsistent factual
allegations.  Defendant’s position is
that the FAC attempts “to plead around the defect and therefore amounts to a
‘sham’ pleading”. (Motion, p. 3.)  Defendant
argues that when a plaintiff attempts to circumvent factual problems by pleading
new inconsistent facts in an amended complaint, the plaintiff must provide explain
why such a drastic change has occurred. If Plaintiff is unable to do so, the
new pleading will be treated as a “sham” and be disregarded.”  (Del E. Webh Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App.3d 593, 604; Owens v. Kings Supermarket (1988)
198 Cal. App.3d 379, 384; and Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 13,
cited by 6 Cal. Prac. Guide, Civ. Proc. Bef-Trial, Sec. 7:48.)
Plaintiff asks the Court to overrule
the demurrer because the sham pleading doctrine is inapplicable when the facts
change due to information obtained in discovery. (Opp’n., p. 2.) Plaintiff
argues that the sham pleading doctrine is inapplicable because Co-Defendant
Palmetto provided new information during discovery to support Plaintiff’s
amended allegation that Defendant Martinez owns the entire property, including
the incident location. (FAC, ¶¶ 18, 24.)
Pursuant to the sham pleading
doctrine, “any inconsistencies with prior pleadings must be explained; if the
pleader fails to do so, the court may disregard the inconsistent allegations.”
(Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
336, 343.) Courts will not close their eyes to situations where a complaint
contains allegations of fact inconsistent with attached documents, or
allegations contrary to facts that are judicially noticed.” (Hoffman v.
Smithwoods RV Park, LLC (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 390, 400.)
Given the information obtained through
discovery, the Court finds that Plaintiff has appropriately explained the
change in the allegations of ownership from the original complaint to the
FAC.  On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Palmetto.  On October 30, 2023, Palmetto timely responded
to the Special Interrogatories as follows:
Special Interrogatory No. 1:
IDENTIFY the PERSON who owed the PREMISES at the time of the INCIDENT.
Response to Special
Interrogatory No. 1: Responding Party identifies Pablo Martinez
(solo_raiders@hotmail.com) as the owner of the premises where Plaintiff was a
tenant. Discovery and investigation is ongoing and continuing, and Responding
Party reserves the right to amend this response up to and including the time of
trial.
 
Special Interrogatory No. 2:
IDENTIFY the PERSON who leased the PREMISES at the time of the INCIDENT.
Response to Special
Interrogatory No. 2: Responding Party identifies Pablo Martinez
(solo_raiders@hotmail.com) as the owner of the premises where Plaintiff was a
tenant. Discovery and investigation is ongoing and continuing, and Responding
Party reserves the right to amend this response up to and including the time of
trial.
 
Special Interrogatory No. 4:
IDENTIFY the PERSON who controlled the PREMISES at the time of the
INCIDENT.
Response to Special
Interrogatory No. 4: Responding Party identifies Pablo Martinez
(solo_raiders@hotmail.com) as the owner of the premises where Plaintiff was a
tenant. Discovery and investigation is ongoing and continuing, and Responding
Party reserves the right to amend this response up to and including the time of
trial.
 
Special Interrogatory No. 6:
IDENTIFY the PERSON who owned the LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT at the time of
the INCIDENT.
Response to Special
Interrogatory No. 2: Responding Party identifies Pablo Martinez
(solo_raiders@hotmail.com) as the owner of the premises where Plaintiff was a
tenant. Discovery and investigation is ongoing and continuing, and Responding
Party reserves the right to amend this response up to and including the time of
trial.
(Opp’n., Exh. B, pp. 2-3.)
Plaintiff did not possess this
information at the time he filed his original complaint.  Plaintiff received this information on October
30, 2023. After the Court sustained Defendant Martinez’s demurrer to the
original complaint, Plaintiff relied on this information when filing the
FAC.  Therefore, the inconsistent facts
between the initial complaint and the FAC are sufficiently explained to bypass
an application of the sham pleading doctrine.  
            Therefore,
the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC.
 
IV.       ORDER
            
Defendant Martinez’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
Defendant to answer within 15 days.
Counsel for Plaintiff to give
notice of this order.
