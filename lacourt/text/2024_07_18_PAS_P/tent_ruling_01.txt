  Case Number:  21GDCV00974    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S  MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT                                     I.           INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs Futang Ji, Fan-Ling Wen,  Yi-Ching Wu, Mingde Zheng, and Yong Zong (together “Plaintiffs”) are five  foreign EB-5 investors who each invested $500,000 for the purpose of expanding  a senior living facility in Punta Gorda, Florida. The initial complaint was  filed on July 27, 2021, the First Amended Complaint was filed on January 11,  2022, the Second Amended Complaint was filed on September 8, 2022, and the  Third Amended Complaint was filed on April 20, 2023. The Third Amended Complaint asserts nine causes  of action for (1) breach of third-party beneficiary contract, (2) intentional  misrepresentation, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) conspiracy to convert  property, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6) violation of the Cal. Bus. &  Prof. Code §17200, (7) unjust enrichment, (8) conspiracy to commit fraud, and  (9) accounting against Defendants Punta Gorda Acquisitions, LLC  (“Acquisitions”), Punta Gorda Senior Living, LP dba The Palms of Punta Gorda  Assisted Living (“Senior Living”), Madison Realty Equities, LLC (“Equities”),  GT Madison Realty, LLC (“GT Madison”), Gary Langendoen (“Langendoen”), and DOES  1 through 50 (together “Defendants”).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants  misappropriated their investments, which has resulted in a total loss of each  of their $500,000 investments.    Plaintiffs now move to for leave to file a  Fourth Amended Complaint. No opposition has been filed. The hearing for the instant matter is set  for July 18, 2024, and a trial is scheduled for September 24, 2024.                                      II.           LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1),  “[t]he court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper,  allow a party to amend any pleading.”   Amendment may be allowed at any time before or after commencement of  trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be  exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring  amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend  can be justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal citations omitted).) “If  the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not  prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend….”  (Morgan v. Sup. Ct.  (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of  critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)  A motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the  proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to  differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court,  rule 3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations are proposed to be  deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)  Finally, a separate supporting declaration specifying the effect of the amendment,  why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the  amended allegations were discovered, and the reason the request for amendment  was not made earlier must also accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.134(b).)               III.           DISCUSSION On June 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for leave to file  a Fourth Amendment Complaint, concurrently with a proposed order and proposed  Fourth Amended Complaint (See Motion, Exh. 7.) The Court notes that Plaintiff  failed to attach a proposed order and failed to file the required separate  supporting declaration that specifies the amendment’s effect, why it is necessary  and proper, when the facts supporting the amended allegations were discovered,  and why the request was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) The  court notes that Plaintiffs both stated what allegations are proposed to be  added by page, paragraph, and line number in the motion and attached a  red-lined version of the Fourth Amended Complaint showing what allegations are  proposed to be added (and what allegations have been deleted). (Motion, p. 5,  Exh. 6.)  Given that the supporting declaration and proposed order were not  concurrently filed, the motion, as filed, is not procedurally sound. However,  the Court makes a determination on the merits of the unopposed motion.  Plaintiffs seek leave to amend their Complaint  to add a tenth cause of action for fraudulent conveyance and aiding and  abetting fraudulent transfer against three new defendants: Grandtag Business Consultants,  Ltd. (“Grandtag”), Jameson Leung (“Jameson”), and Rene Leung (“Rene”). The new  defendants are the owners and managers of Defendant GT Madison Realty, LLC (“GT  Madison”). Plaintiffs filed the instant action on July 27, 2021, and allege that proposed  Defendant Grandtag has been the sole manager of Defendant GT Madison,  responsible for its daily operations since August 11, 2020. (Motion, p. 4, Exh.  3.) Through discovery that occurred at the end of 2023, Plaintiffs learned that  Defendant Punta Gorda Senior Living assisted care facility was sold to several  purchasers including proposed Defendant Rene, as manager of GT Madison Realty,  LLC. (Motion, p. 4, Exh. 4.) In January 2024, Plaintiffs learned that Defendant  GT Madison was owned by Grandtag, and that Jameson and Rene were Grandtag’s CEO  and President, respectively. (Motion, p. 4.) Given the discovery of these new  defendants, the Court finds that no prejudice existS to warrant denial of leave  to amend. Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to  amend is GRANTED.   Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.    Dated:  July 18, 2024                                                                                                   JARED  D. MOSES   JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT [TENTATIVE]  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S  FIRST SET OF REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; AND AWARDING MONETARY  SANCTIONS IN THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF $2,810.00                          I.           INTRODUCTION            Plaintiffs  Futang Ji, Fan-Ling Wen, Yi-Ching Wu, Mingde Zheng, and Yong Zong (together  “Plaintiffs”) are five foreign EB-5 investors who each invested $500,000 for  the purpose of expanding a senior living facility in Punta Gorda, Florida. The  initial complaint was filed on July 27, 2021, the First Amended Complaint was  filed on January 11, 2022, the Second Amended Complaint was filed on September  8, 2022, and the Third Amended Complaint was filed on April 20, 2023.The Third Amended Complaint asserts  nine causes of action for (1) breach of third-party beneficiary contract, (2)  intentional misrepresentation, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) conspiracy  to convert property, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6) violation of the Cal.  Bus. & Prof. Code §17200, (7) unjust enrichment, (8) conspiracy to commit  fraud, and (9) accounting against Defendants Punta Gorda Senior Living, LP dba  The Palms of Punta Gorda Assisted Living (“Defendant”), Punta Gorda  Acquisitions, LLC (“Acquisitions”), Madison Realty Equities, LLC (“Equities”),  GT Madison Realty, LLC (“GT Madison”), Gary Langendoen (“Langendoen”), and DOES  1 through 50 (together “Defendants”).   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misappropriated their investments,  which has resulted in a total loss of each of their $500,000 investments.   On October 2, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded  their “First Set of Requests for Production” on Defendant Punta Gorda Senior  Living, LP dba The Palms of Punta Gorda Assisted Living, including Requests for  Production of Documents, Set One. The deadline to respond to the request for  responses was mutually extended by the parties until January 29, 2024.Before the Court is a Motion to  Compel Further Discovery Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of  Documents, filed on January 26, 2024. Plaintiff also requested sanctions of $8,310.00  be imposed against Defendant and their counsel. As of July 17, 2024, no  opposition has been filed.  A trial date  is scheduled for September 24, 2024.            The Court is unaware any subsequent further meet and confer efforts  that may have occurred since the motion was filed. Having reviewed the  moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court makes the following rulings.                                     II.           ANALYSISA.     Motion to Compel Further Production of DocumentsUnder  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, parties may move for a further  response to requests for production of documents where a statement of  compliance with the demand is incomplete, a representation of inability to  comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or where an objection is without  merit or too general.¿¿ Notice of  the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,  otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further  response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motion must also be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,  subd. (b).)¿¿¿ Finally,  Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses  involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each  request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for  compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd.  (a)(3).)¿¿¿On October 2, 2023, Plaintiffs  served Requests for Production of Documents on Defendant. Plaintiffs move the  Court issue an order compelling Defendant to produce responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests  for Production of Documents, Set One. The deadline to respond was initially extended  to November 16, 2023, and again extended to January 29, 2023. (Declaration of  Keren E. Gesund (“Gesund Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-3, 13; Exhs. 1-2.) On November 16, 2023,  Defendant served responses which Plaintiffs argue are not substantive, and  feature boilerplate objections. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel sought to meet and confer over the phone on  November 21, 2023. (Id. ¶¶ 7, 8, Exh. 4.) On November 30,  Plaintiff’s counsel delivered a meet and confer letter. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 10,  Exh. 5.). After Defendant sought new counsel, the parties extended the deadline  to compel further responses to January 29, 2024. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 11-13, Exh.  6.)The motion is not timely as it was filed on January 26, 2024, making  the statutory deadline to file this motion on December 31, 2023. The  parties exchanged meet and confer correspondence following receipt of  Defendant’s supplement responses, and set January 29, 2024 as the date the  motion would be filed if Defendant failed to provide supplemental responses.  The meet and confer requirement is fulfilled. The motion is procedurally sound  as it is also accompanied by a separate statement and supporting declaration.Despite any procedural  deficiencies, the Court will consider the motion on its merits. Plaintiff brings  this motion to compel Defendant to provide further responses to Request for Production  of Documents. It is undisputed that Plaintiff seeks production of financial  records of the incident in connection with these discovery requests. Defendant served objections as to  Production of Documents Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 on the grounds that the  information was confidential as to Defendant GTM. Plaintiff argues that the  objection is improper and sanctionable because a protective order was entered on  November 14, 2023, two days prior to Defendant’s responses. (Motion, p. 5.) The  Court agrees.  Defendant must comply by  providing code compliant responses to the foregoing request within 30 days of  this order. B.     Sanctions  Code of  Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to  impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which  includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without  substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an  evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial  justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.   (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.) If  sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that  the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought  and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points  and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the  amount of any monetary sanction.   With  regard to a motion to compel further responses to requests for production,  Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.310, subdivision (h) provides that  sanctions shall be awarded against any party, person or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless  the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions  unjust. Plaintiffs request the court to  impose a monetary sanction of $8,310.00 on Defendant and/or their counsel for Defendant’s  alleged failure to prove the requested documents. (Motion, p. 5.) Plaintiffs’  Counsel, Keren E. Gesund, Esq., an associate of the Law Offices of Robert V.  Cornish, Jr., P.C., states that $2,810.00 were incurred in preparing this  motion based on her hourly billing rate of $275.00 as applied to 10 hours to  prepare this motion and the $60 filing fee. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 15.).  Plaintiffs’ counsel anticipated an additional  10 hours in preparing a reply. Considering the motion is unopposed, Plaintiffs have  not expended this amount. Plaintiffs were justified in  bringing the motions. Defendant failed to successfully oppose the motions and  sanctions are therefore mandatory. The Court agrees that the supplemental  responses are too broad, would contain irrelevant information, and pose an  undue burden on Plaintiffs to produce documents that show Plaintiff’s capacity  following the alleged incident, communications between the parties, and wage  information to support Plaintiff’s prayer for relief.Plaintiffs request sanctions in the  amount of $2,810.00. Each Defendant and Defendant’s counsel are ORDERED,  jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $2,810.00 to Plaintiffs within 30  days of today’s date. IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER      Defendant is ordered to provide code compliant responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents and pay $2,800.10 in sanctions within 30 days of this order.      Moving party to give notice.          Dated:  July 18, 2024                                     JARED D. MOSESJUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT [TENTATIVE]  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S  FIRST SET OF SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES; AND GRANTING REQUEST FOR MONETARY  SANCTIONS IN THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF $2,810.00                          I.           INTRODUCTION            Plaintiffs  Futang Ji, Fan-Ling Wen, Yi-Ching Wu, Mingde Zheng, and Yong Zong (together  “Plaintiffs”) are five foreign EB-5 investors who each invested $500,000 for  the purpose of expanding a senior living facility in Punta Gorda, Florida.

Plaintiff also requested sanctions of $8,310.00  be imposed against Defendant and their counsel. As of July 17, 2024, no  opposition has been filed. A trial date is scheduled for September 24, 2024. The Court is unaware of any subsequent further meet and confer efforts  that may have occurred since the motion was filed. Having reviewed the  moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court makes the following rulings.                                     II.           ANALYSISA.     Procedural Matters45-Day RuleThis motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response in question  (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP §1013);  otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further response  to the CCP §2031.010 demand.  CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber  v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit  is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)  58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in writing  on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP  §2031.310(c).  Meet-and-Confer  Requirement The  motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a declaration showing  “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court  (so-called “meet and confer”).  CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2). Separate  Statement Any motion involving the content of a  discovery request or the responses to such a request shall be accompanied by a  separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further responses to  demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule  3.1020(a)(3).   On October 2, 2023, Plaintiffs  served Special Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Production, Set One, and  Request for Admission, Set One on Defendant. Plaintiff moves the Court to issue  an order compelling Defendant to produce further responses to Plaintiff’s Special  Interrogatories, Set One. The deadline to respond was initially extended to  November 16, 2023, and again extended to January 29, 2023. (Declaration of  Keren E. Gesund (“Gesund Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-3, 13; Exhs. 1-2.) On November 16, 2023,  Defendant served responses which Plaintiff argues are not substantive and  feature boilerplate objections. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel sought to meet and confer over the phone on  November 21, 2023. (Id. ¶¶ 7, 8, Exh. 4.) On November 30, Plaintiff’s  counsel delivered a meet and confer letter. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 10, Exh. 5.).  After Defendant sought new counsel, the parties extended the deadline to compel  further responses to January 29, 2024. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 11-13, Exh. 6.)The motion is not timely as it was filed on January 26, 2024, and  forty-seven days after service of Defendant’s supplemental response is December  31, 2023. The parties exchanged meet and confer correspondence following  receipt of Defendant’s supplement responses, and set January 29, 2024 as the  date the motion would be filed if Defendant failed to provide supplemental  responses. The meet and confer requirement is fulfilled. The motion is  accompanied by a separate statement and supporting declaration.Despite the procedural  deficiencies, the Court will consider the motion on its merits.B.     Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – Special Under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.300, a court may order a party to serve a further response to  interrogatories when the court finds that any of the following apply: 1.      An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 2.      An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is  unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 3.      An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.  Under Civil Procedure Code 2030.22(a) and (b), a  responding party’s answer to interrogatories must be “as complete and  straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party  permits. If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be  answered to the extent possible.” It is improper for an answer to only respond  to a portion of the information sought, particularly when an interrogatory is  specific and explicit. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,  783.)  Plaintiff moves the Court issue an  order compelling Defendant to produce further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,  Set One.  The Court finds that the lack of direct facts in Defendant’s  supplemental responses to these interrogatories is delaying discovery by  failing to address the key questions in determining the outcome of the case.            The Court agrees that Plaintiff is  entitled to supplemental responses 45 days after receipt of these provided  responses. Thus, Defendant must comply by providing code compliant responses to  the foregoing requests without further delay or prejudice to Plaintiff. The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion compelling Defendant to provide code complaint responses to  the special interrogatories, set one, within 30 days of this order.C.    Sanctions Code of Civil Procedure section  2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery  sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without  limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,  an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to  discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or  opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.   (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.) If sanctions are sought, Code of  Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity  of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction  requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the  facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary  sanction.   Plaintiff requests that the court impose  a monetary sanction of $8,310.00 on Defendant and/or their counsel for Defendant’s  failure to provide code complaint responses to the special  interrogatories.  (Motion, p. 5.) Plaintiff’s  Counsel, Keren E. Gesund, Esq., an associate of the Law Offices of Robert V.  Cornish, Jr., P.C., states that expenses of $2,810.00 were incurred in  preparing this motion based on her hourly billing rate of $275.00 as applied to  10 hours to prepare this motion and the $60 filing fee. (Gesund Decl., ¶ 15.).  Plaintiff’s counsel anticipated an additional  10 hours in preparing a reply. Considering the motion is unopposed, Plaintiff  has not expended this amount. Plaintiff was justified in bringing  the motions. Defendant failed to successfully oppose the motions and sanctions  are therefore mandatory. Defendant Punta Gorda Senior Living LP is ORDERED to  pay sanctions of $2,810.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days of today’s date.                III.         CONCLUSION AND ORDER   Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff's Special Interrogatories, Set One, and pay $2,810.00 in sanctions within 30 days of this order.   Moving party to give notice.            Dated:  July 18, 2024                                     JARED D.
