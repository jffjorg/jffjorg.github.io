Summary in English text:

The judge has written a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement was entered into on December 23, 2022, and provides for the distribution of funds to the defendant, Khalil Brian Zaghian. The defendant is seeking a judgment of $2,792,773.00, plus attorneys' fees and costs of $4,749.50. However, the plaintiff, Awilda Gisselle Hernandez, and Glamlite, Inc., argue that the defendant is not owed any further payments under the terms of the settlement agreement. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the settlement agreement provides for the distribution of funds to the defendant based on the spreadsheet attached to the agreement, and that the defendant is owed nothing further. The judge has also ordered the defendant to comply with the outstanding terms of the settlement agreement, including the transfer of shares.
