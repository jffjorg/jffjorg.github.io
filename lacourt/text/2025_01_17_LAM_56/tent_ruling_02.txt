[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Date: January 17, 2025
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District
(“Defendant” or “LAUSD”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Bessie Riley (“Plaintiff”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff filed this revival action under Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 340.1 on September 9, 2022 seeking damages
for childhood sexual abuse allegedly committed between 1972 and 9173 by a named
employee of the school district where Plaintiff was a student at the time. The
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges causes of action for: (1) negligence
as to LAUSD; (2) negligence as to Does 2 through 25; (3) negligent hiring,
retention and supervision as to LAUSD; and (4) negligent hiring, retention and
supervision as to Does 2 through 25. 
 
            On May 10, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion for summary judgment (the “Motion”). On November 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition (the “Opposition”). On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed a
reply (the “Reply”).            
 
DISCUSSION
            A motion for summary judgment shall
be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as
to any material fact for trial or that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law. (CCP, § 437c, subd. (c).) 
 
The moving party bears the initial burden
of production to make a prima facie showing that no triable issue of material
fact exists. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
850.) To meet this burden, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does
not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff cannot
reasonably obtain needed evidence.”¿(Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out
the absence of evidence.¿(Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884,
891.)¿The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot
reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿(Id.)¿The
supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿(Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.) 
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on
allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿“If
the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”¿(Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463,
467.)  
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court
must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a
factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence.¿While viewing the evidence
in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to
identify issues rather than to determine issues.¿[Citation.]¿Only when the
inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of
law.¿ If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by
trial.”¿(Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832,
839.)¿Further, “the trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a
factfinder to determine whose version is more likely true.¿[Citation.]¿Nor may
the trial court grant summary judgment based on the court’s evaluation of
credibility. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 840; see also Weiss v. People ex
rel. Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts
deciding motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the
evidence but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing
party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
claims fail because the perpetrator Plaintiff names in her FAC was not employed
at the school until six years after the alleged abuse occurred. In the FAC,
Plaintiff alleges that she was abused by Mark Berndt (“Berndt”) at Miramonte Elementary
School between 1972 and 1973. (FAC ¶¶ 7, 33.) Defendant asserts, however, that Berndt
did not work at Miramonte Elementary School until 1979. (UMF Nos. 3-5; Frohwein
Decl., ¶ 4). Thus, Defendant has met its prima facie burden of production to
show that no triable issue of material fact exists. The burden thus shifts to
Plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact does exist.
 
            In the Opposition, Plaintiff
concedes that although she names Berndt in the FAC as the perpetrator, she was
not abused by Berndt. (Opp. p. 1:7-9.) Plaintiff argues instead that between
1971 and 1973, she was abused by Gerald Shaia (“Shaia”) while she was a student
in Shaia’s class. (PUMF Nos. 2-3; Riley Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff argues that although
she inadvertently named the wrong perpetrator in the FAC, the FAC provided
Defendant with notice that she was sexually abused in approximately 1972 to
1973, that Defendant had enough information to identify the perpetrator and
that the mistaken identity does not go the nature of the claim. (Opp. p.
4:6-15.) 
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
not met her burden to show that there are triable issues of material fact. In
the FAC, Plaintiff specifically alleges that she was abused by Berndt. There is
no reference to Shaia or question as to the identity of the abuser. The
allegations contained in a plaintiff’s complaint constitute judicial admissions
and thus are “conclusive concessions of the truth of a matter.” (Castillo v.
Barrera, (2007) 146 Cal. App. 4th 1317, 1324; see also Kurinij v.
Hanna & Morton (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 853, 871 [judicial
admissions in a complaint overcome evidence even if the opposing party seeks to
contradict the prior admission.].) “‘While inconsistent theories of
recovery are permitted [citation], a pleader cannot blow hot and cold as to the
facts positively stated.’” (Brown v. City of Fremont (1977) 75
Cal.App.3d 141, 146.) Thus, even construing the papers in the light most
favorable to the non-moving party, as the Court must, Plaintiff’s statement in
her declaration that she was abused by a different party than the one named in
the FAC does not raise a triable issue of fact as to the allegations contained
in the operative FAC. 
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
