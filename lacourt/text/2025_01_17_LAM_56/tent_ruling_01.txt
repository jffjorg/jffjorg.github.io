MOVING PARTY:  Defendant/Cross-Complainant Khalil Brian

Awilda Gisselle Hernandez and Glamlite, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving,

BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of the deterioration of
a personal and professional relationship. On April 4, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
the complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendant alleging causes of
action for: (1) civil theft; (2) conversion; (3) tortious interference with contractual
relations; (4) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage; (5)
breach of fiduciary duty; (6) unfair competition; (7) accounting; (8)
constructive trust; (9) identity theft; (10) invasion of privacy; (11)
declaratory relief; and (12) temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction and permanent injunction.
 
            On May 6, 2022, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint (the “Cross-Complaint”) alleging causes of action for: (1)
declaratory relief; (2) summary judgment pursuant to California Corporations
Code section 709; (3) abuse of process; (4) breach of oral contract; (5) breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) breach of fiduciary
duty; (7) wrongful termination; (8) conversion; (9) common count for claim and
delivery; (10) constructive trust and unjust enrichment; (11) common count for
money had and received; (12) accounting; (13) violation of computer fraud and
abuse act; (14) fraud: concealment; (15) libel per se; (16) slander per se;
(17) intentional interference with prospective economic relations; (18)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (19) a TRO, preliminary
injunction and permanent injunction. 
 
            On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to enforce settlement agreement (the “Motion”). On January
6, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an opposition (the “Opposition”) and on January 10,
2025, Defendant filed a reply (the “Reply”). 
 
DISCUSSION
            “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.” (Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 664.6, subd. (a).) 
 
            Defendant asserts that pursuant to
the settlement agreement entered between the parties on December 23, 2022 (the
“Settlement Agreement”), he is entitled to a judgment of $2,792,773.00, plus
attorneys’ fees and costs of $4,749.50, for a total amount of $2,797,522.50.
(Mot. p. 4.) In the Opposition, Plaintiffs assert that pursuant to sections 1
and 3(c) of the Settlement Agreement, Defendant is not owed any further
payments. (Opp. pp. 4:1-5:13.) 
 
            In relevant part, the Settlement
Agreement states as follows: “The distributions in the amount of $63,259.00
taken by Zaghian during the calendar year of 2022 shall be credited toward the
Distributions payment contemplated herein. In the event that Hernandez’s
distribution for the year 2022 is less than or equal to $63,259.00, the
Distribution to Zaghian shall be $0.00, but Zaghian will not be responsible for
the repayment of the difference. In the event that Hernandez’s distribution for
the year 2022 is greater than $63,259.00, the Distribution to Zaghian shall be
equal to Hernandez’s distribution less $63,259.00.” (Mot. Ex. 1, [Settlement
Agreement] ¶ 1.) 
 
            “Distributions are to be determined
by Spreadsheet A attached covering the period of April 2022 through October
2022 and from review and analysis of financial records by Matthew Taylor and/or
a mutually-agreeable neutral third party accounting professional for the
remaining period of calendar year 2022. Any monies on deposit in Bank of
America account number ending in 0612 (“Personal 0612”) held on behalf of
Glamlite and not transferred into Bank of America account number ending in 8474
(“Corporate 8474”) by the close of business on October 26, 2022 are deemed
Distributions to Hernandez for purposes of determining the amount of
Distributions that Hernandez took in year 2022 so that Zaghian is paid an equal
amount as stated in provision 1 hereinabove. The intent is to prevent Hernandez
from transferring corporate funds on deposit in Personal 0612 to Corporate 8474
after execution of this Agreement and claim that Distributions were not made to
Hernandez. The amount of Distributions is to be determined within 120 days from
the date of execution of this Agreement and Glamlite will be responsible for
full payment of such accounting. Hernandez must cooperate in good faith to have
the accounting completed within 120 days. In the event the current accountant,
Jennifer Bohorquez, is unable to complete the accounting within the 120 days
period, the Parties agree to hire a mutually selected neutral third party
accountant. The reason the accounting is necessary is to complete the analysis
to determine if Hernandez took any distributions in year 2022. Payment of
Distributions are to commence no later than the 15th of September 2024.” (Mot.
Ex. 1, [Settlement Agreement] ¶ 3(c).) 
 
            Thus, the parties agreed that the
distributions would be calculated pursuant to the spreadsheet attached to the Settlement
Agreement and the accounting conducted by Jennifer Bohorquez (“Ms. Bohorquez”),
and that if the distribution was less than $63,259.00, the distribution to Defendant
would be be $0.00. Ms. Bohorquez concluded that the distribution to Defendant
was $57,703.81. (Opp. Ex. A.) Accordingly, Defendant is owed nothing further
under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement does not
provide for the Defendant to seek an alternative accounting if he is
dissatisfied with the results of the accounting performed by the agreed-upon
professionals. Thus, the Motion, and accompanying request for attorneys’ fees,
is DENIED. Defendant is ordered to comply with any outstanding terms of the
Settlement Agreement, including the transfer of shares as stated in section 5
of the Settlement Agreement. 
 
            Defendant’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement is DENIED. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 17th day of January 2025
