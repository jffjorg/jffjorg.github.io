[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO TAX COSTS

MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Scarlett Benchley (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
SRC Entertainment, LLC dba Nightingale Plaza (“Defendant”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arose from an incident
that allegedly occurred while Plaintiff was a patron at a nightclub owned and
operated by Defendant. The third amended complaint (the “TAC”) alleged: (1)
battery; (2) assault; (3) false imprisonment; (4) negligence; (5) negligent
supervision; and (6) premises liability. 
 
The
action was tried in June 2024. On July 1, 2024, the jury rendered a verdict in
favor of Defendant on all causes of action. On July 30, 2024, the Court signed
and entered judgment and on July 31, 2024, Defendant noticed entry of judgment on
the parties. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Allowable costs under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and
must be reasonable in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Section
1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable
in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e.,
reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). If the items appearing in a
cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) 
 
Moreover,
a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) A party seeking to
tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima facie showing. (Jones v.
Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266, superseded by statute on other
grounds].) Mere statements unsupported by facts are insufficient to rebut the
prima facie showing that costs were necessarily incurred. (Id.)¿On the
other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and
the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) 
 
Whether
a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of
fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
(Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) Because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute, a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized. (Id.) Discretion is abused only when, in its
exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances
being considered.” (Lincoln v. Schurgin (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 100, 105.)¿ 
 
Timeliness
After
judgment is entered, the prevailing party “who claims costs must serve and file
a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment,
whichever is first.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a).)
 
In
this case, notice of entry of judgment was served on July 31, 2024. On August
15, 2024, Defendant timely filed a Memorandum of Costs. Plaintiff subsequently filed
the instant motion to tax costs. Then, on September 12, 2024, Defendant filed
an Amended Memorandum of Costs. Defendant relies on Pointe San Diego
Residential Community, L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP
(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 265, to support its position that the Amended Memorandum
should be considered because it ‘relates back’ to the initial Memorandum of
Costs. However, that decision is not instructive in this case. In Pointe San
Diego Residential Community, the Court of Appeals only discussed the
relation-back doctrine as it applies to an amended complaint, not an amended
memorandum of costs. (Pointe San Diego Residential Community, L.P. v.
Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 265, 276-283.)
Furthermore, Defendant has failed to provide any explanation as to why the additional
$84,966.96 in costs sought in the Amended Memorandum of Costs were not known or
available at the time the initial Memorandum of Costs was filed. Therefore, because
the Amended Memorandum was not timely filed, it will not be considered in
connection with this motion.  
 
Item No. 12, Models,
enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits
            Plaintiff challenges $1,526.35 of
Defendant’s costs for hotel, parking, and electric vehicle reimbursement to
Litigation Support Professionals as not reasonably necessary because Defendant
could have selected a local litigation support company that would not have
incurred such expenses. (Mot. p. 3:12-19.) In the opposition, Defendant argues
that the cost was reasonably incurred because Litigation Support Professionals
is their preferred and trusted company, and since the company is located in
Riverside, a daily commute to the courthouse would be impractical. (Opp. p.
3:20-28.) 
 
Upon
review, the $1,526.35 for lodging and travel reimbursement were costs incurred
for trial litigation support. (Memo. of Costs, No. 12; Invoice 5631.) However,
the Memorandum of Costs includes this expense in the $12,747.60 noted under
Item 12 for “Models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits.”  Defendant does not provide any invoices that
indicate $12,747.60 was spent on models, enlargements, or exhibits.  Thus, because there is no backup to support the
cost for its stated purpose, the Court taxes the entire amount. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in the total amount of $12,747.60.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
