And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has considered the motion to tax costs filed by the defendant, SBE aka SBEEG HOLDINGS LICENSING, LLC dba Nightingale Plaza, and opposes the motion filed by the plaintiff, Scarlett Benchley. The defendant seeks to recover costs incurred during the trial, including hotel, parking, and electric vehicle reimbursement for its litigation support professionals. The plaintiff challenges these costs, arguing that they were not reasonably necessary.

The Judge finds that the costs incurred by the defendant were not reasonably necessary, as the professional services of Litigation Support Professionals were not essential to the trial. The Judge also finds that the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims of costs, and that the additional $84,966.96 in costs sought in the Amended Memorandum of Costs were not timely filed.

As a result, the Judge grants the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the total amount of $12,747.60. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
