and Victoria Lerman           
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Plaintiffs DB Maple Avenue LLC and Behrouz

Motion to Continue Trial and Related Pre-Trial Dates
The court
considered the moving, limited opposition, and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants 450 Maple Condominiums Owners Association, LB Property
Management, Inc., Pamela Maxwell, Susan Yeung, and Victoria Lerman
(“Defendants”) move the court for an order continuing trial and all related pre-trial
dates in this action, filed by plaintiffs DB Maple Avenue LLC and Behrouz
Yadegar (“Plaintiffs”), from July 24, 2024 to January 27, 2025, or a later date
convenient to the court’s calendar. 
Defendants move for this relief on the ground that (1) new counsel
substituted in to represent Defendants on March 12, 2024, and (2) Defendants
have been unable to obtain essential discovery despite diligent efforts to do
so.
The court finds that Defendants have not met their burden to make an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance of trial.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subd. (c).) 
First, although the court acknowledges that Defendants retained new
counsel on March 12, 2024, Defendants have not shown that this substitution
requires a trial continuance since counsel (1) was retained a little over four
months before the July 24, 2024 trial date, and (2) did not state, in her
declaration, that she requires additional time to become familiar with the
facts of this case or that counsel is otherwise unable to represent Defendants
due to this substitution.  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1332, subd. (c)(4); Vinje Decl., ¶ 3.)
Second, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that they have
been unable to obtain discovery from Plaintiff “despite diligent efforts” to do
so.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332,
subd. (c)(6).)  Specifically, Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s discovery responses were deficient and therefore required
Defendants to file motions to compel as to those responses, but Plaintiff
served the subject discovery responses on July 2, 2021, and Defendants filed
motions to compel nearly three years later, in May 2024.  Moreover, defendant Pamela Maxwell served
written discovery on Plaintiff on April 30, 2024, only three months before
trial.  (Vinje Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Vinje
Decl., Ex. 1.)  Thus, the court finds
that Defendants have not acted diligently in obtaining discovery from Plaintiff
so as to warrant a trial continuance. 
Third, the court recognizes the proximity of the trial date, which is
set to begin in approximately six weeks, and that Defendants are requesting a
significant continuance of six months. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subds. (d)(1), (d)(2).) 
Fourth, the court acknowledges that Plaintiffs assert that they do not
oppose a 90-day continuance.  However, Plaintiffs
oppose (1) the request for a six-month continuance, and (2) the continuance of
discovery cutoff deadlines, and therefore the parties have not stipulated to
the continuance requested by Defendants. 
(Opp., p. 7:24-27; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(9).) 
            Thus, the court finds that
Defendants have not shown good cause to continue trial and therefore denies
Defendants’ motion.
ORDER
            The court denies defendants 450
Maple Condominiums Owners Association, LB Property Management, Inc., Pamela
Maxwell, Susan Yeung, and Victoria Lerman’s motion to continue trial and related
pre-trial dates.
            The court orders plaintiffs DB Maple
Avenue LLC and Behrouz Yadegar to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
