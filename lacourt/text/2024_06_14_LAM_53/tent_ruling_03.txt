[1] The
court notes that, on June 5, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to its form interrogatories, which the court granted on March
4, 2024.  The papers attached to that
motion indicate that Defendant served those interrogatories on Plaintiff’s
counsel at the apparently incorrect email address “howblum@gmail.com.”  (June 5, 2023 Def. Mot. to Compel, Rothstein
Decl., Ex. 1.)  However, the emails from
Plaintiff’s counsel attached to that motion (sent from the correct “hblum@albrightblum.com”
email address) confirmed receipt of that discovery.  (June 5, 2023 Def. Mot. to Compel, Rothstein
Decl., Ex. 4, p. 1[April 17, 2023 email from Howard Blum stating that counsel
would “endeavor to provide [Defendant] with responses to Form Interrogatories
by 4/28”], Ex. 5 [May 8, 2023 email from Howard Blum stating that he could “get
responses to the Form Interrogatories and the emails by the end of the
month”].)
