And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the defendant's motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Orange County. The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden to show that Los Angeles County is not the proper venue for this action. The court also sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second cause of action for invasion of privacy, as the plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court grants the plaintiff 20 days to file a First Amended Complaint that cures the defects with the second cause of action.
