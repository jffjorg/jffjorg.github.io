  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to
  special interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Vision Construction
Group, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Vision Construction Group, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Morillo Construction, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) to serve responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, and
(2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in
the amount of $3,611.65.
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
The court
finds that Defendant has not shown that it served Plaintiff with its Special
Interrogatories at the correct email address for Plaintiff’s counsel.  
In support
of its motion, Defendant has submitted copies of its Special Interrogatories,
Set One, directed to Plaintiff. 
(Rothstein Decl., Ex. 1.) 
Attached to the Special Interrogatories is a proof of service stating
that Defendant served counsel for Plaintiff with this discovery by electronic
service at the email address “howblum@gmail.com.”  (Rothstein Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 14-15 [proof of
electronic service].)  However, this does
not appear to be the correct email address for Plaintiff’s counsel.  First, on August 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
“Proof of Service of Summons,” on which Plaintiff identified its attorney’s
email address to be “hblum@albrightblum.com.” 
(Aug. 5, 2022, POS-010, p. 1.) 
Second, the email from Plaintiff’s counsel that is attached to
Defendant’s motion was sent from the email address “hblum@albrightblum.com.”  (Rothstein Decl., Ex. 4, p. 1.)  Thus,
it appears that Defendant, in serving Plaintiff with the Special
Interrogatories at “howblum@gmail.com,” served Plaintiff at its counsel’s incorrect
email address.  Further, although the
court notes that the July 6, 2023 email from Plaintiff’s counsel states that he
“know[s] [he] owe[s] [Defendant’s counsel] discovery[,]” Plaintiff’s counsel
did not expressly acknowledge receipt of the Special Interrogatories that are
the subject of this motion.[1]  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to this
motion conceding that it received the discovery. 
Thus, based on the evidence
submitted in support of this motion, the court finds that Defendant has not
shown that it served Plaintiff with the Special Interrogatories at the correct
email address for Plaintiff’s counsel. 
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)
 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Vision
Construction Group, Inc.’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories.
            The court orders defendant Vision
Construction Group, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
