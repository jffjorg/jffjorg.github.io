And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling notes that the defendant filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories on June 5, 2023. The court granted the motion on March 4, 2024. However, the papers attached to the motion indicate that the defendant served the interrogatories on the plaintiff's counsel at an incorrect email address. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel confirmed receipt of the discovery, despite the incorrect email address. The court will likely consider these facts when making a final ruling.
