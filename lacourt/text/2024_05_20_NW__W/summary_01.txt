And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants defendant Leila Hakimelahi's motion for leave to file an amended answer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant seeks to add an affirmative defense based on the plaintiff's lack of motorcycle rider's insurance at the time of the accident. The court finds that defendant has substantially complied with California Rules of Court and that the motion is unopposed. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 576, as well as Civil Code section 3333.4(a) subd. (1), (2), to support its decision.
