And here is the English text summary:

On February 9, 2024, the Plaintiffs (Ava Stone, Camile Cabale, David Benetiz, Rhonda St. John, and Steven Bicknel) filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in this matter. The Defendant, City of LA, demurred to the FAC citing uncertainty, lack of capacity to sue, lack of jurisdiction, and failure to state sufficient facts. Since there was no opposition, the FAC was deemed abandoned. The Demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The Request for Judicial Notice was granted. The moving party is required to give notice. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to appear remotely through LACourtConnect instead of in person.
