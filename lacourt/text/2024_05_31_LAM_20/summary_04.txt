And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is related to the case BC587406, where the plaintiff AMAG, Inc. filed a complaint against Vlaze Media Networks, Inc. and others. The defendant Anastasiia Arseneva filed a cross-complaint against Zambrano. The court previously granted Arseneva's motion to quash a subpoena issued to AT&T due to the lack of consumer consent. Now, Zambrano is seeking to compel Arseneva to sign a consent form for the same subpoena. The court has granted the motion to compel Arseneva to sign the consent form within 5 days. If Arseneva fails to comply, the court will set an order to show cause for daily sanctions. Counsel are encouraged to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
