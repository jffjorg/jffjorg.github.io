And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is unable to enter a default judgment at this time due to several issues with the plaintiff's request. First, the operative complaint does not specify the amount of damages or attorney fees sought, which is required by law. The plaintiff must file an amended complaint with a prayer for monetary relief and attorney fees in an amount encompassing the amounts to be sought. Additionally, the plaintiff's arithmetic is incorrect, and the judge needs more information on how many hours the plaintiff worked per week to determine the amount of overtime pay owed. The plaintiff's request for pre-judgment interest is also problematic, as the judge needs more information on how the interest should be calculated. The judge also notes that the Doe defendants have not been dismissed, and the plaintiff should omit them from the amended complaint. The judge sets the March 13, 2024, date as a status conference rather than a hearing on the entry of default judgment.
