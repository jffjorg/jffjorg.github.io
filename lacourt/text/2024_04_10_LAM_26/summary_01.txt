And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Robert Franklin Klueger. The settlement amount is $135,000.00 to be paid over the course of 36 months. The judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith and that the non-settling defendants have not challenged the proposed settlement. The judge also finds that the settlement amount is reasonable and does not appear to be a grossly disproportionate approximation of the plaintiff's recovery and the defendant's liability.
