1.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to dismiss Does 1-20.
2.                 
The court is not inclined to award general damages of
$120,000.00 based on the 
information provided in Plaintiff’s declaration. Further, medical
records attached to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration indicate that Plaintiff
suffered a foot contusion and that there was “[n]o evidence of acute fracture
or dislocation.” (See Wire Decl., 1:25, Exh. 1.) 
3.                 
Plaintiff does not provide the court with evidentiary
support for the statements made in Paragraph 4 of his declaration.
4.                 
Paragraph 2 of Plaintiff’s declaration appears to
contain a typographical error as to the date of the incident.
