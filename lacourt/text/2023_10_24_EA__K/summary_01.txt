And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jonathan Dailey's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff alleges that he sustained injuries on March 5, 2022, at Sage Social Eatery after an outdoor umbrella fell on his foot. The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendant, Abigail Rodriguez dba Sage Social Eatery and Sage Café, Inc., and subsequently merged into, alleging premises liability. The Defendant's default was entered on June 1, 2023. The Judge notes several defects in the Plaintiff's Application, including failure to dismiss Does 1-20, insufficient evidence to support the claimed general damages of $120,000.00, and a typographical error in the Plaintiff's declaration. The Judge is not inclined to award general damages based on the information provided and is denying the Application for Default Judgment without prejudice.
