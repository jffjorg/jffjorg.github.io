I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On October 5, 2022, Plaintiff, Kenneth
Alexander (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants, Slater
Waterproofing, Inc., City of Redondo Beach, County of Los Angeles, Sika
Corporation, and DOES 1 through 50. The complaint alleges causes of action for:
(1) Negligence; (2) Premises Liability; and (3) Products Liability. Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges that he was riding his bicycle on the designated bike path
through the Redondo Beach Pier parking garage, when due to the slippery
concrete, Plaintiff’s bike slid out from under him, throwing Plaintiff to the
ground and causing him to sustain serious bodily injuries including a broken
arm. 
 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff served
Defendant, City of Redondo Beach (“City”) with Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Two. 
 
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff served
City with Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three.
 
On March 14, 2024, City’s Attorney’s
legal secretary requested an extension for the responses to the Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Two, then due on March 15, 2024, and the responses
to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three, then due on March 18,
2024, to both b due on March 22, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff states that on March 22, 2024,
City served responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
Two and Set Three, Requests Nos. 54-73, with objections only and no documents
were produced. Plaintiff contends that Defendants did not serve responses to
the outstanding supplemental interrogatories and supplemental Requests for
Production of Documents. 
 
As such, Plaintiff brough this Motion to
Compel Further Responses. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
Motion to Compel Further Responses. On May 17, 2024, Defendant City filed an
opposition brief. On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
 
This motion was originally scheduled for
May 31, 2024, but was continued to June 6, 2024.  On June 6, 2024, this motion was placed off
calendar, on the IC Hub Court’s own motion. 
 
On June 10, 2024, this case was
reassigned to this Court. 
 
On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Ruling of the Court’s August 6, 2024 case management conference rulings,
indicating the Motion to Compel would be heard on November 19, 2024.  On January 8, 2025, City filed a status report.

 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.    Legal
Standard
 
            Where there
has been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the
demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief
from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There
is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to
respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court
before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the
inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is required. 
A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or
overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing
that there “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the
discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to
other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
B.   
Discussion
Here, Plaintiff has requested
an order from this Court granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel City’s Further
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two and Set Three,
Request Nos. 54-73, and issue an order directing Defendant to serve said
further responses within ten (10) days of the ruling. 
The status report filed by City
indicates that it served substantive responses which Plaintiff’s counsel
acknowledged receipt of on January 6, 2025. However, City admits that
Plaintiff’s counsel identified two major deficiencies to Request Nos. 54-72
(Set Two) and Nos. 73-74 (Set Three) because Defendant’s further responses
included objections, and because in response to Request Nos.
56-59, 61, 64-67, 69 and 72, Defendant provided the it was unable to comply
“because any such documents no longer exist.”
The Court notes that without an updated separate statement with
City’s supplemental responses, it is unable to rule on this motion. Thus, the
parties are required to provide more context during oral argument. 
C.   
Sanctions
Here,
Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,691.2. This amount is based
on counsel for Plaintiff, Kevin S. Conlogue, Esq.’s declaration (“Conlogue
Decl.”) stating his hourly rate is $725, that he spent a total of 2.25 hours on
this matter, and the $60 filing fee. The Court previously indicated in
connection with the deposition motion that the claimed hourly rate of $725 for
a generic discovery motion, without more support for the setting of such a
rate, was unreasonable. This issue may require further argument or supplemental
papers.
