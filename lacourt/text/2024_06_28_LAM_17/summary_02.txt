And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories and sanctions the plaintiff $700.00. The plaintiff, Roberto Perez, failed to respond to the defendant's Form Interrogatories despite being served via e-mail and U.S mail on April 9, 2024. The defendant, Mireya Perez, moved to compel initial responses on May 23, 2024, and the motion was unopposed. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to justify its failure to respond and therefore sanctions the plaintiff and its counsel $700.00. The defendant's motion is granted, and the plaintiff is required to respond within 10 days.
