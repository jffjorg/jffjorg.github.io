And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's previous ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Ruth Montury, is challenging the arbitration agreement and arguing that it is substantively and procedurally unconscionable. The Defendant, Gem Healthcare, LLC, is arguing that the agreement is valid and that the Court should compel arbitration. The Court has considered the arguments and has denied the motion for reconsideration.

The Court has also considered the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendant has not been diligent in selecting an arbitrator, but has also denied this argument. The Court has noted that the parties have only had a little over two months to select an arbitrator and that it is premature to say conclusively that they cannot do so without court intervention.

The Court has also denied the Plaintiff's argument that the arbitration costs are excessive and that the agreement is substantively unconscionable. The Court has noted that the Defendant has provided the names of some arbitrators who work for JAMS, a company that charges up to $10,000 per day for arbitration, but has also noted that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she cannot afford these costs.

Overall, the Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and has ordered the Defendant to give notice of the ruling.
