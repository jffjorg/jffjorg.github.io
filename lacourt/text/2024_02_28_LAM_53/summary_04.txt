This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding two motions to be relieved as counsel, one for popchest, inc. and one for defendant Valerian Bennett, filed by Al Mohajerian. The motions were filed on January 26, 2024, and the hearing was scheduled for January 16, 2024 (for popchest, inc.) and January 19, 2024 (for defendant Valerian Bennett). However, the court cannot verify that Counsel properly gave notice to the clients of the hearing on this motion, as the notice of ruling was not filed with the court. Therefore, the court denies the motions, without prejudice, and orders Al Mohajerian to give notice of this ruling.
