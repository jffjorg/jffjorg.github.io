Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to seal and the motion to quash a deposition subpoena. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant falsely accused him of giving her herpes, and the defendant has filed a cross-complaint alleging sexual battery and other claims.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the deposition subpoena, which sought information about the defendant's past sexual conduct. The plaintiff failed to obtain a court order permitting discovery into the defendant's past sexual conduct, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.220.

The judge has also granted the parties' motions to seal various documents and motion papers. The parties have agreed to seal certain documents, including medical records, sensitive communications, and images, to protect their rights under the protective order in the case.

The judge has found that an overriding interest exists which overcomes the public's right to access these materials and supports sealing the records. The parties will be prejudiced if the records are not sealed, and the sealing is narrowly tailored and there are no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.
