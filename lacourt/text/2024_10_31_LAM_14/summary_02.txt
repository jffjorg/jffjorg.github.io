Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the seventh cause of action, which alleges that the defendant failed to pay relocation assistance. The defendant argued that the complaint failed to state a cause of action with sufficient specificity, as it did not allege when the notice to vacate was first mailed or posted on the premises. However, the judge found that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendant was required to provide relocation assistance to the plaintiffs, as the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety issued an order requiring the defendant to cease using the subject building as a dwelling and to provide relocation assistance to the plaintiffs if they were evicted. The judge also found that the defendant was liable for relocation fees 20 days before the date the plaintiffs were required to vacate, and that the defendant's demurrer was therefore overruled. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days of the order.
