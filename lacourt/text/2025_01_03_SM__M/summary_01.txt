And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that counsel David Tran's motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff BMBG Investments LLC is GRANTED. The motion was granted because counsel failed to submit the mandatory form MC-052, although counsel did submit a declaration. The court does not find that the client will be prejudiced by the withdrawal, given that trial is not set and default is entered against the defendant. The order is effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client.
