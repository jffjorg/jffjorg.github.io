Legal
Standard
 
A¿lis¿pendens¿is a¿recorded
instrument, recorded in the office of the county recorder where land is located,
that gives¿constructive notice¿of a pending lawsuit affecting title to
described real property. (Gale v. Superior Court¿(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th
1388, 1395.) “A party to an action who asserts a¿real property claim¿may
record a notice of pendency of action in which that real property claim is
alleged.” (CCP § 405.20.) Anyone having an interest in the property affected by
a lis pendens, whether or not a party to the pending lawsuit, may move to
expunge the lis pendens any time after it is recorded. (CCP § 405.30.) A lis
pendens may be expunged on any of the following grounds: (1) defects in the
statutory service and filing requirements; (2) the complaint does not contain a
real property claim; (3) the claimant cannot prove the probable validity of the
real property claim by a preponderance of the evidence; and (4) “adequate
relief” can be “secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking.” (CCP
§§ 405.23, 405.31, 405.32, 405.33; McKnight v. Sup.Ct. (Faber)¿(1985)
170 Cal.App.3d 291, 303 [recognizing defective servicing and filing
requirements as grounds for expungement].) The motion may be made even while an
appeal is pending. (Peery v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 837,
842.)  
 
“At any time after notice of
pendency of an action has been recorded pursuant to this title or other law,
the notice may be withdrawn by recording in the office of the recorder in which
the notice of pendency was recorded a notice of withdrawal executed by the
party who recorded the notice of pendency of action or by the party's successor
in interest. The notice of withdrawal shall be acknowledged.” (CCP, §
405.50.) 
 
The claimant who filed the lis
pendens has the burden of proof where the motion is made on the grounds that
the action does not involve a real property claim or the action lacks probable
validity. (CCP § 405.30.) “ ‘Probable validity,’ with respect to a real
property claim, means that it is more likely than not that the claimant will
obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim.” (CCP § 405.32.) If the
claimant fails to meet his or her burden, the court must order that the notice
be expunged and may not order an under taking be given as a condition of
expunging the notice. (CCP § 405.32.) 
 
A real property claim is any cause
of action which, if meritorious, would affect title to, or the right of
possession of, specific real property; or the use of an easement identified in
the pleading (other than one obtained pursuant to statute by ay regulatory
public utility). (CCP § 405.4.) The allegations of the complaint determines
whether a “real property claim” is involved; no evidence is required. (Urez
Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Keefer) (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149 [decided under
former law, but principle probably still valid].) 
 
The claimant who filed the lis
pendens has the burden of proof where the motion is made on the grounds that
the action does not involve a real property claim or the action lacks probable
validity. (CCP § 405.30.) If the claimant fails to meet his or her burden, the
court must order that the notice be expunged and may not order an under taking
be given as a condition of expunging the notice. (CCP § 405.32.) 
 
A prevailing party on a motion to
expunge a lis pendens is entitled to recover “reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court finds that the other
party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of attorney's fees and costs unjust.” (CCP § 405.38.) For purposes
of attorneys’ fees and costs, a court’s ruling on a motion made pursuant to CCP
Sections 405.31 and 405.32 necessarily decides who is the “prevailing party”
since such motions place in issue whether the lis pendens was proper. The award
of attorney’s fees is only against the losing party, not the losing party’s
counsel. (Doyle v. Sup.Ct. (Jacinth Develop., Inc.) (1991) 226
Cal.App.3d 1355, 1359.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant Signix Management LLC
moves to Expunge Lis Pendens as to the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by
Plaintiffs Jinwan Shen and Da Bai Niu as to the real property located at 4226
New Hampshire Avenue, Claremont, CA 91711 (“Claremont House”). 
 
Objections
 
            Plaintiffs’
request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
 
Defendants’ request to present oral
testimony is DENIED. 
 
Real Property Claim 
 
Defendant first argues that there
is “no real property claim” alleged as to Claremont House. The complaint states
two causes of action concerning the Claremont House which may state a real
property claim: fraudulent conveyance and constructive trust.
 
Fraudulent transfer claims may
support a lis pendens. Civil Code section 3439.07 provides that a creditor who
makes a successful fraudulent conveyance claim may obtain “[a]voidance of the
transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor's
claim.” “By definition, the voiding of a transfer of real property will affect
title to or possession of real property. Therefore, a fraudulent conveyance
action seeking avoidance of a transfer under subdivision (a)(1) of Civil Code
section 3439.07 clearly ‘affects title to, or the right to possession of’ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.4) real property and is therefore a real property claim for
the purposes of the lis pendens statutes. (Kirkeby v. Superior Ct., (2004)
33 Cal. 4th 642, 649.) 
 
That said, fraudulent conveyances
and constructive trusts do not necessarily support the real property
claim requirement for lis pendens. (Lewis v. Superior Court (1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 1850, 1862-1865.) Instead, the trial court must look to the
“essence” of the claim supporting a lis pendens. In Lewis, for example, the
trial court erred in denying a real property purchaser's motion to expunge a
lis pendens on the property, where the essence of the complaint was an effort
to impose a constructive trust on the property as opposed to an archetypical
fraudulent transfer action. (Id. at 1864-65.) There, the complaint did not
allege any conveyance of real property. (Id. at 1865.) Instead, it merely
alleged that the defendant wrongfully took the plaintiff’s money and used the
money to buy (but not convey) real property. (Ibid.) Thus, the Lewis
court took the fraudulent conveyance claims as claims for a constructive trust,
which do not support lis pendens if those allegations only act as a collateral
means of collecting monetary damages. (Id.; see Urez Corp. v.
Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149 [discussing circumstances
where constructive trusts support lis pendens].) However, when it presents an
archetypical fraudulent conveyance action, the complaint states a real property
claim. (Lewis, supra, 30 Cal.App.4th at 1865; see, e.g., McKnight v.
Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 291, 295-296, 299, 303 [fraudulent
transfer action to set aside conveyance affected real property where defendant
defaulted on a loan secured by real property, plaintiff obtained a writ of
attachment against the property, defendant then quitclaimed his community
interest in the subject property to his wife to avoid debt].)
 
“[E]quitable remedies [such as
constructive trusts], even if colorable, will not support a lis pendens if,
ultimately, those allegations act only as a collateral means to collect money
damages.” (Urez, supra, 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149.) “The case law
distinguishes between two subtypes of constructive trust claims. First, there
are constructive trust claims that are akin to fraudulent conveyance claims
because they seek a constructive trust on real property that was itself
wrongfully taken and, if successful on the merits, plaintiffs would regain
title to or possession of the same property. On the other hand, there are
claims seeking a constructive trust or equitable lien on different property,
merely as a means to secure collection of a debt.” (Shoker v. Superior Court
(2002) 81 Cal. App. 5th 271, 282-83.) “[T]o allow a party to record a lis
pendens in a case in which the party seeks only ‘to freeze the real property as
a res from which to satisfy a money judgment’, is not consistent with the
history and purpose of the lis pendens statutes…” (Campbell v. Superior
Court (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 904, 918-919.) 
 
The first amended complaint (FAC)
alleges the following facts concerning the allegedly fraudulent conveyance of
the Claremont Property. First, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Li is a debtor
as defined by the fraudulent transfer statute. The FAC alleges that Li misappropriated
millions of Plaintiffs’ investment funds before buying the Claremont House in
September 2021. From 2018-2019, Li advised Shen to create the Six Irrevocable
Trusts, but despite Li’s assurances that Shen’s money was “safe,” Li
misappropriated over $27 million in Plaintiffs’ funds including funds deposited
in the Lincoln Trust. (FAC ¶¶ 99-108, 114.) On September 13, 2021, Li took
title to the Claremont House as a single man, notwithstanding that he was
legally married to Defendant Yingxia. (Id. ¶ 183.) On December 17, 2021, while
still in the midst of committing his fraudulent actions against Plaintiffs and
being legally insolvent, Li transferred the Claremont House to Signix for no
consideration. (¶¶ 184-185.) The December 2021 transfer of the Claremont House by
Defendant Li to Defendant Signix was for no consideration, was an attempt to
hinder, delay or defraud Plaintiff as creditors by placing such asset/property
out of reach of Plaintiffs’ collection efforts, and thus constituted a fraudulent
transfer. (¶ 186.) The December 17, 2021, transfer of the Claremont House
harmed Plaintiffs in that it diverted assets away without consideration and
placed them out of reach of creditor Plaintiff Shen. (¶ 394.) The prayer
requests that the court set aside (i.e., void) all the referenced fraudulently
transferred real properties. (Prayer ¶ i.) 
 
With the above facts, The FAC
presents an archetypical fraudulent conveyance action. Plaintiffs are allegedly
creditors of Li, Li owned real property, and Li transferred the real property
to place funds outside of the reach of his creditors. (FAC ¶¶ 183-189, 251,
256, 394, 414.) Therefore, the FAC states a real property claim.
 
Probable Validity
 
A fraudulent conveyance under the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”) involves “a transfer by the debtor of
property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor
from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.” (Filip v. Bucurenciu
(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 825, 829.) Civil Code section 3439.01(b)-(e) provides
the following relevant definitions:
 
(b) “Claim,” except as used in
“claim for relief,” means a right to payment, whether or not the right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.
(c) “Creditor” means a person that
has a claim, and includes an assignee of a general assignment for the benefit
of creditors, as defined in Section 493.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure, of
a debtor.
(d) “Debt” means liability on a
claim.
(e) “Debtor” means a person that is
liable on a claim.
 
Under Civil Code section 3439.04(a),
a transfer is voidable as to a creditor where the debtor made the transfer or
incurred the obligation: (1) “With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
any creditor of the debtor”; or (2) “Without receiving a reasonably equivalent
value in exchange for the transfer or obligation”, and the debtor either: (A) “Was
engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the
remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the
business or transaction”, or (B) “Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably
should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor's
ability to pay as they became due.” Under section 3439.05(a), a transfer is
voidable to a creditor “if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the
obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the
transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor
became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.” 
 
In determining intent, the
statutory scheme lays out several factors for consideration, though no single
factor is dispositive. (See Annod Corp. v. Hamilton & Samuels (2002)
100 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1298 [proof of fraudulent intent in conveyances often is
inferences from the surrounding circumstances].) Such factors include, whether
the transfer or obligation was to an insider, whether the debtor retained
possession or control of the transferred property, whether the transfer was
concealed, etc. (Civ. Code § 3439.04(b).) 
 
            Plaintiffs
present evidence, if credited, demonstrating that Li is a Debtor to Shen.
Plaintiffs explain that Shen’s funds were earmarked to be used in good faith
for specific purposes but became unaccounted for prior to the Claremont House
purchase. Shen claims that Li misappropriated funds in the Lincoln Trust, made
the $1.8 million loan on the Haven Ave. Office Building, and obtained
approximately $29.5 million in additional funds prior to buying the Claremont
House. (Shen Decl., ¶¶ 28-33, Exs. L-P.) 
 
Plaintiff presents evidence that
the transfer was for no consideration. (RJN Ex. 9.) This is a hallmark of a
fraudulent transfer. That said, no single factor is dispositive. Plaintiffs fails
to present evidence of the other factors showing that Li transferred the
property to Signix with actual intent to defraud, or alternatively, Li’s
insolvency. Plaintiffs naturally have little evidence of Li’s financial status,
and thus cannot prevail on theories requiring an analysis of Li’s finances. As
to actual intent, Plaintiffs contend that Li transferred the house to Signix
for the benefit of his wife (Defendant Yingxia, an insider) but only cite to
their allegations and the request for judicial notice which does not support
such facts. Plaintiffs do not cite evidence suggesting that the house
was transferred for the benefit of Yingxia. Additionally, Plaintiffs do not
cite evidence that the transfer was “concealed.” At best, Plaintiffs cite
evidence the representation that he took the property as a single man. (RJN Ex.
3.) However, this evidence does not suggest that the transfer was concealed
from Plaintiffs.
 
Critically, Plaintiff fails to
demonstrate the necessary element of injury. To set aside a transfer of real
property under the fraudulent transfer statutes, the additional element of
injury to the creditor must be “affirmatively” shown. (Mehrtash v. Mehrtash,
(2001) 93 Cal. App. 4th 75, 79–80.) “A transfer in fraud of creditors may be
attacked only by one who is injured thereby. Mere intent to delay or defraud is
not sufficient; injury to the creditor must be shown affirmatively. In other
words, prejudice to the plaintiff is essential. It cannot be said that a
creditor has been injured unless the transfer puts beyond [her] reach property
[she] otherwise would be able to subject to the payment of [her] debt.” (Fidelity
Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Schroeder (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 834, 845; Mehrtash,
supra, 93 Cal.App.4th at 79-80 [judgment creditor could not show injury
from an intra-family real estate transfer where the existing encumbrances and
senior liens were worth more than the property, since setting aside the
transfer would not yield a net recovery]; Yaesu Electronics Corp. v. Tamura
(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 8, 13-14 [debtor liquidated an account and transferred proceeds
to family members shortly before creditor obtained a judgment, hindering the
ability to execute on the account]; Potter v. Alliance United Ins. Co.
(2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 894, 909-910 [harm sufficiently alleged where judgment debtor
settled an assignable bad faith claim against insurer for $75,000, which cut
off judgment creditor’s ability to place a meaningful lien on the judgment].)
Here, Plaintiffs do not present evidence of harm. Plaintiffs merely cite the allegations
that this transfer was a substantial factor in causing harm to Plaintiff Shen
harm. (FAC, ¶¶ 98, 118-127, 175, 181-189, 394-399, 408-411.) Plaintiff neither
explains nor evidences the harm suffered. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to meet their
responsive burden on this motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Attorneys’ fees are GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,123.08 and payable
within 30 days.
