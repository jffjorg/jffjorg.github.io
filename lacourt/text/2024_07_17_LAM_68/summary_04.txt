Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration filed by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Sang Hyun Kim regarding defects in a 2023 Mercedes-Benz vehicle purchased on July 21, 2023. The Judge found that the lease agreement containing the arbitration clause did not apply to the warranty claims, and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not provide a basis for compelling arbitration. The Judge also found that the case is governed by California law, and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply. The Judge cited several California cases, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor, and Kielar, which support the decision. The motion is denied, and the Defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 15 days from the date of the order.
