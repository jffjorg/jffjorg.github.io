  Case Number:  23SMCP00651    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDEN REFORESTRATION PROJECTS, et al.  Petitioners, v.  ASPIRATION PARTNERS, INC., et al.,   Respondents.    Case No.:  23SMCP00651     Hearing Date:  March 15, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   RESPONDENTS’ MOTION FOR    RECONSIDERATION      BACKGROUND    This case arises from a dispute over a settlement agreement.  The signatories to the settlement agreement were Petitioners Eden Reforestation Projects and its wholly owned subsidiary Compassionate Carbon on the one hand, and Respondents Aspiration Partners, Inc. and Aspiration Inc. on the other.  A dispute arose over the settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement provided for the resolution of disputes “arising from or relating to” it by JAMS arbitration.   Petitioners commenced an arbitration of the dispute by filing a demand with JAMS.  The Hon. Kirk H. Nakamura (Ret.) was appointed as the arbitrator.  Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Arbitrator granted.  (See Attachment 8(c) to Petition.)   The Arbitrator concluded that (1) Respondents breached the Settlement Agreement by not making a $1,000,000 settlement payment, (2) Respondents repudiated the Settlement Agreement and thereby anticipatorily breached the Settlement Agreement and $1,376,271.19 is the discounted accelerated payment sum due under the Settlement Agreement, (3) the $1,000,000 past due sum is a sum certain and thus Petitioners are entitled to pre-award prejudgment interest on that sum which totals $10,958.90, and (4) Respondents are liable for all arbitration costs.  (Id.)  The Arbitrator also granted judgment in favor of Petitioners on their declaratory relief claim.  (Id.) On December 15, 2023, the Arbitrator issued the Award, and JAMS served the Award on the parties on December 5, 2023.  No request to correct the Award was made by any party.  On January 29, 2024, the Court confirmed the arbitration award.         This hearing is on Respondents’ objection to the proposed judgment and motion for reconsideration of the Court’s January 29, 2024 order.  Respondents argue that they were not properly served with the petition to confirm the arbitration award, and as a result, the Court did not have jurisdiction over them, and the Court’s order is void for lack of jurisdiction.   LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc. §1008(a):¿ “When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code of Civ. Proc., §1008(a).)¿  A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.”¿ (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal. App. 4th 1494, 1499.)  There is a strict requirement of diligence, meaning the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence, different facts, or law earlier.¿ (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 674, 690.)¿ A motion for reconsideration is properly denied when it is based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the original motion.¿ (Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1460;¿Hennigan v. White (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 395, 406.) ¿¿¿ DISCUSSION     Petitioners argue that Respondents’ motion fails to comply with §1008 as it presents no new facts or new law.  The Court agrees.  Respondents’ motion relies on a case that is more than ten years old.  The declaration it submits says nothing about any new facts or new law.  It also says nothing about diligence or why counsel failed to bring the case to the Court’s attention at the January 29 hearing.     Notwithstanding, the Court agrees with Respondents that it has inherent authority to reconsider its rulings, and it is compelled to do so here.  “[T]he trial court’s inherent authority to correct its errors applies even when the trial court was prompted to reconsider its prior ruling by a motion filed in violation of section 1008.”  (In re Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303-1304 (affirming grant of motion for reconsideration that failed to comply with Section 1008).)   Turning now to the substance of Respondents’ motion, Respondents argue that they were not properly served with the petition to confirm the arbitration award, and therefore, the Court did not have personal jurisdiction over them.  The Court agrees.   The requirements for serving a petition to vacate an arbitration award are governed by¿section 1290.4, which specifies that¿ “[a] copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based¿shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.” (§ 1290.4, subd. (a), italics added.)  However, “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made¿and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance with this¿subdivision: [¶] (1)¿Service¿within this State¿shall be made in the¿manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1290.4, subd. (b), italics added.) Here, the Settlement Agreement says “[a]ll notices that any Party to this Agreement may be required or may wish to give in connection with this Agreement” may be delivered by email.  Under Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217, Cal.App.4th 1199, this “all notices” provision does not constitute an agreement as to how a petition to confirm an arbitration award shall be served.  And accordingly, Petitioners were required to serve Respondents “in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1290.4, subd. (b).) In Abers, homeowners filed a petition to vacate an arbitration award issued in favor of trustees.  The homeowners served the motion to vacate by overnight delivery to the trustees’ counsel.  The trustees moved to quash service and sought an order dismissing the petition on the ground that the homeowners failed to properly serve the petition.  The trial court granted the trustees’ motion, dismissing the petition to vacate the award, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.    As in this case, the homeowners argued that Civ. Proc. Code 1290.4(a) applied because they followed the method provided in the arbitration agreement for serving notices.  In rejecting this argument, the Court of Appeals found the notices provision “governs only the manner in which ‘notices’ may be ‘sent,’” and “says nothing at all about the manner in which a petition to vacate an arbitration award must be¿served.”  (Id. at 1207.)  ¿ Petitioners attempt to distinguish Abers because it purportedly involved only a subset of notices relating to the lease.  But the notice provision in Abers is indistinguishable from the notice provision here.  There, the notices provision states that “written notice[s] … respecting this Lease” may be “sent by certified or registered mail” to a specified address.¿ (Id. at 1206.)  Here, the notices provision states “[a]ll notices … in connection with this Agreement” may be delivered by email.  In both provisions, the notices were “respecting” or “in connection with” the relevant agreement.   Petitioners’ reliance on Rockefeller Technology Investments (Asai) VII v. Changzhou SinoType Technology Co. Ltd. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 125, 143 is misplaced.  There, the MOU contained explicit language that the parties “consent to service of process in accord with the notice provisions above.”  Thus, the Supreme Court construed the MOU as confirming “the parties’ intent to replace ‘service of process’ with the alternate notification method specified in the agreement.”  On this basis, the Supreme Court distinguished Abers, explaining “the MOU not only contemplated that notifications be sent via Federal Express, but also that such notifications would take the place of formal service of process.”  (Id. at 144.) In contrast to Rockefeller, here, the Settlement Agreement contains no language adopting the methods set for “notice” under the Settlement Agreement for the purpose of service of process.  In the absence of any such explicit language, Petitioners were obligated to serve Respondents in a manner and pursuant to methods that comport with standard service of process pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §1290.4(b).  Because there is no dispute Petitioners failed to serve Respondents in a manner consistent with §1290.4(b), this Court is devoid of jurisdiction to enter judgment against Respondents.  (Rockefeller, 9 Cal.5th at 144; Abers, 217 Cal.App.4th at 1206.) Proper¿service of process¿of a petition is the means by which a court obtains personal jurisdiction over a party. (In re Jennifer O. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547¿(“a court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of process or by that party’s general appearance …”).) Petitioners next argue that even if service was defective, Respondents received actual notice.  But the obligation to serve a party with process is not coextensive with merely providing the party with¿notice¿of the proceeding.  Even undisputed¿actual¿notice of a proceeding does not substitute for proper¿service¿of the petition. (Honda Motor Co. v. Superior Court¿(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1049¿(“The fact that¿the person served ‘got the word’ is irrelevant.”);¿In re Abrams¿(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 685, 693¿(“Mere knowledge of the action is not a substitute for service, nor does it raise any estoppel to contest the validity of service … .”).)  Indeed, “no California appellate court has gone so far as to uphold a service of process solely on the ground that the defendant received actual notice when there has been a complete failure to comply with the statutory requirements for service.”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 414.) Petitioners then argue that that even if service was defective, it has now properly served Respondents’ agent for service of process.  This belated service, however, does not cure the fact that the Court lacked jurisdiction to have issued the January 29, 2024 order.   CONCLUSION   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Respondents’ motion for reconsideration and vacates its January 29, 2024 order.               DATED:  March 15, 2024              ___________________________ Edward B.
