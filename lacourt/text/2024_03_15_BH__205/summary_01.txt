And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Respondents' motion for reconsideration and vacating the court's January 29, 2024 order. The court finds that Petitioners failed to properly serve Respondents with the petition to confirm the arbitration award, and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to enter judgment against Respondents. The court agrees with Respondents that it has inherent authority to reconsider its rulings, and it is compelled to do so here. The court also finds that the settlement agreement does not provide for the manner in which a petition to confirm an arbitration award shall be served, and therefore, Petitioners were required to serve Respondents in a manner and pursuant to methods that comport with standard service of process pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1290.4(b).
