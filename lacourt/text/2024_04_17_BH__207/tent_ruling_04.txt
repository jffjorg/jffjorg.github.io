[1] To clarify, the Second Amended Complaint was filed,
but because it was not filed in conformity with the timing requirements and
scope outlined in the Court’s December 14, 2023 ruling, the Court has now
stricken the Second Amended Complaint filed on January 16, 2024 (see concurrent
tentative ruling re Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint).  
 


[2] The Court does not consider Plaintiff’s reply
evidence, as Defendant has not had a fair opportunity to respond.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316 [“due process requires a
party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate
notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall
Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)  


[3] In Reply, Plaintiff has submitted a redlined version
of the Second Amended Complaint that was filed, with additional deletions made
to the version that was filed.  Not only
was this improperly submitted as Reply evidence (see footnote 1), but it also
does not satisfy the requirement of demonstrating changes made between the
first amended complaint and the proposed second amended complaint.
