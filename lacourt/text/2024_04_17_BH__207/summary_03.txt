Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the pleading without prejudice. The Plaintiff sought to add new causes of action and defendants to the second amended complaint. The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 3.1324(b) and therefore denied the motion. The Plaintiff is allowed to file a new motion for leave to amend, which must comply with the procedural requirements and be supported by a separate declaration.
