And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge grants Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for fraud. The Plaintiff had alleged that the Defendant concealed financial information and made misrepresentations to obtain favorable lease terms. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the parties were on the eve of trial and that the Plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking to amend the complaint. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's delay was not prejudicial to the Defendant and that the proposed amendment does not involve a change in legal theory that would make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing party. The Court orders Plaintiff to file and serve the proposed first amended complaint on or before April 24, 2024.
