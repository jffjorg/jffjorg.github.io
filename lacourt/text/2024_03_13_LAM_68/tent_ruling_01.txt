Cause of Action: California Invasion of Privacy Act (Penal Code section 638.51)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Jose Licea, a “consumer privacy advocate who works as a ‘tester’ to ensure that
companies abide by the privacy obligations imposed by California law” in order
to “advance[] important public interests at the risk of vile personal attacks”[1]
alleges defendant Hickory Farms, LLC “secretly installs tracking software on
the devices of all visitors to its website in violation of California law.” Plaintiff
characterizes the technology as a “pen register” and “trap and trace” device. 
 
On
October 25 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Comprehensive Computer Data
and Access Fraud Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act (Penal Code section
638.51), California Invasion of Privacy Act (Penal Code section 631), Invasion
of Privacy, and Intrusion Upon Seclusion. On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a first amended complaint for California Invasion of Privacy Act (Penal Code
section 638.51)
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The
court takes judicial notice of the legislative history. On the other superior
court order, and certified copy of the transcript, the court takes notice of
the existence of documents, but declines to take notice for the truth of any
matter asserted in either item. (Kilroy v. State of California (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 140, 147-148; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) The order or transcript
was never published, and therefore not citable for any reference. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.1115(a); Rittiman v. Public Utilities
Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote
18).)
 
Evidentiary Objections: Overruled.[1]A search of the court index reveals at least 19 filed,
pending or dismissed cases under Jose Licea with counsel from Pacific Trial
Attorneys, including 23STCV25882, 23STCV28947, 23STCV02906, 23STCV02964,
23STCV14667, 23STCV14680, 23STCV14839, 23STCV26145, 23STCV15816, 23STCV16165,
23STCV16244, 23STCV16259, 24STCV00021, 24STCV01651, 24STCV01653, 24STCV01687,
24STCV02041, and 24STCV 02762. The court presumes counsel presents the
allegation of a consumer advocate in order to proactively defend against a
potential motion to designate Plaintiff and/or the law firm as vexatious. It
remains to be determined whether the serial filing of similar actions will lead
to review for coordination, consolidation, or other form of special
designation.
 
The declaration of counsel on the subject matter of sanctions
constitutes argument beyond the scope of the demurrer. The court therefore
declines to consider the subject matter.
 
Defendant
Hickory Farms, LLC (Hickory Farms) brings the subject demurer to the first amended
complaint for California Invasion of Privacy Act under Penal Code section
638.51. Hickory Farms challenges the operative complaint on a lack of
sufficient facts to establish liability. Plaintiff Jose Licea in opposition contends
the statutory based claim is properly pled. Plaintiff maintains the “pen
register” technology used in conjunction with an IP address via mobile phone
qualifies as an improper act. Hickory Farms in reply specifically addresses the
exclusion/lack of any inclusion of IP address information acquisition as a
violation of the California Consumer Privacy Act or the federal Patriot Act. 
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
(a)
Except as provided in subdivision (b), a person may not install or use a pen
register or a trap and trace device without first obtaining a court order
pursuant to Section 638.52 or 638.53.
(b) A
provider of electronic or wire communication service may use a pen register or
a trap and trace device for any of the following purposes:
(1) To
operate, maintain, and test a wire or electronic communication service.
(2) To
protect the rights or property of the provider.
(3) To
protect users of the service from abuse of service or unlawful use of service.
(4) To
record the fact that a wire or electronic communication was initiated or
completed to protect the provider, another provider furnishing service toward
the completion of the wire communication, or a user of that service, from
fraudulent, unlawful, or abusive use of service.
(5) If
the consent of the user of that service has been obtained.
(c) A
violation of this section is punishable by a fine not exceeding two thousand
five hundred dollars ($2,500), or by imprisonment in the county jail not
exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section
1170, or by both that fine and imprisonment.
(d) A
good faith reliance on an order issued pursuant to Section 638.52, or an
authorization made pursuant to Section 638.53, is a complete defense to a civil
or criminal action brought under this section or under this chapter.
 
Pen.
Code, § 638.51
 
For purposes of the demurrer, Hickory Farms contends the
operative complaint fails to allege sufficient facts establishing the actual
use of a “pen register’ and “trap and trace device” “within the meaning of” the
California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) notwithstanding the admitted
allegations in the first amended complaint regarding the use of said
technology. [See First Amend. Comp., ¶ 20.] Hickory Farms maintains the subject
devices are limited to telephonic devices, including cellular phones, and not via
internet connected devices with a unique IP address, as relied upon in the
first amended complaint. [See First Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 9-14.]
 
“(b) ‘Pen
register’ means a device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing,
addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility
from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the
contents of a communication. ... 
“(c) ‘Trap
and trace device’ means a device or process that captures the incoming
electronic or other impulses that identify the originating number or other
dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information reasonably likely to
identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, but not the contents
of a communication.”
 
Pen.
Code, § 638.50
 
The court considers the telephonic functionality represented
limitation. CIPA begins with Penal Code section 630, with definitions and
limitations reflecting an era of cordless radio phones and cellular phones at
the time. 
 
“(a)
Every person who, without the consent of all of the parties to a
communication, intercepts or receives and intentionally records, or assists in
the interception or reception and intentional recordation of, a communication
transmitted between two cellular radio telephones, a cellular radio telephone
and a landline telephone, two cordless telephones, a cordless telephone and a
landline telephone, or a cordless telephone and a cellular radio telephone,
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the
state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment. If the person has been
convicted previously of a violation of this section or of Section 631, 632,
632.5, 632.6, or 636, the person shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one
year, or in the state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.
...
(d) As used in this
section, each of the following terms have the following meaning:
(1)
“Cellular radio telephone” means a wireless telephone authorized by the Federal
Communications Commission to operate in the frequency bandwidth reserved for
cellular radio telephones.
(2)
“Cordless telephone” means a two-way, low power communication system consisting
of two parts, a “base” unit which connects to the public switched telephone
network and a handset or “remote” unit, that are connected by a radio link and
authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to operate in the frequency
bandwidths reserved for cordless telephones.
(3)
“Communication” includes, but is not limited to, communications transmitted by
voice, data, or image, including facsimile.”
 
Pen.
Code, § 632.7
 
Legislative updates and commentary continue to
explicitly cover cordless and cellular phone technology without reference to
internet based communications. (Smith
v. LoanMe, Inc. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 183,
191.) The subject argument has been addressed many times by district courts,
including a previously dismissed action by the same Plaintiff and counsel in
the Central District. (Licea v. Cinmar, LLC (C.D. Cal. 2023) 659 F.Supp.3d 1096, 1104; see Licea v. Vitacost.com, Inc.
(S.D. Cal., July 24, 2023, No. 22-CV-1854-RSH-WVG) 2023 WL 5086893, at *4-5; Augustine v. Lenovo
(United States), Inc. (S.D. Cal., Aug. 2,
2023, No. 22-CV-2027-L-AHG) 2023 WL 4938050, at *4; Garcia v. Build.com, Inc.
(S.D. Cal., July 13, 2023, No. 22-CV-01985-DMS-KSC) 2023 WL 4535531, at *6; Kauffman v. Papa John's International, Inc. (S.D. Cal., Jan. 12, 2024, No. 22-CV-1492-L-MSB) 2024 WL
171363, at *9.) 

A recent district court case however
characterizes certain internet based software as equivalent to a pen register,
which Plaintiff cites to directly in the operative complaint. [First Amend.
Comp., ¶¶ 17, 19.] (Greenley v. Kochava, Inc. (S.D. Cal., July 27, 2023, No. 22-CV-01327-BAS-AHG) 2023
WL 4833466, at *15–16.) Plaintiff conclusively pleads the pen register claim
via parroting the relied upon case, to which Defendant challenges as still
qualitatively flawed. 
 
The court
finds validity in the argument that nothing in the complaint establishes an IP
address as equivalent to the “unique fingerprinting” relied upon by the
Southern District when finding embedded software into a mobile phone, thereby
providing unique location and other information normally within the domain of
law enforcement officers with a warrant. (Ibid; Heeger v. Facebook, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2020) 509 F.Supp.3d 1182, 1190 [“There is no
legally protected privacy interest in IP addresses alone”]; In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation (9th Cir. 2020) 956 F.3d 589, 604; U.S. v. Forrester (9th Cir.
2008) 512 F.3d 500, 510.) The operative complaint otherwise lacks any actually
acquired qualifying information for the establishment of a violation. [See
First Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 9-14.] “Record information, the Ninth Circuit explained,
‘includes the name, address, and subscriber number or identity of a subscriber
or customer.’ (Citation.) ...
However, user names, passwords, and geographic location information are not
contents. (Citation.)” (Brodsky v. Apple Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2020) 445 F.Supp.3d 110, 127.) 
 
Plaintiff offers no apparent challenge the current
interpretation governing state law and instead introduces new argument based on
the federal Patriot Act (18 U.S.C. § 3127(3): “the term ‘pen register’ means a
device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or
signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a
wire or electronic communication is transmitted, provided, however, that such
information shall not include the contents of any communication, but such term
does not include any device or process used by a provider or customer of a wire
or electronic communication service for billing, or recording as an incident to
billing, for communications services provided by such provider or any device or
process used by a provider or customer of a wire communication service for cost
accounting or other like purposes in the ordinary course of its business ...” 
 
The court
finds no inherent conflict with the standards. The court however finds lacking
factual support however under the standard.


First and foremost, the operative complaint only
alleges a “device” without any actual specific reference to a mobile phone or
other potential form of communication device potentially qualifying as a
cellular device. [First Amend. Comp., ¶ 20.] Even assuming a qualifying device
was pled, the court agrees with the argument regarding the basis of consent
under the guise of visiting a website, where an IP address may be voluntarily
disclosed. (Heeger v. Facebook, Inc., supra, 509 F.Supp.3d at p. 1190; U.S. v. Forrester, supra,
512 F.3d at p. 510.) At a minimum, it remains unclear from the conclusively
pled complaint how Plaintiff’s information was acquired, including initiation
from a visit to the Hickory Farm website, and whether any protocols were
violated from said visit. The court declines to characterize the “consent”
argument as only available in the form of a defense in that the court cannot
determine qualification under CIPA in the first place. (Brown v. Google LLC (N.D.
Cal. 2021) 525 F.Supp.3d 1049, 1063.)
 
The court also finds public policy strongly disputes
Plaintiff’s potential interpretation of privacy laws as one rendering every
single entity voluntarily visited by a potential plaintiff, thereby providing
an IP address for purposes of connecting the website, as a violator. Such a
broad based interpretation would potentially disrupt a large swath of internet
commerce without further refinement as the precise basis of liability, which
the court declines to consider. Hickory Farms in reply also cites to certain
defined rights and compliance obligations for data collection via internet
connectivity, but the court both finds the argument extrinsic given the paucity
of underlying facts in the operative complaint, as well as depriving Plaintiff
of an opportunity to respond. (Civ. Code, § 1798.100, et seq.)
 
Finally, the court also raises potential concern involving
the requirement of a third party to actually commit a volitional act for
purposes of liability. The conclusive allegations in the first amended
complaint in no way indicates any preexisting relationship between the parties
(e.g. a customer inquiry), or otherwise specifically articulate Hickory Farms
as a third party for purposes of alleging liability. (In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation (9th Cir. 2020) 956 F.3d 589, 606-608; Brodsky v. Apple Inc., supra,
445 F.Supp.3d at p. 127; see Smith v. LoanMe, Inc. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 183, 193-196.)
 
The court sustains the demurrer
with 30 days leave to amend in order to allow Plaintiff an opportunity to
improve the quality of the allegations, rather than concluding an inability to
plead a valid claim upon first review. Plaintiff may not add any new
causes of action or allegations to the previously existing claims. (Harris
v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any new
causes of action added without leave of court may be subject to a motion to
strike. 
 
The court will concurrently conduct the Case Management
Conference. 
 
Hickory Farms to give notice.
