And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Defendant Gabriel Michael Frischer to deem admitted the truth of certain matters specified in requests for admission served on Plaintiff Susan Jalili. The requests for admission were served on August 15, 2024, and Jalili failed to respond to them in a timely manner. The judge grants Frischer's motion and deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted.

The judge also awards Frischer $380.34 in sanctions for the time spent by his attorney and legal assistant in preparing for the hearing and reviewing the motion and declaration. The judge orders Jalili to pay the sanctions by January 29, 2025.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which provides that if a party fails to serve a timely response to requests for admission, the truth of the matters specified in the requests may be deemed admitted. The judge finds that Jalili failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admission and therefore deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted.
