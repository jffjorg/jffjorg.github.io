And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the petition and has ruled that it is denied without prejudice. The petition was filed by Alexander Szuch, the guardian ad litem of minor plaintiff Mason Szuch, seeking expedited approval of a compromise of Mason's claims against Todd Felderstein and others. However, the court found several issues with the petition, including inconsistent figures for the gross settlement amount and unexplained costs listed under "Med Pay". As a result, the court denied the petition, noting that it may be reconsidered if the issues are addressed.
