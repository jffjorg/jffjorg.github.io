```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Kia's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the third cause of action, which asserts that Kia failed to make available sufficient service literature and replacement parts to its authorized service and repair facilities. The court finds that the complaint lacks factual specificity to support this allegation. The plaintiff, Mark Kim, has 14 days from the hearing date to file and serve an amended complaint. The court will continue the case management conference, which is scheduled for today, to a date that is convenient for the parties and the court.
