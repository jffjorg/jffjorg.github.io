And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which concerns a lawsuit filed by Isaac and Elizabeth Boteo against Ford Motor Company and South Bay Ford, Inc. The Boteos are claiming that Ford concealed defects in their 2018 Ford Expedition, which they purchased in September 2018. Ford is arguing that the lawsuit is time-barred because it was filed more than four years after the purchase date.

The Judge has ruled that Ford's demurrer to the Boteos' claims for breach of express warranty is meritless, and that the Boteos' claims are not time-barred. The Judge has also ruled that Ford's demurrer to the Boteos' claim for breach of implied warranty is sustained, and that the Boteos' claim for breach of implied warranty is time-barred. Finally, the Judge has ruled that Ford's demurrer to the Boteos' claim for fraudulent inducement-concealment is sustained, and that the Boteos' claim for fraudulent inducement-concealment is time-barred.
