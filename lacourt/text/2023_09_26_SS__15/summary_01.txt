Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference and set the trial date for January 22, 2024. The plaintiffs, Kathleen Hiland and John Brockett, are seeking preference in the case due to Hiland's serious medical condition, stage IV epithelioid mesothelioma. The judge found that the plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence, including a declaration from Dr. Jiaxin Niu, to meet the clear and convincing standard for granting the motion. The judge also found that the interests of justice would be served by granting the preference, as it would allow Hiland to pursue her case while she is still able to. The defendants, Hyster-Yale Group and Pneumo Abex, had argued that the plaintiffs' moving papers did not provide sufficient medical documentation, but the judge disagreed. The final status conference is set for January 8, 2024, and the parties are to meet and confer on a trial setting order.
