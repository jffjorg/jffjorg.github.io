The Court seeks additional briefing from the defendant (County of Los Angeles) on its arguments that summary judgment should be granted as to the first and ninth causes of action. Specifically, the Court wants the County to provide support for its position that no triable issues of material fact exist as to race-based harassment allegations. The Court also seeks additional briefing from the plaintiff (Delores) on its arguments that triable issues of material fact exist as to the fourth and fifth causes of action, which relate to racial discrimination and age discrimination. The Court will permit the County to file a supplemental separate statement and permit Delores to file a supplemental separate statement.
