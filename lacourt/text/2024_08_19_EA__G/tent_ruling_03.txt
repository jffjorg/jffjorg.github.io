BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from an equipment financing agreement. In  May 2019, Plaintiff Trebar Financial Services, Inc. (Trebar) entered into a  written equipment financing agreement with Defendant Diwan Transport, Inc.  (Diwan Transport) in which Trebar agreed to provide $123,569.00 in financing  for a 2020 Freightliner. In support of the agreement, Defendants Baljit Singh  Khinda, Narinder Singh, Tajinder P. Kaur, and Sukhraj Singh (collectively, the  Singhs) executed personal guaranties. In August 2023, Diwan Transport allegedly  breached the agreement by failing to make payments due. On May  7, 2024, Trebar filed a complaint against Diwan Transport, the Singhs, and Does  1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of promissory note,  (2) breach of guaranty, and (3) account stated. On May  14, 2024, Trebar filed the present applications. A hearing on Trebar’s applications  has been set for August 19, 2024. ANALYSIS Trebar  applies for writs of attachment against Diwan Transport and the Singhs. For the  following reasons, the court GRANTS Trebar’s applications. Legal Standard Attachment  is proper where: (1) “[t]he claim is one upon which an attachment may be  issued;” (2) “plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon  which the attachment is based;” (3) “[t]he attachment is not sought for a  purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is  based;” and (4) “[t]he amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than  zero.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 480.090, subd. (a); see also Bank of  America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 271 (Salinas  Nissan) [party pursuing attachment remedy carries burden of establishing  grounds justifying attachment, including presenting facts that show probable  validity of underlying claim].)¿ The court may issue an attachment on a claim  for money arising under contract, so long as the amount claimed by the party  seeking attachment is reasonably ascertainable in an amount greater than  $500.00. (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (a).) “Probable  validity means that ‘more likely than not’ the plaintiff will obtain a judgment  on that claim.” (Santa Clara Waste  Water Co. v. Allied World National Assurance Co. (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 881,  885, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 481.190.) Plaintiff’s application must “be  supported by an affidavit or declaration showing that the applicant, on the  facts presented, would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment  is based.” (Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp. (2015) 234  Cal.App.4th 937, 944, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 484.030.) The affidavits must  set forth facts with particularity and a verified complaint may be utilized in  lieu of such affidavits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 482.040.) Furthermore, any  documentary evidence must be presented in admissible form. (Id., at p.  944.) Discussion In  this case, attachment is proper because Trebar’s claims involve a contract or a  written agreement. (See Klein v. Benaron (1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 607, 610.)  Additionally, Trebar seeks to secure $96,473.36 which is an amount greater than  zero and for the purposes of recovering on the claims of breach of contract,  breach of guaranty, and account stated. Thus, the court now considers whether  Trebar has established the probable validity of Trebar’s claims. Here, Trebar  argues it is entitled to $92,897.71 for Diwan Transport’s breach of contract in  failing to make payments pursuant to their financing agreement. (Barrett Decl.,  ¶ 11.) To establish a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to  establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or  excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting  damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51  Cal.4th 811, 821.) In  this case, Trebar alleges Diwan Transport entered into a contract in the form  of a financing agreement on May 7, 2019. (Barrett Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) According to the agreement, Trebar agreed  to provide financing for a 2020 Freightliner in exchange for Diwan Transport  making sixty (60) monthly payments of $2,578.49. (Barrett Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 1.) In  support of the agreement, the Singhs executed personal guaranties. (Barrett  Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 2.) Trebar  alleges Trebar performed pursuant to the agreement. (Barrett Decl., ¶ 11.) Further, Trebar  alleges Diwan Transport breached the agreement on August 30, 2023 by failing to  make monthly payments. (Barrett Decl., ¶ 7.) Due to Diwan Transport’s breach, Trebar  alleges they are damaged in the amount of $92,897.71, including $37,137.90 in  payments due and $51,758.01 in collection costs. (Barrett Decl., ¶ 9-11.) Based  on the allegations of Trebar’s declaration, the court finds Trebar has  established the probable validity of Trebar’s breach of contract claims. But  the court notes the sum of the payments due and collection costs only amounts  to $88,895.01. Accordingly, Trebar’s applications for writs of  attachment are GRANTED in the reduced amount of $95,118.76 that includes  $2,800.80 in interest (10% of $88,895.01 divided by 365 = $24.3547972603 per  diem multiplied by 115 days (4/26/2024 – 8/19/2024)), $2,747.95 in attorney  fees, and $675.00 in costs. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Trebar’s  applications for writs of attachment against Diwan Transport and the Singhs are  GRANTED in the reduced amount of $95,118.76.
