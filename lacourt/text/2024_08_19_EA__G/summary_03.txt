Kaur, and Sukhraj Singh) in the reduced amount of $95,118.76. The applications were filed in May 2024 and are related to a breach of contract action arising from an equipment financing agreement entered into in May 2019.

Diwan Transport allegedly breached the agreement by failing to make payments due, resulting in a debt of $88,895.01.
