And here is a brief summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Sam Agha in an employment action brought by Plaintiff Alejandro Banuelos. The plaintiff alleges that he was owed unpaid commissions for May, June, and July 2020 and that the defendant refused to pay him and provide his employment records. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against him and that the plaintiff's claims are preempted by the Workers' Compensation Act. The judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support his claims for wage and hour violations, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and labor code violations.
