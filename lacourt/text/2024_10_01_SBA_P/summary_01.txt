And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation and has granted the motion. The Plaintiff, Dunia Orbeli-Madrid, slipped on cracked eggs while shopping at Defendant's warehouse on August 31, 2022, and alleges that Defendant allowed the substance to remain on the floor for an unreasonable amount of time, creating a dangerous condition.

Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. Defendant provided evidence that an employee inspected the dairy cooler shortly before the Plaintiff's fall and did not see any spills. Defendant also provided a "Daily Floor Walk/Inspection" form, which indicated that the area in question was inspected no more than 20 minutes prior to the Plaintiff's fall.

The Judge found that Defendant has met its burden to show a prima facie case that it was not negligent in the performance of its duty to its customers. The Plaintiff failed to oppose Defendant's motion and failed to provide any evidence to dispute the facts set forth by Defendant. Therefore, the Judge granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
