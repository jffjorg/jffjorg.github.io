The Court has reviewed the petition to change the Petitioner's name and has granted the petition. However, the Court has specified that the Petitioner must review the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the new name is correct and clearly written, no appearance is necessary. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing.
