```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ordered the Clerk's Office to re-run a criminal history assessment on the Petitioner and provide a clearer notation on any convictions, including those that require sex offender registration. The notation currently states "no information found," which is vague and ambiguous, leaving it unclear whether the Petitioner has a criminal history or not. The case is continued to May 20, 2024, at 9:30 am.
