The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and provides guidance on the process for submitting a corrected proposed decree. If the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
