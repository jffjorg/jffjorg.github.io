This tentative ruling is regarding a petition for name change. The Judge has granted the petition, but with a condition. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree with their new name to ensure that the spelling and legibility are correct. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the decree, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge will provide a copy of the signed decree to the Clerk's Office, and once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change the name.
