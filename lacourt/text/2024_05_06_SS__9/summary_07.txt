The judge's tentative ruling concerns a petition for a name change. The Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of their new name on the proposed decree. If the name is clear and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing.
