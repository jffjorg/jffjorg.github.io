And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The tentative ruling grants the petition for name change, subject to the Petitioner verifying the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing."
