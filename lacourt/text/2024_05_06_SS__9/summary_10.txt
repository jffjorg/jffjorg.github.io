"The court has granted the petition to change the petitioner's name. The petitioner must ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the new name is not correctly spelled or written, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date."
