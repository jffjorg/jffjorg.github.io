And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling sets forth the Judge's thoughts on the case prior to the hearing. The Judge requires that the Petitioner double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the result, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge grants the petition and notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. The signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
