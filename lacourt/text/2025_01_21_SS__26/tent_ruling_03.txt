 Case Number:  23STLC04641    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  26 Sunrun Inc. v. Rivera, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:  
Plaintiff Sunrun, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.  
ANALYSIS: 
Plaintiff Sunrun, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for (1) possession of personal property; (2) breach of contract; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) quantum meruit against Defendant Victor M. Rivera (“Defendant”) on July 24, 2023. Defendant filed an answer in properia persona on August 16, 2023. On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the first Motion for Summary
Judgment. The first Motion came for hearing on August 14, 2024 and was denied
on the grounds that it was mis-noticed as a motion for summary judgment but
actually sought summary adjudication of the second cause of action for breach
of contract. (Minute Order, 08/14/24.) 
On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the causes of action
for possession of personal property, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit.
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment on October 18, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
Discussion 
Allegations in the Complaint 
The Complaint alleges that
the parties entered into a lease agreement for a certain photovoltaic solar
system (“the Solar System”) on February 28, 2017. (Compl., ¶4 and Exh. A.)
Pursuant to the lease, Plaintiff installed the Solar System on the real
property located at 7002 Calvin Avenue, Reseda, California. (Ibid.) In
exchange, Defendant promised to purchase all the energy produced by the
Solar System by making monthly lease payments in the initial amount of $62.00
per month, subject to a 2.5% increase annually, for a term of twenty (20)
years. (Ibid.) Plaintiff completed installation of the Solar System on
April 19, 2017. (Id. at ¶6.) Around November 19, 2019, Plaintiff noted
that the Solar System meter had stopped functioning and initiated a field
service appointment to determine the reason. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) On
information and belief, Defendant removed, or authorized the removal of the
Solar System from the Subject Property because other solar panels and related
equipment had been installed on the Subject Property in place of Plaintiff’s
Solar System. (Id. at
¶9.) Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice of Material Breach on December
15, 2019. (Id. at ¶10 and Exh. B.) Defendant did not cure the default
and is in breach of the contract. (Id. at ¶¶11-13.) Plaintiff is
entitled to certain remedies, including, but not limited to, terminating the
Contract and requiring Defendant to pay to Plaintiff a payment equal to the
estimated prepayment of all future monthly lease payments to be made during the
initial term the Contract (the “Make Whole Payment”). (Id. at ¶14.) The Make Whole Payment due as of the filing of the Complaint
is $18,357.00. (Id. at ¶15.) The contract also provides that Plaintiff
may disconnect or take possession of the Solar System upon default. (Id.
at ¶16.) Plaintiff is entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of the
Solar System and immediate payment of the Make Whole Payment. (Id. at
¶¶18, 25.)
Summary Judgment
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, which provides “[a] party may
move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that the
action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) On a motion for summary judgment,
a moving plaintiff must show that there is no defense by proving each element
of every cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the
defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as
to the causes of action or a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the Court must view the “evidence
[citations] and such inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the
opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72,
81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843].)
The elements for a claim of breach of contract are: (1) the
contract; (2) plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) resulting damages. (Otworth
v. So. Pacific Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458; Lortz
v. Connell (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 286, 290.) Plaintiff presents the
following facts in support of its initial burden of proof.
On February 28, 2017, the parties entered into the Sunrun
BrightSave Lease Agreement (“the Contract”) for Defendant to lease a certain
photovoltaic solar system (“the Solar System”). (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 1; Gazotti Decl., ¶4 and Exh. A., p. 21) In exchange, Defendant
promised to purchase all the energy produced by the Solar System by making
monthly lease payments to Plaintiff in the initial amount of $62.00 per month,
subject to a 2.5% increase annually, for a term of twenty (20) years. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Gazotti Decl., ¶4 and Exh. A, §B.) Plaintiff
completed its installation of the Solar System at 7002 Calvin Ave, Reseda, California
(“the Subject Property”) on April 29, 2017. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 2; Gazotti Decl., ¶6.) From that date, the Solar System was fully
operational. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Gazotti Decl., ¶6.) Under
the Contract, Plaintiff would design, install, retain ownership of, maintain,
and monitor the Solar System for the duration of the Contract. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Gazotti Decl., ¶5.) Defendant breached the
Contract by removing the Solar System without Plaintiff’s authorization.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Gazotti Decl., ¶7.) Plaintiff
performed all its obligations under the Contract. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 5; Gazotti Decl., ¶10.) Defendant owes $18,375.00 under the Contract
as of the filing date of this Motion. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6;
Gazotti Decl., ¶¶8-12 and Exh. B.)
This evidence carries Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof as
to each element of the cause of action for breach of contract. The burden now
shifts to Defendant to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material
fact as to any of these elements. Defendant, however, has not filed any
opposition to the Motion.
Conclusion 
Therefore, Plaintiff Sunrun,
Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
Moving party to give notice.
