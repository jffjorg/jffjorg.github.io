And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Kimberly Engeln's Motion for Leave to Withdraw Improperly Propounded Discovery and Re-Propound Discovery Within CCP § 94 Limits; or, in the alternative, Motion for Leave to Conduct Additional Discovery Pursuant to CCP § 95. The judge found that Defendant's request to withdraw discovery was not supported by statutory or caselaw authority, and that Defendant had not shown that it would be unable to defend the action effectively without the additional discovery. The judge also noted that Defendant's opposition failed to explain what additional discovery was crucial to the defense in light of the responses received from Plaintiff.
