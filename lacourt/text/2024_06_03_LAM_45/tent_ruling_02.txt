Motion to Compel Inspection of Real Property
 
            The court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition was received.
The court GRANTS the motion to compel inspection
of real property. Sanctions in the amount of $1,526.65 are imposed against Defendant.
Background
            On August 29, 2022 Plaintiffs Suzanne M. Emerson and
Austin J. Cook (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
Jeffrey L. Martin (“Martin”) for (1) partition (CCP § 872.230), (2) breach of
contract, (3) fraud, (4) conversion, and (5) theft (Penal Code § 496(c)). On
December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs substituted Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. for
Doe 1. 
            On January 17, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant unopposed motion.
Legal
Standard
            Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, of control of any other party to the
action. (CCP § 2031.010, subd. (a).) A party may demand that any other party
produce and permit the party making the demand, or someone acting on the
demanding party’s behalf, to inspect and to photograph, test, or sample any
tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party on
whom the demand is made. (CCP § 2031.010, subd. (c).) A party may demand that
any other party allow the party making the demand, or someone acting on the
demanding party’s behalf, to enter onto any land or other property that is in
the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made,
and to inspect and to measure, survey, photograph, test, or sample the land or
other property, or any designated object or operation on it. (CCP § 2031.010,
subd. (d).)
            The
party to whom a demand for inspection has been directed shall respond
separately to each item or category of item with: (1) a statement that the
party will comply with the particular demand for inspection; (2) a
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for
inspection; or (3) an objection to the particular demand for inspection. (CCP §
2031.210, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs
provide the declaration of counsel who attests that despite demands to vacate
the property, Defendant has refused to leave and has prevented Plaintiffs from
inspecting and/or exerting control over the property. (Fisher Decl., ¶5.) Counsel
sent a Request to Inspect the real property on November 7, 2023, and an amended
request due to a clerical error. (Id. at ¶¶6-7, Exhs. A-B.) Defense
counsel stated that Plaintiffs’ counsel could contact Defendant directly. (Id.
at ¶8, Exh. C.) Defendant did not reply to Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Ibid.)
Defense counsel thereafter substituted out. (Id. at ¶9.) Plaintiffs’
counsel hired attorney support to videotape the inspection and went to the
property on December 8, 2024 after leaving a phone message the day before to
confirm, but received no response from Defendant. (Id. at ¶10.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel sent another email to Defendant asking for a mutually
convenient date for the inspection, but never heard back. (Id. at ¶11,
Exh. D.)
As Plaintiffs’
requested the inspection, and Defendant has failed to respond or allow them
access to the property without valid objections, the court GRANTS the motion. 
Defendant is
ORDERED to permit inspection of the property within 20 days of this ORDER.
Plaintiffs also
request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,976.65. The court finds that
sanctions are warranted. (CCP § 2031.320(b).) Sanctions may be awarded even
though no opposition was filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). The court finds the
request excessive. Counsel anticipates spending another 6 hours to appear at
the hearing and draft the order but does not justify why this would take that
amount of time. The court finds that $1,526.65 (4.5hrs x $300/hr., plus fees)
is a reasonable amount in sanctions. (See Fisher Decl., ¶12.)
Defendant is
ORDERED to pay $1,526.65 in sanctions to Plaintiffs within 20 days of this
Order.
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
