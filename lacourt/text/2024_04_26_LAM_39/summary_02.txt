And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that emails between Mabel Frias and her attorneys transmitted through Luna Magic's server on or after April 12, 2022, are not privileged. The judge found that Mabel Frias agreed to be bound by Luna Magic's employee handbook, which includes policies on access to technology resources. The judge also found that Mabel Frias did not satisfy the criteria for privilege prior to April 12, 2022. The judge granted Luna Magic's motion in part and denied it in part. The judge ordered that the parties would discuss whether in-camera review was necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
