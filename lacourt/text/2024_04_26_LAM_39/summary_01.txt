And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a court decision that grants the motion to discharge the writ of mandate issued by the court in a case involving the City of Los Angeles and the United Neighborhoods for Los Angeles. The writ was issued to compel the City to set aside its determination that a hotel project was categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The City complied with the writ by rescinding its approvals and determinations. The court found that the City's return showed that it had satisfied the writ's terms and that the writ should be discharged. The court rejected the plaintiff's objections to the return, including claims that the City had continued to work on the project and that new project approvals were invalid. The court held that the writ's discharge was proper and that the City had complied with the writ.
