And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, L and R Auto Parks, Inc., alleges that the defendants, Ocean Blue Investments, LLC, et al., terminated their management agreement in breach of contract. The plaintiff seeks to re-install itself as the parking management company pending trial. The court finds that the plaintiff has not established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, as the plaintiff failed to account for 11 years of expenses due to its own negligence and took matters into its own hands by withholding payments from the defendants. The court also finds that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law for monetary damages and that the defendants' actions did not cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff's business operations.
