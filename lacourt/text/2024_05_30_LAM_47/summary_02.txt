And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for order authorizing service of process for S3D Partners, LLC via service on the California Secretary of State. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to properly pay their wages and seek to serve the defendants with process. The court finds that the defendants' agent for service of process cannot be found with reasonable diligence and that attempts to serve the agent by personal service or substitute service have been unsuccessful. The court also finds that the defendants cannot be served with reasonable diligence by mail with acknowledgment and receipt. Therefore, the court grants the motion and allows service of process to be made via service on the California Secretary of State.
