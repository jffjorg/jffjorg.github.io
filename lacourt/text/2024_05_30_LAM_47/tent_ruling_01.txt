STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for equitable indemnity that was filed on May 26, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that that Defendant failed to maintain insurance for Workers’
Compensation, causing Plaintiff to bear the liability to an employee on a
successful workers’ compensation claim. 
 
Attorney Abe G. Salen of Wesierski
& Zurek, LLP moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Abe G. Salen of Wesierski
& Zurek, LLP moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s
declaration states that they served Defendants by mail and confirmed the
address is current by mail, return receipt requested. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, the matter is not yet set for trial.
The only hearings currently scheduled are a series of Status Conferences on
June 24, 2024, July 5, 2024, and September 25, 2024. The risk of prejudice to Defendant
is low because the case has not yet been set for trial. Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that there are irreconcilable differences between counsel
and Defendant rendering continued representation extremely difficult, including
nonpayment of fees and a breakdown in communications. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) In light of
the evidence of the breakdown in the relationship and the relative distance of
trial, the Court finds that these circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
            Accordingly, Attorney Abe
G. Salen of Wesierski & Zurek, LLP’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for
Defendant BaronHR, LLC is GRANTED.
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel serving written notice of this order on
all parties and filing proof of service with the Court. 
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
