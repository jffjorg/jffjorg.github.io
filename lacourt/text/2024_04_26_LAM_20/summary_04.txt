And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Motion to Compel in part, requiring the production of certain documents from December 1, 2017, until May 1, 2020. The Court has temporarily narrowed the scope of the subpoena to focus on this specific time period. The Court finds that the testimony of Michel Amar, a Defendant, is unclear and that there is an interrelationship between BMI and the Defendants. The Court also notes that BMI was formed close in time to when Yang alleges that the Defendants began a campaign to force Yang out of Bit.Management. The Court has declined to award sanctions. The Court orders that the documents are to be produced within 30 days.
