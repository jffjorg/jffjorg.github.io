And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses two related cases, 21STCV18241 and 21STCV18469, in which Plaintiff Brendan Schulz is suing Pitzer College and others for alleged discrimination and mishandling of his concussion injury. Pitzer College seeks to compel the deposition of Plaintiff, citing his failure to provide a date for the deposition. However, Plaintiff contends that his health issues, including a potentially terminal condition, have made it difficult for him to participate in the deposition process. The Court has decided to require the depositions to take place within 60 days, rejecting Plaintiff's request for an indefinite delay. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.
