The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chalmers-Walnut, LLC v. Luxy Custom Flooring, Inc., Mimi L. Lin, and All Unnamed Occupants of or in Use of the Premises, denying Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The Plaintiff seeks default judgment in the total amount of $142,560.65, including $40,382.86 in past-due rent, $97,459.04 in holdover damages, $4,002.50 in attorney fees, and $716.25 in costs. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff's calculations contain errors, including unclear determination of principal amount of past-due rent and inclusion of other past-due rents that have accrued before and/or after service of the 3-Day Notice. Additionally, Plaintiff's request for attorney fees does not comply with Local Rule 3.214, and the amount sought seems excessive. The Court has denied Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
