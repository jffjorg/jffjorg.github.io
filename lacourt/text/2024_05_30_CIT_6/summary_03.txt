And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiffs' motion to disqualify Jorn S. Rossi as counsel for the defendants. The court finds that Rossi represented both Jesse and John in connection with the drafting of the shareholder agreement, which forms part of the basis of this action. The court also finds that Rossi communicated directly with Jesse regarding these matters and obtained confidential information from Jesse. Therefore, the court finds that Rossi is presumed to have had access to confidential information and his disqualification is mandatory. The court sets a status conference re representation of the corporate defendants at the hearing on this motion.
