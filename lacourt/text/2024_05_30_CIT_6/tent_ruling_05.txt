 Case Number:  24PSCV00085    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Chalmers-Walnut, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants: Luxy Custom Flooring, Inc., Mimi L. Lin, and All
Unnamed Occupants of or in Use of the Premises 
COURT RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a commercial unlawful detainer action. On January 5, 2024, plaintiff
Chalmers-Walnut, LLC (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Luxy
Custom Flooring, Inc., Mimi L. Lin, All Unnamed Occupants of or in Use of the
Premises (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 50, alleging the sole
cause of action for unlawful detainer. On February 6, 2024, default was entered
against the Defendants. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry
of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed
form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits
as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by
the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $142,560.65, including
$40,382.86 in past-due rent, $97,459.04 in holdover damages (i.e., 112 days
from December 13, 2023 to April 2, 2024 x $870.17 per day), $4,002.50 in
attorney fees, and $716.25 in costs. The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
calculations contain some issues that need to be addressed. First, it is
unclear how Plaintiff determined the principal amount of past-due rent.
Plaintiff indicates that the initial amount of past-due rent at the time of
serving the 3-Day Notice on December 8, 2023, was $60,996.20, comprised of base
rent, late charges, and common area operating expenses (CAM) from October 1,
2023 through December 7, 2023. (Devling Decl., ¶¶ 16, Ex. 2.) But, the monthly
rental rate at that time was $26,105.00. (Id., ¶ 10, Ex. 1.) Two months
of unpaid rent based on that rate would be $52,210.00, leaving a difference of $8,786.20.
Two months of CAM expenses of $870.00 would only add up to $1,740.00, (see Id.,
¶ 11), which leaves a difference of $7,046.20. Two late charges of 10% would
only add up to $5,221.00 (i.e., $2,610.50, 10% of $26,105.00, multiplied by 2),
leaving a difference of $1,825.20. It is unclear to what extent the past-due
rent is based on the month of December 2023, given that the rent was due on the
1st and the notice was served on December 8, 2023, and states that
it includes amounts due through December 7, 2023. (See Id., ¶¶ 12-18.) 
Second, it
appears Plaintiff is attempting to include other past-due rents that have
accrued before and/or after service of the 3-Day Notice. While Plaintiff
acknowledges having received partial payments following service of the 3-Day
Notice, (Devling Decl., ¶ 25), Plaintiff seeks to add $5,920.16 in undefined past-due
CAM expenses for the whole year of 2023, not just the period between October 1,
2023 and December 7, 2023, as well as $2,610.00 in CAM expenses for an
undefined period of time and an additional $7,831.50 in past-due rent for an
undefined period of time. (See Id., ¶ 25, Ex. 2.) Some of this seems as
though it may be duplicative of the amount sought in the 3-Day Notice and the
daily holdover damages rate of $870.17 sought in the complaint and request for
entry of default judgment. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ 2, 3; Request for
Entry of Default Judgment (3/26/24), ¶ 2, subd. (g).) Any other damages, other
than holdover damages, must be sought in a separate action for breach of
contract. (See Hudec v. Robertson (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1156, 1163.) Further,
the Court will not allow for holdover damages that could have been avoided had
Plaintiff requested a Clerk’s Judgment for possession only to recover
possession of the premises and then a separate Court Judgment for money
damages. This is particularly pertinent here where possession is not obtained
because Plaintiff’s request for default judgment contains errors. 
Third, Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees
does not appear to consider Local Rule 3.214, which prescribes formulas for
attorney fees calculations in default judgments. (Local Rule 3.214.) Also, the
amount sought seems excessive for a default judgment. Moreover, the timesheet
provided by Plaintiff’s counsel provides no explanation as to how it determined
this amount, but instead provides only a lump sum without any explanation of
hours expended or the hourly rate. (Taitelman Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) The timesheet
also does not match the costs purportedly incurred, i.e., $1,070.01 instead of
the $716.25 in costs requested. (See Id.) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
