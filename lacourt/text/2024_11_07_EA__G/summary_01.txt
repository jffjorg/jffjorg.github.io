And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Edward Zheng's petition to vacate the arbitrator's order to comply with a deposition subpoena. The arbitrator had issued the subpoena as part of an arbitration proceeding between Stone Barkley Company LLC (SBC) and United Safety Technology Inc. (UST) over a commercial lease agreement. Zheng argued that the arbitrator lacked authority to order his compliance as a non-party to the arbitration agreement. However, the judge found that the arbitration agreement did incorporate the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.05, which allows for depositions in arbitration proceedings. The judge also found that the arbitrator was within its authority to order Zheng's deposition, as the arbitration agreement specifically allowed for the arbitrator to order the deposition of third-party witnesses. Zheng's claims that there was no factual need for his deposition and that the purpose of the deposition was to harass him were unsupported by evidence. The judge's ruling denies Zheng's petition and upholds the arbitrator's order to comply with the deposition subpoena.
