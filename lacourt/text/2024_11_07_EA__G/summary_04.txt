And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Jiefeng Cao and Everflow Renovations. The defendants are attempting to dismiss the entire complaint filed by plaintiffs Hubert Co and Linh Trac. The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer, as required by law. Specifically, the defendants' counsel only attempted to contact opposing counsel by email, which is not a code-compliant means of meeting and conferring. The judge orders the defendants' counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel in person or by telephone and to file a supplemental declaration describing these efforts. The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike is continued to a date to be determined.
