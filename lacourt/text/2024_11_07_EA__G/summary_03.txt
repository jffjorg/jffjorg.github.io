And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro) has moved to quash a business records subpoena served on Bender Rosenthal Inc. (Bender Rosenthal) by the Foxes. The court has granted LA Metro's motion. The subpoena requested a broad category of documents relating to Bender Rosenthal's appraisal of the City of Industry property, which is the subject of the eminent domain action. LA Metro argues that the requested documents are inadmissible because they are an appraisal report and summary of an appraisal, which are prohibited from being considered as evidence of admission or as an offer of compromise. The Foxes argue that the documents are necessary to object to the validity of LA Metro's pre-condemnation offer, but the court finds that this is not a valid basis for requesting the documents. The court also finds that the documents are not necessary to bring a motion to increase LA Metro's deposit of probable just compensation. Therefore, the court grants LA Metro's motion to quash the subpoena.
