The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendants, Stance Construction Company and Ahmad Elrabaa. The plaintiff, Developers Surety and Indemnity Company, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $646,107.19, including $600,855.54 in damages, $32,100.50 in interest, $11,896.50 in attorney fees, and $1,254.35 in costs. However, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege a specific amount of damages, and therefore, the plaintiff must amend its complaint before seeking a default judgment. The judge is setting an OSC Re: Default Judgment for November 7, 2024, to allow the parties to address the issues raised in the tentative ruling.
