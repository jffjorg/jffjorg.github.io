And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to disqualify Claudia Borsutzki and Friedman & Chapman from representing the plaintiff in this case. The plaintiff, Elizabeth Reyes, is suing the defendant, Cedar Green, LLC, for failing to maintain habitable conditions in her dwelling. The defendant claims that Borsutzki, who now works for Friedman & Chapman, previously represented the defendant in this matter and acquired confidential information. The judge finds that Borsutzki's declaration lacks personal knowledge and is hearsay, and that she did not obtain written consent from the defendant to represent the plaintiff. The judge also finds that Friedman & Chapman did not seek or obtain written consent from the defendant to represent the plaintiff. Therefore, the court disqualifies Borsutzki and Friedman & Chapman from representing the plaintiff.
