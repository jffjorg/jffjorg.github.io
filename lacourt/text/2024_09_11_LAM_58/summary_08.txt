And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Johnny Gill's Motion to Quash Service of Summons. The motion was filed on August 13, 2024, and no opposition was filed by the plaintiff. The defendant claimed that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint, as he was in Georgia performing at concerts on July 20 and 21, 2024. The defendant attached evidence to support his claim, including a flight confirmation receipt and a flyer for the concerts. The judge found that the defendant had presented sufficient evidence to challenge the court's personal jurisdiction, and since the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the burden shifted to the plaintiff to establish jurisdiction through proper service. Since the plaintiff did not present evidence to establish jurisdiction, the judge granted the motion and quashed the service of summons.
