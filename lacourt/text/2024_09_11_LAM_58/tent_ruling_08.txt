On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff Dwell
California Real Estate & Investment, Inc. (“Dwell”) filed an action against
Defendants Johnny Gill, Compass California, Inc., Kathy Mehringer, Lilach
Basson, the Beverly Hills Estates, Inc., Branden Brent Williams, Rayni Romito
Williams, Gregory Allan La Plant, Jerica Leanna Juncker Jensen, and Twana
Henry, for (1) real estate broker commission, (2) interfering with prospective
economic advantage, and (3) tortious interference with contract.  Plaintiff’s claims arise from a real estate
transaction between the parties.
 
On August 13, 2024, Defendant Johnny
Gill (Gill) moved to quash service of summons (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“‘Service
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.’
[Citation.]”  (AO Alfa-Bank v.
Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.)  “To establish personal jurisdiction,
compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  Defendant’s
knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory requirements for
service of summons.  (Kappel v.
Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.)
 
            “A defendant, on or before the last
day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may
for good cause allow” may move “to quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her” that results from lack of
proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1)). 

 
            “When a defendant challenges the
court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’”  (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)
 
“Evidence Code section 647 provides
that a registered process server’s declaration of service establishes a
presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in
the declaration.  [Citation.]”  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code, § 647.)
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
Gill specially appears to quash service of summons and complaint on the basis
that he was not properly served and, thus, the Court has not acquired personal
jurisdiction over him.  (Mot. p. 2.)
 
            On
August 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed Proof of Service indicating that Gill was
personally served with the summons and complaint on July 20, 2024, at 2:28 p.m.
at 19237 Charles Street, Tarzana, CA 91356.  These papers were served by Brian Essah of
South Bay Attorney Service, who is a registered California process server.  Pursuant to Evidence Code section 647, the
Proof of Service by a registered California process server creates a
presumption of proper service.
 
            Gill
has submitted his declaration in support of the Motion.  He states that he was never served with the
summons and complaint as he was in the State of Georgia performing at two
concerts on July 20 and July 21, 2024. 
(Gill Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Gill has
attached a copy of his flight confirmation receipt showing that he flew from
Los Angeles, California, to Atlanta, Georgia, on July 19, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 5, Ex. A.)  He has also attached a copy of a flyer to
show the concerts scheduled for July 20 and 21 in Stockbridge, Georgia, at 6:00
p.m.  (Id. at ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  He asserts that he did not return to
California until July 28, 2024.  (Id.
at ¶ 7.)
 
            Defense
counsel has also submitted her declaration stating that she informed
Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant Gill had been outside of California on the
date of service.  (Sedaghatfar Decl. ¶ 3,
Ex. B.)  Plaintiff’s counsel initially
responded to her email asking if she would accept service; she replied that she
was not authorized to accept service.  (Ibid.)  Subsequently, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an
email claiming that Defendant Gill had been properly served.  (Id. at ¶ 4, Ex. C.)
 
            The
Court finds that the Motion was filed timely.
 
            Defendant
has presented sufficient evidence to challenge the Court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service. 
Thus, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff to establish the existence of
jurisdiction through proper service. 
Plaintiff has not opposed the Motion to present such evidence.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
 
Conclusion
 
            The
Court grants Defendant Johnny Gill’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons.
