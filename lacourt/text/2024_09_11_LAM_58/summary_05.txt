And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ramer v. Cimmaron, Inc. The ruling states that the demurrer filed by the defendants is overruled. The plaintiff, Bruce Ramer, chartered a boat from the defendants, Cimmaron, Inc., Ken Newman, and Brandie Newman, and alleges that the captain and crew were not properly licensed and that the vessel was operated in a manner that threatened safety.

The judge finds that the complaint adequately states a claim for relief and that the defendants' arguments are often factual challenges that are inappropriate for a demurrer. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has pleaded adequate damages and that the issue of damages will be determined at trial.

The judge also rules on the defendants' alter ego allegations, finding that the allegations are adequate and that the court will not disregard the corporate entity.

The ruling concludes that the demurrer is overruled and that the defendants shall serve and file their answer on or before October 2, 2024.
