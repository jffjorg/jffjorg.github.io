And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the petition filed by Kimberly Jenner Kardashian, Jr. to change her name to Ken La Kardashian and to change her gender and sex identifier to "nonbinary". The judge has discretion to deny the petition if there are substantial and principled reasons for doing so. In this case, the court finds that the petition is inconsistent, as the petitioner requests a change of name and gender and sex identifier, but also requests a change to "female". Additionally, the petitioner is required to provide an explanation for the name change, but has not done so. Therefore, the court denies the petition.
