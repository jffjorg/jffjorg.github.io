In the Matter of: Kimberly Jenner Kardashian, Jr.
Monday,

[TENTATIVE] ORDER
DENYING
 PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
            The Court has
considered the Petition filed by Kimberly
 Jenner Kardashian, Jr., to change name to Ken La
 Kardashian.    
            The
Court has discretion to deny the petition where “there are substantial and
principled reasons for denying [it].  …
(In re Ross (1937) 8 Cal.2d 608, 610, 67 P.2d 94 [need some substantial reason
for denial]; Lee v. Superior Court, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p. 515, 11
Cal.Rptr.2d 763 [court may properly deny petition if name adopted to defraud,
intentionally confuse, or intrude into someone's privacy or violate recognized
public policy.” (In re Arnett (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 654, 661). 
At
common law a person's name consisted of a given name and of a surname or family
name. (In re Ritchie (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 1070, 1073). The Criminal History Assessment filed on May 8,
2024, reflects that “Kimberly Jenner Kardashian, Jr.” is not Petitioner’s given
name. The name associated with the Social Security Number provided is Jerome
Eady. 
The
Petition is inconsistent as Petitioner requests a change of gender and sex
identifier to “nonbinary”, however, Petitioner’s declaration requests a change
to “female.” (Compare Pet.,
item 1 and dec. on page 2.) Additionally, Petitioner is required to provide an
explanation for the name change. (Pet., item 7.c.)
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES the petition.
