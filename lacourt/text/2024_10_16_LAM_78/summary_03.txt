Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion for additional attorney fees. The court found that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff were intended to be addressed in their entirety at the time the $768,000 was awarded and incorporated as part of the judgment. Plaintiff had sought additional fees for work related to the hillside replanting issue and for the period beginning in March 2024 through the date of the hearing. The court concluded that the prior court intended to address attorney fees only once and that Plaintiff's motion for additional fees was therefore denied.
