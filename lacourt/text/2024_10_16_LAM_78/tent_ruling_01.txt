  Case Number:  23STCV17018    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  10/16/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  23STCV17018 PABLO GOMEZ LUNA, et al. vs BRYAN RUBIO REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  BRYAN RUBIO RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $18,219.98 Interest: $18,726.56 Costs: $585.00 TOTAL: $37,531.54  TENTATIVE  This is an action for breach of contract and common counts. Plaintiffs Pablo Gomez Luna (“Luna”) and Lucas Logistics, Inc. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege that defendants Bryan Rubio (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10 entered into a written agreement for Plaintiffs to loan Defendant money for his personal use. “Defendant was to pay the money, $3,500.00 at an interest rate of 2% a month and a pre-loan payment of 3% ($300.00). The loan term would be for one (I) months, due an payable on April 1, 2021. In addition, Defendant was to pay for any and all credit card uses of Plaintiffs credit card from April 1, 2021, in the amount of $ 15,092.00. Defendant agreed to pay a monthly payment of $ 1,500.00. Defendant failed to repay the loan and credit card charges.” (Compl. p. 3.)  On default judgment, Plaintiffs request $18,219.98 in principal damages, $18,726.56 in interest, $2,250 in attorney fees, and $585 in costs. On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff Luna filed an amended affidavit in support of the amounts sought.  The request for $18,219.98 in principal damages for the first and second contracts is granted. The request for interest at 2% starting on May 1, 2021 for each loan in the amount of $18,726.56 is also granted. The request for $585.00 in costs for clerk’s filing fees and process server’s fees are allowable costs, and therefore granted. (CCP § 1033.5(a).)  However, the request for $2,250.00 in attorney fees is unsupported and denied. Plaintiff Luna declares the contract did not specifically provide for attorney fees, but instead argues that Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney’s fees based on California Civil Code § 1717. Just because an action is premised upon a contract does not automatically entitle a party to attorney’s fees. California Civil Code § 1717(a) states, in relevant part, “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party…” Because the contract does not specifically provide for attorney’s fees, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any. ¿   Based on the foregoing, the application for default judgment filed on May 7, 2024, is GRANTED in the total principal amount of $18,219.98, prejudgment interest of $18,726.56, and $585.00 in costs against defendant Bryan Rubio.¿  Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.¿
