MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Beverly Hills

RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan
(1)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 45, 46,
65, 66, and 68.
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 122-138
The court

connection with each motion.  
 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, NOS. 45, 46, 65, 66, AND 68
Defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC (“Defendant”) moves
the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan (“Plaintiff”)
to provide further verified answers to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set
One, numbers 45, 46, 65, 66, and 68, and 
 (2) awarding sanctions in favor
of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,162.50.
The court notes that Plaintiff filed, on January 8, 2024, a “Qualified
Opposition to Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
Set One and Set Three,” asserting that Plaintiff served verified responses to, inter
alia, Special Interrogatories numbers 45, 46, 65, 66, and 68 on January 8,
2024.  (Opp., p. 1:21-23.)  However, Plaintiff did not submit evidence
showing that those responses were served. 
The court therefore evaluates Defendant’s motion based on the responses
served by Plaintiff on March 17, 2023. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶ 8.) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further answers
to Special Interrogatories, numbers 45-46, 65-66, and 68 because (1) the
answers to the interrogatories are evasive and incomplete, and (2) the
objections to the interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(3).)
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)  The court finds that $1,650 (6
hours x $275 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against
Plaintiff in connection with this motion. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶ 19.) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET THREE, NOS. 122-138
Defendant moves the court for an order (1) compelling Plaintiff to
serve further answers to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three,
numbers 122-138, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and
against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,475.
The court notes that Plaintiff filed, on January 8, 2024, a “Qualified
Opposition to Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
Set One and Set Three,” asserting that Plaintiff served verified responses to, inter
alia, Special Interrogatories numbers 122-138.  (Opp., p. 1:21-23.)  However, Plaintiff did not submit evidence
showing that those responses were served. 
The court therefore evaluates Defendant’s motion based on the responses
served by Plaintiff on March 17, 2023. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶ 3.) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further answers
to Special Interrogatories, numbers 122-127 because the objections to those
interrogatories are without merit.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)  
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further answers
to Special Interrogatories, numbers 128-136 because those interrogatories,
which request information from Plaintiff and anyone acting on her behalf (which
may include her attorney), are overbroad since they also call for information
that is protected by the attorney work product protection and therefore the
objections in those interrogatories are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(3); Hassell Decl., Ex. A, Special Interrogatories, Set Three, p. 3,
§ (a) [defining “YOU” and “YOUR” to be “responding party and to any PERSON
acting on his/her behalf”].) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further answers
to Special Interrogatories, numbers 137-138 because the answers to those
interrogatories are evasive and incomplete. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
            In light of the mixed results of the
court’s ruling on this motion, the court finds that the circumstances presented
make the imposition of sanctions unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)  The court therefore denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions.
