The court has ruled on two motions: a motion for discovery sanctions or a protective order filed by the plaintiffs, and a motion to continue trial and reopen discovery filed by the defendant. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion and ordered that the defendant may not introduce certain evidence at trial. The court also denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to pay monetary sanctions to the plaintiffs in the amount of $4,616.30. The court found that the defendant had engaged in a misuse of the discovery process by failing to produce documents, intentionally withholding documents from the plaintiffs, and failing to disclose evidence in a timely manner.
