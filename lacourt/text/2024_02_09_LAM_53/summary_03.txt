And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that defendant Navigators Specialty Insurance Company's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents is moot. This is because the court previously found that plaintiff rifm properties, llc failed to amend its complaint against defendant Navigators within the time ordered, and therefore Navigators was entitled to an order dismissing the action against it with prejudice. The court entered judgment in favor of Navigators and against plaintiff on October 20, 2023. As a result, the court orders that Navigators' motion is taken off calendar.
