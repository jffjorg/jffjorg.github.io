[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to (1)
  form interrogatories, (2) special interrogatories, and (3) requests for
  production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Navigators Specialty
Insurance Company
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Motion to Compel Responses to (1) Form Interrogatories, (2) Special
Interrogatories, and (3) Requests for Production of Documents
Defendant Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (“Navigators”) filed
the pending motion to compel plaintiff RIFM Properties LLC (“Plaintiff”) to
provide responses to Navigators’ form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and requests for production of documents on June 16, 2022. 
On September 9, 2022, the court sustained Navigators’ demurrer with
leave to amend and granted Plaintiff 20 days leave to file a Second Amended
Complaint.  (Sep. 9, 2022 Order, p.
8:14-16, 8:19-20.)  The Second Amended
Complaint omitted Navigators as a defendant. 
(SAC p. 2:1-3 [“For its Second Amended Complaint against Defendants
Benveniste & Francke Insurance Services, Daniel Francke, and DOES
1-10”].)  Because Plaintiff did not amend
its complaint against defendant Navigators within the time ordered by the
court, the court found that Navigators was entitled to an order dismissing the
action against it with prejudice.  (May
16, 2023 Order, pp. 4:19-20, 5:10-12.) 
The court entered judgment in favor of Navigators and against Plaintiff on
October 20, 2023. 
Thus, the court finds that Navigators’ motion is moot. 
The court orders that Navigators Specialty Insurance Company’s motion
to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production is taken off calendar. 
The court directs the clerk to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 9, 2024
