Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting Grandtag's motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed on November 15, 2024, within 10 days after service of the court's order. However, the judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to provide genuinely new or different facts, circumstances, or law to justify reconsideration. The plaintiffs' arguments are based on information that was available at the time of the original ruling, and they have failed to demonstrate why this information was not presented earlier. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' requests for jurisdictional discovery and judicial notice are not justified. The motion is denied.
