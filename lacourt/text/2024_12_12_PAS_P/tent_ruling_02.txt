 Case Number:  22GDCV00119    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT
JAE PARK’S MOTION TO STAY CROSS-COMPLAINTI.         INTRODUCTION
            This matter
arises from disputes concerning the management and financial operations of
Hyundai of Glendale, LLC. Defendant and Cross-Complainant Jae Park
(“Park”), the former General Manager of Hyundai of Glendale, LLC, has been
accused by Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Hyundai of Glendale, LLC (“Hyundai
Glendale”) and Cross-Complainant Auto Holdings, LLC (“Auto Holdings”) of
fraudulent financial practices, including inflating revenues, misrepresenting
financial data, and misappropriating funds. 
On March 9, 2022, Hyundai Glendale
filed this instant action against Park. On August 15, 2022, Park filed a First
Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) against Hyundai Glendale, Auto Holdings, LLC,
and John Hurry. On December 19, 2022, Hyundai Glendale filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) against Park. On October 15, 2024, Auto Holdings filed a
Cross-Complaint against Park, alleging operational misconduct and fraud
spanning from September 2016 through March 2022.
On November 14, 2024, Park filed a
motion for stay of proceedings, seeking to stay Auto Holdings’ Cross-Complaint
in this action pending resolution of a pending Nevada action. Park argues that
the claims in both cases overlap significantly and that a stay is necessary to
avoid duplicative litigation and inconsistent rulings. On November 27, 2024,
Auto Holdings filed an opposition to the motion, contending that its
Cross-Complaint includes broader allegations of operational misconduct distinct
from the Nevada case. On December 4, 2024, Park filed a reply, reiterating his
position.
The Nevada action was filed in
Douglas County, Nevada by Auto Holdings, LLC and Investment Services Capital,
LLC (“ISC”), a related entity, on June 7, 2022, and subsequently amended on
February 9, 2024, to include additional fraud claims. Trial for the Nevada case
is currently set for August 11, 2025.

III.      ANALYSIS
Park moves to stay the
cross-complaint filed by Auto Holdings under Code of Civil Procedure sections
128(a)(8), 187, and 410.30. Park argues that the claims in the cross-complaint
are duplicative of those in the pending Nevada action and are designed to
harass him by causing unnecessary litigation costs. Park further contends that
staying the cross-complaint will avoid conflicts with the Nevada court, which
is better suited to adjudicate the issues, given the advanced stage of
proceedings in that forum.[1]
Park specifically argues that the
Cross-Complaint is duplicative litigation to the Nevada action. Both cases
involve allegations that Park fraudulently induced investments by providing
false pro formas, inflated expected net profits, and misrepresented profits for
Hyundai of Glendale. (Motion, p. 5; Reply, pp. 2–3.) Park highlights that the
Nevada complaint already addresses these issues in detail, asserting claims for
fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation. (Motion, Exhibit 4, ¶¶
14–22.) Park further contends that the Nevada court is the appropriate forum
for these claims because the Nevada action was filed earlier, involves
overlapping discovery, and is already set for trial in August 2025. (Motion,
pp. 7–9; Reply, pp. 3–5.)
In opposition, Auto Holdings argues
that the Cross-Complaint is broader than the Nevada complaint, encompassing
claims of operational fraud from September 2016 through March 2022. Auto
Holdings contends that these allegations—such as Park’s inflated financial
reports and mismanagement—are distinct from the fraudulent inducement claims in
Nevada. (Opposition, p. 4; Exhibit K)
Auto Holdings asserts that its
cross-complaint is compulsory under California law because it arises from the
same transactions at issue in Park’s own cross-complaint. Auto Holdings claims
that staying its cross-complaint would hinder the court’s ability to fully
adjudicate the issues raised by Park. (Opposition, pp. 5–6.) Auto Holdings also
contends that Park waived his objections to the Cross-Complaint by failing to
raise the issue earlier through a demurrer of affirmative defense. (Opposition,
p.6) Finally, Auto Holdings argues that a stay would unduly prejudice its
ability to litigate operational fraud claims, which are directly related to
Park’s allegations. Auto Holdings asserts that proceeding with its
cross-complaint is necessary to offset the damages claimed by Park.
(Opposition, p. 7.)
Under California law, trial courts
have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to
promote judicial efficiency. (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) Courts also have inherent authority to fashion
procedures to manage litigation and ensure the orderly administration of
justice. (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1376–79;
see also CCP §§ 128(a)(3), (a)(5).)
Further, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 404.5, courts may stay an action when related cases involve
overlapping claims or issues affecting judicial coordination. Similarly,
California Rules of Court Rule 3.300(a) defines cases as related if they involve
the same parties, arise from substantially identical transactions, or present
overlapping questions of law or fact. The Court finds these principles applicable
here.
The Court reviewed the
Cross-Complaint filed by Auto Holdings and the Complaint in the Nevada action
and finds that there is substantial overlap in claims and allegations.
Specifically, both actions assert that Park made fraudulent financial
representations, including inflating revenue figures, misrepresenting financial
data, and diverting company funds for personal use. (Motion, p. 5; Reply, pp.
2–3.) Both cases assert claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and
breach of fiduciary duty. The Court finds that the allegations in both cases
arise from the same transactions and occurrences, spanning the same time frame
of 2016–2022, and involve the same parties. (Motion, Exhibits 3 and 4.)
Although the Nevada Complaint
emphasizes the pre-investment phase and allegations of fraudulent inducement,
while the California Cross-Complaint focuses on operational fraud and
misconduct post-investment, these distinctions do not negate the significant
factual overlap. Both actions will require determination of substantially
identical questions of law and fact, including whether Park's financial
representations were fraudulent, whether fiduciary duties were breached, and
resulting damages.
Allowing the California
Cross-Complaint to proceed while the Nevada case remains pending would waste
judicial resources and risk inconsistent rulings. Both cases involve
overlapping discovery, and the Nevada action is already set for trial in August
2025. Proceeding in California would unnecessarily duplicate efforts already
undertaken in Nevada, further complicating litigation.  Furthermore, as noted above, the earliest
trial date in this matter would be summer 2026, ample time for the Nevada
matter to resolve.  Staying the
California Cross-Complaint would not prejudice Auto Holdings. The allegations
in both cases are substantially similar, and resolution of the Nevada action would
likely narrow the issues for adjudication in this forum. Any remaining claims
can be addressed in California after the Nevada case concludes. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that the claims in the California Cross-Complaint substantially overlap
with those pending in the Nevada action. Resolution of the Nevada case will
materially affect and potentially narrow the issues in this case. Judicial
efficiency, consistency in rulings, and fairness to the parties all favor
granting Defendant Park’s motion to stay the Cross-Complaint filed by Auto
Holdings.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Park’s motion to stay the Cross-Complaint pending resolution of the Nevada
case.
 
            IV.       CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Park’s Motion for
a Stay of Proceedings.
The Parties are directed to provide
a joint status report after any final judgment in the Nevada case. 
Park is to give notice.Dated: December 12, 2024 JARED D. MOSES  JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
