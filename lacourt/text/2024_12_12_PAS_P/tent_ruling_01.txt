II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure Section
1008(a) provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order . . .
[may] make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party
making the application shall state by affidavit¿what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”¿¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008(a).) A trial court has discretion with respect to granting a
motion for reconsideration.¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court¿(2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿ 
            “A
motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for
reconsideration can offer ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law which
it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
time of the prior motion. (Citations.) A motion for reconsideration will be
denied absent a strong showing of diligence.” (Garcia v.¿Hejmadi¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690;¿Forrest v. State of California Dept. Of
Corporations¿(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202¿disapproved of and
overruled on unrelated grounds in¿Shalant¿v.¿Girardi¿(2011) 51 Cal.4th
1164, 1172 (footnote 3);¿New York Times Co. v. Superior Court¿(2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212–213;¿Baldwin v. Home¿Sav.¿of¿America.¿(1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199.)   
III.      ANALYSIS
Procedural
requirement
Plaintiffs’ motion meets the procedural requirements under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1008(a). The motion was timely filed on November 15, 2024,
within 10 days after service of the Court’s order. Plaintiffs also submitted a declaration
from their counsel, Keren E. Gesund, in support of the motion, as required by
Section 1008(a), to explain the grounds for reconsideration.
Analysis
Plaintiffs argue that they have presented new or different facts or
circumstances that justify reconsideration of the Court’s order granting
Grandtag’s motion to quash service of summons. Plaintiffs contend that Grandtag
purposefully availed itself of California’s jurisdiction by acting through
California-based GT Madison Realty, LLC, and orchestrating fraudulent asset
transfers (Motion, p. 8). Plaintiffs also claim that the Court failed to
explicitly address their requests for jurisdictional discovery and judicial
notice, which they argue warrant reconsideration (Motion, pp. 10–12).
Grandtag opposes, asserting that Plaintiffs’ motion is procedurally
deficient under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008(a) because it fails to
identify genuinely new or different facts, circumstances, or law (Opposition,
p. 4). Grandtag further argues that Plaintiffs are merely rehashing prior
arguments and attempting to relitigate issues already decided in the original
ruling (Opposition, p. 6).
Plaintiffs cite Exhibit 6 of their Fourth Amended Complaint to support
their claim that Grandtag controlled GT Madison and its California operations
(Motion, p. 6). Plaintiffs also cite legal authorities such as SK Trading
Internat Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court (2022) to bolster their argument for
jurisdiction and highlight fraudulent transfers involving GT ABC, LLC (Motion,
p. 8). However, Plaintiffs fail to justify why Exhibit 6, or these authorities
were not cited during their opposition to the motion to quash. Grandtag
correctly notes that Exhibit 6 was part of Plaintiffs’ own pleading and
available at the time of the original motion (Opposition, p. 2). Grandtag also
emphasizes that all legal authorities cited by Plaintiffs were published well
before the hearing (Opposition, p. 3).
The Court agrees with Grandtag. “[F]acts of which the party seeking
reconsideration was aware at the time of the original ruling are not ‘new or
different.’” (In re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468
[citing Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690].) Plaintiffs
purported new evidence and arguments do not meet the statutory standard under
Section 1008(a). Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to explain why these facts or
authorities could not have been presented earlier. 
Plaintiffs also argue that the Court failed to explicitly rule on their
request for jurisdictional discovery (Motion, p. 11). However, the November 5,
2024, the order denied the request by granting the motion to quash. Plaintiffs
failed to demonstrate how discovery would likely uncover evidence to establish
jurisdiction, which is necessary to justify such a request. This omission does
not constitute a new or different fact under Section 1008(a).
Finally, Plaintiffs claim that the Court’s lack of an explicit ruling on
their late-filed Request for Judicial Notice justifies reconsideration (Motion,
pp. 10–11). However, Plaintiffs filed the Request for Judicial Notice on
October 28, 2024, only four days before the November 1, 2024, hearing. The
Court finds that the untimely filing does not alter the merits of the decision
and does not meet the standard for reconsideration.
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to
meet the requirements of Section 1008(a), including providing genuinely new or
different facts, circumstances, or law. Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration
is DENIED.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
IV.       CONCLUSION
 Plaintiffs’
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
Grandtag is to give notice.
