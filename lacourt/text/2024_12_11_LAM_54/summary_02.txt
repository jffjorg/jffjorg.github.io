And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to bifurcate the trial, which sought to separate the equitable claims (specific performance and declaratory relief) from the legal claims (breach of contract) and try the former in a bench trial before submitting the latter to the jury. The judge agrees with the defendants that this would deprive them of their right to a jury trial and could greatly prejudice them. The judge is concerned that the bifurcation of the trial could lead to factual determinations being made by the court instead of the jury, which could be unfair to the defendants. The case will proceed to trial without bifurcation.
