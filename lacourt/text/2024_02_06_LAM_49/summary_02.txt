And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the petition of Jeffrey T. Jones to appoint him and his three siblings as directors of the Thomas and Louise Jones Family Foundation, Inc. The petition was filed because the initial directors, Thomas and Louise Jones, are deceased, and the foundation has no current directors or members. The Judge notes that the Bylaws of the foundation limit the number of directors to three, but the petitioners intend to amend or restate the Bylaws to provide for four or more authorized directors in the future. The Judge has granted the petition pending the confirmation of which three directors should be appointed. The newly appointed directors will have the authority to amend the Bylaws to add a fourth sibling as a director, if permitted by the Bylaws and applicable law.
