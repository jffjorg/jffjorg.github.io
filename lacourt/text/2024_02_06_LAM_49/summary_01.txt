Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the plaintiff's vehicle was not a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act. The court found that the vehicle was a used vehicle with a balance of the original warranty remaining, and therefore does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" under the Act. The court also granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's second cause of action for breach of implied warranty, finding that the defendant has no affiliation with the seller or distributor and therefore has no duty to the plaintiffs under the Act. The court ordered the defendant to file a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling and to give notice.
