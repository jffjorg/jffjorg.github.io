And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, John Anthony Hickey, has moved to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles to Orange County. The judge has reviewed the papers submitted by the defendant and has granted the motion. The judge finds that Orange County is the proper venue for the case because the motor vehicle accident that is the subject of the lawsuit occurred in Irvine, which is located in Orange County. Additionally, the defendant resides in Irvine and the plaintiff resides in Mission Viejo, which is also located in Orange County. The judge notes that the complaint incorrectly alleges that the accident occurred in Los Angeles, but this does not affect the propriety of the venue. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, so the judge has granted it.
