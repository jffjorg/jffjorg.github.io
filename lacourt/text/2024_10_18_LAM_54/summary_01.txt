And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the trial, which was filed by the defendants, Norman J. Kravetz and Glenda J. Kravetz. The defendants are seeking a continuance of the trial for at least 90 days due to their recent change in counsel. The judge has granted the motion, ordering a continuance of the trial to March 17, 2025, and a final status conference to March 7, 2025.

The judge considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1332(c) and (d), including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and the length of the continuance requested. The judge found that a 90-day continuance was appropriate, as the defendants' counsel has only recently substituted out and the plaintiff will not suffer any prejudice from the continuance.

The case involves a complaint filed by Pacific Western Bank against Norman J. Kravetz and Glenda J. Kravetz alleging breach of promissory note, conspiracy to fraudulently conceal assets, aiding and abetting fraudulent concealment of assets, voidable transfer, and declaratory relief. The defendants are seeking additional time to prepare for trial and/or to obtain trial counsel.
