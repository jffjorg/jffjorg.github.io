BACKGROUND
 
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
promissory note; (2) conspiracy to fraudulently conceal assets; (3) aiding and
abetting fraudulent concealment of assets; (4) voidable transfer; and (5)
declaratory relief. Plaintiff alleges Defendant Norman Kravetz defaulted on a
business loan and fraudulently transferred real commercial property to avoid
repayment of the debt.
 
ANALYSIS
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Defendants move for a continuance of
the October 28, 2024 trial for at least 90 days. Defendants assert that they
recently became unrepresented by counsel and require additional time to prepare
for trial and/or to obtain trial counsel. Defendants filed a substitution of
attorney on September 17, 2024. In opposition, Plaintiff asserts Defendants
have known that their counsel would not represent them at trial for some time, because
their former counsel stated that the representation was limited to settlement
negotiations. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants should not be treated
differently because they are unrepresented.
 
The Court finds a 90-day continuance
appropriate. Defendants’ counsel has only recently substituted out and
Plaintiff will suffer no prejudice from a continuance. Defendants’ motion is
GRANTED.
