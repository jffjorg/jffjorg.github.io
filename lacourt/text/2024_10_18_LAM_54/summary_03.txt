Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 2464 Fletcher Drive LLC vs. Silver Lake Caregivers Group and Tolabus Stein. The case involves an unlawful detainer lawsuit filed by the plaintiff against the defendants, who are alleged to have failed to pay rent and operated an unlicensed cannabis dispensary on the premises.

The plaintiff moved for summary adjudication of the issue of possession of the premises, arguing that the defendants had not paid rent since October 2023 and had not been served with a written three-day notice to pay rent or quit. The defendants argued that the plaintiff had filed suit before the time to cure the unpaid rent had expired and that they had not received personal service of the notice.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants had received proper notice to pay rent or quit.

The plaintiff also moved to strike the defendants' answer, arguing that the defendant Silver Lake Caregivers Group was a suspended corporation and therefore disqualified from exercising any rights or privileges in the lawsuit. The judge granted the motion to strike, finding that the defendant had not opposed the motion to show that it had remedied the suspension.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any written objections filed by the parties.
