Hearing Date: October 18, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Transfer Venue
Moving Party: Defendant John Anthony Hickey
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE IS
GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.  
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving
papers. No opposition has been received. 
 
CCP § 395(a) provides, in pertinent
part, “If the action is for injury to person or personal property or for death
from wrongful act or negligence, the superior court in either the county where
the injury occurs or the injury causing death occurs or the county where the
defendants, or some of them reside at the commencement of the action, is a
proper court for the trial of the action.” 
 
Defendant moves to transfer venue to
Orange County, CA. Defendant asserts that venue is proper in Orange County
because the motor vehicle accident at issue in this action occurred in Irvine, Defendant
resides in Irvine, and Plaintiff resides in Mission Viejo. Defendant represents
that the complaint erroneously alleges the accident occurred in Los Angeles and
that the parties reside in Los Angeles. This is sufficient to show that Orange
County is the proper venue for this action. Plaintiff does not oppose this
motion to show otherwise. The motion is GRANTED.
