[1] “[¶27] The Company, at the direction of Majority
Director Defendants and over the objection of Plaintiff, has engaged a law
firm, Littler Mendelson P.C. (“Law Firm”), not for purposes of engaging in
litigation but rather to conduct a wasteful harassment campaign against
Plaintiff, her family, and former employees. Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and based thereon alleges, that this wasteful campaign
was undertaken in an
attempt to damage Plaintiff’s good name and reputation for the purpose of also
lowering the value of the Company so that Plaintiff’s put option would be less
valuable . . . .
 
[¶28] Plaintiff is
informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Law Firm and Company
engaged in a campaign of harassment by posting physical notices on the doors of
the houses of former employees and family members of Plaintiff, making frequent
and disruptive telephone calls to former employees, using private investigators
to track former employees physically and digitally, and purposefully
distributing letters intended for former employees to current employees to
smear former employees’ reputations.”.
 


[2] “[¶40]. . . Majority Director Defendants’ false
statements are intended to hide the detrimental economic impact that ouster of Plaintiff
had on the value of the Company, and save face on the part of Majority Director
Defendants before LG H&H, for the personal benefit of Majority Director
Defendants and to the detriment of Company and its shareholders . . . .
 
[¶41] For example,
Defendant Moon has falsely represented in South Korean
publications that she
is responsible for valuable licensing agreements by the Company, including The
Crème Shop x Sanrio Lunar New Year Collection, launched in December
of 2022(fn.1)”.
