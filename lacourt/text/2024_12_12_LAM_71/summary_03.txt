And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Company, at the direction of the Majority Director Defendants, engaged a law firm to conduct a harassment campaign against the Plaintiff, her family, and former employees. The campaign allegedly included posting physical notices, making frequent and disruptive telephone calls, using private investigators to track former employees, and distributing letters to smear their reputations. The judge believes that the purpose of this campaign was to damage the Plaintiff's good name and reputation, lower the value of the Company, and hide the detrimental economic impact of the ouster of the Plaintiff. The judge also notes that the Majority Director Defendants made false statements to hide this economic impact, including Defendant Moon's false representation of being responsible for valuable licensing agreements.
