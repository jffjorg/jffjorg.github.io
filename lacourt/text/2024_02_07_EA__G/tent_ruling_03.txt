 Case Number:  23PSCV03425    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Min Zhou’s Demurrer to Complaint
 
Respondent: Plaintiff Juan Zhao
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Min Zhou’s Demurrer to Complaint is SUSTAINED IN PART with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the First
and Fifth Causes of Action and OVERRULED IN PART on all other grounds.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a breach of contract and fraud action arising from
a loan agreement. In May 2023, Plaintiff Juan Zhao entered into an agreement
with Defendant Min Zhou in which Zhao agreed to loan a total of $1,500,000 to
Min Zhou in exchange for repayment within one week. After two to three weeks
later, Min Zhou told Zhao that Min Zhou would be unable to repay the loan and
claimed the money had been lost in an online scam. On June 23, Min Zhou signed
a written promissory note that acknowledged the loan, agreed to repay it within
thirty days, and listed property in Diamond Bar as collateral for the loan.
Subsequently, Zhao alleges Min Zhou failed to make any payments on the loan.
 
On July 25, 2023, Zhao filed a complaint in Orange County
Superior Court against Defendants Min Zhou, Bing Zhou, and Does 1-50, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) promissory estoppel, (3)
fraudulent transfer, (4) breach of oral contract, (5) breach of written
contract, and (6) common counts.
 
On October 4, 2023, the parties stipulated to the transfer
of this action to the present court.
 
On November 29, 2023, Min Zhou filed the present demurrer.
On January 9, 2024, the court continued the hearing on Min Zhou’s demurrer in
order for parties to further meet and confer. On January 16, Min Zhou’s counsel
met and conferred remotely over Zoom with Zhao’s counsel. (Hacohen Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer is set for February 7,
2024, along with a status conference Re: Incoming Transfer.
 
ANALYSIS

Min Zhou demurs to Zhao’s entire Complaint. For
the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS
Min Zhou’s demurrer to Zhao’s first
and ­­fifth causes of action with leave to amend and OVERRULES Min Zhou’s demurrer on all other grounds.
 
Legal Standard

A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Fraud (First Cause of Action)
 
Min Zhou argues Zhao’s first cause of action
for fraud is barred by the economic loss rule and fails to plead sufficient
facts to state a claim. The court agrees in part.
 
Legal Standard
 
Fraud

“The elements of fraud, which give rise to
the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638,
quoting 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, § 676, p. 778.) The
facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically
as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Id., at p. 645.)
 
Economic Loss Rule

Pursuant to the economic loss rule, “there is
no recovery in tort for negligently inflicted ‘purely economic losses,’ meaning
financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property damage.” (Sheen v.
Wells Fargo Bank. N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.) It “functions to bar
claims in negligence for pure economic losses in deference to a contract
between litigating parties.” (Id., at p. 922.) “Tort damages have been
permitted in contract cases where . . . the duty that gives rise to tort
liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from
conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999)
21 Cal.4th 543, 551-552.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Min Zhou argues Zhao’s fraud
claim is barred by the economic loss rule because it is essentially duplicative
of Zhao’s contractual claims. But Zhao’s Complaint does more than just allege
Min Zhou failed to repay Zhao’s loan. Instead, it specifically alleges Min Zhou
made false representations and concealments to induce Zhao to make the loan in
the first place. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Thus, the economic loss rule does not apply.
(See Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 991;
Las Palmas Associates v. Las Palmas Center Associates (1991) 235
Cal.App.3d 1220, 1238-1239.)
 
Min Zhou also argues Zhao’s fraud claim is
not pled with the requisite specificity required by law. In alleging a cause of
action for fraud, “[t]he specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege
facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege
the names of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak
on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and
when the representation was made.” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges Min Zhou reached
out to Zhao on May 3, 2023, and falsely represented that Min Zhou’s company
needed cash for a short-term cash crunch. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) But elsewhere, the
Complaint alleges Min Zhou made these representations on May 2 and fails to
specify how and through what means these alleged misrepresentations were made.
(Complaint, ¶ 19.) The Complaint also alleges Min Zhou knew the promise to
return repay the loan within a few weeks was false. (Complaint, ¶ 19-20.) But
the Complaint fails to allege any further details as to when, how, where, and
by what means this promise was made. Furthermore, it fails to satisfy the
requirements of a false promise as the Complaint does not specifically allege
Min Zhou had no intention of repaying the loan at the time the promise was
made. (See Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
481.)
 
To the extent the Complaint also alleges Min
Zhou fraudulently induced Zhao to make the loan through concealment of Min
Zhou’s financial condition, the court notes the law is currently unsettled with
regards to whether these allegations would be barred by the economic loss rule.
(See Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 843
[holding economic loss does not bar claims for fraudulent inducement by
concealment], review granted Feb. 1, 2023, S277568.)
 
Accordingly, because Zhao failed to plead
fraud with required specificity, Min Zhou’s demurrer to this cause of action is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Breach of Written Contract (Fifth Cause
of Action)
 
Min Zhou contends
Zhao’s fifth cause of action for breach of written contract fails to plead
sufficient facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of
contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms
must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written
agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances,
a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty
Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Min Zhou contends Zhao’s cause
of action fails to allege performance or breach of the alleged written loan
agreement. Zhao’s Complaint alleges Min Zhou signed a promissory note
acknowledging the $1,500,000 loan agreement from Zhao and promising to repay
the loan within thirty days. (Complaint, ¶ 47.) Min Zhou contends this
allegation is contradicted by the copy of the loan agreement in Zhao’s
Complaint and cites SC Manufactured Homes, Inc. v. Liebert (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 68, for the rule that “[i]f the allegations in the complaint
conflict with the exhibits, we rely on and accept as true the contents of the
exhibits.” (Id., at p. 83.) But “in doing so, if the exhibits are
ambiguous and can be construed in the manner suggested by plaintiff, then we
must accept the construction offered by plaintiff.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the alleged promissory note, dated June
23, 2023, states “[t]he Lender promises to loan $1,5000,000.00 USD to the
Borrower and the Borrower promises to repay this principal amount to the Lender
along with $150,000.00 interest, which may be paid separately.” (Complaint, Ex.
B.) Contrary to the allegation of the Complaint, the promissory note does not acknowledge
the parties’ prior loan agreement and instead references a present or future
promise of Zhao to loan funds to Min Zhou. And because the Complaint fails to
allege Zhao performed by making this additional promised loan, it necessarily
fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract against Min Zhou.
 
Accordingly, Min Zhou’s demurrer to this
cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Standing

Min Zhou maintains Zhao’s second, third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action fail because Zhao lacks standing to
pursue claims for funds belonging to third parties. Specifically, Min Zhou
maintains that Zhao’s Complaint alleges “such funds were sent by, and belonged
to, third parties Yuqing Zhao and Ang Li.” (Demurrer, p. 4:14-15, citing
Complaint, ¶ 9, 39, 46.) But this is not what the Complaint alleged.
 
Instead, the Complaint alleges Zhao
transferred the funds at issue from accounts owned by these third parties. (Complaint,
¶ 9, 39, 46.) And while Min Zhou claims the Complaint fails to allege Zhao had
ownership over these funds, these Complaint does exactly that by claiming the
funds transferred were “earmarked for [Zhao’s] tax payments.” (Complaint, ¶ 9,
39, 46.) This is sufficient to establish Zhao had ownership interests in the
funds at issue.
 
Accordingly, Min Zhou’s demurrer on this
ground is OVERRULED.
 
Misjoinder of Parties

Min Zhou argues Zhao’s fourth and fifth
causes of action fail because there is a misjoinder of parties. Specifically,
Min Zhou maintains Yuqing Zhao and Ang Li are indispensable parties because the
funds at issue belonged to them. But as noted above, this argument fails as
Zhao has adequately alleged these funds belonged to Zhao. Accordingly, Min
Zhou’s demurrer on this ground is also OVERRULED.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Min Zhou’s demurrer to Zhao’s Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty
(20) days leave to amend as to the first and fifth causes of action and OVERRULED
on all other grounds.
