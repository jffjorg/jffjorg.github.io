And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment in a breach of contract and fraud action. The defendant, Maria del Socorro Munoz Suarez, is seeking to set aside the default judgment and file an answer to the complaint. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendant was properly served with the complaint and summons via substitute service. However, the defendant alleges that they were not aware of the proceedings until they received a packet in the mail, which was a result of surprise or inadvertence. The court finds that the defendant has adequately established the entry of default was a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and grants the motion to set aside the default. The proposed answer filed as Exhibit 1 to the defendant's motion is to be separately filed as of this date.
