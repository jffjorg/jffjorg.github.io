English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a demurrer filed by defendant Min Zhou to a complaint filed by plaintiff Juan Zhao. The court sustains Min Zhou's demurrer to Zhao's first and fifth causes of action with leave to amend, and overrules it on all other grounds. The first cause of action alleges fraud, which the court finds is not pled with required specificity. The fifth cause of action alleges breach of written contract, which the court finds is not adequately pled. The court also rejects Min Zhou's arguments that Zhao lacks standing to pursue claims for funds belonging to third parties and that there is a misjoinder of parties.
