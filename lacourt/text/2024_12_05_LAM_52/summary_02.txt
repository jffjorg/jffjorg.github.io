And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Safe-Guard Productions International, LLC to the complaints filed by Gail Wiggan. The court finds that the complaints are uncertain and lack specificity, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The court orders plaintiff to file a single first amended complaint within 15 days, which will supersede the separate complaints in the two consolidated actions. The court finds that plaintiff's claims against Safe-Guard Productions International, LLC are based on a condition precedent that did not occur, and therefore, plaintiff cannot succeed on a claim for breach of contract against Safe-Guard Productions International, LLC.
