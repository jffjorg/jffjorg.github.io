  Case Number:  23LBCV01593    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn August 23, 2023, Plaintiff Martin and Graciela Ruiz filed a complaint against Defendants Frank Colaruotolo Consulting, Inc. (“FCC”), Pacific Crane Maintenance Company, LLC (“PCMC”), and Does 1-10. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging two causes of action: (1) Negligence against Defendants FCC, Frank Colaruotolo, and Does 2 through 10; and (2) Negligence against Defendants PCMC and Does 2 through 10. On June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”), adding CSI Services as a Defendant.Plaintiffs Martin Ruiz and Graciela Ruiz are the surviving biological father and mother of the decedent, respectively. (SAC ¶¶ 1, 2.) Plaintiffs are suing for the loss of their adult son, decedent Edgar Ruiz. Decedent was killed during a forklift incident on January 18, 2022. (See SAC ¶¶ 16-23.)Since the filing of Plaintiffs’ original complaint, Nico Ruiz filed a separate action against Defendants FCC and CSI Services, Inc., LASC No. 24LBCV00081. LASC Case No. 23LBCV01593 and LASC Case No. 24LBCV00081 (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Related Cases”) were deemed related by this Court. (See March 14, 2024 Notice of Ruling Re: Related Cases and Upcoming Hearing Dates in Case No. 24LBCV00081; Forouzan Decl., ¶ 6.)On May 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to consolidate the Related Cases.Legal StandardCCP § 1048 provides:(a) When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make suchorders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.(b) The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United States.The purpose of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both actions, and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together. (See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 484-485.) Further, the granting or denial of a motion to consolidate rests in the trial court's sound discretion and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. (Feliner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.)RulingThe Court agrees the two related matters should be consolidated for the following reasons: (1) both involve the same incident and (2) include nearly identical Defendants, (3) involve identical questions of law and fact, (4) identical burdens of proof, and (5) similar if not identical witnesses.However, there appears no record of Plaintiffs filing a notice of motion to consolidate in LASC Case No. 24LBCV00081 (the “Nico Ruiz” case) as required by Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(1)(C). If the parties in 24LBCV00081 waive the requirement of a noticed motion, the Court will grant the Motion to Consolidate. If there is no waiver, the Motion to Consolidate is denied without prejudice for Plaintiffs to correct the procedural defects.
