And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the two related cases, LASC Case No. 23LBCV01593 and LASC Case No. 24LBCV00081, should be consolidated for the purposes of avoiding unnecessary costs or delay. The judge finds that the two cases involve the same incident, have nearly identical defendants, and raise identical questions of law and fact. However, the judge notes that Plaintiffs have not filed a notice of motion to consolidate in LASC Case No. 24LBCV00081, as required by Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(1)(C). If the parties in 24LBCV00081 waive the requirement of a noticed motion, the judge will grant the Motion to Consolidate. If there is no waiver, the Motion to Consolidate is denied without prejudice for Plaintiffs to correct the procedural defects.
