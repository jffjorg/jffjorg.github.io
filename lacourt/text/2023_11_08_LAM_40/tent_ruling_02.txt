 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendants 99
  Cents Only Stores, LLC and Bargain Wholesale’s Motion to Strike First Amended
  Complaint.



 
Background
On August 29, 2022, Plaintiff Anahitasadat
Abolghasemi (Plaintiff) initiated this action by filing a Complaint alleging
eight claims against Defendants 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC, Bargain Wholesale,
and Does 1 to 100: (1) General
Negligence; (2) Gross Negligence; (3) Product Liability/Failure to Warn; (4)
Negligence/Product Liability; (5) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention
of Employee; (6) Strict Products Liability; (7) Breach of Warranty of
Merchantability; and (8) Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for Particular
Purpose.
The claims arose from allegations that Defendants are a manufacturer,
wholesaler, distributor, or retailer of “Roxi” lighters and that, on August 19,
2021, while sitting inside her personal vehicle, Plaintiff attempted to use a
“Roxi” lighter purchased from Defendants, only for the lighter to explode in
her hand, resulting in serious injuries and burns to her hands and face, with
Plaintiff dropping the lighter inside the vehicle, causing a fire to spread
therein, thus causing additional damages and injuries.
On March 1, 2023, Defendants 99 Cents Stores and Bargain
Wholesale filed a demurrer to the Complaint’s second, fifth, seventh,
and eighth causes of action.
Plaintiff failed to oppose the
demurrer, which came before the Court on July 21, 2023. On that date, the Court
sustained the demurrer as to the Complaint’s second and fifth causes of action,
with leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer as to the Complaint’s sixth and
eighth causes of action. The Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend the pleadings
within 20 days of July 21, 2023, i.e., by August 10, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel
attended the hearing and requested 20 days, rather than the 14 indicated in the
initial, tentative ruling.
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (FAC) suing Defendants
99 Cents Stores, Bargain Wholesale, and Does 1 to 100 for (1) General
Negligence, (2) Product Liability/Failure to Warn, (3) Negligence/Product
Liability, (4) Strict Products Liability, (5) Breach of Warranty of
Merchantability, and (6) Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for Particular
Purpose. (The FAC does not contain the two claims against which Defendants’
demurrer was sustained on July 21, 2023.) The claims arise from the same general
allegations as the Complaint.
On August 17, 2023, Defendants 99 Cents Stores and Bargain Wholesale
moved to strike the FAC on the grounds that Plaintiff filed the pleading
without leave of court and without a stipulation by the parties, under
circumstances where Plaintiff could not amend her pleadings as a matter of
course. The motion was set for hearing on November 8, 2023.
On September 20, 2023, the Court held a case management conference, at
which time the Court noted that the motion to strike was on calendar for
November 8, 2023.
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff
opposed the motion to strike.
On October 31, 2023, Defendants 99
Cents Stores and Bargain Wholesale replied to the opposition.
Defendants’ motion to strike is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Strike
Legal
Standard
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
For
the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
Order
Striking First Amended Complaint: DENIED.
In
their motion, Defendants 99 Cents
Stores and Bargain Wholesale argue that the Court should strike the August 17,
2023 FAC because it was filed 7 days after the 20-day deadline given by the
Court in the July 21, 2023 minutes, without leave of court or a stipulation by
the parties, thus constituting a filing not made in conformity with the laws of
the State of California. The declaration from counsel attached to the motion to
strike fails to elaborate on meet and confer efforts. (Mot., pp. 3-5; Mot., Anz
Decl., ¶¶ 1-6, Ex. A [Jul. 21, 2023 minutes].)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion to strike has no merit based on a
liberal construction of the pleadings and that the strong public policy of
deciding cases on the merits disfavors striking the FAC. Plaintiff also argues
that Defendants come to the Court with unclean hands by failing to meet and
confer and that any late filing of the FAC should be excused pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). (Opp’n, pp. 2-6.)
In
reply, Defendants 99 Cents Stores and
Bargain Wholesale argue that defense counsel sought to meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel but that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond to meet and
confer requests. Defendants otherwise argue that the FAC should be stricken as an
untimely filing made without proper court approval or a stipulation by the
parties. Last, Defendants argue that relief pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is not available because an application
for that relief in an opposition does not provide the “notice” required by that
statute and because a granting of this motion will simply leave the original
August 29, 2022 Complaint as the operative pleading, as modified by the Court’s
July 21, 2023 order. (Reply, pp. 2-4.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff.
The
Court first notes that even if Defendants failed to adequately meet and confer,
this alone is not a ground for granting or denying the motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(4) [“A determination by the court that the meet and
confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny the
motion to strike”].) The opposition’s unclean hands argument therefore fails.
Next,
the Court notes that relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473 is not
clearly available in opposition to a noticed motion. The statutory language is
admittedly vague. (Compare Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a) [“The court may …,
in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars,” emphasis added], with Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d) [notice
not mentioned in relation to discretionary relief], and with Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (d) [“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order,” emphasis added].) However, cases that discuss relief pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473 in opposition to a motion to dismiss involved
circumstances where relief pursuant to section 473 was made pursuant to a
noticed motion. (See Martin v. Cook (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 799, 804, fn. 3
[Proceeding for relief from judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against
movant through mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is proper in
opposition to a motion to dismiss and may be heard and considered
contemporaneously with motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution, citing Bergloff
v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359], disagreed with in Wilcox
v. Ford (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1170, 1178-1179 [disagreeing as to whether relief
pursuant to section 473 can be requested in opposition to motion to dismiss];
see also Bergloff v. Reynolds, supra, at pp. 352 [a motion to set
aside was made pursuant to section 473], 356 [discussing procedural adequacy of
the notice of motion to set aside at issue].) 
However,
the Court is not blind to the reality that even if this Court were to grant the
motion to strike on this ground, Plaintiff would thereafter be undeniably
entitled to bring a motion to set aside that Order on the same ground as that
set forth in the Opposition. As it includes a declaration of attorney fault, such
a motion would present a mandatory basis to set it aside. 
It
is true that Plaintiff had no authority to file the FAC as a matter of course
on August 17, 2023. “‘[A] litigant does not have a positive right to amend his
pleading after a demurrer thereto has been sustained. “His leave to amend
afterward is always of grace, not of right. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ (Gautier
v. General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 310 …].)”  However, courts of appeal have split on the issue
of whether a court can exercise its discretion to accept an amended complaint
past the deadline. (Compare Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc.
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 612, with Harlan v. Dept. of Transporation
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 874-875 [Disagreeing with Leader’s
conclusion that, “where the court has properly sustained a demurrer, granted
leave to amend, and fixed a time for filing the amended complaint, [the court]
has no discretion subsequently to extend the time without a noticed motion by
the plaintiff”].) 
The
Court finds the Harlan case to be the better reasoned decision. Moreover,
facts matter. In Leader, the plaintiff failed to file a fourth amended
complaint for over a month at which point the plaintiff arrived at a status
conference with a proposed fourth amended complaint.  (Leader, supra, at p. 607.) Moreover,
the plaintiff had been given a stipulated continuance to file the amended
complaint past the original deadline and had still failed to amend. (Id.
at p. 610-611.) The Court found no abuse of discretion to dismiss the case.
Such facts are a far cry from the instant case in which the complaint has been
filed one week late. (See also Harlan, supra, at p. 872-873 [court
exercised its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 425 not to strike
the complaint where the second amended complaint was filed about 8 days late,
saying that the “delay in filing was brief and inconsequential”].) 
Nor
does the case of Gitmed v. General Motors Corp. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th
824, cited in Defendants’ reply, require that the Court grant this motion to
strike. To the contrary, in that case the Court held that “the trial court
abused its discretion in dismissing an action after appellant filed his amended
complaint one day late.” (Gitmed, supra, at p. 825.) 
The
Court here exercises its discretion to deny the motion and allow the Amended
Complaint to be filed one week late. In addition to Code of Civil Procedure
section 475, the court has “fundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and
administrative powers, as well as inherent power to control litigation before
them.” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967.)
Defendants
99 Cents Stores and Bargain Wholesale’s motion is thus DENIED. 

Conclusion
Defendants 99 Cents Only Stores,
LLC and Bargain Wholesale’s Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint is DENIED.
