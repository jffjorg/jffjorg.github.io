Summary:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Mario Sanchez's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and award attorney's fees and costs. The settlement agreement was executed by the parties on July 28, 2022, and includes a payment of $26,000 to Plaintiff. The Defendant failed to pay the amount, and Plaintiff brought the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The Court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and binding, and that the Defendant's failure to pay the amount constitutes a breach of the agreement. The Court awards Plaintiff attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $7,855.40, which includes 10.75 hours of attorney time at a rate of $725 per hour, and costs of $61.65. The Court also orders Plaintiff to file a proposed judgment within seven calendar days of the hearing.
