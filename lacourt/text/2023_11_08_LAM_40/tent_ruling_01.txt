 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Mario
  Sanchez’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and for Award of Attorney
  Fees of $7,855.40.



 
Background
Plaintiff Mario Sanchez sued
Defendants Peter Chhoeu Enterprises, Inc. and Does 1 through 25 to a February
17, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Failure to Provide Rest Periods –
Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512, (2) Failure to Provide Meal Periods – Labor Code §§
226.7, 512, and (3) Unfair Competition – Business and Professions Code §§ 17200
et seq.
On July 21, 2022, the parties
participated in a mandatory settlement conference, at which time the action was
settled.
Counsel for Plaintiff Sanchez
drafted a settlement agreement and release, which was executed by Defendant
Peter Chhoeu Enterprises, Inc.’s President, Peter Chhoeu, on July 28, 2022, and
by Plaintiff on August 3, 2022. The agreement’s terms partly involve Peter
Chhoeu Enterprises, Inc.’s obligation to pay Plaintiff Sanchez $26,000 by
August 15, 2022, the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement, a term relating to default, and a term allowing the recovery of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred in enforcing the settlement agreement. 
On October 12, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a notice of settlement of the entire case.
That same day, Plaintiff filed a
motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for an award of attorney fees of
$7,855.40. The motion was set for hearing on May 3, 2023.
Also on that day, the Court set an
Order to Show Cause (OSC) re Dismissal (Settlement) for July 14, 2023. The notice
also advanced and vacated all hearings on calendar.
On February 2, 2023, the Court
noticed a reassignment of the action to the new judicial officer in Department
40.
On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff
Sanchez gave notice of reassignment.
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff Sanchez
again filed a nearly identical motion to enforce the settlement agreement and
for an award of attorney’s fees of $7,855.40, with the only notable difference
being a change of counsel for Plaintiff.
On July 14, 2023, the Court held
the OSC re Dismissal (Settlement), which only Plaintiff’s counsel attended.
Plaintiff’s counsel represented that the settlement had not been fully executed
and, at the request of Plaintiff’s counsel, the Court continued the hearing on
the motion to enforce settlement to November 8, 2023.
Plaintiff Sanchez’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a).)
“Because
of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of [Code of
Civil Procedure] section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.” (J.B.B. Inv. Partners, Ltd. v. Fair
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 984, as modified Dec. 30, 2014.) “Thus, the statute
requires the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought
to be enforced.” (Ibid., internal quotations and brackets omitted; Kohn
v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533 [“In deciding motions made
under Section 664.6, judges “must determine whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement”].)
The
trial court may enter judgment pursuant to a stipulated agreement to settle in
one of two ways: (1) in a writing signed by the parties; or (2) by oral
agreement made “before the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a); Murphy
v. Padilla (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 707, 711-712.) A party moving for entry of
judgment under section 664.6 need not establish a breach of the settlement
agreement; rather, the court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to the
settlement regardless of whether the settlement’s obligations were performed,
breached or excused. (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1184-1185.)
Disputes
regarding the parties’ “compliance with the settlement agreement may be
relevant to the enforcement of the judgment, once entered ….” (Machado v.
Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 796.) “Section 664.6 was enacted to
provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract
without the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)
If
the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the settlement
cannot be enforced through section 664.6 summary proceeding and must be
addressed in a separate civil action. (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005)
131 Cal.App.4th 1445 [finding parties never agreed to the means that were
material to the settlement, including what role an independent manager was to
play regarding management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be
qualified as a QTIP, thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds
as to the material terms], with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
1355 [holding trial court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s
agreement to repurchase house did not create a material term and was within
court’s power because the closing date had passed by the time the motions came
on for hearing and a new closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought
by both parties].)
Order
Entering/Enforcing Settlement: GRANTED.
Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence of a settlement agreement executed by the parties
between July 28, 2022 and August 3, 2022. The agreement provides that this
Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement. The agreement
also requires a $26,000 payment to Plaintiff by August 15, 2022, in exchange
for which Plaintiff would dismiss this case. The agreement contains a term
relating to how Defendant Peter Chhoeu Enterprises, Inc. may remedy any default
under the settlement agreement. (7/12/23 Mot., p. 9; 7/12/23 Mot., Hedwat
Decl., Ex. A, Settlement Agreement, §§ 1, 3, 7.) 
The
Court determines that a writing constituting a settlement agreement signed by
the parties is now before the Court. (7/12/23 Mot., Hedwat Decl., Ex. A.) The
parties’ entry into the settlement agreement is supported by Plaintiff’s
October 12, 2022 notice of settlement of entire case. (See 10/12/22 Notice.) The
Court is thus empowered to enter judgment based on the parties’ settlement
agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 664.6, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
also shows that, as of the time this motion was filed on July 12, 2023, Defendant
Peter Chhoeu Enterprises, Inc. had failed to pay $26,000 to Plaintiff, monies
which were due on August 15, 2022 per the terms of the settlement agreement. (7/12/23
Mot., Hedwat Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. A, § 1.) Plaintiff thus brought this motion,
seeking not only entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement agreement terms,
but also an award of attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $7,855.40,
i.e., fees to enforce the settlement by reaching out to defense counsel. (7/12/23
Mot., Hedwat Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. B [communication with defense counsel].) The fees
and costs are comprised of 8.25 hours preparing this motion at a rate of $725
per hour, 2.5 hours expected to be expended preparing for and attending the
hearing, and a motion filing fee of $61.65. (7/12/23 Mot., Hedwat Decl., ¶¶ 8-12.)
The
Court finds that these fees are awardable and reasonable. The prevailing party
is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).) Attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded where a contract between the
parties at issue specifically provides for such fees and costs and one party
prevails over the other on the contract. (See Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
The fees are determined based on the lodestar inquiry of reasonable fee rates,
reasonable fee hours, multiplier enhancements, and reasonable costs. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [lodestar method]; Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [multiplier factors].)
Here,
there is an agreement for attorney’s fees and costs built into the parties’
settlement agreement, which the Court may enforce pursuant to the terms of that
agreement. (7/12/23 Mot., Hedwat Decl., Ex. A, §§ 7, 18.) The Court determines
that the fee rate of $725 per hour is within the reasonable range for a 14-year
practitioner like Raphael Hedwat. (7/12/23 Hedwat Decl., ¶ 8.) The Court also
determines that the 10.75 hours sought by Plaintiff are reasonable based on efforts
attempting to enforce the settlement agreement since August 2022. (See, e.g.,
7/12/23 Mot., Hedwat Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.) No multiplier award is requested.
Costs are reasonable in the amount of $61.65, i.e., cost of filing this motion
and to set hearing. (7/12/23 Mot., Journal Technologies Court Portal Printout
[$61.65 payment].)
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Mario Sanchez’s Motion to
Enforce Settlement Agreement and for Award of Attorney Fees of $7,855.40 is
GRANTED.
Plaintiff is to file a proposed
judgment to the Court within seven calendar days of this hearing. The proposed judgment
must include all terms and conditions in the settlement agreement. (See Machado
v. Myers, supra, 39 Cal.App.5th at pp. 792-793.) The proposed order
must also set out the contractual and factual bases for the recovery of
attorney’s fees and costs.
