And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add HeavenStone Ranch Corp as an additional judgment debtor without prejudice. The plaintiff had argued that HeavenStone Ranch Corp is the alter ego of HeavenStone Corporation, the judgment debtor, citing similarities such as shared employees, address, and control by the same individual, Jack Jie Qin. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim, citing the lack of evidence of unity of interest and ownership between the two entities. The judge noted that the plaintiff's arguments were based on general similarities between the two entities, rather than specific evidence of shared assets, directorate, and other features that would support a finding of alter ego liability. As a result, the motion was denied without prejudice.
