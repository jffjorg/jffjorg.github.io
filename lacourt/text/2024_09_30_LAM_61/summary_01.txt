And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiffs' motion to enforce a settlement agreement is continued to October 29, 2024. The settlement agreement was reached orally before the court on August 29, 2024, and the insurer has not signed the written agreement. The defendants argue that the settlement is not enforceable because the insurer has not signed the agreement, and that the plaintiffs intend to demurrer to the defendants' claims in an other action. The judge finds that the settlement agreement does not prescribe a time in which the insurer must sign the agreement, and that the policy of the State of California favors hearing the defendants' motion to file a cross-complaint. The judge also finds that the parties were aware that the settlement had implications for the defendants' other action, and that the written memorialization of the settlement agreement includes specific language relating to that case. Therefore, the judge concludes that the motion is continued to await resolution on the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.
