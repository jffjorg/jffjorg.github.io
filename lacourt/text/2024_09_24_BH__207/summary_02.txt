And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for monetary sanctions against counsel for the plaintiff. The judge finds that the notice of motion is procedurally defective because it does not explicitly state that sanctions are being sought against the counsel for the plaintiff. The ruling cites relevant legal principles and cases, including Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, Blumenthal v. Superior Court, and Marriage of Fuller. As a result, the judge is inclined to dismiss the motion for monetary sanctions against counsel for the plaintiff.
