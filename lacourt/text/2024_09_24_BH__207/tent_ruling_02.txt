party's counsel, the notice of motion must expressly so state. It is not enough
simply to attach declarations or a transcript showing that the deponent refused
to appear or answer questions on counsel's advice.”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2022) ¶ 8:1985 (citing Blumenthal
v. Superior Court (1980) 103 CA3d 317; Marriage of Fuller (1985) 163
CA3d 1070); see also id. at ¶ 8:1986 [“Where an award is sought against
the attorney for advising the opposing party not to answer or respond, the
notice of motion must identify the opposing counsel and state that sanctions
are being sought against such counsel personally”].)  Here, Defendants failed to name counsel for
Plaintiff as required; therefore, the Court finds the notice regarding monetary
sanctions as to counsel for Plaintiff to be procedurally defective.
