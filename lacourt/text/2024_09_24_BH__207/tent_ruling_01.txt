MOTIONS
 
            Defendants Jonah Berghoff, Stephan
Berghoff, and Arezou Berghoff (“Defendants”) move to compel responses from Plaintiff
Vadim Ivanov (“Plaintiff”) to Form Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROG”); Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”); and Demands for Production of Documents
(Set One) (“RPD”).  Defendants also seek
monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  
 
Defendants’ motions are unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.     Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.     Requests
for Production
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a),
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . . [and] The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Discovery Requests
 
Defendants electronically served Plaintiff with
the FROG, SROG and RPD on February 2, 2024. 
(See Exhibit A to Matteis Decl.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the subject discovery
requests.  (Matteis Decl. ¶ 7.)    As of
the filing date of the motions, Defendants have not received responses from
Defendant.  Accordingly, the Court finds
that Plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses to the FROG, SROG and RPD. 
 
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Defendants
request monetary sanctions for legal fees spent in connection with the motions.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the FROG, SROG and RPD to be an abuse of the discovery process,
warranting monetary sanctions.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).)  Accordingly, the Court imposes monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $918.00, which represents six
hours of attorney time to prepare the three motions and attend the hearing, at
$133 per hour, plus $120 in filing fees for the three motions.[1]   
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’ motions to compel responses to
the FROG, SROG and RPD per Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300,
without objections, within 30 days of notice of the Court’s orders.        
 
Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $918.00 to Defendants, by and through counsel for Defendants, within
30 days of notice of the Court’s orders. 
 
Defendants shall provide
notice of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
