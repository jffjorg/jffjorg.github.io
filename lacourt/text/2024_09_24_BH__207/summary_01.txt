And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23SMCV03071. The defendants, Jonah Berghoff, Stephan Berghoff, and Arezou Berghoff, have moved to compel responses from the plaintiff, Vadim Ivanov, to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Demands for Production of Documents (Set One). The defendants also seek monetary sanctions for legal fees spent in connection with the motions.

The Court finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests in a timely manner and therefore grants the defendants' motions to compel responses. The Court also imposes monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $918.00, which represents six hours of attorney time spent preparing the motions and attending the hearing.

The Court orders the plaintiff to pay the monetary sanctions and provides notice of the Court's orders and filing fees for the three motions.
