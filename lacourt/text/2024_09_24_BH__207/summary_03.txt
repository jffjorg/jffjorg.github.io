Judge Michael E. Whitaker has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel Stephen Bernard, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Stuart Rosen. The motion is unopposed, and Counsel seeks to be relieved due to a breakdown of communication with the client and physical incapacity to litigate following an emergency surgery and resulting complications. The Court finds that the motion complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Rules of Court. As a result, the Court grants Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. Counsel must serve the signed order on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action within 10 days of the date of the order. The Court also discharges as moot an order to show cause regarding monetary sanctions against Counsel for failure to appear in court.
