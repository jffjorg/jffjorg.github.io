And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Defendant Ricardo Marquez to the unlawful detainer complaint filed by Plaintiff PR SM Livorno LLC. The demurrer argued that the notice to pay rent or quit overstates the rent due and is therefore ineffective to support an unlawful detainer. However, since the Defendant did not sign the demurrer papers and did not fill out the proof of service, the demurrer is overruled. The Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 5 days.
