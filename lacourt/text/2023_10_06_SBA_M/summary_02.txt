And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to deem facts admitted as set forth in the Requests for Admission, Set One, is GRANTED. The truth of the matters in the Requests for Admission is deemed admitted as against Ghulam Sarajzada and Aisha Sarajzada. The judge also ordered the defendants to pay sanctions in the amount of $660 to the plaintiff within 30 days. The judge found that the defendants failed to respond to the Requests for Admission, which is a misuse of the discovery process. The court is required to impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney whose failure to serve a timely response necessitated a motion to deem them admitted.
