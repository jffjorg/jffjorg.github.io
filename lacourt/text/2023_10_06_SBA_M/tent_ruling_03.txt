RULING
The demurrer to the FAA is OVERRULED.
BACKGROUND
On July 10, 2023, plaintiff Diana
Hayden filed a complaint against Sofi Stadium, Stadco, and Live Nation for (1)
negligence and (2) premises liability. 
Plaintiff alleges that on October 17, 2021, she and her daughter
attended a Rolling Stones concert at Sofi Stadium.  Complaint, ¶7.  Plaintiff decided to leave the concert early
with the hope of avoiding the rush of the crowd.  Id., ¶8. 
While walking to her car, plaintiff encountered a large crowd of concert
goers who were being directed and forced by defendants through temporary guard
rails.  Id., ¶9.  These rails were not sturdy, and the crowd
began knocking them over in an effort to get to their vehicles faster because
the force and energy of the crowd were also unintentionally knocking the rails
over.  Id., ¶10.  This crowd of people slammed into plaintiff
and caused her to be violently thrown like a ragdoll into adjacent bushes.  This crowd slamming into plaintiff would not
have happened but for defendants negligently forcing the crowd into the rails
and the improper placement of the rails, which were not suitable for the crowd
or directing the crowd.  Also, defendants
failed to take adequate crowd control measures and failed to have adequate
security and crowd control personnel on hand to ensure crowd safety as they
exited the premises.  Id., ¶11.  The result was substantial injury to
plaintiff’s body and mind.  Id., ¶12.
On August 21, 2023, Stadco LA, LLC
(erroneously sued and served as Sofi Stadium and Stadco) filed an answer.
On August 25, 2023, Stadco LA, LLC
filed a FAA.
On August 30, 2023, plaintiff filed
an amendment to complaint correcting Live Nation’s name to Live Nation
Worldwide, Inc.
On August 31, 2023, plaintiff filed
an amendment to complaint designating Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. as Doe
1.
On September 15, 2023, plaintiff
filed an amendment correcting Stadco’s name to Stadco LA, LLC.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
Plaintiff may demur to an answer on
the ground of insufficient pleading of defenses.  CCP §430.20. 
Under CCP §431.30(g), every affirmative defense “shall be separately
stated, and the several defenses shall refer to the causes of action which they
are intended to answer, in a manner by which they may be intelligibly
distinguished.”  “The same pleading of
‘ultimate facts’ rather than ‘evidentiary’ matter or ‘legal conclusions’ is
required as in pleading the complaint.” 
Weil and Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, 6:459.  “The answer must aver facts ‘as carefully and
with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and which
are alleged in the complaint.’”  Id.
(quoting FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
384).  “In general, whatever defendant
bears the burden of proving at trial is ‘new matter,’ and thus must be
specially pleaded in the answer.”  Civ.
Proc. Before Trial, 6:431.  When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context.  Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff demurs to defendant Stadco
LA, LLC’s First Amended Answer and the 1st through 8th
affirmative defenses on the grounds that they fail to state sufficient facts to
constitute a defense and are uncertain.
            Plaintiff argues that the
affirmative defenses fail to set forth any facts whatsoever.
            In opposition, defendant argues that
the court should overrule the demurrer based on California’s liberal pleading
standard that “only requires the plaintiff be put on notice of the nature of
the defenses, and because modern discovery procedures can readily clarify any
ambiguities.”  
            The court finds that the allegations
are sufficient as to each of defendant’s affirmative defenses in its amended answer
as defendant has plead the ultimate facts in support.
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
            Defendant is ordered to give notice.
