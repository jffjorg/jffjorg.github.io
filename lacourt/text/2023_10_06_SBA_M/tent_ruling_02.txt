BACKGROUND
On June 16, 2023, plaintiff ROIC
California, LLC filed a complaint against Ghulam & Sons, Ghulam Sarajzada,
and Aisha Sarajzada for (1) breach of written lease, (2) breach of written
guaranty, (3) account stated, and (4) money had and received.
On August 15, 2023, Ghulam
Sarajzada and Aisha Sarajzada (self-represented) filed an answer.
On August 16, 2023, a default was entered
against Ghulam & Sons.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(b), a
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not
result in automatic admissions.  Rather,
the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.”  Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial,
¶ 8:1370, citing CCP § 2033.280(b).  The
court “shall” grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  CCP § 2033.280(c).  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
ROIC California, LLC requests an order establishing the truth of each matter
specified in the Requests for Admission, Set One, served on July 23, 2023 on
defendants Ghulam Sarajzada and Aisha Sarajzada.
            Plaintiff
asserts that responses were due by August 27, 2023 but that plaintiff’s counsel
has not received responses.
            The
court finds that plaintiff properly served the discovery requests and that
defendants failed to respond.
            The
motion is GRANTED.
Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  
It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated a motion to deem them
admitted.  CCP § 2033.280(c). 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.”  
Plaintiff requests $2685 in sanctions
against defendants.  The court finds that
$660 ($400/hr. x 1.5 hrs., $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount to be imposed
in sanctions against defendants.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
