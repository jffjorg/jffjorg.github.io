```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action in the FAC is OVERRULED. The court finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful death and elder abuse. The court also finds that the defendant's assertion that it was an independent contractor providing therapy services is outside the pleadings and therefore cannot be considered. The court orders the moving defendant to file an answer with 10 days.
