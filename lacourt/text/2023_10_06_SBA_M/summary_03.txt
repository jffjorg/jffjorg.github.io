The demurrer argues that the affirmative defenses filed by the defendant fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a defense and are uncertain. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the allegations are sufficient as to each of the defendant's affirmative defenses. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled. The defendant is ordered to give notice.
