  Joo’s Claim of Exemption.



 
Background
Plaintiff Eastland Corporation sued
a number of Defendants—including Defendant Ji Young Joo—pursuant to a July 31,
2009 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Open Book
Account, (3) Account Stated, (4) Goods Sold and Delivered, and (5) Statutory
Damages on Dishonored Checks.
The claims arose from allegations
that Plaintiff and Defendants entered an agreement for the purchase of
goods—specifically fresh and frozen meat products, with Plaintiff as the seller
and Defendants as the purchasers—and that Plaintiff delivered goods to
Defendants only for Defendants to either fail to pay their debt or to provide
checks that bounced for insufficient funds, thus damaging Plaintiff in the
amount of $55,702.51.
On November 13, 2009, Plaintiff
secured an entry of default against all Defendants except for Tae Hwan Joo and
Moon Kwon Joo, i.e., against Defendants La Galbi, Inc., Moon & Flower,
Inc., Young Jin Corporation, Won Chang, Ji Young Joo, Madangsae, Inc., Ho Bok,
Inc., In Ho Lee, Bok Kim Tae, 153 OK, Inc., and In Gap Chun (the Defaulted
Defendants).
On January 28, 2010, Plaintiff
filed a complete default judgment packet against the Defaulted Defendants.
Pursuant to Plaintiff’s request,
the Court entered judgment against the Defaulted Defendants.
On January 21, 2020, Plaintiff
applied for a renewal of judgment.
That same day, a notice of renewal
of judgment was issued by the Clerk.
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
memorandum of costs after judgment.
That same day, Plaintiff applied for,
and the Clerk issued a writ of execution for a money judgment.
On July 21, 2023, Defendant Ji
Young Joo (Joo) received notice that approximately $53,779.91 had collectively
been taken out of seven bank accounts held by Joo at Bank of America.
On July 31, 2023, Defendant Joo
made an ex parte application to recall and quash the June 15, 2023 writ of
execution. The ex parte application also informed the Court that Defendant Joo
had set a formal motion to set aside default judgment in this matter for
hearing on October 23, 2023.
On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff
opposed the ex parte application.
On August 2, 2023, the Court denied
the ex parte application but calendared a hearing on the same relief for
October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with the motion to set aside default
judgment. The Court ordered the levying officer to hold the funds and not
disburse them.
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed and served a notice of hearing on a claim of exemption made by
Defendant Joo. Service was made on the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office and
Defendant Joo’s counsel—Equitable Law Group.
That same day, Plaintiff’s counsel filed
a notice of opposition to claim of exemption.
On September 20, 2023, the Court
continued the hearing on the claim of exemption to October 23, 2023 to be heard
concurrently with the proposed motion to set aside the default and default
judgment.
On September 25, 2023, Defendant Joo
made her motion to set aside the default.
On September 26, 2023, Defendant Joo
made a motion to recall and quash the writ of execution.
On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff
opposed the motions to set aside default and to quash the writ.
On October 16, 2023, Defendant Joo
replied to the October 9th oppositions.
Defendant Joo’s motion to set
aside, motion to quash, and claim of exemption are now before the Court.
 
Motion
to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment
Legal Standard
The court may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, (d).) A default or default judgment is void if the
defendant was not served or was improperly served. (American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 387; Dill v. Berquist
Const. Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) Generally, a defendant is
considered properly served if the defendant had actual notice of the suit and
the plaintiff substantially complied with the statutory requirements for service.
(See Pasadena Medi-Ctr. Assoc. v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773,
778 [if actual notice is received by the defendant, statutory requirements
should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction];
cf. Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 410-11 [actual
notice is not enough to establish proper service if the plaintiff completely
failed to comply with statutory requirements].)
“A motion for relief under section
473 is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate
court will not interfere unless there is a clear showing of an abuse.
[Citation.] The statute is remedial and should be liberally applied to carry
out the policy of permitting trial on the merits, but the moving party has the
burden of showing good cause. [Citations.]” (David v. Thayer (1980) 133
Cal.App.3d 892, 904-905.)
The Court also notes that while
Defendant cites Civil Code section 1788 subdivision (a)(1) allowing a motion to
set aside a default judgment within 180 days of the first actual notice of the
action, that provision is part of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Act (Civil
Code § 1788 et seq.) and applies by its terms only to actions “brought by a
debt buyer.” (Civ. Code § 1788 subd. (a)(1).) There has been no argument that
this is such an action; therefore, this statute does not apply. 
Order Setting Aside Default and
Default Judgment: DENIED.
“An order is considered void on its
face only when the invalidity is apparent from an inspection of the judgment
roll or court record without consideration of extrinsic evidence. [Citations.]
There is no time limit to attack a judgment void on its face. [Citations.] If
the invalidity can be shown only through consideration of extrinsic evidence,
such as declarations or testimony, the order is not void on its face. Such an
order must be challenged within the six-month time limit prescribed by section
473, subdivision (b), or by an independent action in equity. [Citations.]” (Pittman
v. Beck Park Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021.)
“When a default judgment has been
taken, the judgment roll consists of ‘the summons, with the affidavit or proof
of service; the complaint; the request for entry of default ..., and a copy of
the judgment.’ ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 670, subd. (a).)” (Kremerman v. White
(2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 370.)
Here, Defendant Joo attacks the
default and default judgment taken against her in 2010 through extrinsic
evidence rather than through an inspection of the judgment roll, i.e., through
her own declaration as to where she lived in 2008 and 2009 and based on
addresses shown in her tax returns. (See Set Aside Mot., Joo Decl., ¶¶ 1-8, Ex.
A; see also OC Interior Servs., LLC v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 1318, 1326-1327 [“A direct attack means an attack on the judgment
in the action in which it was rendered, or a proceeding instituted for the
specific purpose of attacking the judgment. [Citation.]”].) Even if she intends
to challenge it on its face, there would be no basis to grant the motion, as she
makes no argument, and the Court sees none, that there is an issue in the judgment
roll that shows that the judgment is void.
To argue in the alternative that the
judgment is void based on extrinsic evidence, she must have either challenged
the default judgment within six months of it being entered pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), or, arguably, file a suit in
equity seeking to set aside the judgment on equitable grounds. (Pittman v.
Beck Park Apartments Ltd., supra, 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021; Kremerman
v. White, supra, 71 Cal.App.5th at p. 370; see, e.g., City of Los
Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 728-732 [owner of real
property brought an independent action in equity to vacate a recorded quiet
title judgment that appeared valid on its face quieting title in favor of
appellant].) This motion was brought more than a decade after judgment was
entered, making relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b) unavailable. Neither is this motion an action in equity.
However, even assuming that this
motion is requesting equitable relief and that a separate action in equity is
not required, Defendant has not met her burden. As held by our Supreme Court in
Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981, a trial court may vacate
a default on equitable grounds such as extrinsic mistake after the statute of
limitations for statutory relief has run; however, such relief “may be given
only in exceptional circumstances.” 
The Court is not at all clear that
there is any extrinsic mistake here. “Extrinsic mistake is found when . . . a
mistake led a court to do what it never intended.” (Ibid., citation
omitted.) The mistake found in Rappleyea was that the court clerk
misunderstood the number of answering defendants, thereby advising counsel that
the fee to file an Answer was $89, when the fee actually was $159 because there
were two defendants. Such a mistake led to the default judgment. (Id. at
978, 983.) Here, there is no allegation that any party, including the Court,
committed any such mistake.
However, even assuming that a
failure to actually serve a defendant where they lived constituted an extrinsic
mistake, to “set aside a judgment based on extrinsic mistake one must satisfy
three elements. First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a
meritorious case. Second[], the party seeking to set aside the default must
articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original
action. Last[], the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set
aside the default once it was discovered.” (Id. at p. 982, citation
omitted.)
Here, Defendant has satisfied the
second two elements, but not the first. Defendant does not show that she has a
meritorious case; indeed, her only statement about the underlying merits is in
her final paragraph of her declaration, in which she has she has no
relationship with any of the parties involved in the contracts and “I do not
have any connections or business with the plaintiff nor any of the other
parties related to this lawsuit.” (Mot., Dec. Ji Young Joo, ¶ 8.) This is
conclusory and leaves the Court with many questions: does she actually know
these parties or is she contending this is a mistaken identity? Is there a
marital or other family relationship? Does she have any idea why Plaintiff
might believe her to be involved? Her Reply Declaration, in which she admits
that she did receive a letter from Plaintiff’s counsel in March 2009 regarding
a balance due, does not answer these questions. Again, she states in a
conclusory fashion that she had “absolutely no involvement with such
obligation,” and that her “reason for calling was to inform them they had the
wrong person.” (Reply, Ji Young Joo, at ¶¶2, 3.) She provides no details and no
corroborating evidence of any of her general denials. 
The Court concludes that, even assuming
an extrinsic mistake existed, to set aside a default judgment 13 years after that
judgment has been entered requires more proof of a meritorious case than these conclusory
statements. Neither does Defendant attach an Answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed in the matter, as is required for motions filed under Code Civ.
Proc. section 473.5, which could also have assisted the Court in determining
the merits of her defense.
The Court further notes that, as
argued by Defendant (Set Aside Opp’n, p. 4), relief pursuant to the alternative
ground for this motion—Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5—is not available
here because such relief required that this motion be made either two years
after entry of default judgment or 180 days after written notice of the entry
of default judgment, whichever came earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(a).) Default judgment against Defendant Joo was entered in 2010, and this
motion was not brought until 2023, well past two years after the default judgment
was entered—written notice of the entry of default judgment aside.
The result in this case is
consistent with the two conflicting public policies in the state regarding
judgments. “[D]uring the period when relief under section 473 is available,
there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and allowing the
requesting party their day in court. Beyond the period when relief under
section 473 is available, there is a strong public policy in favor of the
finality of judgments and only in exceptional circumstances should relief be
granted.” (In re Marriage of Stevenot (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1071; Rappleyea,
supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 981-982 [quoting same].) Unfortunately, this
motion falls well outside the statutory period, and Defendant has not met her
heavy burden of showing a basis for equitable relief.
Defendant Joo’s motion to set aside
is thus DENIED.
 
Motion
to Quash Writ of Execution
Legal
Standard
A
writ of execution is issued to direct the levying officer to enforce a money
judgment in a manner prescribed by law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 699.520.) The
court has the inherent equitable power over its process to recall and/or quash
a writ of execution improperly or inadvertently issued or to vacate an
execution levy. (See Meyer v. Meyer (1952) 115 Cal.App.2d 48, 49; United
Taxpayers’ Co. v. City & County of San Francisco (1927) 202 Cal. 264,
266; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 128 [The court has inherent power to control
the litigation process].) For example, a motion to recall and quash a writ of
execution and release any liens lies where, among other things, the judgment is
void. (Jones v. World Life Research Inst. (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.)
“‘[W]hen an execution is quashed, any levy made pursuant thereto falls with it,
and any title to the property vested in the sheriff by the levy is defeated.’”
(Hulse v. Davis (1927) 200 Cal. 316, 318, quoting Wellington v.
Wedgwick (1859) 12 Cal. 469, 475.)
Order
Quashing Writ of Execution: DENIED.
After
review, the Court finds that Defendant Joo is not entitled to the relief
requested.
Defendant
Joo’s argument is that the writ should be quashed because the Court lacked
personal jurisdiction to enter default judgment against Joo. Specifically, as
with the motion to set aside, Joo argues that she was never served with the
summons and Complaint given that she did not live at the Masselin address where
service was made in 2009. (Quash Mot., pp. 4-6.)
The
Court has addressed this argument in discussing the motion to set aside default
and adopts that discussion to find that Defendant has not met her burden on any
of the available grounds. 
Defendant
Joo’s motion to quash is thus DENIED.

 
Claim of Exemption
Legal
Standard
Except
as otherwise provided by law, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to
enforcement of a money judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.010, subd. (a).)
Property that has been levied upon may be claimed to be exempt as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure sections 703.510 to 703.610 unless otherwise provided
by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.510, subd. (a); see Code Civ. Proc., §§
703.510-703.610 [Enforcement of Money Judgments, Exemptions, Procedure for
Claiming Exemptions After Levy].) The debtor must make the claim within 15 days
of the date the notice of levy on the property was served (20 days if the
notice of levy was served by mail). (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.520, subd. (a).) At
the hearing on the claim of exception, the claimant has the burden of proof.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (b).)
Order
Granting Claim of Exemption: CONTINUED.
The
claim of exemption—usually made on Judicial Council form EJ-160—is not attached
to the August 16, 2023 notice of hearing on claim of exemption or the August
16, 2023 notice of opposition to claim of exemption. The Court therefore cannot
determine the claim’s timeliness or its merit. Moreover, the Court is not in
receipt of the financial statement with which Plaintiff takes issue nor any
other documents that will assist the Court to make a proper determination as to
the claim. (See 8/16/23 Notice of Opp’n, items 5-6.)
The
Court thus CONTINUES the hearing on the claim of exemption to a mutually
convenient date to be determined at oral argument.
Supplemental
filings attaching the claim of exemption and its supporting documents SHALL be
made no fewer than five court days in advance of the continued hearing.
The
Court suggests that the parties contact the levying officer—the Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Office (LASD)—to ask that the LASD file the claim of exemption
and supporting documents with the Court, which the levying officer should have
promptly done after receiving Plaintiff’s notice of opposition to the claim of
exemption and notice of motion for an order determining the claim of exemption.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 703.550, subd. (a); see 8/16/23 Notice of Hearing on Claim
of Exemption, § 1 [identifying LASD as the levying officer].) 

Conclusion
Defendant Ji Young Joo’s Motion to
Set Aside and Vacate Default is DENIED.
Defendant Ji Young Joo’s Motion to
Recall and Quash Writ of Execution is DENIED.
Defendant Ji Young Joo’s Claim of
Exemption is CONTINUED.
