SoFi Lending Corp.

For the Court

SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff SoFi
Lending Corp. (Plaintiff) has filed a motion to enforce settlement pursuant to
CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff filed this motion because Defendant Derek Hennessy
(Defendant) has not complied with the terms of a written settlement stipulation
made between the parties and approved by the Court on March 30, 2020.
 
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant defaulted on the agreement and there is now due and
owing the amount of $25,912.41. The principal balance was $43,828.41, and
Defendant has made $17,916.00 in payments. (Rohan Decl., Exs. A and B.)
 
The stipulation
between the parties provides that “the parties further agree that the Court may
dismiss Case No. PC058268 but retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the terms of this agreement.” (Rohan Decl.,
Ex. A, ¶ 17.) 
 
ANALYSIS
CCP § 664.6
provides that “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed
by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,
for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
When
considering a CCP § 664.6 motion, “the trial court must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement of all or part of the case.
In making this determination, trial judges, in the sound exercise of their
discretion, may receive oral testimony or may determine the motion upon
declarations alone.” (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994;
Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 565.)
 
Plaintiff has
made this motion pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The parties stipulated to the settlement
of this case. The Court, by virtue of Plaintiff filing this motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. Additionally, the
agreement between the parties allowed the Court to retain jurisdiction over the
parties in order to enforce the settlement. 
 
Plaintiff
provided a declaration with attached exhibits indicating that Defendant failed
to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. Therefore, it is
appropriate for the Court to enforce the settlement and enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to enforce settlement is granted. Judgement is entered against Defendant
in the amount of $25,912.41.
