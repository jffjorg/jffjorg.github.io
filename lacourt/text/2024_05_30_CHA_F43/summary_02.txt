And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production. The motion was filed by Defendant FCA US LLC, and seeks to compel Plaintiff Juan Gonzalez Perez to provide further responses to Request for Production No. 20. The request seeks documents reflecting any social media posts made by the Plaintiff concerning the subject vehicle. The Plaintiff objected to the request on several grounds, including that it is vague, ambiguous, and compound, and that it seeks information contained in business records. The Defendant argues that further response is necessary because the Plaintiff only provided a list of objections rather than providing the requested documents. The court finds that the motion is denied as moot because the Plaintiff has already supplemented their response to the request. The court also awards sanctions of $1,000 to the Defendant for having to bring the motion.
