[1] Despite Defendants’
contention in opposition that Summers stands for the proposition that a
plaintiff’s ownership interest must be “undisputed” (Opp. p. 4:16-17
[“Plaintiff has failed to assert or show that the Plaintiffs ownership interest
is undisputed”], Summers contains no such language. Rather, Summers requires
a trial court to solve or resolve the parties’
respective percentage of ownership. 
 


[2] To the extent that there is a dispute as the truthfulness of the parties’
statements, though both signed under the penalty of perjury, that could be
resolved by submission of each payment Plaintiff made to her mother via direct
deposit, direct transfer, or by check. (Reply p. 12 of 14 of PDF.) To the
extent that Defendants would argue that payments from Plaintiff to the
mother/Defendants were for non-real property related costs, the totality of the
circumstances would indicate otherwise as why else would Plaintiff send her mom
checks in the amount of a mortgage, every month (when a
mortgage is due), and denoted for "mortgage."
