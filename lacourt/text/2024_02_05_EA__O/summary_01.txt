And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment of referee. The court finds that the Plaintiff has an ownership interest in the property as a joint tenant with her parents/Defendants as evidenced by the grant deed. The court also finds that partition by sale is more equitable than physical division.

The court appoints Attorney Matthew L. Taylor as the referee in this case and instructs him to divide or sell the property as ordered by the court. The court also orders that the costs of the partition be equally borne by the Plaintiff and Defendants, each owing one third of the cost.

The court retains jurisdiction of this matter to confirm the sale of the property and to issue whatever additional orders may be required to carry out the partition of the property.
