And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant City Fibers, Inc. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff Carlos Chavez is valid and enforceable. The agreement was presented to Plaintiff in Spanish, and he executed it on January 19, 2019. The Court also finds that the settlement agreement signed by Plaintiff does not conflict with the arbitration agreement.

The Court rejects Plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable due to lack of opportunity to review the agreement and limitations of the agreement. The Court also rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply to the case.

The Court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable under California law, and the dispute is subject to arbitration. The Court orders the parties to select an individual arbitrator within the agreed-upon organization or, if they cannot agree, to submit a list of one to two arbitrators and the Court will select the individual. The parties have 30 days to begin the selection process.
