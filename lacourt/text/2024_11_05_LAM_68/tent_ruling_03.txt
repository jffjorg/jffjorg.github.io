to Compel Arbitration
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Carlos Chavez began employment with
Defendant City Fibers, Inc. in 1992. In May 2023, Plaintiff suffered from
diabetes complications, thereby leading to a toe amputation, and required a
work absence. Plaintiff took leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. When
Plaintiff sought to return to work, Plaintiff was told the position was no
longer available. 
 
On
April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. FEHA Disability Discrimination
2. Retaliation in Violation of FEHA 3. Failure to Engage in the Interactive
Process 4. Failure to Accommodate. Defendant answered the complaint on June 3,
2024.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant City Fibers, Inc. move to compel arbitration
on the complaint filed by Plaintiff Carlos Chavez. Defendant maintains all
claims are subject to arbitration under the terms of two separate agreements—one
agreement executed during employment, and the second a settlement agreement.
Defendant denies any unconscionability. Plaintiff in opposition challenges
enforcement of the agreement on grounds of the lack of an ability to enforce
the agreement due to unconscionable practices in presenting the agreement to
Plaintiff, a limited in literacy adult, without any opportunity to seek
assistance from his daughter or a lawyer. Plaintiff also alleges the terms are
unconscionable, due to the preselected arbitration service. Defendant in
extensive reply also denies any unconscionability, and maintains Plaintiff
accepted the agreement upon signing it.
 
The
first arbitration policy was implemented in 2019, and presented to all
employees. The “Mutual Arbitration Policy” agreement was presented in both
English and Spanish versions, with meetings regarding the agreement in either
English or Spanish as well. Defendant represents employees were given the
option of reviewing the agreements and not required to sign at the time of the
meeting. Defendant states Plaintiff executed the Spanish language version of
the agreement on January 19, 2019. [Declaration of Brett Jones.]
 
In
February 2019, non-exempt employees, like Plaintiff, were offered a settlement
due to a pending “putative class action” against the company, which led to an
agreed upon payment in exchange for a release. Plaintiff signed the English
version of this agreement, and was paid the net sum of $2,002.26. [Jones Decl.]
 
Plaintiff
acknowledges signing the settlement agreement itself, and only states no recall
to executing the preceding arbitration agreement. [Ex. D: Declaration of Carlos
Chavez.] The court finds the undisputed Spanish language version of the
arbitration agreement was also signed [Jones Decl.], notwithstanding the
defenses to entry into the agreements addressed below.
 
The
court first addresses the parties’ dispute as to the application of the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA). The MAP provides the FAA shall govern arbitration.
Plaintiff again challenges enforcement under the FAA due to lack of a validly
executed agreement, but additionally maintains Defendant insufficiently
establishes interstate commerce. 
 
Defendant
represents engaging in interstate commerce and therefore contend FAA rules
govern. [Jones Decl.] Plaintiff relies on a challenge to the sufficiency of the
Jones declaration and Plaintiff’s own declaration regarding the lack of any
direct engagement with interstate commerce simply based on the operation of a
forklift, as the basis for challenging FAA preemption. [Chavez Decl.]. 
 
Paragraph
two of the Jones declaration states: “City Fibers is a recycling business that
collects, sorts, and resells manufactured waste from businesses across Southern
California. This waste includes papers, plastics, metals, and other such
recyclable materials. City Fibers sells the waste to customers across the
United States and abroad, after which its customers recycle or repurpose the
materials into different products. In connection with its business, City Fibers
uses purchased equipment and leased vehicles that are made outside of
California.”
 
“The
court recognized the FAA's reach coincides with that of the commerce clause,
and the FAA applies not only to the actual physical interstate shipment of
goods but also contracts relating to interstate commerce.” (Basura v. U.S.
Home Corp. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1213–1214.) “The United States
Supreme Court has identified ‘three categories of activity that Congress may
regulate under its commerce power: (1) “the use of the channels of interstate
commerce”; (2) “the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or
things in interstate commerce, ...”; and (3) “those activities having a
substantial relation to interstate commerce, ... i.e., those activities that
substantially affect interstate commerce.”’” (Evenskaas v. California
Transit, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 285, 293.) Courts engage in a
“‘four-factor test for determining whether a regulated activity “substantially
affects” interstate commerce.’ (Citation.) These considerations are: (1)
whether the regulated activity is commercial/economic in nature; (2) whether an
express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach;
(3) whether Congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed
activity on interstate commerce; and (4) whether the link between the prohibited
activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.” (U.S. v.
Adams (9th Cir. 2003) 343 F.3d 1024, 1028.) 
 
The
represented nationwide distribution of recycled products from the facility
sufficiently establishes interstate commerce, and therefore application of the
FAA. (Hoover v. American
Income Life Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) The activity
is clearly commercial in nature, with no cited jurisdictional limit or express
congressional findings. The court also finds no prohibited activity involved. 
 
Notwithstanding,
barring a conflict supporting a preemption of a specific provision under FAA,
the court adheres to the California standard for compelling arbitration in that
FAA and California adhere to the same standards for review of arbitration agreements.
The court finds no conflict with the FAA under the terms of the agreement in
reviewing the contract formation defenses. (Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S.
468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346; see Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906.)
 
“A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.) “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
The
law creates a general presumption in favor of arbitration. In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. “‘Under “both
federal and state law, the threshold question presented by a petition to compel
arbitration is whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.”’” (Long v. Provide Commerce, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
855, 861.) “Private arbitration is a matter of
agreement between the parties and is governed by contract law. (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993)
6 Cal.4th 307, 313.) In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. The burden then shifts to the
resisting party to prove by a preponderance of evidence a ground for denial
(e.g., fraud, unconscionability, etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164–165; Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.) Any challenges to the formation
of the arbitration agreement should be considered before any order sending the
parties to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs
all evidence, including affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if
applicable, oral testimony to determine whether the action goes to arbitration.
(Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at
p. 758.)
 
The
court finds the MAP agreement covers the disputed claims. The submitted copy of
the settlement agreement is illegible, and therefore not relied upon. The
burden now shifts to the challenging party to establish the defense. (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l Securities Corp., supra, 14 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic, supra,
72 Cal.App.5th at pp. 164–165; Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra,
144 Cal.App.4th at p. 758.) 
 
Unconscionability
claims have both a “‘procedural’” and “‘substantive’” element. (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51
Cal.App.4th 1519, 1531.) “‘Procedural unconscionability’” concerns the manner
in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at
that time. (Kinney v. United HealthCare
Services, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1329.) “‘The procedural
element focuses on two factors: “oppression” and “surprise.”  “Oppression” arises from an inequality of
bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of
meaningful choice. “Surprise” involves the extent to which the supposedly
agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted
by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.’” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1532.)
“Substantive unconscionability” involves contracts leading to “‘“overly
harsh”’” or “‘“one-sided”’” results.’” … “[U]nconscionability turns … on an
absence of ‘justification “for it…” [and therefore] must be evaluated as of the
time the contract was made.’” (Ibid.) 
 
In
the employment context, a mandatory arbitration agreement
is enforceable, if it “(1) provides for neutral arbitrators, (2) provides for
more than minimal discovery, (3) requires a written award, (4) provides for all
of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) does
not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators’ fees
or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 102.) Required execution of an
arbitration agreement as a condition of employment may constitute an
unconscionable provision, where the contract lacks mutuality and/or imposes a
disadvantage on the employee. (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp.
114-118; Little v. Auto Stiegler, Inc. (2003)
29 Cal.4th 1064, 1071-1072.) A showing of procedural
unconscionability will not invalidate an arbitration clause, but can lead to
greater scrutiny under the substantive standard, thereby supporting
invalidation. (Davis v. TWC Dealer Group, Inc. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 662, 674 accord OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8
Cal.5th 111, 129-130.)
 
Cases addressing unconscionability offer
guidance on the standard of the employment adhesion contract—an agreement
substantively presented as “take or it leave it” the circumstances of which
potentially impose a disadvantage on the employee. “With respect to preemployment
arbitration contracts, we have observed that ‘the economic pressure exerted by
employers on all but the most sought-after employees may be particularly acute,
for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary
employment, and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an
arbitration requirement.’” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, supra, 8 Cal.5th
at pp. 126-127 accord Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services,
Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 115; Ramirez v. Charter Communications,
Inc. (2024) 16 Cal.5th 478 [322 Cal.Rptr.3d 825, 837]; Hasty v. American
Automobile Association of Northern California, Nevada & Utah (2023) 98
Cal.App.5th 1041, 1055-1056; Serafin v. Balco Properties Ltd., LLC
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 179-181; see Grand Prospect Partners, L.P. v.
Ross Dress for Less, Inc. (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1351; Serpa v.
California Surety Investigations, Inc. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 695, 705.)
 
Plaintiff
essentially relies on an assertion of unconscionability based on a “deception
and concealment” as to the terms of the agreement given the literacy
limitations of Plaintiff, notwithstanding the vague lack of recall in seeing
said MAP document. The unchallenged declaration of Jones establishes Spanish
language presentation and an offer to allow time for review, if requested. The
lack of recall in an of itself lacks any form of evidence sufficient to
establish a finding of oppressive circumstances. Continued employment by Plaintiff can constitute a basis for a
finding of acceptance of the arbitration agreement. (See Gorlach v. Sports Club Co.
(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1497, 1508 accord Craig
v. Brown & Root, Inc. (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 416, 420-421.) 
 
The
circumstances while demonstrating a large group process as part of the
enrollment of all non-exempt employees, still lacks sufficient support
demonstrating actual true concern for time to review the document or consider
alternatives. The court therefore finds no factual basis of support for the
argument of procedural unconscionability. (OTO,
L.L.C. v. Kho, supra, 8 Cal.5th at
pp. 126-127; Hasty v. American Automobile
Association of Northern California, Nevada & Utah, supra, 98 Cal.App.5th 1041 [317 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp.
309-311]; Davis v. TWC Dealer Group, Inc. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 662, 674; Grand Prospect Partners, L.P. v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc., supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 1349, 1352-1354.) 
 
Asuming
a degree of procedural unconscionability however, the court will consider the
terms in context of the substantive unconscionability defense. “[A]lthough
adhesion alone generally indicates only a low degree of procedural
unconscionability, the potential for overreaching in the employment context
warrants close scrutiny of the contract's terms.” (Ramirez v. Charter
Communications, Inc., supra, 16 Cal.5th 478 [322 Cal.Rptr.3d at p.
838].) 
 
Nothing
in the opposition offers any challenge to the completeness of the terms in the
Spanish language version of the MAP. The Chavez declaration offers no challenge
to the representation that Christina Jones explained the agreement in Spanish
at the time of execution. Again, Chavez lacks any recall of signing said first
agreement, notwithstanding the evidence of the document. (Carmona v. Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 74, 84-86.) Chavez only
addresses the settlement agreement, and relies on the lack of explanation of said terms waiving a jury
trial and compelling arbitration, and maintains American Arbitration
Association (AAA) were not attached to the MAP, with only “generic reference”
to AAA. (Trivedi v. Curexo Technology Corp. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th
387, 392 disapproved of by Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016)
62 Cal.4th 1237 on unrelated grounds.) 
 
Plaintiff
fails to identify any and all of the exact offending language. The court cites
to certain provision referencing AAA: “The Employment Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in place at the time of the dispute
will govern the procedures to be used in arbitration, unless you and the
Company agree otherwise in writing. The current version of those Rules is
available for you to review at www.adr.org and you may also request a copy from
the Company. [¶¶] A neutral party, the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”), runs the proceedings, which are held privately. Since 1926, AAA has
handled many thousands of cases. Though arbitration is much less formal than a
court trial, it is an orderly proceeding, governed by rules of procedure and
legal standards of conduct. The arbitrator’s responsibility is to determine
whether the Company’s policies and procedures and applicable law have been
complied with in the matter submitted for arbitration. The arbitrator shall
render a written decision on the matter within 30 days after the arbitration
hearing is concluded and post-hearing briefs, if any, are submitted. [¶¶] “If
you would like to receive or review a copy of the AAA Rules, in either English
or Spanish, please request a copy or visit the website www.adr.org.”
 
The
agreement provides other references explaining the process, and directs
Plaintiff to a copy, as shown in the last paragraph. While extrinsic reference
can arguably constitute a basis for challenge, the opposition lacks any
substantive support for this position. Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc., supra,
62 Cal.4th at p. 1246.) The court therefore finds no basis of substantive
unconscionability on this outlier cited case.
 
Finally,
Plaintiff offers challenge on the “repeat player effect.” The position appears
to suggest that use of ADR and adherence to AAA rules will lead to a more
favorable outcome for the employer, as a repeat customer of said services. (Haas v. County of San Bernardino (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1017, 1030.) While the
court acknowledges the doctrine, the general statement lacks any evidentiary
support. The court declines to find an entire organization biased based on
accusation. Plaintiff may raise potential concerns to any individually
appointed arbitrator, but the court will not outright reject the organization
based on the mere raising of the concern. (Id. at pp. 1031-1033; Mercuro v.
Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 167, 178-179.) 
 
The
court again finds no substantively unconscionable terms with the MAP. The court
therefore finds no factual basis of support for the argument of
unconscionability. The action is subject to arbitration. The motion is GRANTED
in its entirety. The court stays the action. (Code Civ. Proc.,§ 1281.4.) 
 
The participating
parties are therefore ordered to select an individual arbitrator within the
agreed upon organization. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the
court orders the parties to submit a list of one to two arbitrators from each
party, where the court will select the individual. The parties have 30 days
from the date of this order to begin the selection process, with any proposed
list due the day after the lapse of the 30-day period. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.6.) 
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management conference,
and set an OSC re: Arbitration Status.
 
Defendant
