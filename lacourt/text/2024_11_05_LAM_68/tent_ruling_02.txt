SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff,
Roshdy Abdelmonen and Doaa Elbarbry allege non-payment of wages and wrongful
termination upon complaining about certain unlawful conduct occurring on the
premises. On October 5, 2023, Plaintiffs field a complaint for wage and hour
violations, Retaliation and Wrongful Termination, and Unfair Business
Practices. On October 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 170.6 challenge, thereby
leading to the reassignment of the case to Department 6 from Department 56. On
October 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint. On October 27,
2024, the court entered the stipulation of the parties for the filing of a
second amended complaint. On April 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their second
amended complaint. 
 
RULING
Demurrer: OVERRULED.
Defendants,
RHDM Oil, Inc. and Mohammed Ansari submit a demurrer to the entire second
amended complaint on grounds of failure to allege sufficient facts to each and
every cause of action. Plaintiffs in opposition maintain the operative
complaint is properly pled. Defendants in reply cites to the standard for
review of a pleading in the demurrer state, and reiterates the failures to
state factual bases for each and every cause of action. 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a
demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of
law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been
stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury
v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition
Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder
our liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave
to amend.] 
 
1st
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 510
2nd
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 1197
Defendant
challenges the subject causes of action on grounds of violation of the three
year statute of limitations. The complaint alleges unpaid overtime wages from
2012 to November 2020. The complaint was not filed until “November 2023.”
Plaintiff counters that the complaint was filed on October 5, 2023, thereby
rendering the complaint timely under continuing accrual doctrine. 
 
The
action was timely filed. The court record shows a filing date of October 5,
2023, contrary to the representation of counsel in the demurrer. The court
reminds counsel that appearances are made as an officer of the court, and the
court expects truthful and accurate representations on objectively verifiable
items.
 
The
cause of action is otherwise properly pled. The challenge to the factual basis
of the claim regarding insufficient exact identification of each and every pay
period will not undermine the validity of the claim. Defendants may conduct
discovery. The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
3rd
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 201 & 202 
Defendants
challenge the factual sufficiency of the claim on grounds that the operative
complaint insufficiently articulates the facts supporting the nonpayment of
wages within 72 hours of termination. Plaintiffs in opposition contend the
demurrer relies on fabrications of allegations not actually pled anywhere in
the operative complaint, and Plaintiffs properly plead their claims for
nonpayment of wages.
 
Defendants
improperly rely on qualitative extrinsic inference regarding the basis of the
end of employment. The court finds the cause of action properly pled.
Defendants may conduct discovery. The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
4th
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 204
Defendants
maintain no claim under Labor Code section 204 can be pled outside of a PAGA
action. Plaintiffs counter that Defendants cite to inapplicable statutory
authority and reiterate the propriety of the cause of action. 
 
The
court finds no PAGA limitation under Labor Code section 204. Nothing in the
subject causes of action references Labor Code section 210. The cause of action
is otherwise properly pled. The challenge to the factual basis of the claim
regarding insufficient exact identification of each and every pay period will
not undermine the validity of the claim. Defendants may conduct discovery. The
demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
5th
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 226
The
demurrer presents no apparent substantive challenge to this specific cause of
action. The demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
6th
Cause of Action: Retaliation and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Labor
Code section 1102.5
Defendants
challenge the lack of facts meeting the Labor Code section 1102.5,
Whistleblower Protection, elements regarding the link between an adverse
employment action and the purportedly unlawful conduct (e.g. gambling on the
premises). Plaintiff cites to Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (c),
regarding retaliatory conduct for Plaintiffs’ refusal to facilitate gambling
practices on the premises. Plaintiffs were subsequently terminated.  
 
The
cause of action is properly pled. The challenge to the factual basis of the
claim regarding based on extrinsic qualitative distinctions will not undermine
the validity of the claim. Defendants may conduct discovery. The demurrer is
OVERRULED. 
 
7th
Cause of Action: Violation of Labor Code section 558.1
Defendant
challenges the lack of any basis imputing liability to individual defendant
Ansari. Plaintiffs counter with citation to Ansari’s involvement with business
operations, thereby establishing a basis of liability. 
 
Labor Code section 558.1 provides in
part: “(a) Any employer or other person acting
on behalf of an employer, who violates, or causes to be violated, any provision
regulating minimum wages or hours and days of work in any order of the
Industrial Welfare Commission, or violates, or causes to be violated, Sections
203, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194, or 2802, may be held liable as the employer for
such violation. (b) For purposes of this section, the term ‘other person
acting on behalf of an employer’ is limited to a natural person who is an
owner, director, officer, or managing agent of the employer, and the term ‘managing
agent’ has the same meaning as in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of the Civil
Code.”
 
Plaintiffs sufficiently allege involvement of Ansari.
The demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
8th
Cause of Action: Unfair Business Practices
Defendants challenge the factual sufficiency
based on recitation of the code section without any factual description.
Plaintiffs counter the claim is based on the preceding wage and hour
violations. 
 
The
UCL does not proscribe specific acts, but broadly prohibits ‘any unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising....’” [¶] “‘A private plaintiff must make a twofold
showing: he or she must demonstrate injury in fact and a loss of money
or property caused by unfair competition.’ (Citation.)”
(Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359.) Fact specific pleading is not required in order to
allege an unfair business practice. (Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46–47. 
 
An
“unlawful” practice “means any practices forbidden
by law, be it civil or criminal, federal, state, or municipal, statutory,
regulatory, or court-made.… ‘Unfair’ simply means any practice whose harm to
the victim outweighs its benefits. (Citation.) ‘Fraudulent,’ as used in the
statute, does not refer to the common law tort of fraud but only requires a
showing members of the public ‘“are likely to be deceived.”’” (Saunders v. Superior Court (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 832, 838–839.) “[A]n unfair business practice also means”
the relied upon public policy provision is “tethered” to a specific regulatory
provisions. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 49, 81.) Fundamentally, recovery
requires a direct harm to the consumer, and actual reliance. (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 310, 326–327.) 
 
The
operative complaint specifically relies on the incorporated wage and hour
claims, even if not specifically repeated. The claims are therefore
sufficiently linked. The demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
 
Motion to Strike: DENIED.
Defendants
move to strike 18 separately identified items: 
·

The
motion to strike any and all wage and hour references is DENIED. Plaintiffs
present a sufficient basis for the subject items, as established in the
demurrer.
 
The
operative complaint sufficiently articulates the statutory basis for recovery
of attorney fees and liquidated damages. The motion is DENIED. Any challenge to
expert fees is premature. The motion is DENIED to this as well.
 
On the punitive
damages claim, the court refers to the statute. Civil Code section 3294,
subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice,
oppression, or fraud, which are defined
as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
Plaintiffs
rely on the whistleblower statute. For purposes of the motion to strike, the
whistleblower liability claim sufficiently supports the claim for punitive
damages. (Mathews v. Happy Valley Conference Center, Inc. (2019) 43
Cal.App.5th 236, 267-268.) The motion is DENIED.
 
Defendants
