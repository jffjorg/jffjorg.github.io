And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel inspection of the premises of Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. The inspection is limited to unrestricted areas of the warehouse, and the parties are to mutually agree on a date and time for the inspection. The judge also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, ordering the defendant to serve verified responses within 10 days. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions in the amount of $250 against both counsel and Grand Life, Inc.

The dispute centers around the plaintiff's claim that the defendant stole at least 21,528 pairs of shoes, and the defendant's claim that the merchandise was stored in restricted areas of the warehouse. The plaintiff seeks to inspect the premises to investigate the alleged theft, while the defendant seeks to limit the inspection to unrestricted areas.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion to compel inspection is granted, as the defendant's objections are deemed waived. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories is granted, as the defendant has failed to respond to the interrogatories.
