And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Kenneth Armstrong, has filed a motion to compel further responses to document requests, set 1, numbers 4, 14, and 43, from the defendant, Gonzalez Food Enterprises, Inc. (erroneously sued and served as Vallarta Food Enterprises, Inc. (Doe1)). The plaintiff also seeks an order overruling and striking the defendant's objections to the requests, as well as sanctions against the defendant and its attorneys in the amount of $3,210.00.

The judge has denied the motion. The judge found that the defendant's responses to the document requests were incomplete and inadequate, but the plaintiff did not meet the burden of showing that the defendant's objections were without merit or too general. The judge also found that the defendant's objections to requests 14 and 43 had merit, as the requests were overbroad and ambiguous. The judge did not find that the plaintiff was entitled to sanctions against the defendant or its attorneys.
