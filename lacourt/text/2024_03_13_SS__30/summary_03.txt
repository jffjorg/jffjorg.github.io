It simply requires that he frame his allegations in order to state a cause of action; and if a plaintiff is unable to do so after an adequate and reasonable opportunity is afforded, he must proceed to review of such legal determination by appeal, rather than seek another trial forum in which to reassert the same claims.” (Wells, supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 789.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint is denied. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to timely amend the complaint after the demurrer was sustained, but the judge found that the plaintiff had elected to no longer prosecute the claim for general negligence and instead intended to prosecute the cause of action for premises liability and/or dangerous condition of public property. The judge agreed with the plaintiff that the cause of action for premises liability/dangerous condition of public property still remained and that the plaintiff did not need to amend the complaint to prosecute this claim. The judge also found that Code of Civil Procedure section 581(f)(2) did not apply in this case, as the demurrer was only sustained as to the second cause of action for negligence and not to the entire complaint.
