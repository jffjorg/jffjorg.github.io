And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motions filed by Defendant Dushyant Singh to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents, as well as his request for sanctions. The Defendant served these requests on Plaintiff Karen Smith on September 14, 2022, but the Plaintiff has failed to provide responses. The Court grants the Defendant's motions to compel, ordering the Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days of this order. The Court also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, as the motions were not opposed and because California law does not allow for monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
