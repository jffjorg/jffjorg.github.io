And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motion to strike filed by the cross-defendants Khaksoy and Hakakian, and the defendant Orbic Air. The court has overruled the demurrers to the first, second, and twenty-second causes of action, and denied the motion to strike the first amended cross-complaint.

The court has found that the allegations in the cross-complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against Khaksoy and Hakakian. The court has also found that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract against Orbic Air.

The court has denied the request for punitive damages, finding that the allegations do not support a claim for punitive damages under the theory of fraud or malice. However, the court has found that the allegations do support a claim for punitive damages under the theory of tort, and has denied the motion to strike the request for punitive damages.

The court has also denied the request for attorney's fees, finding that the allegations do not support a claim for attorney's fees under the theory of indemnity.

The parties are ordered to respond to this tentative ruling within 20 days.
