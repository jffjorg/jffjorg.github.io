And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Nedjathaiem, alleges that the defendants, HOA Premier Management, Durant Towers Owner's Association, and HOA board members Hyles and Field, engaged in oppressive, fraudulent, and intentional conduct in their handling of a water leak in his unit. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to provide a plan of action or timeline for repair, caused unnecessary delays in the repair process, and threatened to prevent him from selling the property. The judge finds that the plaintiff has pled specific facts that support a claim for punitive damages, including evidence of conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights and malice. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.
