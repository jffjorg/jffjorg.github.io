 Case No.: 22STCV13457
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  July 12, 2024



 
CBD Franchising’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
On 4/21/2022,
Plaintiff CBD Franchising, Inc. (Plaintiff or CBD) filed suit against Central
Jersey Doors & Closets, LLC, Mary Conway, William Conway, One Day Doors and
Closets, Inc., and One Day Enterprises, alleging: (1) breach of written
contract; (2)  breach of the implied duty
of good faith and fair dealing; (3) tortious interference with contractual
relations; and (4) unlawful business practices.
 
On 5/21/2024,
the Court granted One Day Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. 
 
            Now,
CBD Franchising moves for reconsideration of that ruling. 
 
Discussion 
 
            CBD
Franchising argues that the Court should reconsider its MSJ ruling because it
was denied the opportunity to respond to the non-compete provision arguments
and because there was a good will transfer here within the meaning of Business
and Professions Code section 16601. 
 
            After
review, the Court denies the motion for several reasons: 
 
            First,
the Court disagrees that One Day Defendants only raised goodwill arguments in
reply, or that CBD Franchising was denied an opportunity to fully respond to
these arguments. One Day Defendants’ opening brief in support of their motion
for summary judgment argued that the 2013 Franchise Agreement “expressly and
repeatedly states that it does not transfer any goodwill.” Moreover, CBD was
provided a full opportunity to respond in oral argument, and the Court fully
considered those arguments in its ruling.
 
            Importantly,
as noted by One Day Defendants, “CBDF argued for the first time at the May 9,
2024, hearing on the One Day Defendants’ motion for summary judgment that the
2013 Franchise Agreement (1) transfers a license to use its goodwill and (2) is
part of a series of “integrated agreements” that includes both the 2016 Asset
Purchase Agreement and the 2016 Transfer Agreement.” (Opp., 4:10-12.) As such, CBD
Franchising itself advanced arguments for the first time at oral argument which
it request be considered now.   
 
            Taken
together, the Court fails to find that CBD Franchising’s motion is based upon
new or different facts, circumstances, or law,” as a motion for reconsideration
must be.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
 
            Second,
even setting aside the fact that reconsideration is not appropriate given the
lack of new or different facts or law, the Court reaches the same conclusion as
to the merits for several reasons: 
 
            First,
Section 16601 provides that a “person who sells the goodwill of a business.
. . may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business
within a specified geographic area.” (Bus & Prof. Code, § 16601, italics
added.) Here, there was no evidence submitted to show that the Conways, as
sellers, sold the goodwill of a business to CBDF as buyer. Rather, CBDF
argues that it licensed its goodwill to the Conways via the 2013 Franchise
Agreement; that the Conways assigned goodwill to DenMatt Industries via the
2016 Asset Purchase Agreement; and that the Conways, with CBDF’s consent,
assigned their license to use CBDF’s goodwill to DenMatt Industries via the
2016 Transfer Agreement. 
 
As such,
there is no evidence that the Conways ever sold their goodwill, or that they
did so with CBDF agreeing as a buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business
within a specified geographic area. Indeed, the 2013 Franchise Agreement
expressly states that it does not transfer the ownership of any goodwill,
whether associated with CBDF’s proprietary marks or otherwise, such that a
franchisee could never sell any goodwill following the termination or
expiration of the agreement: 
 
Following the
termination or expiration of this agreement, no monetary amount will be
attributable to any goodwill associated with your use of the Proprietary Marks
or operation of the franchised Business or Closets By Design Location, include
any local goodwill.
 
(MSJ C.E. Ex. 9, p. 130 — 2013
Franchise Agreement at p. 42, § 15.01.)
 
The Northern
District of California’s decision in Scott v. Snelling and Snelling,
Inc. (N.D. Cal. 1990) 732 F.Supp. 1034 supports this interpretation. In Scott,
the plaintiff-franchisor argued that section 16601 applied because “a franchise
agreement is akin to a sale of goodwill in a business.” (Id. at p.
1041.) The Northern District disagreed, and instead found that a “franchisor
simply does not sell its goodwill to the franchisee” but instead, consistent
with the terms of a license, only “agrees that the franchisee may benefit from
the goodwill for a specified period of time.” (Id.) Given that distinction,
the court rejected the plaintiff-franchisor’s argument that section 16601
applied, noting that “the position that a franchisor sells its goodwill by
entering into a franchise agreement while retaining its ownership of the
goodwill is patently untenable.” (Id. at p. 1041, fn. 9.) As applied
here, CBDF, as a franchiser, never sold any goodwill to the Conways, and thus
the Conways never owned any goodwill to sell. 
 
Third, the
Court maintains that the 2013 Franchise Agreement, 2016 Asset Purchase Agreement,
and 2016 Transfer Agreement are not integrated agreements that should be read
together. Civil Code section 1642 provides that “[s]everal contracts relating
to the same matters, between the same parties, and made as part of
substantially one transaction, are to be taken together.” (Civil Code, § 1642.)
But, here, the three referenced agreements do not relate to the same matters,
are not between the same parties, and were not made as part of substantially
one transaction. As noted by One Day Defendants:
 
-        
The three agreements were signed at
different times over a more than three-and-a-half-year period: the Conways
signed the 2013 Franchise Agreement in December 2012; signed the 2016 Asset
Purchase Agreement over three years later in March 2016; and signed the 2016
Transfer Agreement five more months later in August 2016.
 
-        
The three agreements relate to three
distinct transactions: the Conways sought a franchise relationship via the 2013
Franchise Agreement; sold and assigned assets to DenMatt Industries via the
2016 Asset Purchase Agreement; and transferred their post-termination rights,
duties, and obligations under the 2013 Franchise Agreement to DenMatt
Industries via the 2016 Transfer Agreement.
 
-        
The three agreements were not signed by
the same parties: neither CBDF nor DenMatt Industries signed the 2013 Franchise
Agreement, and CBDF did not sign the 2016 Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
-        
And the three agreements do not each
reference the other: the 2013 Franchise agreement does not reference the 2016
Asset Purchase Agreement or the 2016 Transfer Agreement; the 2016 Asset
Purchase Agreement does not reference the 2016 Transfer Agreement; and the 2016
Transfer Agreement—which CBDF calls “the most important document in the
transaction” and references as the agreement “that binds all three agreements
together” (Recons. Mot. 7, 17)—does not even reference the 2016 Asset Purchase
Agreement.
            
(Opp.,
7:6-16.)
 
Moreover,
even assuming the three referenced agreements were integrated agreements that
should be read together, that does not mean that they were merged into one
contract. (Mountain Air Enters., LLC v. Sundowner Towers, LLC (2017) 3
Cal.5th 744, 759, noting that while it is the rule that several contracts
relating to the same matters are to be construed together (citing Civ. Code,
sec. 1642), it does not follow that for all purposes they constitute one
contract.) And even if the contracts to be read as one, there is still nothing
which would show a sale of the goodwill of a business to CBDF, as required to
fall within the scope of the section 16601.
 
Based on the
foregoing, CBDF’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
