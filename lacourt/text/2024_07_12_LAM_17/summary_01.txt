Summary:

The court has denied CBD Franchising, Inc.'s motion for reconsideration of the previous ruling granting summary judgment to One Day Defendants. The court found that CBD Franchising's motion was based on the same facts and law as the original motion and did not present any new or different arguments. The court also found that the evidence did not support CBD Franchising's claims that the Conways sold goodwill to DenMatt Industries and that the company is now prohibited from operating a similar business in the same geographic area. The court further held that the 2013 Franchise Agreement, 2016 Asset Purchase Agreement, and 2016 Transfer Agreement are not integrated agreements that should be read together.
