The plaintiffs are seeking ex parte relief due to "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." However, the proposed Memorandum of Points and Authorities lacks a concise statement of law and discussion of statutes and cases. The court typically requests that a party seeking an earlier hearing date first make a reservation on the court reservation system, file and serve the motion, and then apply ex parte to advance the hearing date. The moving party is being notified.
