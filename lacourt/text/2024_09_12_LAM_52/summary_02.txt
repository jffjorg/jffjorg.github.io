And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion by Donnie Muldrow, the plaintiff, to use a settled statement for the record on appeal regarding oral proceedings on June 23 and July 17, 2023. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is defective because it does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 8.137(b)(1) and (b)(2). Specifically, the plaintiff did not serve and file a proposed statement within 30 days of the notice designating the record on appeal, as required by rule 8.137(c)(1). The judge also notes that the plaintiff's reason for not using a reporter's transcript is incorrect, as it was an unreported proceeding, which is not a reason for using a settled statement. The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
