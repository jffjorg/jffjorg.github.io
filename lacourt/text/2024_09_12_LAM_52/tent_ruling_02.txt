 Case Number:  BC720986    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Donnie Muldrow’s Motion to Use a Settled Statement 
            Plaintiff Donnie
Muldrow moves for an order permitting him to use a settled statement for the
record on appeal regarding proceedings on June 23 and July 17, 2023.  
Plaintiff’s
motion is defective.  California Rules of
Court, rule 8.137(b)(1)(A) provides that when “oral proceedings in the superior
court were not reported by a court reporter,” the “appellant may elect in his
or her notice designating the record on appeal” to use a settled statement
“without filing a motion.”  When doing
so, “the appellant must serve and filed a proposed statement in superior court
within 30 days after filing its notice under (b)(1).”  (Rule 8.137(c)(1).)  
            On June 12, 2024, Muldrow filed a
notice designating the record on appeal. 
The notice indicates plaintiff elected to proceed using a settled
statement for oral proceedings that were not reported by a court reporter.  (Notice, § 2.b(3)(a).)  The notice lists five proceedings, including
those on June 23 and July 17, 2023.  (Id.,
§ 6 & attachment 6.)  But plaintiff
did not serve and file a proposed statement within 30 days of the notice as
required under rule 8.137(c)(1).
As
an alternative to electing to use a settlement statement without filing a
motion (rule 8.137(b)(1)), the “appellant intending to” use a settlement
statement “for reasons other than those listed in (1) must serve and file in
superior court with its notice designating the record on appeal … a motion to
use a settled statement instead of a reporter’s transcript.”  (Rule 8.137(b)(2).)  Plaintiff’s motion does not comply with this
rule for two reasons.  
First,
plaintiff does not intend to use a settlement statement “for reasons other than
those listed in” rule 8.137(b)(1).  His
motion indicates his reason is “[t]he oral proceedings requested … cannot be
transcribed because” the proceedings were “unreported.”  (Motion, § 5.b.)  That is not a reason the “oral proceedings cannot
be transcribed.”  (Rule
8.137(b)(2)(A)(ii).)  That merely means
the proceedings “were not reported by a court reporter.”  (Rule 8.137(b)(1)(A).)  Plaintiff thus was required to (and attempted
to) proceed via a notice of election to use a settled statement without filing
a motion.  (Rule 8.137(b)(1).)  
Second,
plaintiff did not file this motion “with [his] notice designating the record on
appeal.”  (Rule 8.137(b)(2).)  He filed the notice on June 12, then filed
this motion on July 31.  
Plaintiff
Donnie Muldrow’s motion to use a settled statement is denied.
