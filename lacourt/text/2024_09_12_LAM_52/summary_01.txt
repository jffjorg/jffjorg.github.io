And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Matthew L. Brinton's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiffs Brenda J. Core and Jamar Brown-Core. The judge found that Brinton has not shown sufficient grounds to withdraw as counsel, and that he has not taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the clients. The judge also noted that permitting Brinton to withdraw so close to the trial date could prejudice the clients or unduly delay the trial. Further, the judge pointed out that Brenda J. Core lives in Texas, which may make it difficult for her to find another attorney to represent her in California. Therefore, the judge denied Brinton's motion to withdraw as counsel.
