ANALYSIS:
 
Defendant 1683-85 Longwood Avenue,
LLC (“Defendant”) propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on
Plaintiff Dadson Washer Service, Inc. (“Defendant”) on March 3, 2023. (Motion, Uzoh
Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plaintiff’s failure to respond, Defendant sought to
meet and confer. (Id. ¶¶3-6 and Exhs. B-C.) When there was no response
from Plaintiff after the extended deadlines, Defendant filed the instant Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Request
for Sanctions on August 31, 2023. (Id. at ¶7.) To date, no opposition
has been filed. 

 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to respond
to the propounded discovery, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
service of verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive.
Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded in the amount of $350.00
based on one hour of attorney time billed at $350.00 per hour. (Motion, Uzoh Decl., ¶9.)  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant 1683-85 Longwood Avenue,
LLC’s Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF DADSON WASHER SERVICE, INC. IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE REQUESTS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF
THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS FURTHER ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $350.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE
OF THIS ORDER.
