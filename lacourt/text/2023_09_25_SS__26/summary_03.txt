## English Summary

The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case from a limited civil case to an unlimited civil case. This decision is based on the fact that the total amount of settlements in the case, including the property insurance claim and the uninsured motorist policy, now exceeds $25,000. 

The case was originally filed as a limited civil case because the initial property insurance claim settlement was under $25,000. However, a subsequent settlement in the uninsured motorist policy brought the total amount in controversy above the $25,000 threshold.

As a result of the reclassification, the case will be transferred to a different court for further proceedings. The Plaintiff is required to pay a reclassification fee within 10 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case as an unlimited civil case. The case was initially classified as a limited civil case, but the plaintiff has shown that the damages may exceed $25,000. The plaintiff has presented evidence of settlements totaling $86,414.01, which demonstrates that the case is incorrectly classified. The judge has ordered the case to be transferred to an independent calendar court and has required the plaintiff to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days. The defendants did not respond to the action or opposition, and the judge has found that the plaintiff has met its burden to demonstrate that the case should be reclassified as an unlimited civil case. The judge's decision is based on the principles set forth in Walker v. Superior Court and Ytuarte v. Superior Court, which require the court to reject the plaintiff's effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an "unlimited" case is certain and clear.
