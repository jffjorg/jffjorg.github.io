And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Reclassify the action as an unlimited civil case. The Plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, filed the action on March 2, 2022, seeking subrogation of insurance payments made to their insured. The action was initially classified as a limited civil case, but the Plaintiff argued that the case should be reclassified as an unlimited civil case due to the settlements exceeding $25,000. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has shown that the action is now incorrectly classified based on the new amount in controversy and should be reassigned to an unlimited jurisdiction court. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days of the order.
