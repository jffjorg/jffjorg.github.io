ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for
automobile subrogation against Defendant Oluwajuwon Ajayi (“Defendant”) on October 20, 2021. Defendant
filed an Answer on June 17, 2022.  
 
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions on November 3, 2022.
On December 12, 2022, the Court granted the Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions against Defendant. (Minute Order,
12/12/22.)
 
On June 6, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, based on the
admissions. (Minute Order, 06/06/23.) Judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor
on June 14, 2023. (Judgment, 06/14/23.) Notice of Entry of Judgment was served
on Defendant on July 18, 2023. Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment on August 30, 2023. No opposition
has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant brings this
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under
this statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months
after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by
an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney
fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary
dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary
relief based on party fault, the request must have been filed within a
reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed within six months of entry of
judgment, and within a reasonable time of Defendant receiving notice of entry
of judgment. The Motion is also supported by an affidavit of fault from defense
counsel explaining that from October 2022 to April 2023, their law firm was in
disarray because half of the attorneys (seven of 14) resigned, severely
impacting the firm’s ability to handle its cases. (Motion, Hellesen Decl., ¶3.)
As a result, defense counsel contends they were unable to serve Defendant’s
responses and verifications to the discovery responses until June 1, 2023. (Ibid.)
Furthermore, Defendant has now filed a Motion for Relief from Admissions, which
is set to be heard on September 27, 2023. 
 
The Court finds it appropriate to exercise its discretion
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) to vacate the June
5, 2023order and June 14, 2023 entry of judgment, and allow Defendant to move
for relief from the admissions. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Oluwajuwon Ajayi’s Motion to Vacate Judgment is GRANTED. THE JUNE
5, 2023 ORDER AND JUNE 14, 2023 ENTRY OF JUDGMENT ARE VACATED.
 
 
Moving party to give
notice.
