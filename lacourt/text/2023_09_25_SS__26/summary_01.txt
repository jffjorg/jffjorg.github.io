And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment against the defendant. The settlement agreement was signed by both parties and their attorneys, and it was filed with the court before the action was dismissed. The agreement provided for the defendant to pay the plaintiff $5,100.00, with an initial payment of $4,100.00 followed by monthly payments. The defendant defaulted on the settlement, and the plaintiff is now entitled to enter judgment in the amount of $3,318.36 principal (the difference between the total settlement amount and the payments made) and $72.00 in costs.
