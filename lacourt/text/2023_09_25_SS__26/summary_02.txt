## English Text Summary

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion to Vacate Judgment. 

This means the June 5, 2023 order granting judgment to the Plaintiff, State Farm, and the June 14, 2023 entry of judgment are both vacated.

The Judge based this decision on several factors:

* **Timeliness:** The Defendant filed the motion within six months of the judgment, and a reasonable time after receiving notice.
* **Affidavit of Fault:** The Defendant's attorney provided an affidavit explaining that their law firm experienced significant staffing issues from October 2022 to April 2023, which impacted their ability to timely respond to discovery requests and ultimately led to the default judgment.
* **Pending Motion:** The Defendant has also filed a Motion for Relief from Admissions, which is scheduled for a hearing on September 27, 2023.

The Judge found that the Defendant's explanation for the default judgment was credible and exercised their discretion to vacate the judgment, allowing the Defendant to pursue relief from the admissions.
