Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Oluwajuwon Ajayi's Motion to Vacate Judgment. The Motion was filed on August 30, 2023, and the Judge found that it was timely and supported by an affidavit of fault from defense counsel. The affidavit explained that the law firm was in disarray due to the departure of several attorneys, which impacted their ability to serve Defendant's responses and verifications to discovery responses until June 1, 2023. The Judge also noted that Defendant has filed a Motion for Relief from Admissions, which is set to be heard on September 27, 2023. Therefore, the Judge has decided to exercise its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) to vacate the June 5, 2023 order and June 14, 2023 entry of judgment, and allow Defendant to move for relief from the admissions.
