And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules that the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Ernst Miller, an employee of the defendant, is granted. The defendant had objected to the deposition notice, citing scheduling conflicts and concerns about the relevance of the testimony. However, the court finds that the defendant did not provide alternative dates for the deposition and did not demonstrate that the testimony from Miller would be redundant with other testimony. Therefore, the court orders the defendant to produce Miller for deposition and to produce the documents requested in the deposition notice. Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,285, which is calculated based on the reasonable expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's non-compliance with the discovery process.
