 Case Number:  21STCV06600    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant’s Employee Ernst Miller
Tentative
The
motion is granted.
Background
Plaintiff Mariam
Arutyunyan (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she was seriously injured when an
electric mixer or blender malfunctioned while being used in a reasonably
foreseeable manner. Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action on February
18, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence and products liability
against Defendants Conair Corporation, Waring Commercial, and Does 1 through
20.
On August 31, 2021,
Norguard Insurance Company (“Norguard”) filed a complaint in intervention
against Conair Corporation, Waring Commercial, and Does 1 through 20, alleging
that the accident occurred during the course of Plaintiff’s employment and that
Norguard made workers compensation payments to Plaintiff as a result of the
accident.
Conair Corporation filed
an answer to the complaint on November 4, 2021, and to the complaint in
intervention on December 30, 2022.
On January 20, 2022,
Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Conair LLC as Doe 1 and Conair LLC of
CA as Doe 2.
On March 9, 2022, Conair
LLC (“Defendant”) filed an answer to the complaint.
Plaintiff filed requests
to dismiss Conair Corporation, Conair LLC of CA, and Waring Commercial on
December 29, 2023.
As is relevant to this
motion, on February 12, 2024, Plaintiff served a notice that she would take the
deposition of Defendant’s employee Ernst Miller on March 4; the notice also
included one request for production. (Geragos Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4 & Exh. 2.) On
February 29, 2024, Defendant timely served an objection to the deposition
notice. (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. 3.) 
The parties have exchanged correspondence regarding rescheduling the
deposition, but no agreement has been reached. 
(Id., ¶¶ 8-13 & Exhs. 4-8.)
On March 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel. Plaintiff also seeks
sanctions.  Defendant filed an opposition on April 16.  Plaintiff
filed a reply on April 22.
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery … by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to
the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for
(among other things) what must be included in a deposition notice, when and
where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice must be
served. 
“The service of a deposition notice …
is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id., §
2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a),
requires any party to serve a written objection at least three calendar days
before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does not
comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.  If
the objection is made three calendar days before the deposition date, personal
service of the objection is required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subd. (b).)
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition
notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).)  
When a motion to compel is granted,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery
process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff noticed the deposition of
Defendant’s employee Ernst Miller for February 26, 2024.  (Geragos
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4 & Exh. 2.) Defendant objected, stating (1) that the witness and
counsel were not available on the date selected and (2) that the document
request sought materials protected by the attorney-client privilege and work
product doctrine.  (Id., ¶ 6 &
Exh. 3.)  Defendant has also asserted
concerns that the testimony sought from Mr. Miller  might overlap with some
of the testimony sought from Defendant’s PMQ(s).
Defendant’s objections are
overruled.  Defendant has not offered
alternative dates for the deposition of Mr. Miller, which is expected when a
party objects to a deposition date based on scheduling.  Plaintiff need not choose between PMQ
depositions and the depositions of an identified employee, and providing a PMQ
deposition does not excuse the obligation of Defendant to produce its employees
for deposition.  The issues are not, as
Defendant contends, intertwined.  Finally, in its opposition, Defendant makes no
effort to defend its objections to the document request.
Accordingly, the motion to compel is
granted.  
The
Court also grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  The Court does not find that
Conair acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust or that it would be unjust.
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,285, calculated based on 3.5 hours of
attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billable rate of $350 per hour for
the work necessary on this motion, plus the $60 filing fee.  (See Geragos
Decl., ¶¶ 17-19.)
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel.
The
Court ORDERS Conair to produce Ernst Miller for deposition on a date and time
to be arranged by counsel that is within 21 days of notice of this order.
The
Court ORDERS Conair to produce, at or before the time of the deposition, the
documents in the category set forth in the deposition notice served on February
12, 2024.
The
Court ORDERS Conair and its counsel Klinedinst PC, jointly and severally, to
pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount
of $1,285, within 30 days of notice.
The
Court ORDERS moving party to give notice.
