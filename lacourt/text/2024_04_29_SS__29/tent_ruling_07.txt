The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
By minute order dated
February 27, 2024, the Court identified certain issues that needed to be
addressed.  Petitioner submitted
additional materials on April 9 and 10 that addressed these issues, with two exceptions.
 
First, in the proposed
Order, Item No. 1 is blank.  The Court requests
the Judicial Assistant to fill in this information.
 
Second, in the proposed
Order, Item No. 8a(3)(a)(i)-(ii) is incorrect. 
This space relates to reimbursements of medical expenses (not payments
to Petitioner).  The Court requests the
Judicial Assistant to strike the information on page 2 of the proposed Order,
in item 8a(3)(a) (listing Petitioner as payee, an address in Virginia, and the
amount of $11,250).
 
With these changes, the
Court APPROVES the Petition.  The terms
of the settlement and the payment of fees is fair and reasonable.  All substantive and procedural requirements
are satisfied.
 
The Court SETS an OSC re
proof of deposit of funds into blocked account.
