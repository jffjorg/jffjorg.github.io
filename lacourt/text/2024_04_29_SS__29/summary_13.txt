And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Defendant AAA's motions for deemed-admitted orders. The motions were filed in response to Plaintiffs' failure to serve timely responses to Requests for Admission (Set One). Although Plaintiffs did eventually serve responses, the court finds that the responses are in substantial compliance with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. The court has granted AAA's requests for sanctions in the amount of $510, to be paid by each Plaintiff and their counsel, jointly and severally, within 30 days of notice.
