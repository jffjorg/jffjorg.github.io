 Case Number:  22STCV16408    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Stephen Ingram Marsh
 
Tentative
The Court CONTINUES the hearing
on Defendant’s motion for summary judgment to May 22, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 

The Court ORDERS that by no
later than May 8, 2024, Plaintiff must file and serve a Separate Statement in
Opposition to Motion that complies, in full, with Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c(b)(3) and California Rule of Court 3.1350(f)(2), (f)(3), &
(h).  Plaintiff’s separate statement must
(among other things) “unequivocally state whether [each] fact is ‘disputed’ or
‘undisputed.”  [Cal. R. Ct.
3.1350(f)(2).]  “Citation to the evidence
in support of the position that a fact is controverted must include reference
to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.” 
[Ibid.]  Absent such a statement, the
Court can only guess at Plaintiff’s position.
Plaintiff is ADMONISHED that “failure
to comply with this requirement of a separate statement [in opposition to a
motion for summary judgment] may constitute a sufficient ground, in the court’s
discretion, for granting the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(3).) 
The Court further ORDERS that by no later
than May 17, 2024. Defendant may, at his option, file and serve a further reply
to respond to any new contentions appearing in Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement.  This is an optional filing
for Defendant and is not required.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
