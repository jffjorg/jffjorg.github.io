The tentative ruling by the Judge continues the hearing on the Defendant's motion for summary judgment to May 22, 2024. The Judge also orders the Plaintiff to file and serve a separate statement in opposition to the motion by May 8, 2024, which must comply with specific rules. The separate statement must clearly state whether each fact is disputed or undisputed, and provide citations to the evidence supporting the position that a fact is controverted. The Judge warns that failure to comply with this requirement may result in the motion being granted. The Defendant is also given the option to file a further reply to respond to any new contentions in the Plaintiff's separate statement by May 17, 2024.
