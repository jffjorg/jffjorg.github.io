Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1032 provides that, in general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); see Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599,
606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103,
1108.)  Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial
court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs of
suit.  (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.)   
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (a) enumerates items that are allowable as costs under
section 1032.  These costs must be
“reasonable in amount” and  “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2) & (c)(3).)  Subdivision (b)of section 1033.5 identifies
certain items that are generally not allowable as costs.  Subdivision (c) states that other items may
be allowed or denied as costs in the discretion of the court.  (Id., subd. (c)(4).)
 
If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-774.)  But once there is a proper objection, the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court.  (Ibid.)   
“A prevailing party
who is represented by the same counsel as a nonprevailing party may only
recover those costs the prevailing party incurred and were reasonably necessary
to the prevailing party's conduct of the litigation, not the other jointly
represented parties' conduct of the litigation.” (Charton v. Harkey
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 730, 744.) Where litigation has terminated as to all
parties, the trial court has discretion to award a prevailing party full,
partial, or no reimbursement for any costs shared with non-prevailing parties. (Id.)
However, where litigation against some parties continues, the court must
apportion the shared costs. (Fennessey v. Deleuw-Cather Corp. (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 1192, 1196.) This avoids two potential scenarios: (a) double
recovery, with multiple parties recovering for the same item, or (b) the first
party to prevail recovering fully while the remaining parties recover little,
raising the potential for subsequent litigation between them. (Id.)
Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs move to strike all
costs, or in the alternative, tax costs requested by Honda.
 
Summary judgment has been entered
in favor of Honda.  Honda is plainly a
prevailing party.  
 
As Plaintiffs correctly point
out, Honda and Cuddy were represented by the same counsel in this action, and
throughout pre-trial proceedings Honda and Cuddy have joined together in motion
practice and discovery.  Plaintffs
contend that all costs should be stricken, or in the alternative that costs
should be apportioned and taxed accordingly. 
 
As a preliminary matter, the
Court notes that litigation as to Cuddy continues.  At this point, we do not know whether
Plaintiffs will prevail against Cuddy or Cuddy will prevail against Plaintiffs.  Cuddy is not today a prevailing party
entitled to recover costs, and at some point in the future she may – or may not
– be a prevailing party.  Because
litigation continues as between Plaintiffs and Cuddy, the Court must, and will,
apportion costs.  (Charton v. Harkey
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 730, 743-744 [“When a prevailing party has incurred
costs jointly with one or more other parties who are not prevailing parties for
purposes of an award of costs, the judge must apportion the costs between the
parties ….“]; Fennessy v. Deleuw-Cather Corp. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d
1192, 1196 [“where a prevailing party incurs costs jointly with one or more
parties who remain in the litigation, during the pendency of the litigation
that party may recover only costs actually incurred by a party or in its behalf
in prosecuting or defending the case”].)  
 
The mere fact that Honda and
Cuddy were joint represented, however, does not mean that Honda has sacrificed its
statutory right, as a prevailing party, to recover its apportioned costs.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to strike the
entirety of Honda’s memorandum of costs is denied.  
 
The Court now turns to each item
of costs challenged by this motion.
 
Item 1 –
Filing and Motion Fees
 
In its Memorandum of Costs, Honda
identifies $1,361.25 in filing and motion fees. 
Plaintiffs move to tax $328.80 of that amount.  Honda does not contest this part of
Plaintiffs’ motion.
 
Accordingly, as to item 1 of the
Memorandum of Costs, the motion to tax $328.80 is granted.
 
Item 4-
Deposition Costs
 
In its Memorandum of Costs, Honda
identifies $32,226.53 in deposition costs. 
Plaintiffs move to tax $24,855.38, arguing that these amounts were not
“reasonably necessary” for Honda’s defense and are not “reasonable in amount.”
 
The items identified in
Plaintiffs’ motion have been properly objected to; this shifts the burden of
proof to Honda as the party claiming these items as costs.  (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) 
Honda concedes that these costs “were jointly incurred with Laura Cuddy”
and “requests that the Court exercise its discretion an award some or all of
[these] deposition costs.” (Opp. at p. 4:9-14.)
 
The Court finds that it was
reasonably necessary for Honda to conduct discovery, including taking
depositions, on Plaintiffs’ claimed damages and other issues beyond vicarious
liability.  Having said that, however, on
the issues that were of joint concern to both Honda and Cuddy (including, but
not limited to, Plaintiffs’ damages), some apportionment is required, and Honda
has provided no basis for the Court to conduct such apportionment.  Although this is ultimately a question
entrusted to the discretion of the Court, the Court must exercise that
discretion based on the facts in the record – and here there are no facts
provided that would inform the Court’s exercise of discretion.  Should the Court find that 10 percent of the
joint work should be apportioned to Honda? 
50 percent?  90 percent?  On what basis?  The record is silent.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Honda has
not satisfied its burden of proof on this issue.  
 
Based upon that finding, as to
item 4 of the Memorandum of Costs, the motion to tax $24,855.38 is granted.
 
Item 5-
Service of Process
 
In its Memorandum of Costs, Honda
identifies $2,605.36 in costs for service of process.  deposition costs.  Plaintiffs move to tax $2,090.26, arguing
that these amounts were not “reasonably necessary” for Honda’s defense and are
not “reasonable in amount.”
 
For the same reason as set forth
above in relation item 4, the motion to tax costs as to item 5 is granted.  Honda has not met its burden of proof.
 
Item 8-
Expert Witness Fees
 
In its Memorandum of Costs, Honda
identifies $73,772.26 in costs for expert witness fees.  Plaintiffs move to tax this entire amount.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(1), expert witness fees are not allowable as
costs, except when the expert is “ordered by the court” or where such fees are
“expressly authorized by law.”  Here,
Honda argues that the fees are authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section
998.  Under section 998, subdivision(c)(1):
 
If an offer made by a defendant
is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or
award … the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the plaintiff
to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert
witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and
reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or arbitration,
or during trial or arbitration, of the case by the defendant.   
 
Honda has not shown that there is
any basis at this time to recover expert fees under Code of Civil Procedure
section 998.  Honda and Cuddy made a
joint settlement offer under section 998 in the amount of $150,000.  (Julian Decl., Exh. I.)  Although Honda has obtained summary judgment,
Plaintiffs’ claims against Cuddy have not yet been resolved, and there is no
way to know at this point what the result will be.  If, for example, Plaintiffs recover $150,001 (or
more) from Cuddy, then there will be no basis for an award of expert witness
fees under subdivision (c)(1), as Plaintiffs will have in fact obtained a more
favorable judgment against Defendants (collectively) than they would have
received if they had accepted the offer under section 998.
 
Accordingly, as to item 8 of the
Memorandum of Costs, the motion to tax the entire amount is granted.
 
Item 16- Misc.
Costs
 
In item 16 of its Memorandum of
Costs, Honda identifies $4,569.70 in “other“ costs.  Plaintiffs move to tax this entire amount.
 
The motion to tax the court
reporter fees for the summary judgment hearing is granted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(5).)
 
The motion to tax the mediation
fees is granted.  In general, where mediation
is not ordered by the court and the parties agree to share the fees, no party
may later recover their share of the mediation fee as a cost. (Anthony v.
Xiaobin Li (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 816, 824-825.) In addition, these fees were incurred jointly by
both Honda and Cuddy, and Honda has provided no evidence to determine what share
is attributable to Honda, as opposed to the joint defense effort.  
 
The motion to tax the other cost items
is granted.  Honda has lumped together filing
and service fees.  Filing fees are
recoverable, but they must be properly listed in item 1 and properly
documented.  Service fees might well be
recoverable, but Plaintiffs have properly objected, and that shifts the burden
to Honda to show why the fees were necessary (including, for example, why
service could not be effected through electronic means), which Honda has not
done.   
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS in part and
DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs. 

 
The Court GRANTS the motion to
tax as to $328.80 in costs in item 1; $24,855.38 in costs in item 4; $2,090.26
in costs in item 5; the entire amount in item 8; and the entire amount in item
16.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
