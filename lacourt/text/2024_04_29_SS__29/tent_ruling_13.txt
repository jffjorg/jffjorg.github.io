 Case Number:  23STCV23139    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s motion for an
order deeming the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set
One) admitted by Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi
Defendant’s motion for an order deeming the truth of the matters specified in
Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted by Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi
Tentative
The motions are denied.
The requests for sanctions
are granted in part.
Background
This case arises out of an
accident that occurred on November 10, 2021.  According to the
Complaint, Plaintiffs Amnon Mizrahi and Susan Mizrahi (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) were injured when they were struck by their improperly secured
vehicle after it rolled off a flat bed tow truck.  (Complaint, ¶¶
10-23.)
On September 25, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this action against Carmel Towing &
Transport, Inc.; Bert’s Garage, Inc.; Automobile Club of Southern California
(“AAA”), and Does 1 through 25.  Plaintiffs assert causes of actions
for premises liability; negligence; vicarious liability; and loss of
consortium.  
AAA filed its Answer to
the Complaint on October 17, 2023.  Bert’s
Garage, Inc. filed its Answer to the Complaint on April 4, 2024.
Set for hearing on April
29, 2024 are two discovery motions.
On November 30, 2023, AAA
served discovery, including Requests for Admission (Set One) to Plaintiff Amnon
Mizrahi and Requests for Admission (Set One) to Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi.
(Harwood Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.) Neither Plaintiff served a timely response
to these Requests for Admission.  Plaintiff
did not respond to this discovery request. (Id., ¶ 5.)
On March 4, 2024, AAA
filed these two motions for orders deeming admitted as true the matters
specified in the Requests for Admission.  AAA also seeks sanctions.  The motion as to Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi was
initially set for hearing on April 25; after a tentative ruling was posted, both
sides asked to be heard, and the Court continued the hearing to April 29.  The motion as to Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi was
initially set for hearing on April 29.
Neither Plaintiff has filed
any opposition.
On the evening of April
24, Plaintiffs filed a “notice” attaching verified responses, without
objection, from each Plaintiff to the Requests for Admission. 
Legal
Standard
A party must respond to
requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required.
(See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely
response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).)
The court “shall” make the
order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted
unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the
court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted
the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party
or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
“The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
Defendant AAA served
Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi and Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi with Requests for Admission
(Set One) on November 30, 2023. (Harwood Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.) Plaintiffs
did not serve timely responses. (Id., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiffs did, however, serve responses to
the Requests for Admission prior to the hearing on these two motions.
The Court has reviewed
Plaintiffs’ responses and finds them to be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  Accordingly, the motions for deemed-admitted
orders are denied.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
AAA’s requests for
sanctions are granted under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c), as the failure to serve timely responses to the Requests for
Admission necessitated these motions.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of this motion, the Court sets sanctions on each motion in
the amount of $510, based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by
counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225 per hour, plus a $60 filing
fee.  (Harwood Decls., ¶ 2.)
Conclusion
The Court DENIES AAA’s
motions for deemed-admitted orders.
The Court GRANTS in part
AAA’s request for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
Amnon Mizrahi and counsel of record George K. Jawlakian, jointly and severally,
to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $510
to Defendant AAA within 30 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
Susan Mizrahi and counsel of record George K. Jawlakian, jointly and severally,
to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $510
to Defendant AAA within 30 days of notice.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
