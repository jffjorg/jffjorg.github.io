And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication. The defendants had argued that there was no dangerous condition present at the restaurant, and that they had no actual or constructive knowledge of any dangerous condition. The judge found that the defendants had not made a sufficient showing to obtain summary judgment on these issues. The judge also found that there were issues of fact regarding whether the allegedly dangerous condition caused the plaintiff's injuries and whether the condition was open and obvious. The judge concluded that the defendants had not shown that one or more elements of the plaintiff's causes of action could not be established, and therefore the motion was denied.
