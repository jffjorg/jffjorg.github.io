And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial without prejudice. The defendants, acting by and through the California Highway Patrol and Alfredo Gutierrez, had filed a motion to bifurcate the trial into two parts: liability and damages. The judge finds that the trial judge should make the discretionary determination on bifurcation, as it is related to the management of the trial proceedings. The judge orders that the defendants may submit a motion for bifurcation at the time that motions in limine are filed, and any opposition may be submitted when oppositions to motions in limine are filed.
