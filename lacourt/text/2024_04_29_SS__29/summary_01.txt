And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The judge grants the motion to tax $328.80 in filing and motion fees, $24,855.38 in deposition costs, $2,090.26 in service of process costs, and the entire amount in expert witness fees. The judge also grants the motion to tax the miscellaneous costs, including court reporter fees and mediation fees. The judge denies the motion to tax the filing and service fees, as Honda has not shown that these fees were necessary. The judge also denies the motion to tax the expert witness fees, as Honda has not shown that these fees were authorized by law. The judge finds that Honda is a prevailing party and has incurred joint costs with Cuddy, and therefore must apportion these costs. The judge exercises its discretion to award some costs to Honda, but notes that the record is silent on how to apportion the costs.
