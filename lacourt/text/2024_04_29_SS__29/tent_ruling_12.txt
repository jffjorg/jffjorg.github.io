On March 23, 2023, Rita Henderson
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against DD’s Discounts for a negligence
(premises liability) cause of action arising from a slip and fall occurring on
May 10, 2021. On May 16, 2023, Ross Dress For Less, Inc, sued and served as
DD’s Discounts (“Defendant”), filed its answer.
 
On March 22, 2024, Defendant filed
its motion for summary judgment.  The motion
is set for hearing on January 31, 2025.
 
On March 26 2024, Defendant filed

Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant has a right to have its timely filed motion for summary
judgment heard before trial.  The motion is
currently set for hearing on January 31, 2025. 
The trial date is September 19, 2024. 
Defendant asks for a trial continuance or, in the alternative, a special
setting of its summary judgment motion.
Plaintiff recognizes that Defendant’s motion must be heard before trial
but also notes that Plaintiff is in very poor health and asks that any
continuance of trial be modest in length. 
Plaintiff has not moved for a trial preference.
The Court has carefully considered all of the evidence and argument
submitted by the parties.  The Court
grants the alternative request for a special setting of Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment on August 21, 2024, at 1:30 pm.  The Court also grants a brief continuance of
the trial date to early October 2024. 
Good cause is shown for a continuance of the trial date.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion is GRANTED in part.
The Court advances
and SPECIALLY SETS the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (filed
on March 22, 2024) for August 21, 2024, at 1:30 pm.
The Court
continues the trial date to early October 2024. 
The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new
trial date.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
