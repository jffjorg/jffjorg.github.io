And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for leave to file an amended complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs, Philip Lawrence and Philmar Studios Inc. The motion was filed on January 9, 2024, and the proposed FAC was attached to the motion. The judge found that the motion was timely and that the proposed amendments were necessary and proper in the furtherance of justice. The judge also granted the motions to relieve counsel, Steven T. Lowe, who seeks to be relieved as counsel due to the clients' inability to meet their financial obligations.

The judge denied the defendants' arguments that the motion was untimely and that the proposed amendments would cause prejudice. The judge found that the defendants had known about the nature of the amendments since June 2023 and that there was no showing of prejudice.

The judge ordered the plaintiffs to serve the FAC within ten days and scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for Philmar Studios Inc. for May 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
