And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiff, Mehrnaz Hadian. The Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the Defendant's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Documents. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses waives any objections to the requests, including those based on privilege or attorney work product. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 30 days, without objection.

The Judge also denies the requests for sanctions, as the Plaintiff did not have notice of any dollar amount and the Defendant did not provide any information for the Court to determine a reasonable sanction. The parties are notified that they must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit to the tentative ruling.
