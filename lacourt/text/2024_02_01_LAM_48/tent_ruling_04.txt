[TENTATIVE] GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
  RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION; GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
  TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
 
Dept. 48

On July 20, 2023, Infinity Plumbing
Inc. and Marco Marquez filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against Green
Court Investors LP and KLS Financial LLC (“KLS”).
On
July 21, 2023, KLS moved to compel Marquez’s further responses to Request for Admissions,
Set One (Nos. 1-8, 11) and Form Interrogatories, Set One (No. 17.1).
A
party may move to compel a further response to interrogatories or requests for admission
if the demanding party deems an answer to be evasive or incomplete, if an exercise
of the option to produce documents is unwarranted or inadequate, or if objection
is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2033.290, subd. (a).)  The court shall impose a monetary sanction against
any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2033.290,
subd. (d).)
RFA
Nos. 1-3 ask Marquez to admit that he did not suffer any damages due to the alleged
defamation.  RFA Nos. 4-8 ask Marquez to admit
that he received negative reviews before the allegedly defamatory review.  RFA No. 11 asks Marquez to admit that the allegedly
defamatory review was publicly available for less than twelve hours.  Form Rog No. 17.1 asks Marquez to identify all
persons with knowledge of facts and all documents that support his responses for
any RFA response that is not an unqualified admission.
Marquez
argues that these requests are irrelevant because he does not need to show special
damages for defamation per se.  He also argues
that any prior negative reviews are irrelevant and hearsay.
“The
elements of a defamation claim are (1) a publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory,
(4) unprivileged, and (5) has a natural tendency to injure or cause special damage.”  (Wong v. Jing (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354,
1369.)  “In an action for damages for defamation
per se . . . the law presumes general damages.” 
(Finney v. Lockhart (1950) 35 Cal.2d 161, 163.)
Here,
there has been no determination that the alleged defamation is in fact per se, rather
than per quod.  Cross-Complainants do not
allege the exact statements.  (FACC ¶¶ 17-18.)  Whether Marquez suffered actual damages is relevant,
even if it is not necessary for him to prove any.  For the prior negative reviews by other individuals,
they could be relevant to Cross-Complainants’ existing reputation and whether the
statement at issue here caused any harm to reputation.
The
motion is GRANTED.
The
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Marquez’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $4,000 ($2,000 for each
motion) to KLS within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
