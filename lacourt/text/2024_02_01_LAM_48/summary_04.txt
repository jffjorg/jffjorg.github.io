And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions and form interrogatories filed by KLS Financial LLC against Marco Marquez. The motion was filed in response to Marquez's first amended cross-complaint against Green Court Investors LP and KLS Financial LLC. The court finds that Marquez's arguments that the requests are irrelevant are without merit, and that the prior negative reviews and allegedly defamatory review are relevant to the case. The court orders Marquez's counsel to pay sanctions of $4,000 to KLS Financial LLC within 30 days.
