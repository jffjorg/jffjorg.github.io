And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for an order that deposition testimony may be taken electronically instead of stenographically. The Plaintiff, Basilía Puerto, argued that electronic recording is more convenient, efficient, and less expensive than stenographic reporting, citing the shortage of stenographic reporters and the reliability of electronic recording. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate any specific problems with stenographic reporting in this case, and that a stenographic transcript will still be required in order to offer deposition testimony as evidence. The Judge also noted that the parties can record depositions electronically as a backup, but this does not justify eschewing the requirement of stenographic reporting.
