On
February 10, 2023, Plaintiff Mehrnaz Hadian filed this action against Defendant
Cedars Sinai Medical Group and others.
On
January 4, 2024, Defendant filed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Documents
(Set One).
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
did not serve responses to Defendant’s discovery and filed no opposition to this
motion.
Accordingly,
the motions to compel are GRANTED.
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Documents (Set One)
within 30 days.
The
requests for sanctions are denied.  Defendant
requested sanctions “in an amount determined to be appropriate by this Court.”  (Motions at p. 5.)  Plaintiff did not have notice of any dollar amount,
and Defendant did not provide any information from which the Court could determine
a reasonable sanction.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
