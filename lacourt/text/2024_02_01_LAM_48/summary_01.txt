And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Central Fitness Partners, Inc. et al.'s motion for summary judgment in a personal injury action brought by plaintiff Hyung Koo. The court finds that defendant did not owe a legal duty to plaintiff and did not cause plaintiff's injuries. The court also finds that the defect in the installation of gym equipment was a patent defect, rather than a latent one, and that defendant is shielded from liability under the completed and accepted doctrine. The court concludes that defendant has met its burden of showing that it did not install the gym equipment and that the defect was a patent one, and that plaintiff has failed to show the existence of a triable issue of fact on these issues.
