```

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendants' demurrers to the complaint without leave to amend as to the named defendants. The Court grants Defendants' request for judicial notice of the deed of trust, which shows that the property was transferred from Defendant Kim to the Ock Ja Kim Living Trust. The Court denies Defendants' motions to strike as moot, as their demurrers were sustained. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not alleged the proper party with whom the rental agreement was formed, and therefore sustains the demurrers to the first, second, third, ninth, and eleventh causes of action. The Court concludes that Plaintiff's claims are duplicative, and that leave to amend would be inappropriate as to the sixth, eighth, and tenth causes of action. The Court's ruling is without prejudice to assertion of the claims set forth in the first, second, third, ninth, and eleventh causes of action against the actual owner of the subject property, which is the Ock Ja Kim Living Trust.
