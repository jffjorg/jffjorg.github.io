Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber in the case of Sung Sik Lim v. Peter Eunsang Kim, case number 23STCV09430. The case involves a dispute between two co-owners of a restaurant, Concerto Restaurant, over a failed agreement and alleged breaches of contract, fraud, and fiduciary duty. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which means that those claims will be dismissed unless the plaintiff amends the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court. The judge has also denied the motion to strike as moot, since the demurrer has been sustained. The plaintiff has been granted leave to amend the complaint, and has 20 days from the date of the order to do so.
