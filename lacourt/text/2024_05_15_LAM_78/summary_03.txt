The court has granted Plaintiff Jose Hernandez's motion to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted as to Defendant Structural Concrete Group, Inc. (SCG). The court has also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,660 jointly and severally against SCG and its Counsel of Record. The sanctions are payable within 15 days after the date of this order. The court finds that SCG failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff's RFAs, necessitating the motion. The court's ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which requires the court to deem requests for admission admitted unless the responding party serves a proposed response that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
