Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Catamount Properties 2018, LLC. The motion to claim cash bond is denied without prejudice because an appeal is pending. The motion to expunge lis pendens is granted, as the court has entered judgment in favor of Catamount after granting its motion for summary judgment. The court must grant the motion to expunge lis pendens unless it finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment.
