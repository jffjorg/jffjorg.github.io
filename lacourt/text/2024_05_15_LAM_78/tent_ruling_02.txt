 Case Number:  21STCV33341    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  78 Department 78, Stanley Mosk CourthouseMay 15, 202421STCV33341Petition to Approve Compromise of Emily Pineda (Age 8)DECISIONA continued hearing date will be set.Counsel are ordered to appear remotely or in person to discuss a continued hearing date.DiscussionPetitioner’s MC-350 states no settlement funds will be used to pay medical expenses. However, Claimant did receive treatment for her injuries. Plaintiffs’ counsel testifies that Plaintiffs could not obtain any information from their medical provider or insurance agency regarding the cost of Claimant’s treatment. (Thomas Decl., ¶¶4-5.) Counsel could only find three statements for monthly payments to Medi-Cal. (Id.) Welfare & Institutions Code § 14124.71 provides that, if a Medi-Cal beneficiary is injured by a third party, DHCS may sue that party directly to recover the cost of treating the beneficiary.“If either the beneficiary or the director brings an action or claim against such third person or carrier the beneficiary or the director shall within 30 days of filing the action give to the other written notice by personal service or registered mail of the action or claim, and of the name of the court or state or local agency in which the action or claim is brought. Proof of such notice shall be filed in such action or claim. If an action or claim is brought by either the director or the beneficiary, the other may, at any time before trial on the facts, become a party to, or shall consolidate his action or claim with the other if brought independently.”(Welf. & Inst. Code, section 14124.73.)Here, because Claimant appears to be a Medi-Cal beneficiary and there is no evidence that Plaintiffs served the required Medi-Cal notice, the Court is concerned that Medi-Cal’s lien rights have not been satisfied.
