```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance their motion for an order deeming their requests for admission admitted. The application was deemed procedurally deficient because it lacked a declaration regarding notice, as required by CRC Rule 3.1204(b). Additionally, the court's congested calendar cannot accommodate the plaintiff's request to advance the motion. The plaintiff will need to seek a continuance of the trial date in Department SE-F if they wish to continue with the motion.
