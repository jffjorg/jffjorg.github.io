And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to reopen discovery without prejudice. The plaintiff had sought to take depositions of specific individuals, including the head coach, freshman head coach, and varsity defensive line coach, in order to propound discovery. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's failure to complete discovery previously does not warrant reopening discovery at this stage, particularly given the prejudice to the defendants and opposing party. The judge also noted that there is no evidence that the plaintiff has attempted to propound any of the discovery referenced in the application and that there are no motions to compel discovery scheduled to be heard. The parties may still seek a trial continuance if essential discovery is ongoing, and may request that the discovery cutoff date be tied to the new trial date if necessary.
