The application is denied without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can refile the application at a later date. The judge is also denying the defendant's request to advance the hearing on the motion and make a determination on the merits today. Instead, the opposing party will have the opportunity to respond. The judge is also scheduling a hearing on the defendant's motion to continue trial for January 10, 2025. If the motion to continue trial is granted, the defendant's ex parte requests will become moot.
