 Case Number:  23NWCP00337    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  C City of South Gate v. Delacruz 23NWCP00337This public nuisance action was filed on August 14, 2023. On December 13, 2024. The Receiver's Application for Issuance of Order Authorizing and Confirming Sale of Receivership Real Property Located at 10325 California Avenue, South Gate, CA 90280 was granted. The Opposing Party/Receiver's Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED. Respondent BENJAMIN DE LA CRUZ ("De La Cruz") now moves ex parte to stay enforcement of this Court's December 13, 2024 Order approving the sale of the real property located at 10325 California Ave., South Gate, CA 90280 pending appeal. A Notice of Appeal was FILED on December 13, 2024. Respondent BENJAMIN DE LA CRUZ's Ex Parte Application to Stay Enforcement of this Court's December 13, 2024 Order Approving the Sale of the Real Property Located at 10325 California Ave., South Gate CA 90280 Pending Appeal is DENIED without prejudice. Respondent Benjamin De La Cruz defaulted on October 20, 2023. Given that Respondent De La Cruz's is currently in default, the only motion he may property make is to set aside the default. As De La Cruz's default has been entered and not set aside, this Court lacks jurisdiction to address any action by the defaulted party other than a motion to vacate entry of default. (See, e.g. W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist. (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72.) “[T]he entry of the default terminates [the defaulting defendant’s] rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either the default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.” (City of Riverside v. Horspool (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 670, 681.)The Court further notes that no Declaration regarding notice is attached to or filed in conjunction with the Subject Ex Parte Application as required under CRC Rule 3.1204(b). Moreover, "[t]he perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order in the trial court if the judgment or order appealed from directs the sale, conveyance or delivery of possession of real property which is in the possession or control of the appellant or the party ordered to sell, convey, or delivery possession of the property, unless an undertaking in a sum fixed by the trial court is given that the appellant or party ordered to sell, convey or delivery possession of the property will not commit or suffer to be committed any waste thereon and that if the judgment or order appealed from is affirmed, or the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed, the appellant shall pay the damage suffered by the waste and the value of the use and occupancy of the property, or the part of it as to which the judgment or order is affirmed, from the time of the taking of the appeal until the delivery of the possession of the property. If the judgment or order directs the sale of mortgaged real property and the payment of any deficiency, the undertaking shall also provide for the payment of any deficiency." (emphasis added.) (CCP 917.4.) Consequently the December 13, Order, and any proceedings related thereto, including enforcement thereof, will only be stayed pending appeal upon the payment of a bond or undertaking in an amount determined by this Court by De La Cruz pursuant to CCP 917.4. Opposing Party to give notice.
