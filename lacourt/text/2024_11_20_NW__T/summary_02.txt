And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents from the defendant, American Honda Motor. The judge notes that the defendant improperly refused to respond to the plaintiff's requests, citing proprietary information without seeking a protective order. The judge orders the defendant to provide verified, code compliant responses with a privilege log within 20 days. The judge grants certain requests for production, including those related to the defendant's policies, procedures, and guidelines, as well as communications with a specific dealership. The judge denies other requests, finding them to be overbroad, vague, and ambiguous. The judge also notes that the defendant must seek affirmative relief by way of a protective order if it intends to withhold certain information.
