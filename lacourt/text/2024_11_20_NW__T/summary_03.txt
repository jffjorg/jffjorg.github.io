And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Cross-Defendant Nairmac, Inc. dba Premier Coach Auto Collision's Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint, and has also granted Cross-Defendant Mercury Insurance Company's Joinder to the Special Motion to Strike. The Cross-Complaint's third through tenth causes of action, alleging claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conversion, and violation of Business and Professions Code, section 17200 (UCL), are struck and deemed null. Cross-Defendant Nairmac, Inc. dba Premier Coach Auto Collision is dismissed with prejudice from the Cross-Complaint. The Court found that these claims are based on protected activity, specifically statements made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body, and that Barones failed to meet their burden of showing a probability of prevailing on these claims.
