The Judge's tentative ruling for the hearing on September 21, 2023, in Dept. 56 of the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District, concerns Case No. 21STCV00971 between Plaintiff Jason Delgado and Defendant Ford Motor Company.

The case arises from the lease of an allegedly defective vehicle manufactured by Defendant. On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant's further responses to Requests for Production (RFPs), specifically regarding documents concerning transmission defects in other cars manufactured by Defendant and files from an ongoing class action lawsuit.

Under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 2017.010, parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action. For discovery purposes, information is regarded as relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.

A motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on incomplete statements of compliance, inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply, or unmerited or overly generalized objections. A motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.

The Court grants the motion in part and orders Defendant to provide supplemental responses regarding:

1. Warranty policy and procedure manuals or similar policies or claim handling procedures that Defendant published from the date the Vehicle was purchased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
2. Written statements of policy and/or procedures Defendant used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase or replacement for lemon law claims from the date the Vehicle was purchased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
3. A list or compilation of customer complaints in Defendant’s electronically stored info database that are substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by Plaintiff.
4. TSBs and recall notices for vehicles purchased or leased in CA for the same year, make, and model of the Vehicle.
5. Copies of any repair instruction bulletin or diagnostic/repair procedure identified in any of the repair orders.

Defendant's supplemental responses are to be provided within 20 days of the date of this order.
