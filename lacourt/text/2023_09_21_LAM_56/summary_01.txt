And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Ford Motor Company, regarding alleged defects in vehicles. The plaintiff, Jason Delgado, seeks to compel the defendant to provide additional documents related to transmission defects in other cars and files produced in an ongoing class action lawsuit. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the production of certain documents, but also finds that the requests for production are overly broad. The court grants the motion in part and orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses that include specific documents, such as warranty policies, customer complaints, and recall notices. The defendant is ordered to provide these supplemental responses within 20 days of the date of this order.
