Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Motion to Dismiss filed by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Moving Defendant) and has tentatively granted the Motion. The Complaint, which was filed by Chyon Simmons, alleges various causes of action, including breach of partnership agreement, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentation. Moving Defendant filed a verified interpleader cross-complaint and the Court sustained its unopposed demurrer to certain causes of action. Despite being granted leave to amend, Plaintiff did not file an amended pleading.

Moving Defendant deposited the disputed amount alleged in its cross-complaint with the Court Clerk, which demonstrates that it is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount. The Court finds that the dismissal of the Complaint is appropriate under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 386.5 and 581. The dismissal is with prejudice and Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website. If the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
