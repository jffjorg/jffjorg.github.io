**Tentative Order Re: Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement**

**Date:** September 21, 2023

**Moving Party:** Defendant Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Moving Defendant)

---

The court has reviewed the moving papers for a motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Moving Defendant). Plaintiff William Martinez Ascencio did not file any opposition papers.

**Background:**

- Plaintiff's complaint alleges 11 causes of action arising from an employment relationship.
- On August 24, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for determination of good faith settlement.

**Discussion:**

- Under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 877, a release, dismissal, or covenant not to sue or enforce judgment given in good faith reduces claims against other defendants and discharges the party from all liability for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity.
- Factors for determining good faith settlement include:
  1. Rough approximation of plaintiffs' total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability
  2. The amount paid in settlement
  3. Allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs
  4. Recognition that a settlor should pay less than found liable after trial
  5. Financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants
  6. Absence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure nonsettling defendants
- The court evaluates good faith based on information available at the time of settlement.
- Defendant's settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of liability.
- In most cases, unopposed motions for good faith settlement determination are granted.
- If contested, the nonsettling party has the burden of proof.

**Court's Decision:**

- Plaintiff and Moving Defendant entered into a settlement agreement on July 19, 2023, with a $30,000 payment from Moving Defendant to Plaintiff.
- The court finds that the motion adequately demonstrates good faith settlement and grants the motion.

**Order:**

- Moving party must give notice of this ruling.
- If the department does not receive an email by the hearing time, the motion will be placed off calendar.

**Judge:** Holly J. Fujie
