And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by defendant Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc. ("Moving Defendant"). The motion seeks to have the court determine that the settlement agreement entered into between the parties on July 19, 2023, was made in good faith. The settlement agreement provides for a $30,000 payment by Moving Defendant to plaintiff William Martinez Ascencio in exchange for the dismissal of plaintiff's claims against Moving Defendant.

The court finds that the motion adequately demonstrates that the proposed settlement complies with the requirements set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488. Specifically, the court finds that the settlement is based on a rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, and that the amount paid in settlement is reasonable in light of the facts of the case.

Since the motion is unopposed, the court grants the motion and finds that the settlement was made in good faith. The court orders Moving Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
