AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Moving
Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
On
May 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging: (1) breach
of partnership agreement; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) misrepresentation;
(4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5) declaratory
relief; (6) unjust enrichment; (7) negligence; (8) breach of fiduciary duty;
(9) constructive trust; and (10) accounting. 
On January 10, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a verified interpleader
cross-complaint (the “XC”).  On April 7,
2023, the Court sustained Moving Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to the seventh
through tenth causes of action in the Complaint and granted Plaintiff 20 days
leave to amend.[1]  Plaintiff did not thereafter file an amended
pleading.  On June 12, 2023, Moving
Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint (the “Motion”).
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Moving Defendant’s Request for
Judicial Notice is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 386.5, Where the only relief sought against one of the defendants
is the payment of a stated amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld,
such defendant may, upon affidavit that he is a mere stakeholder with no
interest in the amount or any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have
been made upon him for the amount by parties to the action, upon notice to such
parties, apply to the court for an order discharging him from liability and
dismissing him from the action on his depositing with the clerk of the court
the amount in dispute and the court may, in its discretion, make such order.  (CCP § 386.5.)


Under CCP section 581, subdivision (f)(2), the
court may dismiss a complaint after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained
with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by
the court, and either party moves for dismissal.  (CCP § 581, subd. (f)(2).)  A dismissal under CCP section 581,
subdivision (f)(2) is with prejudice.  (See Parsons v. Umansky (1994)
28 Cal.App.4th 867, 870.)
 
Moving Defendant provides evidence that it
deposited with the Court Clerk the disputed amount alleged in its XC.  (Declaration of Arjun P. Rao (“Rao Decl.”) ¶¶
5-6, Exhibits 1-2.)   The Court finds
that Moving Defendant has demonstrated that dismissal is appropriate under CCP
sections 386.5 and 581.  For these
reasons and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion and orders
that the Complaint be dismissed with respect to Moving Defendant.  (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.

calendar.
