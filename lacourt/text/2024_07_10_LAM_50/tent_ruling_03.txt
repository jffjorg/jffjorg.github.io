Hearing Time:


10:00 a.m. 




ORDER RE: 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
  ARBITRATION AND/OR TO STAY ACTION PENDING ARBITRATION



            
The Lobster LLC (“The Lobster”) moves to
compel arbitration and to stay any further proceedings in this matter until any
arbitration award is final. The Lobster’s motion is
continued as set forth below. 
            The parties have interposed 33 evidentiary objections. Due to the voluminous number of objections, the hearing on the
motion will be continued to a date that will be set at the Hearing on
Objections discussed below. 
The
Court orders the parties to meet and confer by telephone or in person in a
serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the objections. The only
objections that should remain are those that pertain to material evidence regarding material issues. Keeping the rules of evidence in mind, the
parties should be able to reduce the objections to just a few. If any material objections remain
unresolved, the parties are to set them forth in a joint statement with the
text, the objection, and the argument of each side in favor of their respective
positions regarding the remaining material objections, along with a space for a
ruling.
The joint statement must be filed on or before _______ with a courtesy copy
delivered to Department 50. The Court will review any remaining
objections with the parties at a hearing on _______________ at 2:00 p.m. (the “Hearing on Objections”). The
date for the hearing on the motion will be set at the Hearing on Objections.
If
necessary, based upon the resolutions reached during the meet and confer
process and/or at the Hearing on Objections, the parties may respectively file
and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence may eliminate
objectionable material; however, no
new evidence or new argument is to be submitted unless it is as a result of
compromises reached during the meet and confer process. In the event
that revised briefing and evidence is necessary, the Court will discuss with
the parties a briefing schedule for the revised briefing at the Hearing on
Objections.  
The Lobster is ordered to give notice of this
Order.
