And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action of the plaintiff's amended complaint. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by allowing a third-party spyware company to eavesdrop on the plaintiff's private conversations. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to allege the defendant's knowledge and intent for aiding and abetting liability. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations did not demonstrate that the defendant intended to aid in Genesys' purported wrongful conduct, and therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court also ordered the defendant to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days.
