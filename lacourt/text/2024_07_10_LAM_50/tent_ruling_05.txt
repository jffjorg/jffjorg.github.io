noted by Defendant, paragraph 13 of the FAC alleges
that “Genesys advertises to its clients, such as Defendant, specifically that
it shares information about its clients’ customers with third parties…” (FAC, ¶

material included in paragraph 13 does not appear to state that Genesys shares
information about its clients’ customers with third parties. (FAC, ¶ 13.)
Rather, the marketing material states, inter alia, “[a]dd context to
customer experiences by connecting with existing back-end or third-party
systems to deliver intelligently optimized service.” (FAC, ¶ 13.)
