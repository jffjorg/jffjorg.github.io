[1]Alejandro Herrera
states that Herrera Law Partners is his business. (Alejandro Herrera Decl., ¶
1.) 


[2]It appears that
the reference to “January 27, 2022” is a typo. (Alejandro Herrera Decl.,
¶ 2.) In the motion, Defendants state that “[t]he HERRERA Defendants were not
aware that defaults had been entered until around January 27, 2023.”
(Mot. at p. 15:14-15, emphasis added, citing Herrera Decl., ¶ 2.) In addition,
Alejandro Herrera states that “[o]n about January 27, 2023, [he] reached out to
Plaintiff’s counsel…” (Alejandro Herrera Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 


[3]In light of the
foregoing, the Court need not and does not address Defendants’ remaining
arguments in the motion.
