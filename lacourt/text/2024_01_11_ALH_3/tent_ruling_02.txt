  ORDER RE: SPECIALLY APPEARING DEFENDANT ZHENYU QI’S MOTION TO QUASH
   SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT

Specially
appearing defendant Zhenyu Qi (“Defendant”) moves for an order to quash service
of summons and complaint. Plaintiff Evelyn D. Childress (“Plaintiff”) filed a
proof of service of summons on November 1, 2023, in which a registered process
server declared that Defendant’s attorney, Eric Khaodadian, was personally
served on Defendant’s behalf. Mr. Khaodadian submits a declaration stating that
on October 17, 2023, a process server attempted to serve him with the summons
and complaint, but he specifically told the process server that he was not
authorized to accept those documents on his client’s behalf. (Motion,
Khaodadian Decl., ¶ 3.) Mr. Khaodadian refused to accept service and the
process server left his office. (Id., ¶ 4.) 
When a
defendant moves to quash service of summons, the plaintiff has “the burden of
proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts
requisite to an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d
866, 868.) Here, on December 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief
stating she has made several unsuccessful attempts to serve Defendant and
requests the Court deny the motion because she is still attempting service. She
states that there was a miscommunication and she mistakenly relied on her
process server, who informed her that defense counsel was a proper agent for
service of process. 
In light of
Plaintiff’s admission that there was a mistake, the motion to quash is GRANTED.
   
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at ALHDEPT3@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. Please be advised that if you submit
on the tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the opposing party may
nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the matter. Unless you receive a
submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume that others
might appear at the hearing to argue. If the Court does not receive emails from
the parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.

[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT THE VILLAS ON THIRD HOA’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF'S
   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT; 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
January
   11, 2024



 
I.       INTRODUCTION
          On
July 12, 2023, plaintiff Evelyn D. Childress filed this action naming Zhenyu
Qi, State Farm, and Garden View Landscaping as defendants. Plaintiff alleges that
on August 14, 2021, she fell and sustained injuries when her right foot became “tangled
in the spider like plant that pertruded [sic] onto the sidewalk.” (Compl., p.
2.)
          On
September 1, 2023, the clerk received and filed Plaintiff’s operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The amended complaint adds “The Villas on Third
Homeowners Association” as a defendant. 
          On October 6, 2023, The Villas on Third
HOA (“Defendant”) (erroneously named as “The Villas on Third Homeowners
Association”) filed this demurrer to the FAC arguing that Plaintiff’s action is
barred by the statute of limitations. 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint
as true and also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]”
(Mitchell v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th
1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true,
however improbable they may be”].) 
Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
III.     DISCUSSION
          Based on the
two-year statute of limitations period set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section
335.1, Plaintiff’s personal injury action had to be filed by August 14, 2023.
Because the FAC naming Defendant was not filed until September 1, 2023,
Defendant argues that the pleading is untimely. Defendant further argues that
the FAC does not “relate back” under Code of Civil Procedure section 474
because Plaintiff did not name any fictitious Doe defendants in her original
Complaint and therefore could not have substituted Defendant as a Doe. 
          On October
27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief. Plaintiff refers to an “amended
complaint” filed on August 14, 2023, which was denied on September 5, 2023.
Plaintiff asserts, without evidence, that the complaint had been received by
the clerk “but not immediately filed.” Plaintiff also states that she later
learned that the clerk, O. Rodriguez, “was off for several days but [her]
complaint remained in his desk , [sic] according to clerk Ms. Jenny in the
pasadena court office.” Plaintiff claims that “[w]hen Mr. Rodriguez, [sic]
returned to the office, he requested a second copy of the Amended Complaint, by
via email, because he had lost the first one [sic] The second copy was sent on
August 21, 2023. Exhibit #1 and #2[.]” 
Plaintiff includes with her opposition
brief a document file-stamped August 14, 2023, and entitled “Amendment.” The
document has a gray square on the caption page with a stamp that says,
“Received Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles” and “Northeast
District Pasadena Courthouse.” The document is on pleading paper and the footer
has handwriting that is cut off; only the word “Exhibit” is legible, suggesting
that Plaintiff intends this document to serve as an exhibit supporting her
opposition. The caption on the exhibit’s first page states that the document is
an “Amendment” and lists “Laura Hoot and Ricky Leahy of The Villas on Third
Homeowners Association” as defendants. The document also includes a
“preliminary statement” and 2 pages of allegations of the incident. Notably,
there are no allegations of wrongdoing by The Villas on Third Homeowners
Association. Instead, on the last page of the document titled “AMENDMENT”,
Plaintiff states that Laura Hoot is the registered agent on file for the Villas
on Third Homeowner Association and Ricky Leahy is the president of the same. Plaintiff
also refers to a “proof of mailing letter” that was sent to an unnamed
defendant on August 14, 2023, an email sent to another unnamed defendant on
August 13, 2023, and a letter sent to “Mr. Byron Yoshida”, identified as the
secretary of the Villas of Third Homeowners Association, on July 5, 2023. 
The Court independently notes that its
record shows that on August 14, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to file an “amendment.”
Like the above-described exhibit included with Plaintiff’s opposition brief, this
filed document lists Laura Hoot and Rickey Leahy “of The Villas on Third
Homeowners Association” on the caption page and includes a copy of the last
page in Plaintiff’s exhibit which describes Laura Hoot, Ricky Leahy, and Byron
Yoshida as officers of The Villas on Third Homeowners Association. However, the
filed document differs from Plaintiff’s exhibit because it is not on pleading
paper and does not include the gray square with the file-stamped date or the
two pages of allegations. The Court’s record further shows that on August 14,
2023, the clerk, “O. Rodriguez” sent a notice of rejection which informed
Plaintiff that her “amendment” could not be processed because the “Amended
Complaint does not specify what parites [sic] are being corrected or
identified.” 
          Plaintiff
submits no evidence – and the Court’s record is devoid of any – showing that
Defendant was named in this action before the statute of limitations period
expired. Even if the clerk accepted the document that Plaintiff claims she presented
on August 14, 2023, that amendment does not name Defendant as a party, but
identifies “Laura Hoot and Ricky Leahy of The Villas on Third Homeowners
Association.” 
The operative FAC, filed on September
1, 2023, is the first document on file that properly names Defendant as a
party. Unlike the rejected amendment and Plaintiff’s exhibit, it (1) excludes
any mention of Laura Hoot, Ricky Leahy, or Bryan Yoshida, and (2) contains an
additional page of allegations that includes Plaintiff’s prayer for relief. Also,
although Plaintiff submits copies of letters she supposedly sent to Laura Hoot,
Ricky Leahy, and Bryan Yoshida, these letters are not a substitute for the act
of filing a complaint. Instead, a civil action is “commenced” for statute of
limitations purposes against persons named in the complaint only upon filing of
the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. § 350.) 
IV.     CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
Moving party to give notice.
