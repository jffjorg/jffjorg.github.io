Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the following motions:

* Defendant Zhenyu Qi's motion to quash service of summons and complaint: GRANTED
* Defendant The Villas on Third HOA's demurrer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint: SUSTAINED without leave to amend

The judge's ruling is based on the following facts:

* Plaintiff Evelyn D. Childress filed a complaint on July 12, 2023, naming Zhenyu Qi, State Farm, and Garden View Landscaping as defendants.
* Plaintiff attempted to serve Defendant's attorney, Eric Khaodadian, on October 17, 2023, but he refused to accept service.
* Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 1, 2023, which named The Villas on Third HOA as a defendant.
* Defendant The Villas on Third HOA filed a demurrer to the amended complaint, arguing that the statute of limitations has expired.

The judge's ruling is based on the following legal standards:

* A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.
* A plaintiff has the burden of proving the facts that gave the court jurisdiction and that the pleading is timely.

The judge's ruling is significant because it:

* Finds that Plaintiff's attempt to file an amended complaint on August 14, 2023, was invalid because it did not properly name The Villas on Third HOA as a defendant.
* Sustains Defendant's demurrer to the amended complaint, concluding that the statute of limitations has expired.
* Grants Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint, finding that Plaintiff's attempt to serve Defendant's attorney was invalid.
