And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production (RPDs) 1-15. The defendant, Pinner Construction Co., Inc., et al., filed the motion after the plaintiff, Jesus and Diana Renteria, failed to provide sufficient responses to the RPDs. The plaintiff argued that the meet and confer efforts were insufficient and that all responses were sufficient. However, the judge found that the parties did meet and confer re: the subject RPDs, and that the plaintiff's objections to the RPDs were overruled.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve supplemental responses to RPDs 1-15, without objections, within ten days. The judge also ordered the parties to work together to resolve issues relating to production without the need for additional law and motion practice.

The judge denied the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $7420, finding that the plaintiff took his position in good faith and that imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The judge also scheduled future discovery motions for November 7, 2024, and asked the parties to continue to meet and confer in good faith to resolve all discovery issues without the need for additional law and motion practice.
