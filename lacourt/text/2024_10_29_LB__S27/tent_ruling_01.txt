  Case Number:  23LBCV00209    Hearing Date:   October 29, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Babken Gabrielyan filed this action against Defendants, SAI
Long Beach B, Inc. dba Long Beach BMW, Brooke Ashley Baker, and Rita Regalado
for damages arising out of an automobile accident.  There are cross-complaints and a consolidated
action arising out of the same accident. 

 
2.     Motion
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
At this time, Baker has agreed to
settle all claims with Plaintiff for her policy limit of $100,000.  Defendant seeks an order from the Court
finding that the settlement is in good faith. 

 
Defendant timely and properly
served the moving papers on all other parties in the action.  Any opposition to the motion was due on or
before 10/16/24.  No party has filed
opposition to the motion.  The burden on
a motion for determination of good faith settlement rests squarely on the party
opposing the finding of good faith.  CCP
§877.6(d).  In light of the lack of
opposition, no party has met that burden. 
The motion for determination of good faith settlement is therefore
granted.
 
Moving Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
