matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are
apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court
may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient
to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form
part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part
thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion
or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out
any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2)
strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, §
436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is
reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations in FAC[2]
 
The Plaintiffs are husband and wife who reside in 1828
Preston Ave., Los Angeles, CA (“1828” or “the Property”). (FAC ¶¶ 1, 2.)
Defendants Joshua Hess (“Joshua”) and Rebecca Baxter (“Rebecca”) are the
co-owners of 1822 Preston Avenue, Los Angeles, CA (“1828” or “the Adjacent Property”).
(FAC ¶ 3.) This action stems from construction activities by Defendants that
have resulted in noise complaints, wood debris landing on Plaintiffs’ Property,
and Defendants taking down sections of the existing wooden fence between the
properties. (FAC ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs allege that excavation by power drilling has
damaged the Property’s concrete retain wall resulting in the weakening of
lateral support and causing the grade of 1822 to slant towards 1828, resulting
in water, rain, soil, and other debris from 1822 to move towards and onto 1828.  (FAC ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs assert that the
weakening of the lateral support increases the likelihood of catastrophic
collapse of land and structures on the Property. (FAC ¶ 33.) 
            
On January 29, 2020, Defendant Joshua discussed with
Plaintiffs whether they could consent to him replacing the existing old wooden
fence between the Property and the Adjacent property with a new fence paid for
by Defendant Joshua. (FAC ¶ 9.) Plaintiffs consented with the following
conditions: (1) that the fence be placed in the same location as the existing
fence and (2) that the fence would not affect the concrete foundation for the
wooden fence and any other items located on the Property. (FAC ¶¶ 9, 96, 103.)
Defendant Joshua represented that he agreed with the conditions and would
install the fence accordingly. (FAC ¶ 9.)
 
On June 17, 2020, Plaintiff Debby Han saw Mr. Hess remove
about six feet of the existing wooden fence and demolish and remove a
stabilizing vertical post on the Property to drill into the Property. (FAC ¶
12.) Plaintiffs allege that the use of power tools, including a jackhammer and
power grinder were used to dig a ditch on the Property to break down and damage
the exposed base of the concrete foundation for the wooden fence, and remove
the stabilizing vertical post on Plaintiff’s property. (FAC ¶ 12.) This
weakened the lateral support for the Property. (FAC ¶ 12.) Defendant Joshua also
caused there to be a change in the grade of the adjacent ground so that the
Adjacent Property slanted towards the Property instead of away as was the
previous condition. (FAC ¶ 13.) Despite Plaintiffs’ request that the Defendants
cease their activities and trespassing on Plaintiffs’ property, Defendant
Joshua refused and continued with the destructive excavation activities. (FAC
¶¶ 14, 16.) 
 
On June 17, 2020, at 4:15 Defendant Joshua provided
evidence from a land survey showing that that the fences between the properties
and “some existing cement work” that provided a foundation for the wooded fence
encroached on the Adjacent Property by six inches. (FAC ¶¶ 15, 17.) Plaintiff
asserts that the survey shows a block of concrete but no fence.  Most of the concrete block wall is on the
Property, including the area on which Defendant Joshua was trespassing and
excavating. (FAC ¶ 18.) Plaintiffs maintain that because the survey fails to
note the existence of a wooden fence, it fails to show any fence or cement work
encroaching on the Adjacent Property. (FAC ¶ 19.) On June 30, 2020, Defendant
Joshua continued to remove portions of the wooden fence between the properties.
(FAC ¶ 23.) On July 6, 2020, Defendant Joshua resumed power drilling and
jackhammering into the cement and concrete on the Adjacent Property, such that
the loud noise interfered with the Plaintiffs’ health and comfortable enjoyment
of their Property. (FAC ¶¶ 25, 26.) Plaintiffs further maintain that Defendants
failed to provide the required legal notices for their activities per Civil
Code §§ 832 (excavation) and 841 (fences). (FAC ¶ 38.) 
 
On August 7, 2020, the court granted Plaintiffs a
preliminary injunction preventing Defendants from (1) trespassing onto the
Property for any reason; (2) causing concrete or cement dust or particulate
matter to blow or transfer onto the Property; (3) failing to maintain the
Adjacent Property in a manner as to permit any soil, dirt, debris, liquids or
construction material to transfer onto the Property; and (4) failing to comply
with any City of Los Angeles requirements regarding construction activities.
(FAC ¶ 29.) Plaintiffs assert that on September 2020, Defendants violated the
injunction by creating an illegal ad hoc retaining wall by putting backfill
behind the wooden fences and failing to reinstall the stabilizing vertical wood
post and concrete foundation that was previously demolished. (FAC ¶ 31.)
Defendants also altered the drainage in the Adjacent Property so that debris
would cut into the Property and failed to restore and repair the planks of the
wooden fence. (FAC ¶ 31.)  
 
The FAC further alleges that from October 2020 to
November 2021, Defendants violated the injunction and failed to obtain permits
that resulted in the removal of soil that changed the soil grading on the
properties and weakened the lateral support for the Property. (FAC ¶ 34.) From
September 2022 to February 2023, construction and excavation activities
continued in violation of the injunction. (FAC ¶ 36.) 
 
On August 30, 2023, Defendant Joshua continued to engage
in unlawful construction and excavation that resulted in clouds of harmful and
offensive particulate matter, dust, and debris to transfer from the Adjacent
Property to the Property. (FAC¶ 37.) The FAC asserts that Defendants have
violated the injunction. (FAC ¶ 39.) 
 
B.        Seventh
and Eighth Causes of Action – Fraud and Deceit and Negligent Misrepresentation
 
To plead a cause of action for fraud, Plaintiff must
plead facts showing the following elements: (1) misrepresentation, (2)
knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4) justifiable reliance, and (5)
resulting damage. (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal. App.4th 170, 184.)
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation are similar to intentional fraud
except for the requirement of scienter; in a claim for negligent
misrepresentation, the plaintiff need not allege the defendant made an intentionally
false statement, but simply one as to which he or she lacked any reasonable
ground for believing the statement to be true.” (Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645, the California Supreme Court addressed the requirement that
“fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not
suffice.”
 
Defendant Rebecca demurs to the seventh and eighth causes
of action on the grounds that they are not pled with the request specificity. 
 
The seventh and eighth causes of action are premised on
the same operative facts. The FAC alleges that the misrepresentation was that
Defendant Joshua orally told the Plaintiffs that the wooden fence between the
properties would be replaced by a new fence on the same location as the
existing fence and that the replacement would not affect the concrete
foundation and any other items located on the Property. (FAC ¶¶ 9, 97, 103.)
However, the representation was false and a pretext to move the fence closer to
Plaintiffs’ Property. (FAC ¶¶ 97, 104.) Defendant Joshua knew the
representation was false he made it, and it was done with the intent to deceive
and defraud Plaintiff and induce Plaintiff to act in reliance on “these
representations.” (FAC ¶¶ 98, 99, 105.)  
 
The court finds that the intent to defraud and justifiable
reliance elements are conclusory as they are pled without any supporting facts.
There are no facts to show that Defendant Rebecca made or ratified any of
Defendant Joshua’s alleged misrepresentations or that Plaintiffs relied on the
representations about replacing the fence. “It is settled law that a pleading
must allege facts and not conclusions, and that material facts must be alleged
directly and not by way of recital.” (Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles and Space
Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531, 537.) The FAC fails to allege how Defendant
Rebecca made or ratified representations with the intent to defraud Plaintiffs
or how Plaintiffs relied on Rebecca’s misrepresentations.
 
Moreover, a negligent representation claim, like a
negligence cause of action, requires that Defendants owe a duty to Plaintiffs
to disclose truthful facts. (See Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF
Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 867.) Here, the
FAC is devoid of facts as to what duty to disclose Defendants owed Plaintiffs.
Therefore, the demurrer to the seventh and eighth causes of action is sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
C.        Ninth and
Tenth Causes of Action – Quiet Title by Adverse Possession and Quiet Title by
Easement by Prescription
 
In
an action for quiet title, Plaintiff must plead 1) a description of the
property that is the subject of the action,” specifically the location of
tangible personal property and the legal description and street address or
common designation of real property, 2) the title of the plaintiff as to which
a determination under this chapter is sought and the basis of the title, 3) the
adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff against which a determination is
sought, 4) the date as of which the determination is sought, and 5) a prayer
for the determination of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse claims.
(CCP § 761.020.) To prevail in an action to quiet title, the plaintiff must
prove title superior to that of defendant. (Gerhard v. Stephens (1968)
68 Cal.2d 864, 918.)
 
Defendant Rebecca demurs to the ninth and tenth cause of
action on the basis that they are conclusory and fail to plead a claim for
adverse possession. Plaintiffs’ ninth cause of action alleges they “own the fee
simple title to the real property claimed and disputed in the Cross-Complaint”
without specifically describing the disputed property and without alleging they
hold superior title to said property. (See Twain Harte Homeowners Ass’n v.
Patterson (1987)193 Cal.App.3d 184, 188.) 
As
Plaintiffs’ title to the disputed property is based on adverse possession,
Plaintiffs must plead facts to support a claim for adverse possession,
including the fact that Plaintiffs paid taxes on the disputed property
continuously for five years. (CCP § 325(b); McLear-Gary v. Scott (2018)
25 Cal.App.5th 145, 156.) 
 
“The elements necessary to establish a
prescriptive easement are well settled. The party claiming such an easement
must show use of the property which has been open, notorious, continuous and
adverse for an uninterrupted period of five years.” (Warsaw v.
Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 564, 570; see also
Civ. Code, §§ 1007, 321.) “[A]n essential element necessary to the
establishment of a prescriptive easement is visible, open and notorious use
sufficient to impart actual or constructive notice of the use to the owner of
the servient tenement.” (Connolly v. McDermott
(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 973, 977.) 
 
The
tenth cause of action alleges that Plaintiffs own an easement by adverse
possession which Defendants hold an adverse title to. (FAC ¶¶ 116-118.) The
easement burdens the Adjacent Property “to the extent claimed and disputed in
the Cross-Complaint. (FAC ¶ 115.) 
 
An easement “represents a limited privilege to use the
land of another, ... but does not create an interest in the land itself.” (Kazi v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (2001) 24
Cal.4th 871, 881, 103.) To claim adverse possession in an easement the claimant
must use the easement in a manner that ‘is wrongful and in defiance of the
owner's property rights.’ ” (McBride v. Smith
(2018) 18 Cal.App.5th 1160, 1181.) The tenth cause of action fails to plead
where the easement is located and what the use of the easement is. There are no
facts to show  how the easement was used
by Plaintiff’s in a way that was wrongful and in defiance of Defendant’s
property rights. 

Based on the above, the demurrer to the ninth
and tenth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
D.        Demurrer
to Entire Complaint Due to Uncertainty
 
“A
demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) A demurrer for uncertainty may only be sustained when a defendant
cannot reasonably determine to what he or she is required to respond. (Ibid.)
For example, where it is not reasonably certain what issues must be admitted or
denied, or what counts or claims are directed against the defendant, the
complaint will be uncertain. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) 
 
Defendant Rebecca asserts that
Plaintiffs’ entire FAC is uncertain because the FAC is unclear as to which
actions were taken by which Defendant. Having reviewed the FAC in its entirety,
the court is unpersuaded that the allegations in the FAC are so uncertain that
Defendants are not appraised of what causes of action are alleged against them
and what issues must be admitted or denied. Consequently, the demurrer for
uncertainty is overruled. 
 
III.      Motion to
Strike
 
Defendant Rebecca
moves to strike attorney’s fees and punitive damages as alleged in the
following paragraphs of the FAC: 
 
First Cause of Action - Private
Nuisance 


Paragraph 54:
      Punitive Damages


 
Second Cause of Action – Abatement of
Private Nuisances and Damages


Paragraph 63:
      Punitive Damages


 
Fifth Cause of Action – Willful
Trespass to Private Property


Paragraph 88:
      Punitive Damages


 
Seventh Cause of Action – Fraud and
Deceit


Paragraph 101:
      Punitive Damages


 
Prayer: 


Pages 31-35: All prayers,
      “For costs of suit and reasonable attorney fees incurred by this action;”
Pages 31-35: Prayers on
      the First, Second, Third, Fifth, Seventh causes of action, “For exemplary
      and punitive damages.”


 
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code §
3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has
been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)  The basis for punitive damages must
be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual
assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)  “Malice” is defined in
Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause
injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”
“Oppression” is as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” 
(Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.)
 
The
court finds that while Plaintiffs have properly alleged
that Defendant Joshua acted with malice and oppression by engaging in nuisance
and in failing to stop construction and excavation activities in violation of
the August 7, 2020, injunction, there are no allegations to support the finding
that Defendant Rebecca acted with malice, oppression, or fraud sufficient to
support a claim for punitive damages against her. (FAC ¶¶ 29, 30, 31, 34, 36, 37, 39.) 
 
Therefore,
the motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Defendant Rebecca also moves to strike
Plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s fees on the basis that the FAC fails to
allege a basis for attorney’s fees. A plaintiff cannot recover
attorneys’ fees in the absence of either a contractual or statutory provision
authorizing their recovery. (CCP § 1021.) Plaintiffs’ opposition fails to show
that Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney’s fees. Therefore, Defendant Rebecca’s
motion to strike Plaintiffs’
request for attorney’s fees is granted with leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Rebecca’s
demurrer to the entire FAC based on uncertainty is overruled but stained with
leave to amend as to the seventh cause of action for fraud and deceit, eighth
cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, ninth cause of action for
quiet title by adverse possession, and tenth cause of action for quite title by
easement by prescription. 
 
Defendant Rebecca’s motion to strike is granted with leave
to amend. 
 
Plaintiffs are granted 30 days
leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for June 3, 2023,
at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
