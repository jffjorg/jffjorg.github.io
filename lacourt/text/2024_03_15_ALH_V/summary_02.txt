```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the unopposed motions filed by the plaintiffs to compel responses to defendant Shao's discovery requests. The motions include requests for responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. After reviewing the motions, the court finds that defendant Shao has failed to provide responses to the discovery requests, which is a misuse of the discovery process.

The court grants the motions to compel responses to each of the discovery requests and orders defendant Shao to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses within 30 days. The court also grants the plaintiffs' requests for sanctions against defendant Shao in the amounts of $510.00, $960.00, and $510.00, respectively, for each of the discovery requests.

The court's ruling is based on the fact that defendant Shao failed to provide responses to the discovery requests, which is a misuse of the discovery process. The court has discretion to impose sanctions for such misuse and has done so in this case. The court's ruling is intended to ensure that the discovery process is used fairly and efficiently and that the parties are held accountable for their actions.
