(“Herc”), and DOES 1 to 50, inclusive, which arises from an incident in which Plaintiff allegedly fell off a boom lift/cherry picker.On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Cleon, IPSUM, Inc. (“Ipsum”), Paet Real Estate, LLC (“Paet”), Herc, and DOES 1 to 50,inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) General Negligence, (2) Products Liability, and (3) Premises Liability.On November 28, 2022, Herc filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Cleon, Ipsum, and Paet, alleging causes of action for: (1) Equitable Indemnity, (2) Partial or Comparative Indemnity, and (3) Declaratory Relief.On January 31, 2023, Ipsum filed a Cross-Complaint against Herc and Ricardo Guzman Villanueva, alleging causes of action for: (1) Equitable Indemnity, (2) Comparative Indemnity, and (3) Declaratory Relief.On January 11, 2024, Herc filed the instant unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)On January 22, 2024, this case was reassigned from the Honorable Ralph C. Hofer to the Honorable Sarah J. Heidel sitting in Department V at Alhambra Courthouse, which became effective on February 5, 2024.Non-jury trial is set to begin on September 30, 2024.LEGAL STANDARDThe trial court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) “Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) “There is a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding.” (Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945, citation omitted.) “An application to amend a pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion.” (Ibid., citation omitted.)Under Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) of the California Rules of Court, a separate declaration must accompany a motion for leave to amend and must specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise tothe amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) A party seeking leave to amend must attach a copy of the proposed pleading to the motion for leave to amend. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a).)DISCUSSIONA. Appropriateness of Allowing Herc Leave to Amend its Cross-ComplaintIn support of the motion, Herc presents the declaration of its counsel, Richard W. Davis (“Davis”). Counsel states that the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint seeks to add a proposed cause of action for express indemnity against Ipsum pursuant to the language of the rental agreement between Herc and Ipsum. (Davis Decl., ¶ 13; Exh. B.) Counsel declares that the amendments are necessary and proper. (Davis Decl., ¶ 14.) Davis sets forth the effect of the amendments. (Davis Decl., ¶ 14; Exh. A.) Counsel states that the facts giving rise to an express indemnity claim against Ipsum were unknown to Herc until after Herc received OSHA documents identifying the subject equipment, which occurred on or about June 7, 2023. (Davis Decl., ¶¶ 5, 15.) Ipsum will not stipulate to Herc filing an amended cross-complaint. (Davis Decl., ¶ 15.) Counsel states that, despite multiple extensions, Ipsum’s previous counsel did not reply to Herc tendering its defense and indemnity pursuant to the rental agreement. (Davis Decl., ¶ 15.)Herc has attached the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint as Exhibit B to the declaration of Davis in support of the motion. Herc has complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. Herc’s motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint is also unopposed which leads to an inference that it is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Herc’s Motion for Leave to File a First-Amended Cross-Complaint as it is unopposed. Herc is ordered to file and serve the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint within five court days of this order so that it becomes an operative pleading in this action.Moving Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
