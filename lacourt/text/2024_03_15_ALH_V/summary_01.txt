And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion of Herc Rentals, Inc. for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The motion is unopposed and seeks to add a proposed cause of action for express indemnity against Ipsum, Inc. based on the language of the rental agreement between the parties. The court finds that the amendments are necessary and proper, and that the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were unknown to Herc until after it received OSHA documents identifying the subject equipment. The court grants the motion and orders Herc to file and serve the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint within five court days.
