And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Sarah J. Heidel regarding two motions to deem admitted plaintiffs' requests for admission and for monetary sanctions against Defendant Markosyan. The motions were filed by Plaintiffs Andrey Zohrabian and Arusyak Torosyan, who are seeking to deem admitted their requests for admission and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $811.65 against Defendant Markosyan. Defendant Markosyan is representing herself in pro per and is not represented by counsel. The court finds that service of the motions by electronic service was improper, and therefore, the motions are denied without prejudice. The court notes that Defendant Markosyan has not consented to electronic service, and there is no indication in the court file that she has consented to receive electronic service. The court also notes that the service list does not set forth an electronic mail address at which the motions were served.
