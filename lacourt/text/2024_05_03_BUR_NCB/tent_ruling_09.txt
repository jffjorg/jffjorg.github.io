A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Jairo L. Estrada (“Plaintiff”) allege
that on January 17, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contact with
Defendant Ford Motor Company (“FMC”) regarding a 2022 Ford Explorer vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that the warranty contract contained various warranties, including but not limited to the
bumper-bumper warranty, powertrain warranty, emission warranty, etc.  Plaintiff alleges that the defects and
nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves during the applicable
warranty period, including but not limited to, transmission defects and
infotainment defects, among other defects and non-conformities.  Plaintiff alleges that FMC failed to promptly
replace the vehicle or make restitution. 

Plaintiff

Duarte (“Envision”) for substantial repair on at least one occasion, but Envision
failed to use ordinary care and skill to properly store, prepare, and repair
the subject vehicle.  
The complaint, filed January 22, 2024,
alleges causes of action for: (1) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(D); (2) violation
of Civil Code, § 1793.2(B); (3) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(A)(3); (4)
breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civil Code, §§ 1791.1, 1794,
and 1795.5); (5) negligent repair; and (6) fraudulent inducement – concealment.

DISCLOSURE
John Kralik was an associate of the Law
Firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed from 1979-1987 and a partner in Hughes
Hubbard & Reed from 1988-1993. During that time he worked on Ford Motor
Company matters, principally on products liability cases from 1976 (when he was
a summer associate) until 1987. Ford was a major client during his partnership
with the firm, and so some portion of his partner draw would have originated
with Ford. The Court does not feel that it is biased in this matter as the
result of this long-ago legal representation but recognizes that the parties
may have a different perception. If any party feels that the Court’s prior work
at Hughes Hubbard creates an appearance of bias, please file an appropriate
request for the Court to recuse prior to the next hearing in this matter. It is
not necessary to file a peremptory challenge under CCP 170.6. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
The parties are ordered to attend the
hearing.  Prior to the hearing, counsel
should discuss with their clients whether they would like this case to proceed
in this Department.  If the parties have
objections, they should be raised at the hearing so that the Court may take
appropriate steps to recuse itself from the action and transfer the case. 
If the parties are willing to waive these
issues, then the Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer to the
complaint to May 31, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
No further briefing will be permitted on the motion. 
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
