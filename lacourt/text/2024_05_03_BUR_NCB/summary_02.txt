And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Carmen Jimenez-Guzman's motion to strike Defendant Smart & Final Stores, LLC's supplemental expert designation. The Judge found that Defendant's failure to initially designate an expert in the area of "medical treatment" or "reasonable costs" of treatment was not an abuse of the statute, and that Defendant's supplementation of its expert witness list was appropriate as a rebuttal expert witness. The Judge also noted that there was no showing that Defendant's delay in disclosing its retained expert was for the purpose of delaying the litigation. The Judge concluded that there was no substantial prejudice to Plaintiff by Defendant's supplementation of its expert witness list, and that both experts should have the benefit of the opposing expert's reports and depositions prior to trial.
