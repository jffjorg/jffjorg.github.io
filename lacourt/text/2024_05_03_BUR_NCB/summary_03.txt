And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Alfred O. Anyia, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on November 13, 2023, and is based on the fact that the plaintiff, Kingsley C. Ukonu, passed away on August 19, 2022. Counsel argues that the administrators of the estate have declined to proceed with the case, and therefore counsel seeks to withdraw from representing the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion, but with the condition that counsel must file a corrected Order to be Relieved as Counsel. The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff's administrators.
