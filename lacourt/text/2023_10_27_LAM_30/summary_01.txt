And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the retroactive elimination of the claims presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims under AB 218 is unconstitutional under the gift clause of the California Constitution. The judge concludes that the Legislature's elimination of the claims presentation requirement serves a public purpose, citing the bill's intent to allow more victims of childhood sexual abuse to be compensated for their injuries, prevent future assaults, and promote positive internal change in public institutions. The judge finds that the argument that the class of childhood sexual abuse victims is too small to be the subject of a "public purpose" is meritless and that the Legislature's discretion will not be disturbed by the courts.
