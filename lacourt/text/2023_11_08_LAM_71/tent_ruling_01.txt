 Case No.:

 Hearing Date:  November 8, 2023



 
Defendant County
of Los Angeles’ demurrer to Plaintiff Gia Nguyen’s first amended complaint is
sustained as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action without leave to amend.
Defendant
County of Los Angeles’ motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Gia Nguyen and
her counsel of record, Law Offices of Maryann Gallagher, is denied.
 
Defendant
County of Los Angeles (“County”) (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiff Gia Nguyen’s
(“Nguyen”) (“Plaintiff”) first amended complaint (“FAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e),
430.30(a), 430.40(a), 430.41; CRC, Rule 3.1320.)
County
moves for sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record, Law Offices of
Maryann Gallagher, for bad faith tactics in their refusal to dismiss frivolous
causes of action from the FAC or respond to County’s inquiries regarding the
same.  (Notice of Sanctions, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§128.5, 128.7.)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
County’s
9/14/23 request for judicial notice as to the first amended complaint in the
instant case is denied, as this Court does not need to take judicial notice of
filings on the instant docket.
 
1.    
Demurrer
Meet
and Confer
Before
filing a demurrer, the moving party must meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer and/or motion to strike.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
County’s
counsel declares she made a good faith effort to meet and confer with Plaintiff
by sending Plaintiff’s counsel an email on June 23, 2023, explaining to the
deficiencies in the FAC.  (Decl. of Goldsmith
¶5, Exh. 3.)  Defendant’s counsel
declares on July 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel asked via email to have a phone
conversation to discuss the meet and confer, and parties agreed to stipulate to
continue to file County’s responsive pleading.  (Decl. of Goldsmith ¶10.)  Defendant’s counsel declares she made an
attempt to contact Plaintiff’s counsel by phone, but Plaintiff’s counsel was
unavailable, and she never received the return phone call she requested from
Plaintiff’s counsel via email.  (Decl. of
Goldsmith ¶10.)  Failure to sufficiently
meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355, citing
text.)  As such, the Court will consider County’s
demurrer.
 
Background
          Plaintiff alleges she was a Clinical
Laboratory Scientist I in the Microbiology lab for over 31 years. (FAC ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges she performed well in her
position.  (FAC ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges she received a meets
expectations performance evaluation.  (FAC
¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges she began to have
some difficulties in some of the record keeping and had been able to fix the
issues before any action was taken. (FAC ¶7.) 
Plaintiff alleges some of her co-workers were making similar errors but
they were not disciplined.  (FAC ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges her coworkers were younger
than her.  (FAC ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Leang Tea
harassed, discriminated, and bullied her based on her age, race, and gender.  (FAC ¶7.) 

Plaintiff
alleges Defendants introduced some new methods and procedures, but Plaintiff
was taken off the bench where she could work on learning the new procedures and
denied training.  (FAC ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges other less senior, younger
employees received training, but Plaintiff was denied the training.  (FAC ¶8.) 
Plaintiff
alleges Plaintiff she worked for Defendants for over 30 years and had
experience and knowledge.  (FAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges she was a valuable
employee.  (FAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants wanted to
replace her because they saw her as older and obsolete.  (FAC ¶9.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants did not want to take the time to train her
on new procedures like they were training the younger staff, then they would
evaluate her on the same standard that they did the employees who had already
been trained and learned the new procedures. 
(FAC ¶9.)  
Plaintiff
alleges Leang Tea (“Tea”), her supervisor, would call her Mama Jiao, and kept
asking her when she was going to retire.  (FAC ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges Tea would only hire people who were less than 40 years
old.  (FAC ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges on her belief that she was
one of many employees who were over the age of 40 that Defendants attempted to
terminate and replace with younger employees. 
(FAC ¶10.)
Plaintiff
alleges Employer Defendants LAC+USC, County, Los Angeles County University of
Southern California Medical Center (collectively, “Employer Defendants”)
pressured plaintiff to retire or tried to force her to resign by refusing to
provide her the training they were giving to other (younger) employees.  (FAC ¶11.) 
Plaintiff alleges Tea would then assign her tasks that she was not
trained for and then write her up if she did not perform them properly even
though she had not been shown the procedures he wanted her to follow.  (FAC ¶11.) 

Plaintiff
alleges she complained in January 2019 to the County Equity Investigations
Unit/(CEIU) that she felt that she was being discriminated against and
disciplined based on her age, her race and her gender.  (FAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants and their supervisors, including Tea, then
began to highly scrutinize Plaintiff, watching her work, and writing her up for
minor infractions.  (FAC ¶12.)  
Plaintiff
alleges on August 14, 2019, Plaintiff filed an equity complaint with the County
Equity Investigations Unit alleging she was retaliated for her complaint.  (FAC ¶14.) 
Plaintiff alleges nobody would help her. 
(FAC ¶14.)  Plaintiff alleges that
instead, Defendants ratified and condoned the discrimination against her and
retaliated against her for complaint of age and gender discrimination by
terminating her.  (FAC ¶14.)
Plaintiff
alleges she was wrongfully terminated on or about April 20, 2020, in
retaliation for her complaints and in wrongful termination of the public policy
set forth in FEHA as set forth above.  (FAC
¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges she exhausted
her administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit.  (FAC ¶17.)
On April
13, 2022, Plaintiff filed her initial complaint against Employer Defendants.  On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC against Employer Defendants alleging two causes of action: (1) violation
of Labor Code §1102.5; and (2) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy.
County
filed the instant demurrer on September 14, 2023.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 26,
2023.  County filed its reply on November
1, 2023.
 
Summary of Demurrer
County
demurs on the basis that Plaintiff’s causes of action are not viable against it
because (1) Plaintiff failed to present a Government Claim Act claim, which is
a judicial prerequisite to filing a lawsuit against a public entity (Gov. Code
§§945.4, 946.6), and (2) the County cannot be liable in Tort for a Wrongful
Termination cause of action (Gov. Code §§815(a), 815.6.  (Demurrer, pg. 1; Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
Legal
Standard
“[A]
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis
v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Government
Claims Act
Violation
of Labor Code §1102.5 (1st COA)
The
Government Claims Act (“GCA”) (Gov. Code §810 et seq.) governs actions
against public entities and public employees. The timeliness of such actions is
governed by the specific statute of limitations set forth in the Government
Code, not the statute of limitations applicable to private defendants.  (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267-1268, citing Moore v. Twomey (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 910, 913-914; Martell v. Antelope Valley Hospital Medical
Center (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 978, 981.)
Under
the GCA, no person may sue a public entity or public employee for “money or
damages” unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied by the
public entity.  (Gov. Code §945.4; see
Shirk v. Vista Unified School District (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 208.)  If a complaint does not allege facts showing
that a claim was timely made, or that compliance with the claims statutes is
excused, it is subject to demurrer.  (Shirk,
42 Cal.4th at pg. 209; J.M. v. Huntington Beach Union High School District
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 652.)  Moreover,
under California’s claim presentation statutes, failure to timely present a
claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a
lawsuit against that entity.  (City of
Pasadena v. Superior Court (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1340, 1340.) “The purpose
of the claims statutes is not to prevent surprise, but to provide the public
entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and
to settle them, if appropriate, without the expense of litigation.”  (City of Stockton v. Superior Court
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 731.)  
To
file a Labor Code §1102.5 claim against a government entity, the Plaintiff must
file a GCA claim within six (6) months of the adverse employment action.  (Gov. Code §911.2.)  If untimely, Plaintiff could have attempted to
present a “late claim” to the public entity by submitting an application for
leave to present a late claim.  However,
a late claim must be submitted within one (1) year of the accrual of the cause
of action.  (Gov. Code §911.4.)
Government
Code §946.6(c) provides that the court will grant relief only if it finds that
(1) the application to the public entity for leave to file a late claim was
made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of the claim
as specified in §911.4(b); (2) was denied or deemed denied by the public agency
pursuant to §911.6; and (3) one or more of the following is applicable: (a) the
failure to timely present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect, unless the public entity establishes that it would be
prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner
from the requirements of §945.4; (b) the person who sustained the alleged
injury, damage or loss was a minor during all of the time specified in §911.2
for the presentation of the claim; (c) the person who sustained the alleged injury,
damage or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during all of the time
specified in §911.2 for the presentation of the claim and by reason of that
disability failed to present a claim during that time; or (d) the person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss died before the expiration of the
time specified in §911.2 for the presentation of the claim.  (Gov. Code §946.6(c).)
Plaintiff
fails to allege she timely presented a GCA claim to County and concedes in her
opposition that County’s demurrer to the two causes of action is well
taken.  (Opposition, pg. 1 at ¶1.)  Plaintiff alleges her adverse employment
action was on April 20, 2020.  (FAC ¶15.).  Therefore, Plaintiff had until October 20,
2020, to present a claim, and had until April 20, 2021, to request the filing
of a late claim.  (Gov. Code §§911.2,
911.4.)  Although Plaintiff claims to
have exhausted administrative remedies, she has not plead that she presented a GCA
claim, which is not an administrative remedy, but a filing with the
governmental entity.  Since Plaintiff
failed to file a GCA claim and cannot do so now, this demurrer must be
sustained.
Plaintiff
requests leave to amend the complaint to correct the mistake and to file a
second amended complaint alleging age discrimination and gender discrimination
on the basis the causes of action were in the initial complaint and were
inadvertently removed by mistake. 
Plaintiff contends Defendants would not be prejudiced because they had a
year to conduct discovery on these claims and they are not new.  (Opposition, pg. 3 at ¶11.)  However, it does not appear that leave to
amend the allegedly inadvertently omitted causes of action would cure necessary
deficiencies, as the proposed Second Amended Complaint (proposed “SAC”)
attached to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration fails to allege that Plaintiff
timely submitted a Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”) Charge of
Discrimination.  (See Decl. of
Gallagher ¶¶1, 16, Exh. 2.)
Accordingly,
County’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy (2nd COA)
The
GCA immunizes public entities such as the County from tort liability in all
cases except those where liability is explicitly created by a particular
statute. (Gov. Code §815(a); Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School District (1998)
19 Cal.4th 925, 932 [“in California, ‘all government tort liability must be
based on statute’”]; Doe v. Los Angeles County Department of Children &
Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 682-683.)  A general tort statute is insufficient by
itself to serve as a basis for direct public liability.  (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183 [direct liability to a public entity could not be
imposed based on general duty of ordinary care embodied in Civil Code § 1714].)
Public
employees cannot sue their public employers for wrongful termination in
violation of public policy.  (See
Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899; McAllister
v. Los Angeles Unified School District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1219;
Gov. Code §815(a).)  Wrongful Termination
in Violation of Public Policy, even when the action cites statutory causes of
action for potential violations of the “policy,” is barred against a public
entity as a matter of law. 
In Miklosy,
the California Supreme Court stated, 
The Government Claims Act . . .
establishes the limits of common law liability for public entities, stating: “Except
as otherwise provided by statute: (a) a public entity is not liable for an
injury whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public
entity or a public employee or any other person.” The Legislative Committee Comment
to section 815 states: “This section abolishes all common law or
judicially declared forms of liability for public entities, except for such
liability as may be required the state or federal constitution.”
 
(Miklosy,
44 Cal.4th at pg. 899.)  The Miklosy
Court held that public entities may only be liable where a statute expressly
gives rise to such liability, and common law claims not derived from statute
are legally impermissible. 
In McAllister,
the Court of Appeal, citing Miklosy, held that the claims at issue in
both those cases, for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, were
common law claims, and thus barred under Government Code §815 and Miklosy
for lack of statutory authority.  (McAllister,
216 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1219 [holding “the alleged torts are barred under
Government Code section 815 and Miklosy.”].)
As
such there is no statutory basis to allege common law tort-based claims like
wrongful termination in violation of public policy against the County.
Accordingly,
County’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
 
Conclusion
County’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is sustained without leave to amend as to
the 1st and 2nd causes of action.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion for Sanctions
County
filed the instant motion on October 16, 2023. 
Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 26, 2023.  County filed its reply on November 1, 2023.
 
Legal
Standard
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §128.5(a), “[a] trial court may order a party, the party’s attorney,
or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
another party as a result of bad faith actions or tactics that are frivolous.”  (C.C.P. §128.5(a).)  “Actions or tactics” specifically include the
making or opposing of motions, or other responsive pleadings such as demurrers.
(C.C.P. §128.5(b)(l).)  “Frivolous”
means, in pertinent part, “totally and completely without merit.”  (C.C.P. §128.5(b)(2).)
By
filing a pleading, motion, or similar paper in court, an attorney makes an
implied “certification” that the filing has legal and factual merit.  (C.C.P. §128.7(b).)  The purpose of §128.7 is “to check abuses in
the filing of pleadings, petitions, written notices of motions or similar
papers.”  (Musaelian v. Adams
(2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 514.)  C.C.P.
§128.7 requires that a pleading filed with the Court, among other things: 
(1)  It
is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or
to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
 
(2)  The claims,
defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or
by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law or the establishment of new law.
 
(3)  The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
 
(4)  The
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief.
 
(C.C.P.
§128.7(b).)
If,
after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that
a pleading fails to meet the conditions set forth under §128.7, it may impose
an appropriate monetary and non-monetary sanction on the attorney or party
responsible for the violation.  (C.C.P.
§128.7(c); see also Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189-190
[“Under section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading
was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either
legally or factually.”].)  “If
warranted,” the court may award the prevailing party its reasonable expenses
and attorney fees “incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.”  (C.C.P. §128.7(c)(1).)
Whether
a party or attorney violated C.C.P. §128.7 is measured objectively. (Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 82 [“We measure the
truth-finding inquiry’s reasonableness under an objective standard, and apply
this standard both to attorneys and to their clients.”]; Optimal Markets,
Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 912, 921 [“A trial court is to apply
an objective standard in making its inquiry concerning the attorney’s or
party’s allegedly sanctionable behavior in connection with a motion for
sanctions brought under section 128.7.”].) 
“A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would
agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.’”  (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 428, 440, quoting In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31
Cal.3d 637, 650.)
Courts
also may sanction counsel for presenting a motion “primarily for an improper
purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase
in the cost of litigation.” (C.C.P. §128.7(b)(1).  However, where a motion is not legally or
factually frivolous, courts are reluctant to find that it was presented for an
improper purpose unless the motion “is filed in the context of a persistent
pattern of clearly abusive litigation activity.”  (Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Alla Medical
Services, Inc. (9th Cir. 1988) 855 F.2d 1470, 1476 [interpreting Fed. R.
Civ. Proc. 11); see also Ponce v. Wells Fargo Bank (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
253, 264-265 [“[W]e have held that the [improper purpose and frivolous filings]
clauses are not totally independent.”].)
The
evidentiary burden to escape sanctions under §128.7 is “light.”  Counsel only need to have “made a reasonable
inquiry into the facts and entertained a good faith belief in the merits of the
claim” and “need not amass even enough evidence to create a triable issue of
fact” as in summary judgment proceedings or show counsel could overcome a
demurrer.  (Kumar v. Ramsey (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1126.)
 
Discussion
While
the Court is sympathetic to County’s frustration in its attempts to meet and
confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the demurrer to the FAC, Plaintiff’s
counsel has demonstrated mistake and inadvertence in filing the instant FAC,
which does not support a finding of improper purpose or frivolousness. (See
Decl. of Gallagher ¶¶1-4, 12, 13, 17.) 
While Plaintiff’s counsel has used her oppositions to the instant motion
and the demurrer to improperly seek leave to amend defective pleadings, the
Court is not inclined to impose sanctions at this juncture.
 
Conclusion
County’s
motion for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving
party to give notice.
