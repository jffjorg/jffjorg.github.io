 Case Number:  21STCV27071    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT  71   TENTATIVE RULING      MARIA    MIRANDA, et al.,               vs.   PATRICIA    CLEVES CABRERA, et al.     Case No.:  21STCV27071         Hearing    Date:  March 20, 2024      Defendants Lupitas Banquet Hall, Inc.’s,  Patricia Cleves Cabreras’, and Juan Salvador Vasquez’s motion to enforce the Settlement  Agreement is granted. Plaintiffs Maria Miranda’s and Luciano  Miranda’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is denied.             Defendants Lupitas  Banquet Hall, Inc. (“Lupitas”), Patricia Cleves Cabreras (“Cabreras”), and Juan  Salvador Vasquez (“Vasquez”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move for an order  finding the settlement agreement reached with Plaintiffs Maria Miranda  (“Maria”) and Luciano Miranda (“Luciano”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) is  enforceable and requires Plaintiffs to walk-through the settlement at the  Worker’s Compensation Appeals Board (“WCAB”) to have the settlement approved.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2.)           Plaintiffs also  move for an order to enter judgment pursuant to the settlement agreement  entered between the parties for the amount of $138,000.00.  (Notice of Motion Plaintiffs, pg. 2; C.C.P.  §664.6.)             Background           On January 8, 2024,  Plaintiffs and Defendants accepted a mediator’s settlement proposal.  (Decl. of Biggins ¶2,  Exh. A.)  The mediator’s proposal  clearly indicated that Plaintiffs would be releasing all claims against  the defendants.  (Id.) On March 8, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion.  On March 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a late opposition.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has  been filed. On March 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their own motion to enforce  the settlement agreement.  As of the date  of this hearing no opposition has been filed by Defendants.             Motion to Enforce Settlement           Legal Standard C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as  follows: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by  the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for  settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter  judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,  the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement  until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  (C.C.P. §664.6(a).) Disputes regarding the terms  of the settlement (or other disputed facts) may be adjudicated on a C.C.P.  §664.6 motion on the basis of declarations or other evidence.  (Malouf Brothers v. Dixon (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d  280, 284; Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 795-796 [stating court  may resolve reasonable disputes over terms of settlement agreement but may not  modify terms from what was agreed to by parties].)  Any written settlement agreement outside of  court must be signed by the parties or their counsel.  (Gauss v. GAF Corp. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th  1110, 1113 [decided under former version of C.C.P. §664.6].)           Even if not enforceable under C.C.P. §664.6, oral  settlements by counsel alone may be enforceable in separate proceedings: e.g.,  by motion for summary judgment (after amending the pleadings to allege  settlement defense or new cause of action); or in a separate suit in equity.  (See Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10  Cal.4th 578, 586 n.5; Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th  299, 306.)  Such proceedings are governed  by agency principles and require proof that the client expressly authorized the  attorney to settle on the client’s behalf. (Murphy v. Padilla (1996) 42  Cal.App.4th 707, 717.) C.C.P. §664.6 procedures  empower the judge hearing the motion to determine disputed factual issues that  have arisen regarding the settlement agreement and permits the court “to  entertain challenges to the actual terms of the stipulation,” that is, whether  there “actually was” a settlement.  (Fiore  v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566 [stating statute’s express  authorization for trial courts to determine if a settlement occurred is “implicit  authorization” for trial court to determine settlement's terms and conditions].)             Discussion Defendants submitted evidence  Plaintiffs’ attorney signed for Plaintiffs and the settlement agreement expressly  states that email by counsel is sufficient to make the settlement agreement  binding.  (Decl. of Biggins ¶2,  Exh. A at pg. 2.)   The parties agreed the settlement  agreement would be enforceable in accordance with C.C.P. §664.6.  (Decl. of Biggins ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 2.)   Accordingly, Defendants submitted  evidence of the existence of a valid settlement agreement, and Plaintiff is  entitled to an order enforcing the settlement. Defendants submitted evidence  that the settlement agreement includes a provision that requires the release of  all claims, The mediator’s proposal clearly  indicated that Plaintiffs would be releasing “all claims” against the  defendants.  (Decl. of Biggins ¶2, Exh.  A.)  The Court finds that “all claims” means  all claims Plaintiffs have against Defendants, known or unknown, and includes any claims for worker’s  compensation benefits.   The Court denies Defendants’  request to walk through the settlement agreement at the WCAB to have the  settlement approved according to the procedures stated in 8 C.C.R. §10789.  No such order is required.  Defendant is entitled to the relief pursuant  to the settlement, and Plaintiff must obtain it as a prerequisite to Defendant  paying the settlement.   Based on the foregoing, Defendants’  motion to enforce the settlement agreement is granted. Plaintiffs’ motion is denied.   Conclusion Based on the foregoing, Defendants’  motion to enforce the settlement agreement is granted. Plaintiffs’ motion is denied. Defendants to give notice.   Dated:  March  _____, 2024
