And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Miranda, Luciano Miranda, et al. v. Patricia Cleves Cabreras, et al. (Case No. 21STCV27071). The defendants, Lupitas Banquet Hall, Inc., Patricia Cleves Cabreras, and Juan Salvador Vasquez, move to enforce the settlement agreement reached with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, Maria Miranda and Luciano Miranda, also move to enter judgment in the amount of $138,000.00.

The Judge grants the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement, finding that the parties agreed to the terms of the settlement and that the settlement includes a provision for the release of all claims. The Judge also denies the plaintiffs' motion to enter judgment, as the settlement agreement does not require the defendants to pay the settlement amount.

The Judge finds that the settlement agreement is enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §664.6 and that the parties agreed to the terms of the settlement. The Judge also notes that the settlement agreement includes a provision for the release of all claims, including any claims for worker's compensation benefits.

The Judge concludes that the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement is granted, and the plaintiffs' motion is denied. The defendants are entitled to the relief pursuant to the settlement, and the plaintiffs must obtain it as a prerequisite to the defendants paying the settlement.
