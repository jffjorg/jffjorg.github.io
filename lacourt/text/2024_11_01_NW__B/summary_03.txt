And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's motion to issue and seal subpoenas to various parties, including the Los Angeles Police Department, Target Corp., and JC Produce, Inc. The Court finds that the subpoenas are substantially related to the underlying road rage incident and are necessary to the Plaintiff's case. The Court issues and seals the subpoenas to the Los Angeles Police Department, Target Corp., and JC Produce, Inc.

However, the Court denies issuance of the subpoenas to Altagracia Sanguino, Ruben Sanguino, and the Sanguino Living Trust, as they seek to obtain information regarding Defendant Christopher Kevin Ewest's income and assets, which is not relevant to the underlying incident. The Court finds that disclosing personal assets would be contrary to the public interest and would not be consistent with the policy of the law.

The Court's decision is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to respond and the Court has considered the responses.
