BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle
accident. On May 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Evan Pugrad (“Pugrad”), Trenton Hearin
(“Hearin”), and Caroline Draper (“Draper”), filed a Complaint against Defendant
Nancy Martinez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50 alleging a single cause of action
for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On
June 5, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz
sitting in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East effective June 24, 2024. 
 
On September
20, 2024, Hesam Yazdanpanah, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed and served the instant
unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiffs.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Hesam Yazdanpanah, Esq.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., §
284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (CRC Rule
3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (CRC Rule 3.1362(e)).  The
proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (CRC Rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (CRC Rule
3.1362(e).) The Court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to
withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would
prejudice the client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  

 
DISCUSSION
Counsel declares that their office has made multiple
attempts to contact Plaintiffs. (MC-052 Item 2.) Counsel represents that their
office has been unable to make any communication with them. (Ibid.) 
Counsel has filed and served Plaintiffs with the required
documents under CRC Rule 3.1362. Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced by Counsel’s
relief as they have adequate time to find alternative representation.
Therefore, Counsel’s motion to be relieved is granted.
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Hesam Yazdanpanah, Esq. This order will take
effect once Counsel files proof of service of this signed order on Plaintiffs.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
