TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Nicholas Alcantar’s request for
default judgment against Defendants Down and Out Bar; Rudy Alberto Rayo, an
individual; Jennifer Savedra, an individual; Lydia Rodriguez, an individual;
jointly and severally is GRANTED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged
January 26, 2019, assault. Plaintiff Nicholas Alcantar (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that Defendants Rudy Alberto Rayo (“Rayo), Jennifer Savedra (“Savedra”), and
Lydia Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), punched and kicked him while at the Down and Out
Bar, resulting in serious injury to Plaintiff.
 
On January 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging four causes of action: (1) assault; (2) battery; (3)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) negligence.
 
On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On September 20, 2024, all Defendants
entered default. Plaintiff then filed the instant request for default judgment
against all Defendants, jointly and severally.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the total
amount of $12,122.69, representing $9,324.44 in general and special damages and
$2,798.25.
 
Defendants
have failed to timely respond or appear. Plaintiff’s default packet meets all
statutory requirements under CCP § 585. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment against Defendants Down and
Out Bar; Rudy Alberto Rayo, an individual; Jennifer Savedra, an individual;
Lydia Rodriguez, an individual; jointly and severally is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
