Re:                         ZOILA MONROY, et al. vs CITY OF GARDENA, et al. (20STCV46821)¿

 

 
Petitioner Zoila Monroy’s Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor
or a Person with a Disability 
 
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Petitioner Zoila Monroy’s
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle collision in which
Defendants City of Gardena, a municipal corporation (“Gardena”), Brandon Pastre
(“Pastre”), an individual, and Does 1 to 50 (collectively, “Defendants”)
negligently owned, maintained, entrusted, and operated a vehicle in a
distracted manner, causing it to collide with Plaintiffs Zoila Monroy
(“Petitioner”), Genesis Dubon (“Genesis”), and Kelly Dubon (“Kelly”) (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) who were in a vehicle stopped at a red traffic light. As a
result, Plaintiffs suffered injuries. (Complaint ¶¶11-14.)  
 
On December 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an action against
Defendants for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On December 7, 2020, Petitioner Zoila Monroy (“Petitioner”)
filed an application and order for appointment of guardian ad litem for Kelly
Dubon, which was granted. On December 9, 2020, Petitioner filed an application
and order for appointment of guardian ad litem for Genesis Dubon, which was
granted.
 
On October 27, 2023, and November 7, 2023, Petitioner filed
two Petitions to Confirm Minor’s Compromise with Special Needs Trust for Kelly
and Genesis. The Court denied both petitions for medical record and filing
deficiencies, including the failure to file an Order to Deposit Funds Into
Blocked Account (MC-355) for both Claimants.
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
settlement. 
 
On December 18, 2023, Petitioner again filed two Petitions
to Confirm Minor’s Compromise with Special Needs Trust for Kelly and Genesis.
The Court denied both petitions for medical record deficiencies.
 
On September 9, 2024, Petitioner filed the two instant
Petitions for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability for Genesis and
Kelly. Petitioner also filed two corresponding forms MC-355.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner seeks court
approval for a settlement under which Genesis and Kelly would receive $7,500
and $6,000, respectively.
 
Legal Standard
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s
claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500,
3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for
approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no
final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s
guardian ad litem. (Id., at p. 1606.) 
 
Probate Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the
settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the
order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as
follows: 
 
The court
making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part
thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such
reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person.
(Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the
court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd.
(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the
facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except
where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later
events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(2).)
 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner seeks court
approval for a settlement under which Genesis and Kelly would receive $7,500
and $6,000, respectively, out of a total settlement of $87,500. No costs or
attorney’s fees will be deducted from either Claimant’s settlement amounts.
 
Having reviewed the
petitions, the Court finds that the settlement is fair considering the risk of
going to trial and the alleged injuries sustained by Plaintiffs. Petitioner has
satisfied the requirements under CRC 7.950 by disclosing information that bears
upon the reasonableness of the compromise. (Kelly MC-350 Attachment 8; Genesis
MC-350 Attachment 8.) There is no fee agreement between Plaintiffs and Counsel
as Counsel represented Plaintiffs pro bono. (Kelly MC-350 line 13a; Genesis
MC-350 line 13a.) Petitioner’s settlement amount is reasonable given her injuries
were more severe than the minors involved. (Kelly MC-350 Attachment 11(b)(3);
Genesis MC-350 Attachment 11(b)(3).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS the petition to confirm minor’s compromise. Court
to sign orders and set OSC re Deposit into blocked account.
