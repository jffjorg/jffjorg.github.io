And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by Hesam Yazdanpanah, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs in this case. The motion was filed on September 20, 2024, and the court found that the requisite forms and documents were properly served on the clients and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The court determined that the clients will not be prejudiced by the relief, as they have adequate time to find alternative representation. The court's order will take effect once Counsel files proof of service of this signed order on the clients.
