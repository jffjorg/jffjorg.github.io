And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of a compromise of claim or action for minors or persons with a disability and has tentatively ruled in favor of the petition. The petition seeks court approval for a settlement under which Genesis and Kelly would receive $7,500 and $6,000, respectively, out of a total settlement of $87,500. The court has considered the risk of going to trial and the alleged injuries sustained by the plaintiffs and has found that the settlement is fair and reasonable. The court has also considered the requirements under California Rules of Court 7.950 and has determined that the settlement is reasonable given the injuries sustained by the plaintiffs. The court has granted the petition and will sign orders and set an order to show cause (OSC) re deposit into a blocked account.
