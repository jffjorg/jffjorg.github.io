And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of F Gutierrez v. Nekola, granting the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial by 90 days. The reason for the continuance is the unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances. The new trial date will depend on the court's and parties' availability, and discovery and related deadlines will be tied to the new trial date. The judge also finds good cause to re-set the mandatory settlement conference (MSC) date and will confer with the parties to select new MSC, final settlement conference (FSC), and trial dates. The judge notes that the parties may seek to advance the hearing dates on the Motion for Protective Order and Motion to Compel Mediation in Dept. SE-C, if necessary.
