**Case Number:** 20STCV39273
**Hearing Date:** November 8, 2023
**Department:** 14
**Case Filed:** October 13, 2020

**Tentative Ruling:**

Deny motions for judgment on the pleadings.

**DISCUSSION:**

I. Background

The Saddle Ridge Fire litigation involves three groups of plaintiffs: Individual Plaintiffs, Subrogation Plaintiffs, and Public Entity Plaintiffs. All three groups have filed complaints against Southern California Edison (SCE) arising out of the Saddle Ridge Fire.

II. Request for Judicial Notice

The Court grants SCE's request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A, C, D, and E, which are official acts of a California government agency and are subject to judicial notice under Evidence Code ยง452(c). The request is also granted as to Exhibit B, which is part of the Court's record in the Foley case, pursuant to Evidence Code ยง452(d).

III. Claim for Inverse Condemnation

Defendant SCE moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the claims for inverse condemnation alleged by all three groups of Plaintiffs.

A. Legal Standards Governing Claims for Inverse Condemnation

The elements of a claim for inverse condemnation are:

1. Plaintiffs owned the real property.
2. The property was taken or damaged.
3. The cause was a public project.
4. Causation.

Cal. State Automobile Assn. v. City of Palo Alto (2006) 138 Cal. App. 4th 474, 480.

B. Discussion

1. SCE as a Private Corporation vs. a Public Entity

SCE argues that it is not liable as a matter of law for inverse condemnation because it is a private entity and not a public entity. However, the law is to the contrary. In Barham v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 744, the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's judgments in favor of Edison on the inverse condemnation claim, rejecting the finding that there had been no taking for public use. The court concluded that publicly owned electric utilities have been held liable in inverse condemnation in situations virtually identical to the facts in Barham.

2. Damage to Properties as Inescapable or Unavoidable

SCE argues that Plaintiffs cannot allege substantial causation because the damage to their properties was not inescapable or unavoidable. However, the Individual Plaintiffs, Subrogation Plaintiffs, and Public Entity Plaintiffs have all alleged that the private property damage was the "inescapable or unavoidable consequence" of the public improvement.

**Facts:**

* The Saddle Ridge Fire was caused by a massive electrical over-current event along SCE's Gould-Sylmar 220 kilovolt (kV) High Voltage Transmission Circuit in Los Angeles County.
* The event was caused by a failure of the ETS, including but not limited to, a clevis, dampers, and/or jumpers on the SCE Transmission Towers.
* The SCE Transmission Towers were owned, designed, operated, maintained, and controlled by SCE.
* SCE's System Protection setting on the reclosers is a cost-saving choice that avoided SCE having a human inspect the line prior to re-energizing the Gould-Sylmar Circuit.
* SCE deliberately designed the ETS to include the y-clevises on the SCE Fault Tower such that, in the event of equipment failure, the line could drop and make direct contact with the metal-cross arm below.
* SCE deliberately designed the SCE Fire Origin Tower and ETS such that the A, B, and C phase jumper cables on one side of the SCE Fire Origin Tower ("Arc Side") were not prevented from moving and swaying during wind events and could make contact with the SCE Fault Tower.

**Conclusion:**

The Court is not persuaded by SCE's arguments and denies its motions for judgment on the pleadings. The pleadings challenge must be rejected for the reasons set forth above.
