Discussion
 
In 2019, the
California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which took effect
January 1, 2020, and made several significant changes to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1 (“CCP § 340.1”)—the statute of limitations for claims
of childhood sexual abuse.[1] Among other things, the law revives
all claims of childhood sexual abuse not previously litigated to finality for a
3-year period; it extends the SOL for such claims to 22 years after the age of
majority (or age 40); it authorizes treble damages for “cover ups”; and it
retroactively eliminates the protection previously afforded to public school
districts by Government Code section 905, subdivision (m), which provided a
bright-line rule that public entities could not be held liable for abuse claims
arising from conduct occurring prior to January 1, 2009. 
 
The crux of
the District’s argument is that AB 218’s imposition of liability on public
entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed (for failure to
comply with claims presentation requirements) is unconstitutional because it
violates Article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution (“Gift Clause”).
The constitutional provision provides that “[t]he Legislature shall have no
power to give or to lend, or to authorize the giving or lending … in any manner
whatever, for the payment of liabilities of any individual, association,
municipal or other corporation whatever; nor shall it have power to make any
gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money….” (Cal. Const.
Art. XVI, sec. 6.)
 
The term ‘gift’ in the constitutional provision ‘includes
all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or
enforceable claim,’ even if there is a moral or equitable obligation.” (Jordan
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [quoting Conlin
v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, 21-22].) Interpreting this constitutional provision, the
California Supreme Court has stated that “the legislature has no power to
create a liability against the state for any [ ] past act of negligence.”
(Chapman v. State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693.) Doing otherwise “would, in effect, be the making
of a gift.” (Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s failure to
comply with a timely claim presentation would otherwise create liability
for a past act of negligence when none existed because the claims presentation
requirement is a substantive element of the COA against the District. Government Code
section 905 provides that, aside from some exceptions, an action for money or
damages may not be maintained against a public entity unless a written claim
has first been timely presented to the defendant and rejected in whole or in
part. Government Code section 945.4 reinforces that such suits are prohibited
absent compliance with a timely claim presentation, which is to be filed not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code §
911.2 (a).) And case law is clear that timely claim presentation is not merely
a procedural hurdle akin to a statute of limitations but is considered a substantive
element of the claim. (Shirk v. Vista Unified School District (2007) 42
Cal.4th 201, 209 [“Complaints that do not allege facts demonstrating
either that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with the claims
statute is excused are subject to a general demurrer for not stating facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”]; see also Rubenstein
v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 906 [“Compliance
with the claim requirement is a
condition precedent to suing the public entity.”], emphasis added.)

 
Accordingly, prior to AB 218, Plaintiff’s failure to file a timely claim
presentation—again, a substantive element of the claim—would result in no
valid claim against the District. (Hom v. Chico Unified Sch. Dist.
(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 335, 339 [court does not have jurisdiction over a matter
wherein the plaintiff fails to make a timely claim presentation].) 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff heavily relies upon Coats v. New Haven Unified School
District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415. But Coats is inapposite. While Coats
involved a constitutional challenge to Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1, it did
not involve, address, or make any finding whatsoever regarding Article XVI,
section 6 of the California Constitution. As such, the decision has no bearing
on the argument made by the District in this case. (Agnew v. State Bd. of
Equalization [“[i]t is axiomatic … that a decision does not stand for a
proposition not considered by the court.”].) 
 
Therefore, based on the foregoing binding authority, it appears
that the Legislature has indeed overstepped its constitutional authority when
it attempted to impose liability on public entities for past conduct where no
enforceable claim existed, which runs afoul of the Gift Clause. 
 
To the
extent that Plaintiff argues that the public funds are used for a public
purpose such that they are not a gift within the meaning of the Gift Clause,
that argument also fails. (Jordan, supra, 100 Cal.App.4th at p. 450; Opp. p. 7, citing Scott
v. State Bd. of Equalization (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1597.) 
 
“The
determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for
the Legislature to determine and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.” (County of
Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.2d 73, 746, citing County of Alameda v.
Janssen (1940) 16 Cal.2d 276.) That said, an appropriation for an unenforceable
claim serves no public purpose.” (Conlin, supra, 99 Cal.17 at pp.
21-22 [“all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or
enforceable claim” are unconstitutional regardless of whether “a sufficient
motive appears for its appropriation.”].) Put plainly, if the claim is unenforceable, there is no
public purpose as a matter of law. (Jordan, supra, 100
Cal.App.4th at 450 [appropriation beyond the public entity’s “maximum exposure”
serves no public purpose and is a gift of public funds as a matter of law]; see
also (Orange County Foundation v. Irvine Co. (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 195,
200 [“[W[hen state funds are expended pursuant to a settlement agreement in
exchange for the relinquishment of such a claim, no ‘public purpose’ is
achieved. Such an expenditure violates the gift clause.”].) 
 
Accordingly, even
if the public purpose of AB 218 is to ensure that the victims severely
damaged by childhood sexual abuse are able to seek compensation from those
responsible and to increase the availability of the courts for victims of child
sexual abuse, that is inapposite.
 
In sum, the
Legislature by enactment of AB 218 created a liability where one did not
previously exist because the claim presentation requirement is a substantive
element of a claim. And when the Legislature creates a liability where one did
not previously exist, whether the enactment was for a public purpose is
irrelevant because all appropriations of public money for which there is no
statutory or enforceable claim are unconstitutional. (Conlin, supra, 99
Cal.17 at pp. 21-22.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, though the court is sympathetic to Plaintiff’s trauma and the court
is cognizant that the Legislature has the right to excuse claim presentation prospectively,
doing so retroactively and consequently creating liability when
none existed appears to be unconstitutional. Therefore, the motion is GRANTED without
leave to amend.
