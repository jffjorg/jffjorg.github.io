[1] As of October 10, 2023, AB 452 was
passed, which all together eliminates the statute of limitations (SOL)
for sexual assault cases arising after January 1, 2024. The motion, however, is
based upon AB 218. Therefore, any citations to CCP section 340.1 will be as to
the 2020 amendment (not 2023 amendment).
