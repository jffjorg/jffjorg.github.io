[1] Plaintiff’s
objection to the Employee Corrective Action Form attached to Besack’s
declaration on the grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation is DENIED. First,
Plaintiff does not explain how the document is hearsay; thus, without an
explanation, the argument is deemed waived. (Although, the form could be deemed
admissible under the business record exception.) Second, to the extent an
analysis is provided, it is regarding the lack of proper foundation. However, Besack
drafted the document (see Deposition transcript); therefore, Defendants have
demonstrated how the log was prepared. 
 


[2] And in Reply,
Defendants do not provide a definition for sensitive information in this
context. 


[3] Based on Defendants’
citations and not otherwise disputed by Plaintiff, Plaintiff appears to have
been at-will employee.
