And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court grants Costco's motion to compel further responses to deposition subpoena for business records issued to Kaiser National HR Service Center. The court finds that Kaiser's initial response was inadequate and ambiguous, and that the court's order is necessary to ensure compliance with discovery requests. The court orders Kaiser to provide a further response that specifically states whether it has business records responsive to the subpoena, and if it does, to produce them to the defendant.
