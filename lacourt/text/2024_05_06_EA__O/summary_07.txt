And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm) has filed a motion for leave to file a complaint-in-intervention in a case arising from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff, Martin Jaime Gonzalez Moreno, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Samantha MIRANDA DE LEON, for a motor vehicle accident. State Farm, which is the workers' compensation carrier for the plaintiff's employer, seeks to intervene in the action because it has a direct financial interest in the matter. The judge grants the motion, finding that State Farm has an unconditional right to intervene in the action under Labor Code Section 3853.
