And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant. The case involves a lawsuit filed by John Doe against Doe #1 for alleged sexual assault of a minor in 1982. The defendant has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's failure to file a timely claim presentation renders the lawsuit invalid. The plaintiff argues that the defendant is liable for the alleged assault under Assembly Bill 218, which revived claims of childhood sexual abuse. The judge has ruled that the Legislature has overstepped its constitutional authority by imposing liability on public entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed. The judge has granted the defendant's motion without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the claims presentation requirement is a substantive element of the claim.
