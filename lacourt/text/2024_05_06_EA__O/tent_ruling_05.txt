Legal
Standard
 
The scope of
discovery is set by the pleadings, in that for information to be discoverable,
it must be relevant to the subject matter, and reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of relevant, admissible information. (Code of Civ. Proc.
2017.010.) “The scope of discovery is one of reason, logic, and common
sense.” (Lipton v. Sup. Ct. (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 1599, 1612,
quoting Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, supra, at ¶ 8:67, p. 8C–2, italics in original.) 
 
Pursuant to
C.C.P. § 1987.1 and C.C.P. § 2025.480, the court, upon a proper showing, is
authorized to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena and order the
witness to produce the documents requested in the deposition subpoena. (Motion
p. 4.)[2]

 
Like other
type of discovery, if objections are not timely made, the responding party
waives such objections. (Motion p. 5, citing Monarch Health Care v. Superior
Court (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 1282, 1288 [The protection of information
from discovery on the ground that it is privileged ... is waived unless a
specific objection to its disclosure is timely made . . .”]; See also C.C.P. §
2025.460.) 
 
Discussion
 
To obtain
information related to Plaintiff’s damage claims (related to the constructive
discharge COA), on or about November 27, 2023, Costco prepared a Deposition
Subpoena for Business Records and Notice to Consumer to Kaiser National HR
Service Center (hereafter “Kaiser”). The Deposition Subpoena specifically
sought the following records related to Plaintiff: 
 
a. Applications for Employment and Resumes. 
b. Documents reflecting Plaintiff’s dates of Employment. 
c. Documents reflecting the structure of her
compensation. 
d. Any documents reflecting the reason for Plaintiff’s
separation from employment.[3]
 
Kaiser did
respond,[4]
but its response, is “confusing.” (Motion p. 4:1-2; see also Motion p. 5:9-12
[“Defendant is thus left guessing as to whether Kaiser’s response is saying
that the only responsive business record is the one-page document produced or
that other responsive documents are being withheld based on the information
included on page two of the certification.”].) 
 
Here, the court agrees that Kaiser’s response is
inadequate and ambiguous.

 
Kaiser’s
response included a copy of the Deposition Subpoena and Notice to Consumer, two
documents entitled Certification of Records, both dated December 28, 2023, an
invoice, and one responsive document. The one document produced by Kaiser is
entitled “Membership Application Deduction Authorization/COPE Contribution
Authorization.” In the second Certification of Records, Kaiser provides a
general description of Kaiser’s practices concerning subpoenas and its
custodians of records and states that some documents in various categories such
as children’s birth certificates and marriage certificates “may have been
removed from the file,” but those documents are not even subject to the
subpoena. (Motion p. 5.) To the extent that Kaiser does not have the
requested records, the certifications do not comply with Evidence Code section
1561 which requires that Kaiser was to “so state in the affidavit and deliver
the affidavit and those records that are available in one of the manners
provided in Section 1560.” (See Separate Statement p. 4.) 
 
In short,
Kaiser has not provided all the requested documents and nowhere does Kaiser
indicate that they do not have the records. Thus, this court orders Kaiser to
provide a further response that specifically states whether it has business
records responsive to the subpoena, and if it does, to produce them to
Defendant. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, as the requests in the subpoena are clear and concise and no
objection was made to them by Plaintiff or Kaiser and Kaiser’s responses are
not code compliant nor clear, the motion is granted.[5]
