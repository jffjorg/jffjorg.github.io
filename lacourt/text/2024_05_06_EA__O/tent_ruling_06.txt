[1] If a nonparty disobeys a depo subpoena, the subpoenaing party may seek
a court order compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after completion of the deposition record. [CCP § 2025.480(b); see Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127, 67 CR3d 111,
112]. The deposition record is “complete” as of the “date
specified for production” or the date objections are served. It is
irrelevant that some documents might be produced thereafter. [Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011,
1032-1033, 273 CR3d 889, 902-903; see ¶ 8:801.1] Here, the record
was “complete” on 1/17/24 when Kaiser’s response was received. (Although Kaiser
certified its production on December 28, 2023, Defendant did not receive it
until January 17, 2024; see Lynch Decl., Ex. 2.) Thus, as the motion was filed on
March 14, 2024, the motion is timely. 
 


[2] Where the witness whose deposition is sought
is not a party (or a “party-affiliated” witness),
a subpoena must
be served to compel the witness' attendance, testimony, or production of
documents. (Code of Civ. Proc., sections 2020.010(b), 2025.280(b); Terry v.
SLICO (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 352, 357.) There are three types of deposition
subpoenas. Of pertinence here, is the production of business records.

Decl., Ex., 1, p. 10 of 40 of PDF.) 
 


[4] And Kaiser untimely
responded. Responses were due on 12/20/23, but Defendant was required to check
in with Kaiser   before it even provided a status update.
(Motion p. 5.) 


[5] The court requests a
proposed order to be filed.
