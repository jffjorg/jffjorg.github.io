Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment (MSJ) as to all three causes of action (COAs). The first COA for fraud fails because the plaintiff has not pled damages. The second COA for invasion of privacy fails because the intrusion was limited. The third COA for wrongful termination fails because the plaintiff's own evidence concedes that he was demoted, not terminated. The court finds that the defendants' reasons for demoting the plaintiff were legitimate and non-discriminatory. The court also finds that the plaintiff's constructive discharge claim fails because it requires a continuous pattern of aggravated conduct.
