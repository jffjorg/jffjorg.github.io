And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff, Colin Harrigan. The court finds that Defendant has good cause to justify compelling the deposition, as it served a proper notice and made persistent attempts to schedule a date for the deposition, while Plaintiff failed to provide any available dates despite expressing intent to do so. The court also grants Defendant's request for monetary sanctions of $1,347.50, which the court finds reasonable. The court orders Plaintiff to appear for a remote deposition on August 21, 2024, or at a date and time agreed upon by the parties within the next 30 days.
