     CASE NO.:  23AHCV01638
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.

December
   4, 2023




 


 


 



 
          Defendant Jennifer L. Morse
(“Defendant”) moves for a 45-day extension to file a response to the complaint.
The motion was filed on September 18, 2023, but Defendant’s request for a fee
waiver was denied and Defendant failed to pay the required fee of $495. Therefore,
the motion is taken off calendar. And even if the motion were to be heard, it
would be deemed moot, as it has been more than 45 days since Defendant
requested the extension. 
Dated
this 4th
day of December, 2023
