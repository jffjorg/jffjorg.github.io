And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for continuance filed by defendant Jennifer L. Morse. The motion was filed on September 18, 2023, but was taken off calendar due to the defendant's failure to pay the required fee of $495. The defendant's request for a fee waiver was also denied. The judge notes that even if the motion were to be heard, it would be deemed moot since more than 45 days have passed since the defendant requested the extension. The judge advises that parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court, and that if they do not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still argue the matter.
