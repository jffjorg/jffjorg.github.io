And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of staying the action brought by the City of Pasadena against the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Pasadena claims that Caltech released and disposed of contaminants into the soil and groundwater at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) facility, which contaminated Pasadena's drinking water supply wells. Caltech argues that the action should be stayed because it will be more efficiently and justly tried in federal court, where the United States can be joined as a party and the EPA can be compelled to participate in discovery and settlement discussions. The judge has granted Caltech's motion to stay the action for six months to allow the pleadings stage of the Federal Action to conclude. The judge has also set a status conference/trial setting conference for a later date.
