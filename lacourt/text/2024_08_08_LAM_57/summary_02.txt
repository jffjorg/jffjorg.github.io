And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant Southwest Law Group's (SLC) motion for attorney's fees. The motion is denied because it was not timely filed. The time limit for filing a motion for attorney's fees is the same as for a notice of appeal, and SLC's motion was filed more than 180 days after the entry of the January 3, 2024 minute order, which is the appealable order in this case. The Judge notes that the notice of the minute order served on the parties on January 5, 2024, did not trigger the time for appealing and hence the time for filing an attorney's fees motion, because it was not file-stamped or entitled "notice of entry of judgment/order" as specified by Rule 8.104(e). Therefore, the time for appealing and filing an attorney's fees motion was 180 days after entry of the minute order, and SLC's motion was untimely filed on July 17, 2024.
