 Case Number:  BC585918    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant Southwest Law Group's ("SLC") motion for attorney's fees is denied on the ground that it was not timely filed.  The time limit for filing a motion for attorney's fees is the same as for a notice of appeal.  (California Rule of Court 3.1702(b)(1).)  The time limit for filing a notice of appeal is either 60 days after a party's notice of entry of judgment; 60 days after the clerk's notice of entry of judgment, or 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is earliest.  (Rule  8.104(a).)  The term "judgment" in these deadlines refers to any appealable order.  (Rule 8.104 (e).)  Plaintiff Medical Acquisition Company ("MAC") appealed from this Court's January 3, 2024 decision granting SLC's motion to dismiss the action on the ground that MAC failed to bring the action to trial within the time specified in Code of Civil Procedure Section 583.320(a)(1).  That decision was memorialized in an unsigned minute order issued by the Clerk on January 3, 2024.  The minute order did not direct either party to prepare a written dismissal order.  The prevailing rule is that an unsigned dismissal order is not appealable.   (Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577-1578.)   Nevertheless, MACs appeal from the unsigned January 3, 2024 minute order remains pending -- it has not been dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that there is no appealable order.  For present purposes, this Court will treat MAC's appeal as one from an appealable order.On January 5, 2024, the Clerk served notice of the January 3, 2024 minute order on SLC and MAC.  No party served notice of the minute order.  Accordingly, the applicable deadline for MAC to appeal, and thus for SLC to file its motion for attorney's fees, is either 60 days after the Clerk served notice of the minute order or 180 days after entry of the minute order.  The Clerk's notice may not have triggered the time for appealing, and hence the time for filing an attorney's fees motion, because it was neither file stamped nor entitled "notice of entry of judgment/order,  as specified by Rule 8.104(e).  (MSY Trading, Inc. v. Saleen Automotive, Inc. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 395, 401.)  If that is correct, then the time for appealing, and the time for filing an attorney's fees motion, was 180 days after entry of the January 3, 2024 minute order.  MAC's appeal from the January 3, 2024 minute order was timely: it was filed on February 20, 2024.  By contrast, SLC's motion for attorney's fees was untimely.  It was not filed until July 17, 2024.  That date was more than 180 days after the entry of the January 3, 2024 minute order.   Because the attorney's fees motion was not timely filed, the Court is denying the motion. The Court is not reaching the alternative grounds that MAC asserted for denial of the motion: that the motion was not timely served, and that it does not set forth a proper contractual basis for an award of attorney's fees.
