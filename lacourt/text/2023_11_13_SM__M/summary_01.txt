And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the defendant, Mahgerefteh, against the plaintiff, Thanou. The FAC alleges four causes of action: breach of warranty of habitability, promissory fraud, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of contract.

For the first cause of action, the judge finds that the FAC states facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him and that the defendant has had notice of the habitability conditions for a reasonable time after the tenant's discovery. Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED.

For the second cause of action, the judge finds that the FAC does not meet the heightened pleading standard for a fraud claim and that the plaintiff has failed to allege the substance or specifics of the representation. Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.

For the fourth cause of action, the judge finds that the FAC fails to state facts to support the implied covenant claim and that the plaintiff has only generically and ambiguously stated a breach of contract. Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.

The plaintiff has five days to file an amended complaint.
