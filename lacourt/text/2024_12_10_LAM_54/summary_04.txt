And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to compel arbitration and one for leave to amend the complaint. The defendant, Endless Pursuit Corporation, moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff, Michael Gordon, in 2020. The plaintiff, however, opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable against his representative PAGA claims. The judge ruled that the defendant has met its burden to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff has established defenses to enforcement, specifically that representative PAGA claims cannot be compelled to arbitration.

In a separate motion, the plaintiff sought to amend the complaint to conform with his intent to abandon his individual Labor Code claims and proceed solely under PAGA. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that waiver of individual claims would waive the representative claims. However, the judge ruled that this is incorrect under recent case law, specifically Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc. (2024). The judge granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint, finding that it is in the interests of justice to do so.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further review and consideration of the parties' submissions.
