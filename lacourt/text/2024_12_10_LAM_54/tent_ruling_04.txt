BACKGROUND
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff
Michael Gordon filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendant
Endless Pursuit Corporation, alleging representative PAGA claims.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate a
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….”  (CCP §
1281.2.)  The right to compel arbitration
exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a party’s
conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where a
pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the
possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.   (CCP § 1281.2(a)-(c).)  “The party seeking arbitration bears the
burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as
unconscionability.”  (Pinnacle Museum
Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
236.) 
 
A. Existence of Arbitration Agreement
 
Defendant moves to compel arbitration
based on the arbitration agreement executed by Plaintiff on July 21, 2020.
(Decl. Zalazar, Exh. A.) The agreement requires the parties “to arbitrate any and all dispute, claims, or controversies (‘claims’)
they may have against each other, . . . which arise from the employment
relationship between Employee and Employer or the termination thereof.” (Id.) The agreement contains a class
and representative waiver.
 
Defendant has met its burden to
establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. The burden shifts to
Plaintiff to establish any defenses to enforcement.
 
B. Enforceability
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that the
agreement is not enforceable against Plaintiff’s non-individual, representative
PAGA claims. Courts have held that employees cannot be made arbitrate or to
waive representative PAGA claims in arbitration agreements. (See Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana,
596 U.S. 639, 649 (2022); see DeMarinis v. Heritage Bank of Commerce (2023)
98 Cal.App.5th 776, 787; Barrera v. Apple American Group LLC (2023)
95 Cal.App.5th 63, 82 [“…even after Viking River, a contractual
waiver of the right to prosecute PAGA claims is unenforceable as against
California public policy”].)
Plaintiff
also asserts that he will not pursue individual claims that are subject to arbitration.
Plaintiff separately has filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to abandon
his individual Labor Code claims and proceed solely under PAGA.
In
reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot separate his individual and
representative PAGA claims, and the individual claims still must be adjudicated
via arbitration. The Court of Appeal in Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting,
Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 533 addressed this issue and the implications
of Viking River, supra, and the California Supreme Court case Adolph v. Uber (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104,
The inability for an employee to pursue an individual PAGA claim does
not prevent that employee from filing a representative PAGA action. California
courts have consistently held that “ ‘[p]aring away the plaintiff's individual
claims’ ” for one reason or another, “ ‘does not deprive the plaintiff of
standing to pursue representative claims under PAGA.’ ” (Adolph, supra,
14 Cal.5th at p. 1122, 310 Cal.Rptr.3d 668, 532 P.3d 682.)
...
In Viking River Cruises v. Moriana (2022) 596 U.S. 639, 661-664,
142 S.Ct. 1906, 1924-26, 213 L.Ed.2d 179, 200-201 (Viking River), the
United States Supreme Court wrote, “Under PAGA's standing requirement, a
plaintiff can maintain non-individual PAGA claims in an action only by virtue
of also maintaining an individual claim in that action.” (...) “When an
employee's own dispute is pared away from a PAGA action, the employee is no
different from a member of the general public, and PAGA does not allow such
persons to maintain suit.” (Ibid...)
...
The Adolph court concluded that the Viking River
requirement of having to file an individual PAGA cause of action to achieve
standing to file a representative PAGA suit was incorrect. There are only two
requirements for PAGA standing. “The plaintiff must allege that he or she is
(1) ‘someone “who was employed by the alleged violator” ’ and (2) someone ‘
“against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed.” ’ ” (Adolph,
supra, 14 Cal.5th at p. 1120, 310 Cal.Rptr.3d 668, 532 P.3d 682.)
(Id. at 537-8.)
Under
Balderas, Plaintiff may maintain this suit as a representative, rather
than individual, PAGA action. Representative PAGA claims cannot be compelled to
arbitration.
Defendant
also asserts that Plaintiff released his ability to bring representative claims
in the separation agreements executed by Plaintiff after his termination. This
agreement goes to the merits of Plaintiff’s claims rather than whether they
must be arbitrated.
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration is DENIED.

Hearing Date: December 10, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion for Leave to Amend
Moving Party: Plaintiff Michael Gordon 
Responding Party: Defendant Endless Pursuit Corporation
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND IS GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff
Michael Gordon filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendant
Endless Pursuit Corporation, alleging representative PAGA claims.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court may allow, in furtherance of
justice, and “upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars….”  (CCP
§ 473(a)(1).)  A motion to amend a
pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate declaration that
specifies (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (CRC Rule 3.1324(b).)
It is not an abuse of discretion of the court
to grant the motion unless there is a “showing that actual unfairness or
obvious prejudice has resulted from the allowance of such an amendment”.  (Posz v. Burchell (1962) 209
Cal.App.2d 324, 334.)  “Counsel on the
firing line in an actual trial must be prepared for surprises, including
requests for amendments of pleading.”  (Ibid.)  Absent a showing of prejudice, delay alone is
insufficient grounds for denial.  (See
Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 558, 564–65.) 
Plaintiff
seeks to amend the Complaint to conform with Plaintiff’s intent to abandon his
individual Labor Code claims and proceed solely under PAGA, on behalf of the
State of California for all aggrieved employees, including himself and other
aggrieved employees. A comparison of the operative First Amended Complaint and
SAC confirms that the pleadings are materially identical in all other respects.
In opposition, Defendant asserts that waiver of individual claims will waive
the representative claims. As discussed in the Court’s ruling on Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration, this is incorrect under Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 533.
The Court finds that amendment is in the
interests of justice. Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
