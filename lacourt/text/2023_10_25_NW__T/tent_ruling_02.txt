 Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  T  HART V. LASALLE 23VECV01030 All persons are advised of the following:  The court does not appreciate and demands  that all persons stop making personal attacks on each other in the papers.  Specifically, incivility and name calling  will be sanctioned if it continues.  It  must stop now. Your positions are not advanced -- and are even weakened -- by  wasteful time on incivility and name calling. The law is clear: incivility –  including name calling -- is a sanctionable offense.  You are all ordered to stop now. This  includes calling the other side a liar.   It is offensive to the court.  Tentative rulings: To the extent that any responses mention the need for a  protective order, it is the responsibility of the party claiming the need for  the protective order to promptly request it.   No parties may object on the grounds of the need for a protective order  and then take no action.  Such action  could be considered discovery abuse.  If  anyone claims the need for a protective order, a motion shall be filed  forthwith. Plaintiff’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike LaSalle  Defendant’s Joint Verified Answer The complaint was filed 3/8/2023.  The verified answer on behalf of the LaSalle  Defendants was filed on 9/7/2023.   Plaintiff demurred to the verified answer and filed a motion to strike  on 9/15/2023.  The hearing is scheduled  10/25/2023.  The opposition is due 9  court days prior to the hearing which is 10/12/2023.  On 10/6/2023, prior to the due date of the  opposition, the LaSalle Defendants timely filed an amended verified  answer.  Therefore, the demurrer and  motion to strike is moot and will be taken off-calendar.  The operative answer is the amended verified  answer.  Any demurrer or motion to strike  must be directed to the operative answer. Concerning plaintiff's objections to the names used by  defendants in the answer, the court does not control how defendants answer a  complaint.  However, all named defendants  have to respond to the complaint and have to be accounted for by an answer. If  a named defendant does not timely respond to the complaint after proper  service, the plaintiff has the right to seek a default against that named  defendant. Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP Set  1 from Legacy Partners and Sanctions It is almost impossible to discern from the various  pleadings, in some coherent form, what was produced in response to which RFPs  and what the final objections are.  The  court cannot tell if 100 pages were produced or 10,000 pages.  The court cannot tell what pages were  responding to which request.  The produced documents should have been numbered. The court  orders the following from counsel for Legacy Partners: 1. A single verified document which identifies which  numbered pages were produced in response to which requests. 2. Provide the court and plaintiff with a brand new, unused  flash drive with the entire production of documents on it so the court can see  the actual documents produced.  In the  future, all documents shall have unique numbers so they are not duplicated. 3. The court needs a notebook with a copy of each of the  written responses/supplemental responses and the compliance statements.  Do not print the documents, they should be on  the flash drive. This is to be prepared by defense counsel and provided to  the court and plaintiff no later than the close of business on ___________ and  the motion will be continued to ________________.
