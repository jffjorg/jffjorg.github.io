Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Tarzana Health Systems, LLC and Peter Brugetti, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Sharon Lodin, alleges that she was bitten by dogs owned by the defendants. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to plead supportive facts to show that they were the owners of the dogs and that the plaintiff's pleading lacked facts to support the element of knowledge and duty of care.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for strict liability without leave to amend, as the plaintiff failed to plead supportive facts to show that the defendants were the owners of the dogs. The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the first and second causes of action for negligence and premise liability with 20 days leave to amend, as the plaintiff's pleading lacked facts to support the element of duty of care and the element of knowledge.

The Judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the pleading within 20 days to cure the defects in the pleading, but has not given leave to add new causes of action. The ruling is subject to change after further consideration.
