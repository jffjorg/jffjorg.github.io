And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. on December 7, 2023. The court finds that the Cross-Complaint is not compulsory because it does not assert causes of action arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action in the plaintiff's complaint. However, the court grants Mulgrew leave to file its Cross-Complaint, allowing it to seek redress against the plaintiff for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. The court orders that the Cross-Complaint is deemed properly filed and grants Mulgrew leave to file an amended Cross-Complaint. The court also denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the Cross-Complaint as untimely.
