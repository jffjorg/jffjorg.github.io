  Order RE:
 
PLAINTIFF AND CROSS-DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
  STRIKE CROSS-COMPLAINT
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff and cross-defendant David
Maijala
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components,
Inc.
Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint
The court
considered the amended moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and cross-defendant
David Maijala (“Maijala”) moves the court for an order striking the
Cross-Complaint filed by defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft
Components, Inc. (“Mulgrew”) on December 7, 2023 as untimely. 
“If a party does not file a
cross-complaint against its opponent ‘before or at the same time as the answer’
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50, subd. (a)), that party ‘shall obtain leave of
court’ to file one (id., subd. (c)).” 
(Department of Finance v. City of Merced (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th
286, 295.)  
In its opposition, Mulgrew states
that, in the event the court is inclined to grant Maijala’s motion, “Mulgrew
respectfully requests leave to amend, and an opportunity to move the Court for
leave to file a Cross-Complaint.”  (Opp.,
p. 8:15-17.)  Further, in explaining its
delay in filing the Cross-Complaint, Mulgrew has stated that (1) it first had
constructive notice of Maijala’s breach of the parties’ employment agreement on
June 15, 2022, when he produced several thousand of Mulgrew’s documents during
discovery (Opp., p. 2:15-19); (2) actual notice of the facts underlying its
claims did not occur until late 2023 (Opp., p. 3:21-22); and (3) Maijala
admitted, in discovery responses served on January 21, 2024, that he used a USB
drive to remove documents from Mulgrew (Nenni Decl., ¶ 2). 
First, the court finds that Mulgrew’s
Cross-Complaint is not compulsory since it does not assert causes of action
“aris[ing] out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions
or occurrences as the cause[s] of action which [plaintiff Maijala] alleges in
his complaint.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
426.10, subd. (c).)  
To determine whether the
relatedness requirement is met, courts will evaluate whether “the claims
‘involve[] common issues of law and fact,’ an ‘overlap of issues,’ and a common
transaction.  [Citation.]”  (ZF Micro Devices, Inc. v. TAT Capital
Partners, Ltd. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 69, 82.)  Although both Maijala’s Complaint and
Mulgrew’s Cross-Complaint concern Maijala’s employment, Maijala’s Complaint is
based on his allegations that Mulgrew retaliated against him for reporting
violations of law, terminated him without good cause, and caused him emotional
distress (Compl., ¶¶ 55, 62, 70, 74), whereas Mulgrew’s Cross-Complaint is
based on its allegations that Maijala accessed and used Mulgrew’s confidential
information and misappropriated its trade secrets (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 26-27, 36, 40,
45, 47).  Thus, the two pleadings do not
involve common issues of law and fact, an overlap of issues, or a common
transaction.[1] 
Second, the court finds that
Mulgrew has shown that it is “in the interest of justice” to allow it to file
its Cross-Complaint against Maijala (1) because Mulgrew discovered the facts
underlying its claims during discovery in this action, and (2) in order to
allow Mulgrew an opportunity to seek redress against Maijala based on his
alleged misappropriation of Mulgrew’s trade secrets and breach of contract.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50, subd. (c) [“Leave
may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the
action”].)  The court has also considered
that the parties have recently stipulated to continue trial in this action,
which will provide the parties more time to conduct discovery on the claims
alleged in Mulgrew’s Cross-Complaint. 
(April 10, 2024 Stipulation to Continue Trial and Related Dates, ¶¶ 2,
4.)  
Thus, the court (1) exercises
its discretion to grant Mulgrew’s request for leave to allow it to file its
Cross-Complaint, and (2) therefore denies Maijala’s motion to strike Mulgrew’s
Cross-Complaint as untimely.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 428.50, subd. (c), 436.) 
ORDER
            The
court denies plaintiff and cross-defendant David Maijala’s motion to strike
cross-complaint. 
            The
court (1) grants defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components,
Inc. leave to file its Cross-Complaint, and (2) orders that Mulgrew Aircraft
Components, Inc.’s Cross-Complaint filed on December 7, 2023 is deemed properly
filed. 
            The
court orders defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.
to give notice of this ruling.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
