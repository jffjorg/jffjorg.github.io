And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a summary adjudication hearing for a case involving Ventura Paving as the defendant. The judge notes that Ventura Paving is arguing that they do not have a duty to prevent harm to the plaintiff due to the premises liability. The judge finds that Ventura Paving has met its burden on summary adjudication and has shown that they own, possess, or control the property. As a result, the judge does not need to consider Ventura Paving's additional argument that the harm was open and obvious. The judge will make a final decision after considering the arguments and evidence presented.
