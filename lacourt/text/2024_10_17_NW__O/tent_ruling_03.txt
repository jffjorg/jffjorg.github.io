I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of a multi-motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs Marisela Garza (“Garza”)
and Irene Carreto Sandoval (“Sandoval”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege they
were walking on the side of the street when Defendant Briana Martinez
(“Martinez”) negligently drove a vehicle (“Car 1”) through a red light and
collided with Defendant Brian Baker’s (“Baker”) vehicle. (See Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”), ¶¶ 15-17.)
Plaintiffs also allege Defendant Alvin Asuncion Montano (“Montano”) was
involved in the accident. (See id. at ¶ 18.) As a result of these
collisions, Plaintiffs allege “debris [flew] in the air resulting in injuries
to Plaintiffs.” (Id. at ¶ 19.) 
Plaintiffs further allege Defendants Meagan Berberian (“Berberian”) and
Mary Lionetti (“Lionetti”) owned Car 1. (See id. at ¶ 20.)
Montano and Defendant Ma Faith Patricia Ramos (“Ramos”) now move
for determination of good faith settlement. No other party has opposed their
motion.

///  
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 877.6(a)(1)[1],
provides that, on noticed motion, “[a]ny party to an action wherein it is
alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of
a settlement entered into by the plaintiff . . . and one or more alleged
tortfeasors or co-obligors.” “A determination by the court that the settlement
was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from
any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable
comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on
comparative negligence or comparative fault.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc. § 877.6(c).)
Although determination that a settlement was in good faith does not discharge
any other party from liability, “it shall reduce the claims against the others in the
amount stipulated” by the settlement.¿(Id.)¿
If a motion is opposed, the moving party must show
by competent evidence all Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 (“Tech-Bilt”) factors. (See Mediplex of Cal. v.
Superior Court (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 748, 753, fn.4; Greshko v. Los
Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822.) The Tech-Bilt factors are: (1) A
rough approximation of plaintiffs' total recovery and the settlor's
proportionate liability; (2) The amount paid in settlement; (3) A recognition
that a settlor should pay less in settlement than if found liable after a
trial; (4) The allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (5) The
settlor’s financial condition and insurance policy limits, if any; and (6) Evidence
of any collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct between the settlor and the
plaintiffs aimed at making the nonsettling parties pay more than their fair
share. (See Tech-Bilt, 38 Cal.3d at 499.)
Parties challenging the good faith nature of a
settlement agreement have the burden to demonstrate that it lies so far “out of
the ballpark” of the Tech-Bilt factors that it is inconsistent with the
equitable objectives of the statute. (Nutrition Now, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 209, 213-214.)
Where a good-faith settlement is unopposed,
counsel’s bare-bones declaration is sufficient for a good-faith determination. (See
City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.) 
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Montano and
Ramos’ (“Settling Defendants”) uncontested Motion sets forth the background of
the case and the grounds for good faith settlement via the declaration of their
attorney, Christopher Nalbantian (“Nalbantian”). (See Declaration of Christopher
Nalbantian filed September 13, 2024 (“Nalbantian Decl.”).) Because the Motion
is unopposed, the Court need not consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt factors.

Nalbantian
declares the $30,000.00 settlement agreement accounts for the $15,000.00 per
person maximum policy limits of Settling Defendants’ automobile liability
insurance policy with Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company. (See Nalbantian
Decl., ¶¶ 11-12, Ex. G.) Nalbantian declares this settlement was made in good
faith and “is within the ballpark of their proportionate liability based on the
potential liability of the other parties” as Settling Defendants “were 0%
liable for the collision.” (Id. at ¶ 13.) Nalbantian declares Martinez “was
100% liable for Plaintiffs’ damages as she ran a red light which caused the
collision with…[Baker]…who then hit…[Montano’s]…vehicle, who was at a complete
stop at a red traffic light and pushed him into the vehicle that was parked on
Mason Avenue.” (Id. at ¶ 10.) Nalbantian further declares most of Sandoval’s
medical bills were covered by Medi-Cal, Garza’s medical bills were $6,096.11,
and neither Plaintiff is claiming loss of income or earning capacity. (See id.
at ¶¶ 6-9, Exs. A-C, E, F.) Finally, Nalbantian declares Settling Defendants’
policy limits are sufficient to cover and exceed their proportionate share of
Plaintiffs’ damages, that the parties have agreed to bear their own attorney’s
fees and costs, and that the settlement agreement was reached following an
arm’s length negotiation through insurance claims representatives. (See id.
at ¶¶ 15, 17, 20.)
Accordingly,
Settling Defendants have adequately established the settlement was entered into
in good faith and their Motion is GRANTED.
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Settling Defendants’ Motion for Determination of
Good Faith Settlement. 
The Court
will sign the Proposed Order submitted with this Motion.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      ­­­­October 17, 2024
