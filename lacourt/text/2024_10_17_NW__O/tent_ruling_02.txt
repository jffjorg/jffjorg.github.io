[2] The Court notes Ventura
Paving appears to make this argument as to both Plaintiff’s causes of action,
however, the core of its argument focuses on duty in the context of premises

Paving is attempting to negate an element(s) of Plaintiff’s first cause of
action for general negligence, it has not adequately done so here.

found Ventura Paving has met its burden on summary adjudication as to the
threshold premises liability question of whether a party owns, possesses, or
controls a property, the Court finds it unnecessary to address Ventura Paving’s
additional “open and obvious” argument.
