     CASE NO.: 24VECV04335
 
 
ORDER
  DENYING DEFENDANT JUSTIN MASSION’S MOTION TO QUASH
 
 



 
I.              
BACKGROUND
This case
arises out of an unlawful detainer dispute between Plaintiffs Ann and Eugene
Massion, as co-trustees of the Arnold and Selma Massion Intervivos Trust (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) and Defendant Justin Massion (“Defendant”). Plaintiffs allege
Defendant does not have a lease for the property at 4611 N. Louise Ave., Los
Angeles, CA 91316 (“Subject Property”) and was living there while assisting
with his grandmother’s care. (See Complaint at p. 2.) Plaintiffs claim
Defendant failed to vacate the property and interfered with the pending sale of
the property while providing misinformation to the buyer’s representatives. (See
id. at 5.) Plaintiffs contend they served Defendant with a Three Day Notice
to Quit on August 30, 2024, but Defendant has maintained possession of the
home. (See id. at 3, 9-12.) 
Defendant now
seeks to quash Plaintiff’s service of summons for improper service. Defendant filed
the present Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint (“Motion”),
arguing Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the personal jurisdiction requirements. (See
Motion at 3:14-16.)
II.

LEGAL STANDARD
A.            
Motion To Quash 
Code of Civil Procedure § 418.10(a)(1)[1]
provides, “[a] defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead
or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve
and file a notice of motion… [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” A motion to quash must be
granted if the court finds that either (1) there is no basis for exercising
personal jurisdiction over the defendant or (2) service on the defendant was
improper. (See Ziller Elecs. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
1222, 1229.)  
“When a defendant challenges the
court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove . . . the facts requisite to an effective
service.”¿(Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413 (internal quotations omitted).)
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Defendant
moves to quash Plaintiffs’ service of summons. (See Motion.) As an
initial matter, Defendant contends Plaintiffs’ written Opposition should not be
considered until it is filed and served at least a day before the hearing. (See
Motion at 3-4: 18-9.) (See also Rules of Court 3.1327(c).) Plaintiffs
filed their Opposition on October 9, 2024, and served said Opposition on
Defendant by mail. (See Opposition at 11.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 1010.6(a)(1)(D), Plaintiffs properly served Defendant with the
Opposition when it was filed and electronically transmitted to the Court. (See
id.); (See Code of Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(a)(1)(D).)
Plaintiffs
argue Defendant was personally served with the summons and complaint. (See
Opposition at 5: 14-15.) To effectuate service on a residence, the “summons may
be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete
at the time of such delivery.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 415.10.) 
Additionally,
if, by reasonable diligence, the copy of the summons and complaint cannot be
personally delivered to the person to be served, a copy of the summons and
complaint can be left at the person’s dwelling house or usual place of abode,
business, or mailing address “in the presence of a competent member of the
household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address… at least 18 years, of age, who shall be
informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20; see also American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara
(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389 (wherein the court reasoned, “Two or three
attempts to personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualifies
as ‘reasonable diligence.’”).)
Code of Civil
Procedure § 417.10 requires an affidavit of the person making the service
showing time, place, and manner of service and facts, which recites the name of
the person receiving the copy of the summons and complaint. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 417.10.) Additionally, “[a] summons in an action for unlawful
detainer of real property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears
to the satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party
to be served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in any manner specified
in this article other than publication and that: (1) A cause of action exists
against the party upon whom service is to be made or he is a necessary or
proper party to the action; or (2) The party to be served has or claims an
interest in real property in this state that is subject to the jurisdiction of
the court or the relief demanded in the action consists wholly or in part in
excluding such party from any interest in such property.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
415.45.) 
Plaintiffs
bear the burden of proving the service complied with the law. (See Summers
v. MacClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) Here, the Court finds they
have done so. On September 20, 2024, a registered California process server, Danny
J. Heinz (“Mr. Heinz”), waited at the alleged home of Justin Massion’s father
located at 24686 Cordillera Drive, Calabasas, California 91302 (“Cordillera
Property”). (See Opposition at 2: 10-21; see also Ex. 1 at 6-7.)
At 1:00 p.m., Mr. Heinz approached a tall man in his 30s with a ponytail who
drove a white Corvette, who had just arrived at the Cordillera Property and was
the same man Mr. Heinz saw and attempted to speak to when serving a Three-Day
Notice to Quit on August 30, 2024, at the Subject Property. (See
Opposition at 2: 17-25.) Mr. Heinz had previously learned Defendant is a tall
man in his 30s who sometimes puts his hair into a ponytail and drives a white
Corvette. (See id.: 8-9.) Mr. Heinz identified himself as a process
server to Defendant. (See id. at 2-3: 25-1.) He informed him he was
being served with a summons and complaint, along with court documents for
himself and unknown occupants of the Subject Property, but Defendant refused to
take the documents as he walked towards the Cordillera Property door. (See
id.) Mr. Heinz then notified Defendant he was served while walking after
him and dropped the documents on the porch while Defendant was on the porch. (See
id. at 3:1-5; see also Ex. 2 at 8-10.) Mr. Heinz also stated he had
attempted to serve Defendant on multiple occasions between September 12, 2024,
and September 20, 2024, driving by the Subject Property “many times” and the
Cordillera Property seven times, and knocking on the Cordillera Property door
at least three times when he saw the white Corvette in the driveway, but no one
answered. (See id., at 10-16.) Thus, Plaintiffs convincingly argue
Defendant was served because Mr. Heinz also recognized him from previously
posting the Three Day Notice to Quit 
Additionally,
the affidavit of service from Mr. Heinz creates a rebuttable presumption of
proper service under Evidence Code § 647 because Mr. Heinz is a registered California
process server. (See Evid. Code § 647; see also Floveyor Internat.,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.) The Proof of
Personal Service, filed on October 9, 2024, and Mr. Heinz's declaration within
the Opposition both attest to and comply with Code Civ. Proc. § 415.10 because
a copy of the summons and complaint were placed on the porch where Defendant
was after Defendant refused to accept the documents, and Mr. Heinz identified
himself as a process server informing Defendant he was served. (See
Proof of Personal Service; see Opposition at 2-3:22-5.) The signed
declaration of Mr. Heinz complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 417.10
as it included the showing time being 1:00 p.m., the place being the Subject
and Cordillera Properties, and manner of service and facts reciting Defendant’s
name receiving the copy of the summons and complaint as it was dropped where
the Defendant was after he refused to accept the documents. (See id. at
2-3: 3-8.) 
Defendant,
who filed his Motion before Plaintiffs filed their Proof of Personal Service, claims
Plaintiffs “only” posted the summons and complaint amounting to a failure to
perform service and cites actual notice as an insufficient substitute for
service. (See Motion at 3: 2-4, 10-16.) He has not filed a Reply. As a
result, Defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption
created by Evid. Code § 647. Therefore, Plaintiffs have met their burden in
proving personal service was effectuated, establishing jurisdiction for
purposes of the present Motion. 
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Quash. Defendant has 10 days
to file a responsive pleading pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(c).
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 17, 2024
