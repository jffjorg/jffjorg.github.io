And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Case Summary**

The court is considering a demurrer to the First Amended Petition filed by the Real Parties-in-Interest (RPIs) in a case between Jeffrey Prang, the Los Angeles County Assessor, and AAB, et al. The petition seeks a writ of mandate to reverse the Board's finding that the Petitioner was bound by, and the Board was without authority to reconsider, the Petitioner's value recommendation of $3,774,000 for the Subject Property.

**Tentative Ruling**

The court grants the demurrer to the First Amended Petition as to the section 1094.5 writ claim, as the petition was untimely filed. The court also sustains the demurrer to the section 1615 claim, as Section 1615 does not provide an affirmative cause of action or relief. The court overrules the demurrer as to the section 1085 writ claim. The court notes that the petition was filed within the 6-month time limit under Rev. & Tax. Code section 1615 and that the RPIs fail to demonstrate that the section 1085 writ would be time-barred.
