Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and
upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Central Realty Advisors Inc. (CRA) demurs to all causes of
action, and moves to strike punitive damages allegations contained in Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint (FAC). 
 
Demurrer
 
CRA argues that there are no specific and substantive allegations against
CRA, such that all causes of action against it are uncertain/ambiguous. The FAC
makes no specific allegations of wrongful acts by CRA directly. CRA notes that
many of the causes are only viable against landlords, and it was not an alleged
owner of the subject property. Instead, the FAC apparently seeks to impose
liability against CRA as an alleged co-conspirator with the other co-defendants
to harass and drive Plaintiff out of her rent-controlled apartment. (FAC ¶ 2.) Thus,
to establish the pled causes of action against CRA, Plaintiff needs to
establish sufficient facts to support conspiracy liability against CRA.
 
Conspiracy
liability is a theory of co-equal liability under which certain defendants may
be held liable for an independent civil wrong committed by others. (Navarette
v. Meyer (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1277.)  “Conspiracy
is not a cause of action, but a legal doctrine that imposes liability on
persons who, although not actually committing a tort themselves, share with the
immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration . . .
Standing alone, a conspiracy does no harm and engenders no tort liability. It
must be activated by the commission of an actual tort. A civil conspiracy,
however atrocious, does not per se give rise to a cause of action unless a
civil wrong has been committed resulting in damage.” (Applied Equipment
Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 510-11 [internal
citations and quotations marks omitted].) 
 
“To allege a conspiracy, a
plaintiff must plead: ‘(1) formation and operation of the conspiracy and (2)
damage resulting to plaintiff (3) from a wrongful act done in furtherance of
the common design.’ [Citation.]” (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing,
Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1173.) “It is not enough that the
[conspirators] knew of an intended wrongful act, they must agree—expressly or
tacitly—to achieve it.” (AREI II Cases¿(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1004,
1022.) A conspirator’s agreement to the conspiracy “may be inferred from the
character of the acts done, the relations of the parties, the interest of the
alleged conspirators, and other circumstances.” (Id. at 1024.) “[A]
complaint is sufficient if it apprises the defendant of the ‘character and type
of facts and circumstances upon which she was relying to establish the
conspiracy.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at 1022.) 
 
Agents and employees of a corporation cannot be liable for conspiracy
when acting in their official capacities on behalf of the corporation. (Applied,
supra, 7 Cal.4th at 512 n.4.) “‘[I]t is basic in the law of conspiracy that
you must have two persons or entities to have a conspiracy.  A corporation cannot conspire with itself any
more than a private individual can, and it is the general rule that the acts of
the agent are the acts of the corporation . . ..’”  (Black v. Bank of America (1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 1, 6, quoting Kerr v. Rose (1990) 216 Cal.App.3d 1551,
1564.)  “To hold that a subordinate
employee of a corporation can be liable for conspiring with the corporate
principal would destroy what has heretofore been the settled rule that a corporation
cannot conspire with itself.”  (Id.)

 
The FAC fails to allege sufficiently the circumstances and facts upon
which conspiracy liability is sought against CRA. The FAC alleges that all Defendants
conspired and agreed to acquire several rent-controlled properties, including
the subject property, with the common purpose of removing “rent-controlled”
tenants and raising the rents to market rates. (FAC ¶ 40.) Each defendant
alleged knew of the scheme and their acts and omissions alleged were in
furtherance of this scheme. (¶ 41.) Defendant David Duel secured the services
of a real estate brokerage, Kimberly Roberts Stepp, and her agency, R&LS
Investments, Inc., to create the backdrop of a pending sale intended to be used
as an artifice to begin the process of unlawfully removing Plaintiff prior to
the sale. (¶ 42.) In May 2019, Plaintiff received several telephone calls from
Defendant Terry Polesie, notifying her that the subject property was to be
sold, and that Plaintiff was required by law to vacate her rent-controlled unit
immediately. (¶ 47.) Starting at this time, Plaintiff was subjected to
unannounced entries into her unit by unspecified defendants that were not
related to repairs or services. (¶ 48.) After refusing to vacate, Plaintiff
began receiving relentless harassment and threats from unspecified Defendants.
(¶ 49.) In May 2019, Defendant Ilana Yamtoobian contacted Plaintiff and fraudulently
held herself out as an “independent mediator” attempting to help Plaintiff negotiate
a buyout which she represented would be of tremendous financial benefit to her.
(¶ 50.) As a result of this harassment and pressure, Plaintiff involuntarily
relinquished possession of her unit on June 4, 2019. (¶ 51.)
 
            The FAC does not establish that Duel,
Stepp, R&LS, Polesie or Yamtoobian were agents of CRA. The FAC only
establishes that Defendant Rebecca Duel was the agent/principal of CRA. (FAC ¶
17.) Thus, CRA’s liability is dependent on Ms. Duel’s acts in furtherance of
the conspiracy. As to Ms. Duel, the FAC alleges she fraudulently misrepresented
that Plaintiff was required by law to vacate her unit and demanded that
Plaintiff immediately vacate the unit. (¶ 49.) While Ms. Duel allegedly made misrepresentations
in furtherance of the conspiracy, the FAC fails to plead those misrepresentations
with the increased specificity required to support liability on a fraud-based
cause of action. The FAC does not allege the when, where and by what means of
the misrepresentations. (See Cansino v.
Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469 [“The particularity
demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and
by what means the representations were tendered.”]; Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 878 [for a
corporate defendant, plaintiff must also allege the names of the persons who
made the allegedly fraudulent representations and their authority to speak on
behalf of the corporate defendant].) Without such allegations, the FAC does not
establish CRA’s liability for conspiracy based on the fraud.
 
Accordingly, CRA’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. The
motion to strike is moot per the ruling on demurrer. Leave to amend will be
granted following consideration of the other demurrers/motions to strike on calendar.  There are four other hearing dates for demurrers
with motions to strike scheduled for May 7, 2024 (Terry Polesie and Surf Realty
Corp.), May 15, 2024 (David Duel, Rebecca Duel, Ilana Yamtoobian, Raffi
Shirinian, Urban Blox LLC, S Bonita One, IY EK Partners LLC, 27 Ozone LLC,
Urban Developer LLC, Thornton Property One, Nourafshan Venice Properties LLC),
May 21, 2024 (RIF Investments-2 LLC and David Nourafshan), and July 24, 2024 (Stepp
Commercial and Kimberly Roberts Stepp).  In
the interest of judicial economy, the Court shall hear all four demurrers on
May 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  In addition,
the Court advances the Case Management Conference to May 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
