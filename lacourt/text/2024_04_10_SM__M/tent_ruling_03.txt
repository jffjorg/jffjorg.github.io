“A motion to remove a mechanic’s lien is
recognized as a device that allows the property owner to obtain speedy relief
from an unjustified lien or a lien of an unjustified amount without waiting for
trial on the action to foreclose the lien. [Citation.] The inquiry upon such
motion is likewise limited to the ‘probable validity’ of the lien. [Citation.]
However, unlike the grant of a motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens, the
grant of a motion to remove a mechanic’s lien is essentially a judgment on the
underlying foreclosure action that no lien exists—a judgment that, upon
recordation, removes the lien from the public records. [Citation.]¿And,
that judgment is a final, appealable judgment for which writ relief would
ordinarily be denied. (Howard S. Wright Construction Co. v. Superior Court
(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 314, 318.) 
 
Analysis
 
Petitioner 702 N. Crescent LLC moves to expunge a
mechanics lien recorded against 702 N. Crescent Drive, Beverly Hills, California
90210 (the “Subject Property”).  Civil Code
section 3118 states that “[a]ny person who shall willfully include in
his claim of lien labor, services, equipment, or materials not furnished for
the property described in such claim shall thereby forfeit his lien.” 
 
The petition provides the following verified facts. On
January 25, 2024, Respondent Ortiz caused a Claim of Mechanic’s Lien to be
recorded against the Crescent Property, Instrument No. 202400560412, in the
Official Records of Los Angeles County, California (the “Ortiz Lien”). (Pet. ¶
6.) The lien claimed $9,500,000.00 for cleaning services labor, services,
equipment, or materials, paint labor, and business consulting labor furnished
by Respondent for work done on the Crescent Property. (Id., Ex. A.) Petitioner
verifies that it has no knowledge of or ever heard of Ortiz, and never hired
Ortiz to provide labor, services, equipment, or furnish materials for work on
the Crescent Property. (¶ 7.) Such services were never provided nor performed.
(¶ 8.) 
 
Based on the verified, undisputed
facts, Respondent included claims for labor services, equipment and materials
which were not furnished for the Subject Property. Therefore, Petitioner
demonstrates that Respondent has forfeited any lien against the Subject
Property.
 
Accordingly, the petition is
GRANTED.
