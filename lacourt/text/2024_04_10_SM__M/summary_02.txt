Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by Central Realty Advisors Inc. (CRA) to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Campolo. CRA argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against it. The court agrees with CRA and sustains its demurrer. The court finds that the complaint fails to plead the when, where, and by what means of the misrepresentations made by CRA. The court also finds that the complaint fails to establish that CRA is liable for conspiracy. The court grants CRA's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations from the complaint. The court sets a hearing date for May 7, 2024, to hear all four demurrers and motions to strike.
