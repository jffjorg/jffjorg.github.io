And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (Defendant) against Michelle Dopak (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff has alleged sexual harassment and claims accrued after March 3, 2022, when the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act was enacted. The Defendant argues that the arbitration agreement signed by the Plaintiff is valid and enforceable, and that the Plaintiff's claims are arbitrable.

The judge concludes that only the Plaintiff's first cause of action for sexual harassment is non-arbitrable, and that the Plaintiff must arbitrate her other claims. The judge also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the Defendant did not waive the right to compel arbitration.

The judge orders that the Plaintiff must arbitrate her claims, except for the first cause of action for sexual harassment, which is stayed pending arbitration of the Plaintiff's other claims. The judge also orders that the Defendant provide notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
