And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiff Noureen Entertainment, Inc. against Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company. The Defendant moves to strike the prayer for punitive damages, alleging that Plaintiff has failed to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The judge grants the motion to strike, finding that Plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts to support its conclusory allegations of fraud, malice, or oppression. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for leave to amend, as Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to cure the defect in its pleading but has failed to do so. However, the judge leaves open the possibility of a motion for leave to amend if Plaintiff uncovers evidence to support a claim for punitive damages.
