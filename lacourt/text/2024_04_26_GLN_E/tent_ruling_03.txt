TENTATIVE
RULING – COMPEL RESPONSES
PRELIMINARY
Plaintiffs, Hairun Investment, Inc. and Yuke Hou filed a
Complaint against Yi Wang, Lei Zhang, and Hedi Wang on 06/21/2023. 
 
On 7/11/2023,
Plaintiffs Hairun Investment, Inc. and Yuke Hou filed an ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order. On 7/13/2023, the ex parte application was
granted in part.
 
On 8/2/2023, the
Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction was denied, and the temporary
restraining order issued on 7/13/2023 was dissolved.
 
Yi Wang filed an
Answer to the Complaint on 08/14/2023. Further, on 08/14/2023, Yi Wang filed a
Cross-Complaint against Hairun Investment, Inc. and Yuke Hou.
 
On 2/2/2024,
Cross-Defendants’ (Hairun Investment, Inc. and Yuke Hou) motion to set
aside/vacate default of the Cross-Complaint was granted.
 
In the 2/28/2024
Minute Order, the Court noted that “Stephan Thomas was relieved as counsel of
record and will no longer represent Hairun Investment or Yuke Hou.” (Min. Order
2/28/2024, p.1)
 
On 3/15/2024,
this Court called for hearing Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Yi Wang’s (Movant)
motion for an order compelling responses to Judicial Counsel Interrogatories,
Set One.
 
Of particular
importance is the fact that in the 3/15/2024 Minute Order the Court noted that
the motion on calendar pertained only to Judicial Counsel Interrogatories
served on Plaintiff on November 13, 2023. Based on the Tentative Ruling section
on page 4 of the 3/15/2024 Minute Order, it appears as if the Court was under
the impression that only one motion was filed. Much to the Court’s surprise,
when reviewing the Court’s file for the instant hearing on 4/26/2024, the Court
noticed there were 4 different motions filed on 2/13/2024 all set for
3/15/2024. 
 
It does not
appear as if any party brought this issue up to the Court, i.e., that despite
Movant filed several motions set for 3/15/2024, the Court only called one
motion for hearing on that date.
 
The Court likely
did not see that Movant filed several motions on 2/13/2024 all set for
3/15/2024 based on Movant’s manipulation of the Court Reservation System. When
the Court viewed the single motion scheduled for 3/15/2024, it likely matched
up the court reservation ID attached to the motion with the CRS # on eCourt
with the 3/15/2024 hearing date. The Court was unaware that what Movant did was
file four motions on 2/13/2024, all set for a hearing date of 3/15/2024, and
used the same reservation ID for all motions that it filed, which
resulted in only one hearing being scheduled. This caused there to be only one
hearing scheduled on calendar despite the fact that Movant filed several
motions.
 
When the Court
called one motion on calendar on 3/15/2024, part of the Court’s tentative ruling
was that “Motion to Compel may be re-served; same reservation for next
hearing.” (3/15/2024 Min. Order, p. 6.) Despite the fact that the tentative
only refers to one motion to compel that may be re-served, likely because the
Court was completely unaware that there were several motions filed with a
hearing date of 3/15/2024, Movant now re-filed and re-served several motions
using the same court reservation ID for three motions it indicates having a
hearing date of 4/26/2024. Based on the 3/15/2024 Minute Order not addressing the
issue that several motions were filed for a hearing date of 3/15/2024, the
Court is guessing that the parties did not bring up the issue that several
motions were filed using the same court reservation ID, and
thus only a single hearing being scheduled for 3/15/2024.
 
Whatever the case
may be, Movant continues to abuse the court reservation system by using a
single court reservation ID for several motions, and thus reserving only one
hearing despite the fact that Movant has filed three motions.
Movant
now has filed three motions, despite the fact that Movant only scheduled one motion
hearing for 4/26/2024. Movant should have scheduled three hearings for
4/26/2024 since it filed three motions. Instead, Movant only has one hearing
scheduled. Using a singular reservation ID for several motions results in there
being only one hearing scheduled, despite the fact that Movant intends for several
motions to be heard. This manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly
jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, scheduling one hearing date by using
one Reservation ID for several motions avoids payment of separate filing fees
for each motion that the Court is entitled to otherwise collect. “[P]ayment of
filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.”  (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999)
70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.) 


If Movant/Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Yi Wang, wants all
three motions to be heard, it can pay the two additional filing fees to the
Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the additional two filing
fees before the hearing.

 
Further, the
Court also stated in the 3/15/2024 Minute Order:
 
Yuke Hou is
present in court without counsel requesting continuance to hire an attorney and
for a Mandarin interpreter.
 
Mandarin
interpreter is ordered for the next court date.
 
Court orders
Hairun Investment to appear with counsel on the next court date.
 
(Min. Order
3/15/2024, p. 6.)

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP §2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP
§2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404

Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
LEGAL STANDARD –REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
“Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared, unless on motion of the requesting party
the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
responding party the court has extended the time for response.” (CCP
§2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010). (CCP §2033.280(b).) 
Further, “If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2033.280(a).)
“The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP §2033.280(c).)
LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP 2030.260(a).)
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (CCP §2030.290(b).)
“The
party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP

a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to

TENTATIVE
RULING 
If Movant/Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Yi Wang,
wants all three motions to be heard, Movant can pay the two additional filing
fees to the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the
additional two filing fees before the hearing.
 
Movant
now has filed three motions, despite the fact that Movant only scheduled one
motion hearing for 4/26/2024. Movant should have scheduled three hearings for
4/26/2024 since it filed three motions. Instead, Movant only has one hearing
scheduled. Using a singular reservation ID for several motions results in there
only being one hearing scheduled, despite the fact that Movant intends for
several motions to be heard. This manipulates the Court Reservation System and
unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, scheduling one hearing date
by using one Reservation ID for several motions avoids payment of separate
filing fees for each motion that the Court is entitled to otherwise collect.
“[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.”  (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999)
70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.) 

As
to the merits of the three motions, Movant served Requests for Admission, Set
One, Judicial Counsel Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production, Set
One, on Plaintiff Yuke Hou on November 13, 2023. On December 19, 2023, Movant
emailed Plaintiff to inform them that responses had not been received and that
objections had been waived. Further, Movant granted Plaintiff an extension to
respond until January 5, 2024. On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff emailed Movant
requesting another extension to respond, and Plaintiff acknowledged that objections
were waived. On January 8, 2024, Defendant agreed to Plaintiff’s request and
allowed Plaintiff to submit responses on January 17, 2024 without objections.
As of the date of Movant’s counsel’s declaration non March 15, 2024, counsel
still had not received responses.
The
instant 3 motions were filed on 3/18/2024. In Opposition, Opposition notes how
it provided verified responses to the RFAs, Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production at issue. Further, Opposition attached as Exhibits 7, 8, and 9 the
responses with verifications as to the instant discovery. 
Therefore,
the Court finds Opposition’s argument availing that the motions to compel are moot
as to compelling responses. However, the Court notes that the issue of
sanctions is not moot.
To
the extent that Reply brings up issues with the responses, motion(s) to compel
further responses is not currently before the Court; therefore, the Court finds
the Reply’s arguments unavailing. 
Further,
the Reply’s argument that the Opposition was untimely is unavailing. Reply fails
to read 1010.6(a)(3)(A) which states, “If a document may be served by mail,
express mail, overnight delivery, or facsimile transmission, electronic service
of that document is deemed complete at the time of the electronic transmission
of the document or at the time that the electronic notification of service of
the document is sent.”
Reply’s
argument about 1010.6(a)(3)(B) is cited out of context. 
Further,
the Court points the Reply to CCP §1005(b) which states, “All papers opposing a
motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party
at least nine court days, and all reply papers at least five court days before
the hearing.” 
Additionally,
“Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all papers opposing a
motion and all reply papers shall be served by personal delivery, facsimile
transmission, express mail, or other means consistent with Sections 1010, 1011,
1012, and 1013, and reasonably calculated to ensure delivery to the other party
or parties not later than the close of the next business day after the time the
opposing papers or reply papers, as applicable, are filed.” (CCP §1005(c).)
Here,
the Opposition was timely served 9 court days before the April 26, 2024 hearing
via electronic transmission.
Movant’s
three motions to compel responses are DENIED as moot if Movant pays filing fees
and the Court hears these motions. If these motions are heard, the issue of
sanctions is not moot.

Sanctions - Inspection Demands
In relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2031.300(c).)
 
Sanctions –
Requests for Admission
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP §2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions – Interrogatories
CCP
§2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2030.290(c).)



Sanctions Ruling
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
As to Opposition’s
argument that sanctions are discretionary with respect to RFAs, Opposition’s
argument is unavailing. CCP §2033.280(c) states that sanctions are mandatory.
Further, Opposition’s case that it cited does not stand for the argument that
it alleges it stands for. In the case cited by Opposition, responses to the
RFAs were served before the motion was filed. Here, responses to the discovery
were not served until after the filing of the motions.
 
For each of the
three motions, Movant requests sanctions be imposed against Plaintiff Yuke Hou
in the amount of $1,285.00.
 
Movant’s counsel,
Fields, states for each motion: I have been practicing law since 1981. The
billing rate for this client is $350.00 per hour. The law office of Fei Pang
and I spent over (2.5) hours to review, research and in prepare this Motion and
(1) hour is anticipated to appear in Court, all of which has been or will be
billed to the client. $60.00 is the cost of filing this motion. Hence attorneys
fees and costs total $1,285.00. (Fields Decl. ¶5.)
 
Opposition argues
that sanctions should not be imposed against Plaintiff Yuke Hou because it was
the responsibility of Plaintiff’s former counsel to provide timely responses.
The Hou declaration at ¶13 states that he made available all the documents
attached to his declaration and does not understand why his prior attorney did
not answer the discovery. Opposition also argues that if the Court imposes
sanctions, it should impost them on prior counsel, the Thomas Business Law
Group because it was the responsibility of former counsel to provide timely
response. 
 
Here, the Court
does not find Opposition’s argument availing that sanctions should not be
imposed because of the prior attorney’s fault.
 
Further, the Court
notes that Opposition filed a document titled “NOTICE TO THOMAS BUSINESS LAW
GROUP, P.C., THAT YUKE HOU IS SEEKING AN ORDER THAT THE COURT IMPOSE SANCTIONS,
IF ANY, AGAINST YOU FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE DISCOVERY RESPONSES.”
 
This document
states that Yuke Hou and his attorney of record are seeking an order that in
the event the pending motions to compel made by Defendants result in sanctions,
the sanctions be payable by Thomas Law Group.
 
Here, the Court is
unclear as to what Opposition thinks this document is or what Opposition thinks
this document achieves. This document provides no legal authority. To the
extent that Opposition believes that this is some form of motion that is to be
heard on April 26, 2024, it is not. It does not comply with any of the notice
requirements for a noticed motion under 1005(b).
 
The Court will
hear from the parties regarding sanctions.
