TENTATIVE
RULING– MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT ON SISTER_STATE JUDGMENT
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Defendant, Mkrtych Oganyan (erroneously sued as Michael
Oganyan) moves this Court for an order vacating and setting aside Judgment on
Sister-State Judgment entered on December 14, 2023, and recalling and quashing
any Writs of Execution or Abstracts of Judgment issued thereunder.
 
Defendant brings this motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1710.40(a)-(b) on the grounds that Defendant Mkrtych was never served
with the summons and complaint for the underlying action, thus the Texas Court
never acquired personal jurisdiction over Defendant Mkrtych; Code of Civil
Procedure §473(d); Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., (1988) 485 US 80, on
the grounds that Plaintiff filed a false Proof of Service of Summons in the

BACKGROUND
In the underlying action
(Texas Suit), Plaintiff Crest Foods, Inc. filed suit against Defendants Ohanyan
LLC and Mkrtych in the action Crest Foods as Trustee for the Starlight Crest
Foods, Inc. v. Ohanyan LLC and Michael Oganyan, Cause No. DC-23-05332, in
the 192nd Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas on April 24, 2023. 
 
On August 14, 2023, the
Texas Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment based on Defendants
failing to file a timely answer.
 
Based on the default
judgment entered in the Texas Court (sister state), Plaintiff filed an
Application for Entry of Judgment on Sister-State Judgment in this Court
against Defendants on 12/14/2023. Judgment was entered in this Court on
12/14/2023. The Notice of Entry of Judgment on Sister-State Judgment indicates
that title of the case and case number in the sister-state is Ohanyan LLC; and
Michael Oganyan, Case No. DC-23-05332.
 
Defendant Mkrtych
(erroneously sued as Michael Oganyan) now brings this motion under CCP §1710.40(a)-(b)
on the grounds that Mkrtych was never served with the summons and complaint in
the sister-state action of Texas, thus the Texas Court never acquired personal
jurisdiction over Defendant Mkrtych.
 
ANALYSIS
Timeliness
As
a preliminary matter, Plaintiff’s Opposition does not oppose the timeliness of
this motion.
“Not later than 30 days after service of notice of
entry of judgment pursuant to Section 1710.30, proof of which has been made in
the manner provided by Article 5 (commencing with Section 417.10) of Chapter 4
of Title 5 of Part 2, the judgment debtor, on written notice to the judgment
creditor, may make a motion to vacate the judgment under this section.” (CCP
§1710.40(b).)
The Court will not analyze Defendant’s argument as to
why the instant motion is timely under the reasoning set forth in Defendant’s
motion. Analyzing Defendant’s argument as to the timeliness issue would be far
more complicated than it needs to be. Defendant’s argument seems to miss the
mark and overcomplicates the issue.
Plaintiff filed a proof of service on 1/26/2024 that
indicated that Mkrtych was served with the notice of entry of judgment on
sister-state judgment on 1/6/2024. The instant motion was made on 1/25/2024;
therefore, this motion is timely.
To the extent that Defendant argued he was served the
notice of entry of judgment on sister-state judgment in this case on or about
December 27, 2023, this appears to be contrary to the proofs of service filed
by Plaintiff. “[T]he statute explicitly states that the 30-day period for
bringing the motion commences with service of the notice of the sister
state judgment. Contrary to Tsako’s contention, section 1710.40 did not require
Juniper to file its motion to vacate within 30 days of learning of the
judgment.” (Tsakos Shipping & Trading, S.A. v. Juniper Garden
Town Homes, Ltd. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 74, 84.)
CCP § 1710.40(a)
“A
judgment entered pursuant to this chapter may be vacated on any ground which
would be a defense to an action in this state on the sister state judgment,
including the ground that the amount of interest accrued on the sister state
judgment and included in the judgment entered pursuant to this chapter is
incorrect.” (CCP § 1710.40(a).)
“The party moving under section 1710.40 to set aside
the sister state judgment has the burden to show by a preponderance of the
evidence why it was entitled to relief.” (Conseco Marketing, LLC v. IFA
& Ins. Services, Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831, 841.)
Casey helps further
explain the defenses that may be asserted under § 1710.40:
The defenses that may be
asserted in a motion to vacate under section 1710.40 are not well
defined. The Act itself does not specify the available defenses. However,
the Law Revision Commission's comment to section 1710.40 lists certain
“[c]ommon” defenses. It states: “Common defenses to enforcement of a sister
state judgment include the following: the judgment is not final and
unconditional (where finality means that no further action by the court
rendering the judgment is necessary to resolve the matter litigated); the
judgment was obtained by extrinsic fraud; the judgment was rendered in excess
of jurisdiction; the judgment is not enforceable in the state of rendition; the
plaintiff is guilty of misconduct; the judgment has already been paid;
suit on the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations in the state where
enforcement is sought.” (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 20 West's Ann.
Code Civ. Proc. (2007 ed.) foll. § 1710.40, p. 385; see Traci &
Marx Co. v. Legal Options, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 155, 158–159,
23 Cal.Rptr.3d 685 (Traci & Marx).)
(Casey
v. Hill (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 937, 976.)
“The party moving under
section 1710.40 to set aside the sister state judgment has the burden to show
by a preponderance of the evidence why it was entitled to relief.” (Conseco
Marketing, LLC v. IFA & Ins. Services, Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831,
841.)
Judgment Rendered in Excess of Jurisdiction
Defendant
moves to vacate the judgment by arguing the judgment was rendered in excess of
jurisdiction. 
Defendant argues that the Texas Court did not have
personal jurisdiction over him because he did not receive service of process in
the Texas Court for the underlying sister-state action. 
“[I]f the movant proves service of process in the
sister state action was not made or was defective, this burden has been met.
Under these circumstances, the sister state judgment is void for lack of
fundamental jurisdiction and therefore unenforceable in California.” (Conseco
Marketing, LLC v. IFA & Ins. Services, Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831,
841.
Specifically, Defendant argues:
Here, on the date of the
alleged substitute service in the First Suit, Defendant Mkrtych was not
residing at the 1243 Vista Court service address. Defendant Mkrtych does not
have a brother named "Adam" that resided at the address. Also,
Defendant Mkrtych did not receive the actual notice of entry of judgment on
sister-state judgment until December 27, 2023 in the present case-while he was
in Nevada. 
Defendant Mkrtych then,
has grounds to move to vacate the Judgment on Sister-State Judgment because he
never received service of process in the First Suit as a result of extrinsic
fraud upon the Texas Court. He has been sued as Michael Oganyan-not as Mkrtych
Oganyan. The green card evidencing receipt of the certified mail for
effectuating substituted service was never provided to the Texas Court. The
process server did not state the date he received the process, nor did he
provide proof in the Affidavit that he posted the process on the door, as
required by the Order Granting Motion for Substitute Service. The Affidavit
does not indicate that process was left with anyone over the age of 18 as
required by the Order Granting Motion for Substitute Service. Defendant
Mkrtych's non-appearance in the First Suit was not intentional or the result of
conscious indifference, in that he did not know about the lawsuit and never
received service of process. Furthermore, he has a meritorious defense in that
Crest Foods, through its own misconduct, breached the franchisee agreement at
issue. 
As such, the Texas
Affidavit of service is invalid, and the California judgment and judgment on
sister-state judgment, therefore, are void.
(Def.
Mot. p. 7.)
Defendant’s argument is unavailing and does not help
the Court evaluate whether or not service was proper in the Texas Court.
As stated in Bank of America:
A review of the
cases under the full faith and credit clause and California's Sister State
Money Judgments Act suggests that personal jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant depends upon the satisfaction of three criteria: First, a statute of
the forum state must allow for the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant
under the circumstances presented (Indiana Insurance Co. v. Pettigrew, supra,
115 Cal.App.3d at pp. 864-865; McGuire v. Brightman, supra, 79
Cal.App.3d at p. 784); second, the assertion of personal jurisdiction must
be constitutionally permissible (ibid.); and third, jurisdiction must be
acquired by service of process in strict compliance with the requirements of
that state's service statutes. (Donel, Inc. v. Badalian (1978) 87
Cal.App.3d 327, 332-333 [150 Cal.Rptr. 855]; see Ziller
Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222,
1229 [254 Cal.Rptr. 410].) All three of these criteria are satisfied here.
(Bank
of America v. Jennett (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 104, 115.)
Here, in the Texas Court, the Texas Court allowed
substitute service to be effected on the non-resident Defendants in California.
In Defendant’s motion, Defendant argues when the substitute service was
effected in the Texas Court, he was living in Nevada.
Defendant asserts various arguments as to why service
was improper in the Texas Court on pages 3-5 of its motion and on page 7. 
Defendant fails to tie his arguments to legal
authority. Instead, Defendant simply concludes he wasn’t served properly. 
Further, Defendant does not explain how he meets the
requirements set forth in Bank of America v. Jennett. 
The Opposition also misses the mark by explaining why
substitute service was compliant with California law. However, that is not the
standard set forth in Bank of America v. Jennett. The relevant issue
would be if service was compliant under Texas law. 
The parties fail to address what the legal standard is
for proper service under Texas law in the instant scenario and whether the
standard was met in the underlying sister-state action. (See Bank of
America v. Jennett (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 104, 115-17 [when discussing the
third criteria, the California Court addressed service requirements in Hawaii].)
Extrinsic Fraud
The
Defendant also argues that the Texas judgment should be vacated because of
extrinsic fraud.
As stated in Casey v. Hill:
Extrinsic fraud—which,
according to the Law Revision Commission comment to section 1710.40, is
the species of fraud that can be asserted as a defense to enforcement of a
judgment—occurs when “the defrauded party was deprived of the opportunity to present
his or her claim or defense to the court, that is, where he or she was kept in
ignorance or in some other manner, other than from his or her own conduct,
fraudulently prevented from fully participating in the proceeding.” (Home
Ins. Co. v. Zurich Ins. Co. (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 17, 26–27, 116
Cal.Rptr.2d 583.) Examples of extrinsic fraud include “ ‘concealment of the
existence of a community property asset, failure to give notice of the action
to the other party, and convincing the other party not to obtain counsel
because the matter will not proceed (and then it does proceed).’ ” (Navarro
v. IHOP Properties, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 834, 844, 36
Cal.Rptr.3d 385.)
(Casey
v. Hill (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 937, 980.)
Further, Casey notes
that “a claim of extrinsic fraud is not available unless the defense the party
was prevented from asserting is a meritorious one.” (Id. at 981 [citing New
York Higher Education Assistance Corp. v. Siegel (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 684,
688].)
Here, Defendant sets
forth the same exact reasons for extrinsic fraud being a basis to vacate the
judgment based Texas Court not having personal jurisdiction over Defendant. 
Defendant’s argument is
unavailing for the same reasons set above.
Argument in Reply
In
Reply, Defendant states that Crest Foods’ sister state judgment is now null and
void because on April 19, 2024, the Honorable Rachel Craig of the 192nd
judicial district Court of Dallas County, Texas, in Case No. DC-24-00942,
granted Mkrtych Oganyan’s Petition for Bill of Review and set aside Crest Foods’
default judgment in Texas. 
Defendant states that the
Texas judgment that Crest Foods relied upon in applying for entry of the sister
state judgment in this California Court has now been set aside. 
Defendant does not cite
any authority establishing this is a proper defense under CCP § 1710.40(a). The
Court notes that it was not able to find case law as to whether 
this is a proper basis to
vacate the judgment.
However, to this Court it
appears as if this could potentially fall under the Law Revision Commission’s
common defense of “the judgment is not enforceable in the state of rendition.”
The Court would likely set
aside the judgment in this case if the underlying judgment in the sister-state
has been set aside. 
The Court will hear
argument from counsel. The Notice of Entry of Judgment on Sister State Judgment
indicates that the case number in the sister-state was DC-23-05332; whereas, Defendant’s
Reply indicates that the Texas Court set aside the default judgment in the
underlying case  in DC-24-00942. 
The Court notes that the
burden is on the movant. (Conseco, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at 841.)
It would be helpful if Defendant
submitted the order granted in the Texas Court on April 19, 2024 that allegedly
vacated the default judgment in the underlying Texas judgment. 
It would be most helpful
if Defendant submitted the Texas Court ruling online before the hearing, but,
in any event, Defendant should consider bringing the Texas Court ruling to the
instant hearing. 
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court will hear argument.
The Court notes that
there are two Defendants in this action. Putting aside whether moving Defendant
comes forth with the proper order that setting aside the default judgment in
the Texas Court, the Court will want to determine whether the order vacates the
default judgment as to both Defendants or just as to one
Defendant. This is important because the moving papers suggest that, if the
motion is granted, this Court should recall and quash any writ that it
previously issued and order that any funds obtained under the judgment be
returned to the payor. The Court would be hesitant to recall any writ if a
write is still proper as to one of the Defendants.
The parties should also address
whether any writs were issued or if any funds were obtained under the judgment.
Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice is granted.
