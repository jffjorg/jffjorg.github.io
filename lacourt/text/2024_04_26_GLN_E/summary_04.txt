**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23GDCV01656
* Case Name: SERGIO DE ALBA SR., an individual; and RASTER VISUAL MEDIA, LLC, a California Corporation v. MERCEDES-BENZ USA LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company; and LAD-MB, LLC, a California Limited Liability Company d/b/a MERCEDES BENZ OF LOS ANGELES, and DOES 1-10 inclusive
* Hearing Date: April 26, 2024

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Sergio De Alba Sr. and Raster Visual Media, LLC
* Defendant: Mercedes-Benz USA LLC
* Non-Party: Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles
* Non-Party: Mercedes-Benz of South Bay

**Procedural**

* Moving Party: Defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA LLC
* Responding Party: Plaintiffs, Sergio De Alba Sr. and Raster Visual Media, LLC
* Motion: Motion to Compel Arbitration

**Background**

* Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on August 7, 2023, alleging three causes of action: Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and Negligent Repair
* The instant motion pertains to whether or not MBUSA can compel arbitration even though Plaintiffs and non-party, Mercedes-Benz of South Bay, were the parties that signed the California Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement that contained the arbitration provision

**Legal Standard**

* CCP § 1281.2 governs orders to arbitrate controversies
* The Court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or grounds exist for rescission of the agreement

**Tentative Ruling**

* MBUSA moves to compel arbitration under the Lease despite the fact that MBUSA is a non-signatory to the Lease
* The Court denies MBUSA's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Montemayor adequately explain why movant's arguments on equitable estoppel and the third-party beneficiary doctrine are inapplicable and distinguishable in the instant scenario

**Request for Judicial Notice**

* Plaintiffs request judicial notice of several court opinions and documents
* The Court grants Plaintiffs' requests for judicial notice

**Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice**

* Defendant requests judicial notice of Plaintiff's Complaint filed on or about August 7, 2023
