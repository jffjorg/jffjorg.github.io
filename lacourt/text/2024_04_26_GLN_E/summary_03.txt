```

The tentative ruling states that the Court will deny the three motions to compel responses as moot if the Defendant/Cross-Complainant pays the two additional filing fees and the Court hears the motions. If the motions are heard, the issue of sanctions is not moot. The Court also notes that the issue of sanctions is not moot and will hear from the parties regarding sanctions.
