(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff lumped what should have been four motions into one motion.Plaintiff has filed one motion seeking to compel responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. This motion should have been four motions with four separate hearing reservations and four separate filing fees. Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.)If Plaintiff wants these four motions to be heard, it can pay the additional three filing fees to the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the additional three filing fees before the hearing.Alternatively, Plaintiff is welcome to request the Court to advance and continue the instant hearing to a date that the other three motions will be scheduled for; however, Plaintiff is warned that all motions must provide sufficient notice to Defendant. Further, the Plaintiff would need to clarify which discovery method the instant motion will pertain to on the future hearing date, i.e., will the instant motion pertain to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for productions. Presumably, the other three motions will clearly indicate what individual discovery method each individual motion will pertain to.As to the merits of this motion, if Plaintiff comes forward with proof of the three additional filing fees before the hearing, Plaintiff alleges that the instant form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production were served on Defendant on November 9, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the discovery was due on December 12, 2023, but the deadline to respond was extended to December 27, 2023. Plaintiff states that on January 3, 2024 Defendant sent Plaintiff limited document production and a protective order, but Defendant did not serve responses to any of the items in this discovery set. Plaintiff alleges that a courtesy email was sent to Defendant on January 8, 2024 and January 30, 2024 regarding overdue responses, but Plaintiff received no response. Plaintiff’s counsel alleges that as of the date of filing this motion [March 27, 2024], Plaintiff has not received any responses.Since over 30 days has passed since the discovery was initially propounded, and since the extended deadline has passed, Plaintiff appears to be entitled to responses.If the filing fee issue is resolved before the hearing, Defendant is ordered to provide code compliant responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One; Special Interrogatories, Set One; and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One within 10 days of this hearing. As to the Requests for Admission, the genuineness of the documents and the truth of the matters specified in the requests are deemed admitted.If the filing fee issue is not resolved before the hearing, the Court will hear argument from the parties.Sanctions - Inspection DemandsIn relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.(CCP § 2031.300(c).)Sanctions – Requests for Admission“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)Sanctions – Interrogatories CCP § 2030.290 states in relevant part:The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.(CCP § 2030.290(c).)Sanctions Ruling “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)The Court will hear from the parties.
