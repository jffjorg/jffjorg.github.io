PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION (filed 09/13/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
BACKGROUND
 
On October 23, 2019, Plaintiff Shahnaz
Amirtalesh (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Rochelle H.
Sterling (“Sterling”), Beverly Hills Properties (“BHP”), The Sterling Family
Trust, Susan Robman and Does 1-50 (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
This
action arises out of Plaintiff’s tenancy at 240 N. Crescent Drive, Apt. 107,
Beverly Hills, CA 90210 (the “Apartment”).  In her complaint, Plaintiff
alleges that the Apartment landlord, BHP, failed to maintain sewage pipes in
the building which caused a leak in her shower drain in October 24, 2018; that
BHP delayed in granting her request to replace flood-damaged carpeting in her
Apartment with laminate floors as a reasonable accommodation for her disability
stemming from lung cancer; that BHP did not properly enforce COVID-19
restrictions regarding the use of the Apartment swimming pool; and further,
that Apartment manager, Susan Robman, harassed and discriminated against
Plaintiff because of Plaintiff’s religious beliefs.   
 
In
the summer of 2019, Plaintiff filed complaints with the County of Los Angeles
Department of Public Health (“DPH”) and the City of Beverly Hills regarding her
apartment.  On September 5, 2019, the City of Beverly Hills issued a
notice of violations to BHP.  On September 10, 2019, DPH issued an
Official Inspection Report for violations regarding wall/ceiling floor and
faucet fixtures. 
  
On
October 23, 2019, Plaintiff filed her complaint against Defendants. Sterling is
the owner of BHP and the Apartment and the trustee of the Sterling Family
Trust.  On August 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) alleging eight causes of action.  On or about October 20, 2021,
the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the fifth cause of action in the
SAC without leave to amend.  The remaining causes of action are as
follows: 
C/A 1: Breach of Warranty of Habitability 
C/A 2: Negligence  
C/A 3: Nuisance  
C/A 4: Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4 
C/A 6: Violation of the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act  
C/A 7: Violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights
Act 
C/A 8: Breach of Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment 
 
On March 17, 2023,
Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Susan Robman from the case.
 
On January 24, 2023,
the Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth,
sixth and eighth causes of action. The motion was denied as to the first,
second and third causes of action. Plaintiff dismissed, with prejudice, the 5th
and 7th causes of action.
 
On September 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration, arguing:
·       Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of the
Court’s September 5, 2024 ruling denying Plaintiff’s ex parte application to
shorten time to hear her motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
 
Defendants
filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
The
motion for reconsideration is moot because the underlying ex parte application
for an order shortening time to hear Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings were “GRANTED to extent that Trial Date of 10/07/2024 is vacated and
becomes a Trial Setting Conference date.” (See October 4, 2024 minute order.)
 
Plaintiff
filed a reply, stating:
·      
Plaintiff’s motion is moot. The trial date of 10/07/24 was
vacated. Plaintiff’s second ex parte application was granted on October 4,
2024. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
Code Civ. Proc., section 1008 states: 
a.                  
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order.¿The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.¿ 
… 
c.                  
If a court at any time determines that there has been a
change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may
do so on its own motion and enter a different order. 
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a
motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.”¿(Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th
1494, 1499.) Motions for reconsideration are restricted to circumstances where
a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not previously considered,
and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.¿(Id.)¿¿¿ 
 
An
appellate decision published during an action’s pendency may be a change of law
under section 1008, subdivision (c), and requires a trial court to reconsider
its earlier ruling if the decision materially changed the law. (Valdez v.
Himmelfarb (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1276.) A change in the law is
always an appropriate basis, up until final judgment is entered, for changing
an interim order. (State of California v. Superior Court (Flynn) (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 94, 101.) 
 
A trial court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to
reconsider an interim ruling.¿(Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th
1094, 1096-1097.)¿ The trial court is specifically authorized to exercise such
inherent jurisdiction to reconsider orders compelling arbitration.¿(Malek v.
Blue Cross of California (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 44, 59–60.) 
 
B.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s instant Motion seeks reconsideration of the
Court’s September 5, 2024 ruling denying Plaintiff’s ex parte application to
shorten time to hear her motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
 
However, both
parties agree that Plaintiff’s Motion is now moot. (Oppos., p. 2; Reply, p. 2.)
The motion for reconsideration is moot because the underlying ex parte
application for an order shortening time to hear Plaintiff’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings was “GRANTED to extent that Trial Date of 10/07/2024
is vacated and becomes a Trial Setting Conference date.” (Court’s October 4,
2024 Minute Order.) On October 7, 2024, the Court vacated the trial date and
continued the trial date to December 8, 2025. 
 
Since
Plaintiff’s motion is now moot, it is therefore DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION 

Plaintiff’s
Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
