And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The plaintiff had sought to reconsider the court's September 5, 2024 ruling denying her ex parte application to shorten time to hear her motion for judgment on the pleadings. However, both parties agree that the motion is now moot since the underlying ex parte application was granted, vacating the trial date and continuing it to December 8, 2025. The court notes that the motion for reconsideration is restricted to circumstances where a party offers new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and the parties must state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. Since the motion is now moot, it is therefore denied.
