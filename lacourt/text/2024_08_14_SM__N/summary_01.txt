And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to cross-complaint and motion to strike portions of cross-complaint filed by defendants Ahmedshah Patail and Shams Virjee. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, seeking cancellation of withdrawals from Midvale LLC and Tabor LLC, with 30 days leave to amend. The judge has granted the motion to strike the request for attorney fees and denied it as moot in all other respects.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, seeking an accounting, with 30 days leave to amend. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, seeking breach of fiduciary duty, with 30 days leave to amend.

The judge has noted that the defendants have not clearly stated the nature of their apprehension of injury or the duty owed to Nagwa Khattab, and that the basis for the request for attorney fees is not clear. The judge has also noted that the defendants' claim for breach of fiduciary duty implies that the harm can be made certain by calculation, which may affect the need for an accounting.

The judge's ruling is subject to change at the upcoming hearing on August 14, 2024.
