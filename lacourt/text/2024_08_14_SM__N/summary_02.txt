And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add non-party alter egos Cody Holmes and Andrew Meyers Abdul-Wahab as judgment debtors. The Plaintiff argued that Shangri-LA Capital, LLC, the defendant, operated as a unified enterprise or instrumentality with Holmes and Meyers, and that they stripped Shangri-LA of its assets to the extent that it cannot satisfy the judgment. The Judge found that the evidence provided by the Plaintiff was insufficient to establish that Holmes and Meyers were the alter egos of Shangri-LA. The Judge noted that while Meyers was Shangri-LA's manager/member and officer, and Holmes was identified as his supervisor or HR manager, this did not compel a conclusion that Holmes and Shangri-LA were alter egos of one another. The Judge also found that the personal guarantee of the lease by Meyers did not establish that Meyers was the alter ego of Shangri-LA, as it was a separate document guaranteeing payments, not a lease. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's motion was denied because there was no basis to amend the judgment.
