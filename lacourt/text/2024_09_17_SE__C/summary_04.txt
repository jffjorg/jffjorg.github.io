And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff is seeking to add a cause of action for fraudulent concealment and a prayer for punitive damages to the original complaint. The judge has reviewed the motion and finds that the plaintiff has met the procedural requirements for amending the complaint. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier, but given that the case was filed less than 1 ½ years ago and only one deposition has taken place, the judge is exercising its discretion to grant the motion. The judge is ordering the plaintiff to file and serve the First Amended Complaint within 5 days.
