And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Juan Soto's motion to dismiss the trademark infringement action filed by Plaintiff John A. Romo. The judge found that Defendant's delayed prosecution argument fails because he is deemed to have made a general appearance by filing his Answer on February 16, 2024. The judge also found that Defendant failed to demonstrate how California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 128.7(b) supports his motion to dismiss. Additionally, the judge ruled that Defendant's remaining contentions are not supported by any legal authority. As a result, the motion to dismiss is denied.
