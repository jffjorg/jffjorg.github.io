Lien Services (“Trustee”), the foreclosure trustee for the homeowners’
association nonjudicial foreclosure sale, for the full amount of Plaintiff’s
winning bid.

Defendant
Four Corners Housing, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
A.             
Legal
Standard
“A party may move for summary
judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that the action has no
merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding. The motion may
be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since the general appearance in
the action or proceeding of each party against whom the motion is directed or
at any earlier time after the general appearance that the court, with or
without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. That is because
of the general principle that a party who seeks a court’s action in his favor
bears the burden of persuasion thereon. There is a triable issue of material
fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to
find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in
accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie
showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he
carries his burden of production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is
then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie
showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.” (Aguilar,
supra, at p. 850; Smith
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the
summary judgment standards in Aguilar to motions for summary
adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment
motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing
party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the
evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function
is to identify issues rather than to determine issues. Only when the inferences
are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the
evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder
v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not
weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact finder to determine whose version is
more likely true. Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment based on the
court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder, supra, at p. 840,
citations omitted; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Dep’t of Transp.
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)

Relevant
Undisputed Facts 
On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff
attended a nonjudicial foreclosure sale for a property located at 12035 Beverly
Blvd., #1-A, Whittier, CA 90601 (“Property”). (Undisputed Fact (“UF”), Nos. 8-9.)The
Property was part of the Whittier Beverly Park Homeowners Association (“HOA”).
(Ibid) Defendant S.B.S. Lien Services (“Trustee”) acted as the trustee
for the nonjudicial sale arising from a Notice of Delinquent Assessment and
Claim of Lien recorded by the HOA. (Ibid) Plaintiff was the winning
bidder at the foreclosure sale and tendered a cashier’s check for $11,039.56. (Ibid)

 
Four Corners is a Limited
Liability Company wholly owned by Clear Preservation Housing Foundation
(“CPHF”) which is a nonprofit corporation deemed a 501(c)(3) entity. (Id.,
Nos. 1-4.) On August 1, 2023, Four Corners submitted a Notice of Intent to Bid and
Affidavit of Eligible Bidder to Trustee pursuant to Civil Code Section 2924m. (Id.,
No. 10.) On August 29, 2023, Matthew Regan, sole member of Four Corners, confirmed
with Trustee that the Property had not been redeemed. (Id., No. 11.)
Trustee also confirmed that the last day for Trustee to receive notices of
intent to bid was on September 8, 2023. (Ibid) 
 
On September 1, 2023, Four
Corners submitted a Qualified Bid, an Affidavit of Eligible Bidder, and a
cashier’s check for $52,000.00 to Trustee. (Id., No. 12.) As Four
Corners’ bid exceeded Plaintiff’s initial bid, on September 12, 2023, Trustee
notified Four Corners that it had submitted the highest qualified post-auction
bid under Section 2924m deeming Four Corners as the successful bidder. (Id.,
Nos. 13-14.) 
 
On October 24, 2024, Trustee
issued a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale for the Property in favor of Four Corners and
recorded it on October 27, 2023. (Id., No. 15.) 
 
On December 19, 2023, Four
Corners recorded a Section 2924o covenant with regard to the Property 
 
3.              
Civil
Code Section 2924m 
Four Corners argues that Civil
Code Section 2924m, enacted in 2021, modified the non-judicial foreclosure
auction bidding process by providing a right of first refusal to tenants,
prospective owner-occupants, and community non-profits, among other “eligible
bidders” defined in Section 2924m. (Four Corners’ MSJ, 2:4-16.) Four Corners
explains that Section 2924m allows eligible bidders to purchase a one to four
unit single-family residence after a trustee’s sale by either matching or
beating the winning bid at the sale. (Ibid.) Eligible bidders have 45
days after the trustee’s sale to provide the trustee a bid before the sale is
deemed final as long as the trustee received a notice of intent to bid from the
eligible bidders within the first 15 days following the foreclosure sale. (Ibid.)
Four Corners contends that the purpose of Section 2924m, based upon the Senate
Rules Committee Notes of SB 1079, was to promote more individuals and nonprofit
organizations to acquire foreclosed properties for the development and
preservation of affordable housing. (Ibid.) 
 
Four Corners argues that it
was a qualified bidder under Section 2924m(a)(3)(E) and was properly awarded
the Property by Trustee. (Id., 6:8-11.) Four Corners contends that Section
2924m states that a potential eligible bidder includes a limited liability
company wholly owned by an eligible nonprofit corporation. (Id.,
6:11-22.) Four Corners argues Four Corners is a qualified bidder as it is
wholly owned by CPHF which satisfies all requirements of Section 2924m(a)(3)(D)
in that CPHF (1) has a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
affirming its tax-exempt status pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and is not a private foundation as that term is defined in Section
509 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) has its principal place of business in
California; (3) has the primary residences of all board members located in
California; (4) has as one of its primary activities the development and
preservation of affordable rental or homeownership housing in California; and (5)
is registered and in good standing with the Attorney General’s Registry of
Charitable Trusts. (Ibid.) 
 
Additionally, Four Corners
argues that it complied with all required provisions of Section 2924m overbid
process as alleged in Four Corners’ Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts. (Id.,
6:23-28, 7:1-21.) As such, Four Corners argues that it was the eligible bidder
who submitted the winning overbid and awarded the Property pursuant to Section
2924m. (Ibid.)
 
Four Corners argues that Plaintiff
alleges that the overbid process pursuant to Section 2924m was wrongfully
applied by Trustee to the sale of the Property because the sale was pursuant to
a Notice of Delinquent Assessment and Claim of Lien recorded by the HOA, and
not a power of sale contained in a deed of trust or mortgage. (Id., 7:24-27.)
Four Corners argues that a review of the enabling statute for HOA foreclosures,
the legislative history, and intent behind Section 2924m provides that
Plaintiff’s argument is not appropriate. (Id., 7:28, 8:1-2.)
 
Four Corners argues that California’s
legislature created a statutory right to lien property, with identical
foreclosure procedures as those created by a deed of trust, when it passed the
Davis-Stirling Act which was previously codified in Civil Code section 1350. (Id.,
8:3-20.) Four Corners contends that Civil Code Section 1367.1(g) states that “any
sale by the trustee shall be conducted in accordance with Sections 2924, 2924b,
and 2024c applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds
of trust.” (Ibid.) Four Corners contends that even when the
Davis-Stirling Act was revamped in Civil Code Section 5710, the same language
pertaining to foreclosure under an HOA lien remained. (Ibid.) As such,
Four Corners argues that the legislature intended that identical procedures would
be used to foreclose HOA liens as those used to foreclose on consensual liens such
as mortgages and deeds of trust. (Ibid.) 
 
Four Corners further argues
that Civil Code Section 5700(a) states that a “lien may be enforced in any
manner permitted by law, including sale by the court, sale by the trustee
designated in the notice of delinquent assessment, or sale by a trustee
substituted pursuant to Section 2934a.” (Id., 8:21-28.) As such, Four
Corners argues that Plaintiff’s position that an HOA lien can be foreclosed in
any manner permitted by law, except by Section 2924m, is wrong. (Ibid.) 
 
Four Corners argues that
Section 2924m applies to the foreclosure of HOA liens since there is no
language within the statute stating otherwise. (Id., 9:11-28.) Four
Corners refutes Plaintiff’s allegation that the language of Section 2924m(c)
restricts the applicability of the overbid process to a trustee’s power sale
contained in a deed of trust or mortgage on real property. (Ibid.) Instead,
Four Corners argues that Plaintiff’s position negates the language of the
Davis-Stirling Act regarding foreclosures arising from HOA liens and it is
contrary to the legislative intent of Section 2924m. (Ibid.) Specifically,
Four Corners points to the Senate Rules Committee Notes stating that the intent
of SB 1079 and Section 2924m was to “mitigate against blight, vacancy, and the
transfer of residential property ownership from owner-occupants to corporate
landlords in the event that California experiences a wave of foreclosures”
following the Covid-19 pandemic. (Ibid.) Four Corners contends that the
Senate Rules Committee Notes refer to foreclosures generally with the intent
that Section 2924m applies to all of them, not only those arising from powers
of sale in deeds of trust or mortgages. (Ibid.)
 
As such, Four Corners argues that
Plaintiff’s SAC causes of action for declaratory relief and quiet title lack
merit as there is no private right of action under Section 2924m and because
Plaintiff has no standing to sue since Trustee’s sale never became final as to
Plaintiff due to Four Corners’ overbid pursuant to Section 2924m. (Id.,
10:23-28.) Additionally, Four Corners argues that Plaintiff’s cause of action
for violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200 lacks merit because
there is no evidence of wrongful conduct by Four Corners when it overbid for
the Property and acquired title, nor that Plaintiff suffered any actual injury.
(Id., 12:16-28, 13:1-9.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that the plain language of Section 2924m indicates that the statute does
not apply to nonjudicial foreclosure sales of real property based on an HOA’s
assessment lien. (Opp., 4:11-28.) Instead, Plaintiff contends that Section
2924m states that it only applies to “trustee’s sale[s] of property under a
power of sale contained in a deed of trust or mortgage on real property
containing one to four residential units...” (Id., 5:11-18; Civ. Code §
2924m(c).) Plaintiff cites various authority arguing that when the language of
a statute is clear, courts do not need to go any further in interpreting the
statute. (Id., 4:12-28.) Plaintiff contends that if the language of a
statute is not ambiguous, a court does not need to go beyond that pure
expression of legislative intent. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff also argues that
even if the court finds Section 2924m to be ambiguous, legislative history
confirms the intent of the statute. (Id., 5:27-28, 6:1-6.) Plaintiff
points to the same Senate Rules Committee Notes as Four Corners to highlight
that the legislature anticipated economic fallout from Covid-19 and “the
prospect that many California homeowners will soon default of their mortgage
payments...” (Ibid.) Plaintiff contends that the legislature does not
make any mention of a concern for a widespread foreclosure arising from HOA
assessment liens and that there is no basis to conclude otherwise. (Ibid.)

 
Plaintiff further notes that the
legislative intent behind Section 2924m is further shown in the Legislative
Counsel’s Digest presented in Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice in
Opposition to Four Corners’ motion. (Id., 6:16-28.) Plaintiff quotes the
Digest’s discussion stating that “[e]xisting law prescribes various
requirements be satisfied before the exercise of a power of sale under a
mortgage or deed of trust and prescribes a procedure for the exercise of that
power…” and “that “[t]his bill…would prescribe an alternative process in
connection with a trustee’s sale of property under a power of sale contained in
a deed of trust or mortgage on real property . . .” (Ibid.) Plaintiff
claims that there is no indication that the legislature intended Section 2924m
to apply to foreclosure based on an HOA lien. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff also contends that the
legislature’s exclusion of nonjudicial foreclosures arising from delinquent HOA
liens and assessments from Section 2924m must be presumed to be purposeful as
the legislature has addressed HOA foreclosures elsewhere and did not include
them in Section 2924m. (Id., 7:19-23.) Plaintiff argues that the Davis-Stirling
Act and Civil Code Section 5700 showcases the legislature asserting specific
regulation over nonjudicial foreclosures arising under HOA liens. (Id., 8:3-8.)
Plaintiff contends that Civil Code Section 5710(a) expressly states that “[a]ny
sale by the trustee shall be conducted in accordance with Sections 2924, 2924b,
and 2924c applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds
of trust” but does not list Section 2924m. (Id., 8:9-15.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that the procedure
stated in Section 2924m directly conflicts with a homeowner’s 90-day redemption
rights contained in Civil Code Section 5715(b). (Id., 8:16-28.)
Plaintiff argues Section 2924m(c) deems the sale final either 15 or 45 days
after auction and in some cases, it is final on the same day as the auction
conflicting with the 90-day period found in Section 5715(b). (Ibid.; Civ.
Code §§ 2924m(c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4).) Plaintiff also points to Section 2924h
to show further conflicts between a homeowner’s right to redemption and Section
2924m. (Id., 8:26-28, 9:1-6.)
 
Plaintiff also notes that Section
2924m has undergone several amendments, showing that if the legislature wanted
to include foreclosures under HOA liens, it had ample opportunity to do so. (Id.,
10:3-12.)
 
Plaintiff opposes Four
Corners arguments that Plaintiff’s SAC causes of action have no merit since
Plaintiff contends that Section 2924m was wrongly applied to the foreclosure
sale of the Property in this case making Four Corners’ acquisition of title erroneous.
(Id., 11:11-22, 12:3-16, 13:17-28.)  
 
In reply, Four Corners contends
that Plaintiff does not dispute that Four Corners was a qualified bidder under Section
2924m or that Four Corners was properly awarded properly awarded the Property.
(Reply, 2:9-20.) Four Corners reiterates its previous arguments that Plaintiff’s
narrow interpretation of Section 2924m only applying to foreclosures arising
from mortgages and deeds of trust is meritless and is in conflict with the
legislative intent. (Id., 2:21-26.) Additionally, Four Corners argues the
Trustee is responsible for foreclosing the Property and enforcing the statutory
90-day redemption period under Section 5715. (Id., 5:13-28.) As such,
the Trustee here was mindful of the 90-day redemption period and did not
finalize the sale of the Property under after the redemption period ended. (Id.,
5:1-8.) Four Corners argues that Plaintiff did not meaningfully address Four
Corners argument that Plaintiff is seeking a private right of action under
Section 2924m which is not available. (Id., 6:9-22.) Four Corners also
argues that Plaintiff provided no meaningful response to its lack of standing since
Plaintiff did not hold legal title to the Property and has never held legal
title. (Id., 6:23-28; 7:1-9.)
 
The main issue present here
is whether Section 2924m applies to foreclosure sales based on HOA liens. Plaintiff’s
most prominent position is that Section 2924m(c) makes reference to deeds of
trust or mortgages. However, when the court reads Section 2924m(c) closer, there
is no clear limitation to the application of Section 2924m(c) to foreclosure
sales based on deeds of trust or mortgages only. 
 
(c)        A trustee's sale of property under a
power of sale contained in a deed of trust or mortgage on real property
containing one to four residential units pursuant to Section 2924g shall not be
deemed final until the earliest of the following:
 
When taking this section for
its plain meaning, it does not exclude Section 2924m from applying to foreclosures
based on HOA liens as Plaintiff implies. 
 
Additionally, Civil Code section
5710(a) of the Davis-Stirling act states that “[a]ny sale by the trustee shall
be conducted in accordance with... the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages
and deeds of trust.” In other words, Section 5710(a) codifies that the
foreclosure procedure of any sale by a trustee under the Davis-Stirling act
should follow the procedure of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds of trust,
including 2924m, which undoubtedly applies to a foreclosure sales based on
deeds of trust or mortgages. 
 
Furthermore, ruling that
Section 2924m does not apply for the foreclosure sale here would go against the
the intent expressed in the Senate Rules Committee Notes for enacting Section
2924m. The intent behind Section 2924m is to mitigate against the transfer of
residential property ownership from owner-occupants to corporate landlords
without giving eligible bidders, as defined in Section 2924m, an opportunity to
match (in the case of tenants) or outbid (in the case of other eligible
bidders) a foreclosure sale bidder. 
 
Plaintiff’s argument that Legislative
Counsel’s Digest makes it clear that Section 2924m pertains to foreclosure
sales based on deeds of trust or mortgages is unpersuasive since the Legislative
Counsel’s Digest is not controlling. 
 
Plaintiff’s argument that Section
2924m conflicts with a homeowner’s right for redemption is also not an issue
here. As Four Corners argues in its reply, the Trustee reconciled both
statutory requirements of Section 2924m and the 90-day redemption period under
Section 5715. 
 
As such, the court finds that
Section 2924m is applicable to foreclosure sales based on HOA liens. Thus, the
Property was properly awarded to Four Corners. 
 
The motion is granted.
