```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) is overruled. The demurrer sought to dismiss the plaintiff's negligence claim, arguing that the defendant suffered a "sudden medical emergency" that caused the accident. The judge has rejected this argument, finding that it relies on facts not contained in the pleading, such as the defendant's medical history. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the FAC within 20 days. The ruling is based on California case law, including the doctrine of "sudden emergency" or "imminent peril," which requires a showing that the defendant did not cause the emergency and acted as a reasonably careful person would have acted in similar circumstances.
