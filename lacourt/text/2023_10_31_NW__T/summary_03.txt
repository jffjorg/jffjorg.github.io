Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Jerry Davidson, for discovery abuse. The plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to produce documents and to appear for a deposition. The court finds that the plaintiff's actions were in bad faith and obstructed the discovery process. The judge has also found that the plaintiff made frivolous objections to discovery requests and failed to respond to requests for admission and special interrogatories. The court's order was violated in multiple ways, including the failure to produce documents and the failure to appear for a deposition. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's actions warrant terminating sanctions, which is the ultimate sanction of dismissing the complaint with prejudice.
