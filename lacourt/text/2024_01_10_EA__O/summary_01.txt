Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs of defendant HomeGoods, Inc. The plaintiff seeks to strike two costs: attorneys' fees of $105,054.15 and $191.26 in deposition fees for Duk Hoon Cha's deposition, which was not taken. The court finds that the attorneys' fees are not reasonably necessary to the litigation and grants the motion to tax said cost. The court also grants the motion to tax the cost of the deposition of Duk Hoon Cha, as the defendant does not dispute the error.
