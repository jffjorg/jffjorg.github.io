Motion for New Trial and Notice of Motion to Vacate
Judgment.
 
The court
considered the moving papers and opposition papers. No reply has been filed. 
The court DENIES
plaintiffs David Ortiz and Yuko Ortiz’s motion for new trial and notice of
motion to vacate judgment because the court lacks jurisdiction because of
Plaintiffs’ notice of appeal filed on October 6, 2023. 
 
Background
            On
October 19, 2018, plaintiffs David A. Ortiz and Yuko Ortiz filed this action
and, on January 28, 2020, filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC)
against Rachel Brinck, Curtis Lepore, Morley Construction Company, Inc.,
Benchmark Contractors, Inc., 62 Hundred Hollywood South, LP, DLJ Real Estate
Capital Partners, LLC, Clarett West Development, LLC. The SAC alleges the
following causes of action: (1) General Negligence; (2) Negligence Per Se; (3)
Negligent Infliction of Emotion Distress; (4) Loss of Consortium; (5)
Permissive Use Statute; (6) Negligent Entrustment; (7) Public Entity
Negligence: Dangerous Condition on Public Property; (8) General
Negligence—Commercial Entity Owner Developers & Contractors; (9) Peculiar
Risk Doctrine; (10) Nondelegable Duty Doctrine; and (11) Premise Liability. 
            Plaintiffs
alleged the following. On October 29, 2017, plaintiff David Ortiz was walking
on the crosswalk between Argyle Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard in the City of
Los Angeles. (SAC at pg. 10:10-13.) Defendant Rachel Brinck was driving a car
entrusted to her by defendant Curtis Lepore when she ran a red light and failed
to yield the right of way to Ortiz (Id. at pp. 7:4-7, 9:20-25, 10:1-2.) Brinck
struck and almost killed Ortiz. (Id. at pg. 7:5-6.) Brinck was driving
too fast and recklessly. (Id. at pg. 9:20.) Defendants City of Los
Angeles, Morley Construction Company, Benchmark Contractors, Inc., 62 Hundred
Hollywood South, LP, DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners, LLC, and Clarett West Development
LLC were negligent by erecting or allowing a tall construction barrier to
remain at the crosswalk, which created a blind spot for pedestrians entering
the crosswalk. (Id. at pg. 7:7-12.)
            On
March 3, 2023, defendants Morley Construction Co., Inc.; Benchmark Contractors,
Inc.; 62 Hundred Holly South, L.P; DLJ Real Estate Capitol Partners, LLC;
Clarett West Development, LLC; and Right of Way, Inc. (collectively, the Entity
Defendants) filed a motion for summary judgment directed at the SAC. 
            On
September 18, 2023, the court granted the Entity Defendants motion for summary
judgment. 
            On
October 5, 2023, the court entered judgment in the Entity Defendants’ favor and
dismissed them with prejudice. 
            On
October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal regarding the October 5,
2023 judgment. 
            On
October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a document titled: “Motion for New Trial.
Notice of Motion to Vacate Judgment Granted by the Respondent: Hon. Judge. Med
Red Recana Judgment on Oct. 05, 2023.”
            On
November 2, 2023, the Entity Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’
motion for new trial. 
 
Legal Standard
“A motion for
new trial is a creature of statute; . . .” (Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co.¿(1992)
7 Cal. App. 4th 1194, 1198.) A movant must satisfy Code of Civil Procedure
sections 657 and 659.
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
657, a motion for new trial may be granted if any of the following apply:
[¶1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse
party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party
was prevented from having a fair trial. [¶] 2. Misconduct of the jury; and
whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any
general or special verdict, or to a finding on any question submitted to them
by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may
be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors. [¶] 3. Accident or
surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. [¶] 4. Newly
discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which he
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
trial. [¶] 5. Excessive or inadequate damages. [¶] 6. Insufficiency of the
evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other
decision is against law. [¶] 7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and
excepted to by the party making the application.   
When ruling on
an application for a new trial, the court sits as an independent trier of fact.
(Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 405, 412.) The court,
therefore, has broad discretion to order new trials, limited only by the
obligation to state its reasons for granting a new trial and the existence of
substantial evidence in the record to support those reasons. (Ibid.) In
assessing the need for a new trial, the court must rely on its view of the
overall record, taking into account such factors, among others, as the nature
and seriousness of the alleged misconduct, the general atmosphere, including
the judge’s control, of the trial, the likelihood of prejudicing the jury, and
the efficacy of objection or admonition under all the circumstances. (Dominguez
v. Pantalone (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 201, 211.) A new trial motion is
available to challenge a summary judgment. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 858.) 
 
Discussion
Irrespective of the merits of the instant motion and whether Plaintiffs
complied with the procedural requirements, the court determines that it
currently lacks jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial and
notice of motion to vacate judgment because Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal
October 6, 2023 and the appeal is still pending. 
“[T]he perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon
the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or
affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial
court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected
by the judgment or order.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 916(a).)  “The automatic stay,
when it applies, arises upon a ‘duly perfected’ appeal.”  (Hearn Pacific Corp. v. Second Generation
Roofing, Inc.¿(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 117, 146.)   
In this instance, a determination on whether a new trial is warranted
would undermine the appeal and render it futile. Thus, as it concerns
Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial and notice of motion to vacate judgment, the action
is stayed relating to the judgment entered in the Entity Defendants’ favor and
to the underlying ruling on the motion for summary judgment. (See Betz v.
Pankow (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 931, 940-941[confirming that a trial court
loses jurisdiction to rule on motion to vacate a judgment when that very
judgment is on appeal].) 
Accordingly, the court DENIES plaintiffs David Ortiz and Yuko Ortiz’s motion
for new trial and notice of motion to vacate judgment.
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
