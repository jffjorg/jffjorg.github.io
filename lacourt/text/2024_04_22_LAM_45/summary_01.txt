Significant Statements:
  - The court lacks jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' motion for new trial and notice of motion to vacate judgment because the appeal is still pending.
  - The perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from.
  - The automatic stay arises upon a "duly perfected" appeal.
  - A determination on whether a new trial is warranted would undermine the appeal and render it futile.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the moving papers and opposition papers in the case. The court lacks jurisdiction to hear the Plaintiffs' motion for new trial and notice of motion to vacate judgment because the appeal is still pending. The court notes that the appeal has stayed the proceedings in the trial court. The court also notes that a determination on whether a new trial is warranted would undermine the appeal and render it futile. Therefore, the court denies the Plaintiffs' motion for new trial and notice of motion to vacate judgment.
