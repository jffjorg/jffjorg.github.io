And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Sunergy Construction, Inc. Counsel Mandeep S. Rupal and Alexander W. Richter are relieved as counsel of record for the client effective upon the filing of proof of service for the court order.

The judge has denied a motion for trial preference filed by plaintiff Delia Alvino due to her age and health. The plaintiff has shown that she has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. However, the judge has denied the motion because the plaintiff's husband, Alfred Alvino, who is a co-owner of the subject property, has not yet joined the suit. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice and has encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
