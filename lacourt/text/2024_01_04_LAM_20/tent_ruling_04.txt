This is a habitability matter.  Defendant D&A Endeavors, Inc. seeks to exclude or limit the testimony of Plaintiffs’ expert, Shilpa Sayana, M.D., because “she intends to opine that [Plaintiff] Roth suffered from a panoply of medical conditions causally related to the mold exposure, including ‘brain fog’, fatigue, immunosuppression, chronic sinusitis, bloating and irritable bowel syndrome, and skin rashes. Dr. Sayana is board certified only in internal medicine. She is not board certified in toxicology, neurology, immunology, as an allergist, psychiatry or epidemiology. The only training she had with respect to the putative health effects of mold exposure was on-line courses from the Institute for Functional Medicine which is not accredited by any generally recognized medical professional accrediting organization. Further, Dr. Sayana’s opinions lack a proper foundation in science/medicine and she is neither qualified to provide the requisite evidence of general or specific causation with respect to any of the putative medical conditions/illnesses she claims Roth suffers from as a result of the mold exposure, nor has she provided any such evidence.”No opposition was filed.The Motion was set for January 4, 2024, and requires at least 16 court days of notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.)  Service was rendered by email, and so two additional days of notice are required.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.)  Thus, the Motion should have been served and filed by December 7, 2023.  However, the Motion was served on December 11, 2023, and filed on December 12, 2023.  This may have prejudiced Plaintiffs because an opposition/response was not filed by the deadline of December 20, 2023.Therefore, the Motion is denied without prejudice.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
