  CASE NO.: 21STCV47328
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
 
8:30 a.m.
November 25, 2024
Dept. 56



 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Brian Lopez 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises from the purchase of an
allegedly defective 2018 Dodge Ram 1500 (the “Vehicle”), which was manufactured
by Defendant FCA US, LLC (“FCA”) and sold by Champion Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram
Fiat (“Champion”) (collectively, “Defendants”). 
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges various warranty
breaches under the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair. 
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement on
July 17, 2023.
On July 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Attorneys’ fees. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiff’s
Requests for Judicial Notice are DENIED. 
The orders of other trial courts as to the reasonability of attorney’s
fees is not relevant to the determination of this Motion.
 
DISCUSSION
The parties have settled this matter via an
offer made pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 998 (“§ 998 offer”); the parties
agreed that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this matter and that FCA will
pay Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to a noticed
motion. Per the § 998 offer, FCA has agreed to pay Plaintiff $110,000, which
includes any and all loan payoff amounts, civil penalties and any
incidental/consequential damages, and any and all liability claimed in this
action subject to proof. Plaintiff now seeks $60,704 in fees, $21,246.40 as a 1.35
fee multiplier, $3,504.28 in costs, and $3,500 for Plaintiff’s counsel’s review
of Defendant’s Opposition, drafting of a Reply, and attending the hearing. In
total, Plaintiff seeks $88,954.68. 
 
As the prevailing party, Plaintiff is
entitled to reasonable fees and costs. 
(Civ. Code § 1794(d).)  Defendants
do not oppose the Motion. 
 
The Court finds that counsels’ hourly
rates—ranging between $325 and $610—are reasonable given their experience and
the locality of the services provided. Additionally, the Court has reviewed
Plaintiff’s billing records and finds that such records do not indicate
obviously duplicative work or improper allocation of attorney assignments. (See
Shahian Decl., Ex. 20) Plaintiff’s fee request is in line with prior attorneys’
fees awards in Department 56.
 
On the other hand, the Court will not award
any fee multiplier. The Court does not believe this matter involved any complex
or novel legal issues warranting any multiplier.  Indeed, Plaintiff’s counsel litigates dozens
of matters nearly identical to this one, often using templates and generally
abiding by the same litigation strategy.
 
Plaintiff requests $3,504.28 in costs;
however, costs are not to be requested by a fee motion but rather by a
memorandum of costs. (Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1).) Should Defendant fail
to file a timely motion to tax, the Court clerk will enter the costs requested
on the judgment. (Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(4).)
 
As no opposition was filed, the Court will
not award $3,500 for Plaintiff’s counsel’s review of an opposition or drafting
of a reply. Plaintiff’s counsel fails to state the time they anticipate
spending to attend the hearing or an hourly rate for that time. Thus, the Court
will not award any fees for review of opposition, drafting a reply or attending
the hearing.
 
In sum, Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’
Fees and Costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Court awards Plaintiff $60,704 in
attorneys’ fees as against Defendants.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
        
Dated this 25th day of November 2024
