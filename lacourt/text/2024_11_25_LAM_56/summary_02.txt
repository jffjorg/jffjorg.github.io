And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiffs, Paola Martinez and Beatriz Vergara. The motion is granted, and the defendant, Kia America, Inc., is ordered to pay monetary sanctions of $2,464.20 to the plaintiffs. The defendant is also ordered to comply with the terms of a previous order, which included providing the plaintiffs with information about the escalated case administrator and the Call Center in Arizona.

The judge found that the defendant failed to comply with the order and that its failure was not justified. The judge also noted that the defendant's conduct was not egregious, and therefore, evidence or issue sanctions were not imposed.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' stipulation to the IDC Order and the defendant's failure to comply with its terms. The IDC Order was issued after the parties participated in an informal discovery conference, and it required the defendant to provide certain information to the plaintiffs. The defendant failed to comply with the order, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions.

The judge's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for the imposition of sanctions in cases where a party fails to comply with an order or engages in frivolous conduct. The judge found that the defendant's conduct was frivolous and that it was not justified by any legitimate reason.

The judge's ruling is final unless either party files a timely opposition or a motion to reconsider.
