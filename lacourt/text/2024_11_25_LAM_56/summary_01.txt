Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Brian Lopez, purchased a defective 2018 Dodge Ram 1500 from FCA US, LLC and Champion Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat. After filing a complaint alleging warranty breaches and negligent repair, the parties settled the matter via an offer made under Code Civ. Proc. § 998. The settlement agreement requires FCA to pay Plaintiff's attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.

The judge has awarded Plaintiff $60,704 in attorneys' fees as against Defendants, finding that Plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable fees and costs. However, the judge has denied Plaintiff's request for a fee multiplier and has not awarded any fees for review of opposition, drafting of a reply, or attending the hearing.

The judge has also noted that the parties have agreed to pay Plaintiff's costs, but these costs should be requested through a memorandum of costs rather than a fee motion. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions made by the parties.
