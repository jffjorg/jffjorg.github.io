Plaintiff claims Labor Code section 432.6 “prevents an employer requiring, ‘as
a condition of employment, continued employment, or the receipt of any
employment-related benefit’ to require an employee to ‘waive any right, forum,
or procedure’ for a violation of the California Fair Employment Housing Act or the
Labor Code.”  (Opposition, p. 6,
emphasis in original.)  The FAA preempts
section 432.6.  (See Chamber of
Commerce of the United States of America v. Bonta (9th Cir.
2023) 62 F.4th 473, 490.)  If
the Court ends up finding the FAA applicable, Plaintiff would not be able to
rely on section 432.6.
