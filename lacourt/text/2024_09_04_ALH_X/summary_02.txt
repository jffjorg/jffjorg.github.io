And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages allegations and prayers for relief in a complaint filed by a plaintiff against defendants Jackie Lubrano, Jake Zacuto, and Zacuto Group, Inc. The defendants move to strike the punitive damages allegations and prayers for relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 435, 436, and 437.

The judge grants the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations and prayers for relief as to Zacuto Group, Inc. because the plaintiff has failed to plead facts demonstrating that the corporation's officers, directors, or managing agents were involved in the alleged fraudulent conduct.

The judge denies the motion to strike as to defendants Jackie Lubrano and Jake Zacuto because the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against these individuals. The judge finds that the plaintiff has pled specific facts showing fraud within the meaning of section 3294 of the Civil Code, including allegations that the defendants knowingly concealed defects in the property and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on these representations.

The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of the ruling and grants the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to plead additional facts to support its claim for punitive damages against Zacuto Group, Inc.
