Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff has failed to comply with discovery requests and court orders, and has not participated in the litigation since at least March 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiff's actions are a misuse of the discovery process and that terminating sanctions are appropriate. The plaintiff is ordered to pay $1,150.80 in monetary sanctions and the case is dismissed. The final status conference and trial dates are vacated.
