BACKGROUND
 
On October 27, 2022, Plaintiff Shyland Davis (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Dana Caprio (“Caprio”) and Does 1 to 10 for injuries related
to a motor vehicle accident on October 28, 2020, at Electric Drive and Fairfax
Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
 
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff was purportedly in another motor vehicle
accident.
 
On January 16, 2024, Caprio filed a cross-complaint against Kierra
Deshon and Daren Deshon (collectively “Deshons”), alleging they are liable for
the May 16, 2023 accident and exacerbated Plaintiff’s injuries. 
 
On May 1, 2024, Deshons filed an application for determination of good
faith of a settlement entered with Plaintiff. 
 
On May 8, 2024, Caprio filed the instant motion to contest Deshons’ Application
for determination of good faith settlement. Deshons oppose; Plaintiff filed a
joinder to the opposition. Caprio replies.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Under section 877.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, “[a] determination by
the court that [a] settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint
tortfeasor . . . from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor .
. . for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 877.6 (c).) Any party to an action may move for an order
determining whether a settlement between the plaintiff and one or more alleged
tortfeasors or co-obligors was made in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6,
subd. (a)(1).) “The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of
proof on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (d).) 
 
In City of Grand View Terrace v. Superior Court
(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261, the court provided the following guidance
regarding a motion for a good faith settlement determination: 
 
If the good
faith settlement is contested, section 877.6, subdivision (d), sets forth a
workable ground rule for the hearing by placing the burden of proving the lack
of good faith on the contesting party. Once there is a showing made by the
settlor of the settlement, the burden of proof on the issue of good faith
shifts to the nonsettlor who asserts that the settlement was not made in good
faith. If contested, declarations by the nonsettlor should be filed which in many cases could require the
moving party to file responsive counterdeclarations to negate the lack of good faith asserted by the nonsettling contesting
party. 
 
(192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1260-1261 [citation omitted].) 
 
Section 877.6 requires “that the courts review [settlement] agreements
made under its aegis to insure that the settlements appropriately balance the .
. . statute’s dual objectives” (i.e., providing an “equitable sharing of costs
among the parties at fault” and encouraging parties to resolve their disputes
by way of settlement.) (Tech-Bilt, Inc. v.
Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 494 (hereafter, Tech-Bilt).) In
Tech-Bilt, the court set forth the factors to consider when determining
whether a settlement is made in good faith. The Tech-Bilt factors are:
(1) a rough approximation of plaintiff’s total recovery and the settlor’s
proportionate liability; (2) the amount paid in settlement; (3) the allocation
of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (4) a recognition that a settlor
should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a
trial; (5) the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling
defendants; and (6) the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct
aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants. (Tech-Bilt,
supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 498-501.) Not every factor will apply in every case.
(Dole Food Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Shell Oil Co.) (2015) 242
Cal.4th 894, 909.) 
 
“ ‘A determination as to the good faith of a settlement, within the
meaning of section 877.6, necessarily requires the trial court to examine and
weigh a number of relevant factors, [fn. omitted] one of the most important of
which is the settling party's proportionate liability.’ [citation.] If ‘there
is no substantial evidence to support a critical assumption as to the nature
and extent of a settling defendant's liability, then a determination of good
faith based upon such assumption is an abuse of discretion.’” (Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1350.)
 
“All affidavits relied upon as probative must state evidentiary facts;
they must show facts and circumstances from which the ultimate fact sought to
be proved may be deduced by the court. [citation.] Affidavits or declarations
setting forth only conclusions, opinions or ultimate facts are to be held
insufficient; even an expert's opinion cannot rise to the dignity of
substantial evidence if it is unsubstantiated by facts. [citation.]” (Greshko v. County of Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834.)
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith . . . [is] permitted to
demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in
relation to [the above] factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable
objectives of [Section 877.6]. Such a demonstration would establish that the
proposed settlement was not a ‘settlement made in good faith’ within the terms
of section 877.6.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at pp. 499–500.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Deshons have settled with Plaintiff for
$8,000. According to the Application for Good Faith, the settlement was reached
through negotiations in January 2024; the release was signed on February 6,
2024. Caprio asserts this value is not reflective of their proportionate
liability since their accident likely exacerbated Plaintiff’s injuries. Caprio
argues her accident with Plaintiff occurred at a low speed. Both cars were at a
stopped intersection prior to the incident. (Leach Decl., Exh. F, 13:20–22.)
Caprio alleges she had only traveled ten feet before impact; Plaintiff alleges
she traveled 20 to 30 feet. Caprio argues this shows that the vehicles were not
traveling fast. (Leach Decl., Exh. F, 14:12–13 [Caprio alleges she was
traveling less than 5 m.p.h]; Leach Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D, 46:7–12 [Plaintiff
could not recall her speed].) Caprio also produces photographs of Plaintiff’s
car following the accident to further argue that the injury was not serious,
and that Plaintiff’s injuries were worsened by the second accident. (Id.,
Exh. D, 52:9–20.) 
 
            During the May 16, 2023 accident,
Plaintiff was at a complete stop at an intersection and was rear-ended by one
of the Deshons. On February 21, 2024, Dr. Ravi Srinivas conducted an
independent medical examination on Plaintiff and concluded “it is within a
reasonable medical probability that the 5/16/23 motor vehicle accident
aggravated [Plaintiff’s] cervical and thoracolumbar paraspinal muscle strains.”
(Leach Decl., Exh. H, p.9.) However, this information would not have been
available during the settlement negotiations that took place in January 2024. 
 
            In her Form Interrogatory responses,
Plaintiff claimed $220,615.39 in past medical specials and $100,000 to $160,000
in future medical specials. (Leach Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. C, 11:16–13:15.) This
discovery response was served June 29, 2023; and the treatment took place from
2020 to 2022—before the second accident. On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s 998
offer to compromise was $499,999. Therefore, Caprio contends the Deshons’
settlement is only 0.8% of Plaintiff’s total recovery. Additionally, Caprio speculates
the settlement is likely not the total policy limit since the minimum coverage
is $15,000. 
 
            In opposition, Deshons argues that
Plaintiff was treated starting in October 2020 (when the first accident
occurred) until June 6, 2022. Then, following the May 16, 2023 accident, from
July 13, 2023 to October 17, 2023, Plaintff was treated at Parehjan, Vartzar
and Khosrovian Chiropractic totaling 12 visits and $2,680.00 in billing. Therefore,
the settlement demand that Plaintiff sent to Deshons’ insurance carrier in
January 2024 only contained the $2,680 in medical billings. Deshons appear to
argue the settlement was appropriate since it was three times Plaintiff’s
medical specials; as a result, the financial condition/policy limit factor is
irrelevant. Additionally, Deshons argue that they cannot be liable for the
$220,555.39 in past medical specials since those were incurred prior to the May
16, 2023 accident. 
 
            In reply, Caprio points to
Plaintiff’s July 11, 2023 deposition where she stated that she was not treated
in 2023 because her “back pain was tolerable until [she] had a second
accident.” (Leach Decl., Exh. D, Pl. Depo. 20:8–16.) However, Caprio has not disputed
that most of Plaintiff’s damages are for past medical specials incurred before
the second accident. While it is possible that the second accident exacerbated
Plaintiff’s injuries, Caprio has not shown that significant medical expenses
were incurred after the second accident. Therefore, Caprio has not shown that
the proportional liability is so far “outside the ballpark.” Caprio also
presents no evidence of Deshons’ financial condition, their policy limits, or
evidence of collusion. As a result, Caprio fails to meet her burden. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the motion to Contest Application for Determination of Good
Faith Settlement is DENIED.
 
Moving party shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof
of service of such.
