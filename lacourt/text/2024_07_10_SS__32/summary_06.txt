Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to contest the application for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a motor vehicle accident and a subsequent settlement between the plaintiff, Shyland Davis, and the cross-defendants, Kierra and Daren Deshon. The defendant, Dana Caprio, contests the good faith of the settlement, arguing that it is not reflective of her proportionate liability since the settlement was reached before the second accident, which likely exacerbated the plaintiff's injuries.

The judge finds that the settlement was reached in January 2024, and the release was signed in February 2024. Caprio argues that the settlement is only 0.8% of the plaintiff's total recovery and that the financial condition/policy limit factor is irrelevant. However, the judge finds that Caprio has not shown that the proportional liability is so far "outside the ballpark" and that she has not presented evidence of collusion.

The judge denies the motion to contest the application for determination of good faith settlement, finding that the settlement was made in good faith. The moving party is required to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
