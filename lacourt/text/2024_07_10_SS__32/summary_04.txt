And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which would add the defendant, The Vons Companies, Inc., to the products liability cause of action. The plaintiff filed the original complaint on September 13, 2022, and the motion to amend was filed on June 4, 2024. The defendant opposes the amendment, citing the delay in seeking the amendment and the potential prejudice it may cause. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient reasons for the delay and that the amendment would result in prejudice to the defendant, who has not conducted discovery on the matter and trial is set for July 10, 2024. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to dispute the defendant's contentions and did not present facts in discovery about the reusable bag's role in the incident. The judge cites case law that unexplained delays in seeking leave to amend is a valid reason to deny amendment.
