BACKGROUND
 
On February 21, 2024, Defendants Fatameh Shamie and Mohammed Shamie (“Defendants”)
moved the Court to consolidate this case with the following for all purposes: McGlew
v. Carriger (Case No. 20STCV48811) (“Carriger”) and McGlew v.
Coxwell (Case No. 21STCV16214) (“Coxwell”).  The Court denied the motion. On May 23, 2024,
Defendants again moved to consolidate. No opposition has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048 states: “When actions involving a common question of law or fact
are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or
all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
 
Under California Rules of Court,
rule 3.350, subdivision (a)(1), a notice of motion to consolidate must: (A)
List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and
the names of their respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of
all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown
first; and (C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. (2) The motion
to consolidate: (A) Is deemed a single motion for the purpose of determining
the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting
papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; (B) Must be served on
all attorneys of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and (C) Must have a proof of service filed as part
of the motion.  
 
¿“Cases may not be consolidated
unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more
cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different
department, have been¿related¿into a single department, or if the cases were
already assigned to that department.” (LASC Local Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1).)
 
The purpose of consolidation is to
avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of procedure, particularly
in the proof of issues common to both action, and avoid inconsistent results by
hearing and deciding common issues together. 
(See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)  The granting or denial of a motion to
consolidate rests in the trial court's sound discretion, and will not be
reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. (Feliner v.
Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.) 
Each case presents its own facts and circumstances, but the court
generally considers the following: (1) timeliness of the motion: i.e., whether
granting consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2)
complexity: i.e., whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too
confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: i.e, whether consolidation
would adversely affect the rights of any party. (See State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430–431.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, the three
cases have not been deemed related. A Notice of Related Actions was filed on June
3, 2024 (after this motion was filed), which the Court denied. 
 
Defendants argue that these cases
involve motor vehicle accidents that occurred from December 18, 2018 to May
2019, involving the same Plaintiff but different defendants. Defendants contend
that Plaintiff was treated by the same medical providers and is represented by
the same counsel in all cases. Although Defendants seek to consolidate on the
basis of purportedly similar issues involving damages, as Defendants
acknowledge, all three cases involve separate automobile accidents. (Motion at
p. 8.)
 
Because the cases have not been
deemed related and are not pending in this department, the motion to
consolidate is denied. (LASC Local Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1).)
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to
Consolidate is DENIED. 
 
Defendants shall provide notice of
this order and file a proof of service of such.
