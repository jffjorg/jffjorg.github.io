And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to consolidate three cases: McGlew v. Carriger, McGlew v. Coxwell, and the current case, 20STCV48002. The defendants, Fatameh Shamie and Mohammed Shamie, sought to consolidate the cases on the basis of purportedly similar issues involving damages, but the cases involve separate automobile accidents. The judge notes that the cases have not been deemed related and are not pending in the same department, making consolidation not feasible. The judge references California Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, California Rules of Court rule 3.350, and LASC Local Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1), in support of the denial. The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of the order and file a proof of service.
