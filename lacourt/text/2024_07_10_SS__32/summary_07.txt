Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose a terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the following: (1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party." (Code Civ. Proc. ยง 2023.030(d).)
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390.)

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by defendants Rachel Carter and Andre Carter against plaintiff Angelica Rodriguez. The defendants are seeking to dismiss the complaint due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery served in October 2023 and also failed to comply with a May 3, 2024 order to serve verified responses. The court granted monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, but the sanctions were not paid. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not complied with the discovery orders and that lesser sanctions would not induce compliance. Therefore, the court grants the motion and dismisses the complaint as to the defendants. The court also dismisses the entirety of the complaint, as the only remaining defendants are unnamed Doe defendants. The court advances and vacates all dates.
