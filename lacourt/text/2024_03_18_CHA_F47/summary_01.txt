And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is a decision by the court regarding a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Ivan Escobar and D&M Home Inspections against the plaintiffs, Delia M. Gonzalez, Monica M. Gonzalez, and Jessica Acosta. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud, negligence, civil battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and premises liability. The court has sustained the demurrer to the entire complaint without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead their claims.

The court's analysis found that the plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to state any of the claims against the defendants, and that the complaint is uncertain as to the bases of the claims. The court also found that the plaintiffs have not attached a copy of any contract between themselves and the defendants, which is an essential element of a breach of contract claim.

The court has also sustained the motion to strike, which sought to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive and exemplary damages and emotional distress damages. As a result, the motion to strike is placed off calendar as moot.

The court has given the plaintiffs two opportunities to try to plead their claims, but they have failed to do so adequately. The court has therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
