  Case Number:  23STCV19069    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  74 Plaintiff People of the State of
California’s Motion to Strike Defendant Ultimate Host, LLC’s Answer.
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order striking Defendant Ultimate Host, LLC (“UHL”) Answer to the
Complaint. Plaintiff contends Defendant UHL has been unrepresented by legal
counsel since November 9, 2023. Defendant Jabli filed the Answer at issue on
behalf of himself and purportedly Defendant UHL. Plaintiff argues Defendant
Jabli may represent himself but cannot represent Defendant UHL absent a showing
that he is a licensed attorney in the State of California. The Court agrees. In
Clean Air Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit District (1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 576, the court held “Only persons who are active members of the
State Bar may practice law. A lay person who purports to represent a corporation
is engaged in the unlawful practice of law.” (Clean Air Transport Systems v.
San Mateo County Transit District (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578.)
The
court grants Plaintiff the People of the State of California’s motion to strike
Defendant Ultimate Host, LLC’s answer.  
Plaintiff shall give notice.
