And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the Answer filed by Defendant Ultimate Host, LLC (UHL) is invalid because it was filed by Defendant Jabli, who is not a licensed attorney in the State of California. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff, the People of the State of California, that only an active member of the State Bar may practice law, and that Defendant Jabli's representation of UHL is unlawful. As a result, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to strike UHL's Answer and requires the Plaintiff to give notice.
