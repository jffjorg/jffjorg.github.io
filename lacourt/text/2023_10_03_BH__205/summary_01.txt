```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to seal and motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff seeks to seal a pre-marital agreement that contains confidential financial information. The Court finds that there is an overriding interest in protecting personal financial information and that the sealing order is properly tailored to seal only the document that reveals the confidential information. The Court also finds that there is no less restrictive means to protect Plaintiff's privacy interests.

Regarding the motion to compel arbitration, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence. The arbitration provision is broad enough to encompass any dispute regarding the division of property between Plaintiff and Decedent. The Court also finds that Defendant is bound by the terms of the Agreement because he stands in the shoes of Decedent as the representative of her estate and trustee of her trust.

The Court further finds that Plaintiff did not waive his right to arbitrate by initiating this action. Plaintiff claims that he had to file the complaint to preserve his claims once his creditor's claims were rejected in the estate action. The Court finds that there is no prejudice to Defendant and that Plaintiff consistently sought to obtain agreement from Defendant to arbitrate the dispute.

Finally, the Court stays this action pending conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.
