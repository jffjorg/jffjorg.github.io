And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, which seeks to add a new cause of action for general negligence against the defendant. The plaintiff filed the original complaint in January 2021, and has since filed two amended complaints. The defendant moved to strike the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, and the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff then moved to file a Third Amended Complaint, which adds a new cause of action for general negligence.

The judge found that the plaintiff's new cause of action is not timely, as it is based on the same set of facts as the original complaint and refers to the same incident that occurred on February 3, 2019. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to provide a valid justification for the delay in filing the motion, and that the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence and added costs of preparation.

The judge noted that the plaintiff's new cause of action is not based on the same material facts and allegations as the original complaint, and therefore cannot relate back to the original complaint. The judge also cited California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a party seeking to amend a pleading to provide a valid justification for the delay and show that the amendment is necessary and proper.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file the Third Amended Complaint, and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
