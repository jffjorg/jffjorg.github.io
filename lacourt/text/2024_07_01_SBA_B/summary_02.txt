Summary:
The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to terminate the bond and authorize the release of collateral. The motion is premature as the Court has not "finally" determined the issues that would justify releasing the bond. The bond was required as part of the temporary restraining order (TRO) and the Court must ensure that the defendant is compensated for any damages sustained as a result of the TRO. The Court will continue to monitor the case and make a final determination on the bond after the main action is terminated.
