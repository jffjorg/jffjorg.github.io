B MONICA FEHN,    Plaintiff, Case No.:  20STCV31485 vs.  [Tentative] RULING  ADA RUBY LOZANO, et al.,   Defendants.       Hearing Date:                         July 1, 2024 Moving Parties:                      Plaintiff Monica FehnResponding Party:                  Defendants Ada Ruby Lozano, Javier Lozano, and Alex LozanoMotion to Tax CostsThe Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.RULINGThe Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED.BACKGROUNDOn August 18, 2020, Plaintiff Monica Fehn filed a complaint for (1) to invalidate bequests to caregivers, (2) to compel trustee to provide a copy of the terms of the trust, (3) financial elder abuse, (4) rescission of designation of beneficiary and all instruments that bequest to Defendants, and (5) quiet title.On September 3, 2020, Plaintiff filed a FAC for (1) to invalidate bequests to caregivers, (2) financial elder abuse, (3) rescission of designation of beneficiary, (4) quiet title, and (5) claim to determine ownership.Defendants were, among others, Ada Ruby Lozano, her husband Javier Lozano and their son, Alex Lozano.  All three Defendants were identified as beneficiaries of a number of bank accounts belonging to Beryl Lynn Kish, Monica’s stepmother.On December 2, 2021, the Court (Judge Mooney) granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action to quiet title.On May 23, 22023 a Code of Civil Procedure § 998 Offer to Compromise was served by attorney McBride on Plaintiff.A court trial was held and on January 3, 2024, the court issued its Final Statement of Decision.  The Court found that “no party is the prevailing party as all parties prevailed in very significant ways on the claims asserted in the Complaint.”  The Court had found in favor of Plaintiff on the cause of action to quiet title and in favor of Defendants on the other causes of action.On January 29, 2024, Judgment was entered.On February 1, 2024, Defendants filed a Memorandum of Costs, in the amount of $32,872.96.  Simultaneously Defendants filed a copy of a C.C.P. § 998 Offer to Compromise that had been served on Plaintiff May 23, 2023, but not accepted.LEGAL AUTHORITYThis Motion raises a number of legal arguments attacking the validity of Defendants’ claim to entitlement to an award of costs.  It is initially noted that this Court ruled that there was no prevailing party based on the outcome of the case.  Both Plaintiff and Defendants had achieved substantial victories.  Defendants, however, base their claim to entitlement to an award of costs on their May 23, 2023, Offer to Compromise under Code of Civil Procedure § 998.  Among other reasons, Plaintiff challenges the validity of the claim of entitlement on the basis that the Code of Civil Procedure § 998 offer of May 23, 2023, was not valid. “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.  This means that the prevailing party is entitled to all of his costs unless another statute provides otherwise.  Absent such statutory authority, the court has no discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party.”Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 128-29 (citations and internal quotations omitted); CCP §1032(b) (“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding”). CCP §1033.5(c) states, in relevant part:  “Any award for costs shall be subject to the following:              (1) Costs are allowable if incurred, whether or not paid.  (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation. (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.  (4) Items not mentioned in this section . . . may be allowed . . . in the Court’s discretion.” “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”  Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774 (citation omitted).   Id.  “The court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face.  If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.”  Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 131 (citations omitted).  “[I]t is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable.  Rather the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.”  Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1550, 1557.DISCUSSIONPlaintiff requests that the Court tax Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs filed on February 1, 2024.Plaintiff asserts that Defendants base their Memorandum of Costs on a C.C.P. §998 Offer to Compromise that was served on May 23, 2023, on behalf of Ruby Lozano, by Ruby Lozano’s counsel.  The C.C.P. § 998 offer provided that “Defendants Ada Ruby Lozano, Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano, collectively, will pay to Monica Fehn the total sum of $25,000; and…” in exchange, the pay-on-death beneficiaries of the various Logix accounts would remain as they existed at the time of Beryl Kish’s death and the offer was made in satisfaction of all claims for damages, costs, expenses, attorney’s fees, and interest in this action.  Plaintiff contends that at the time of the C.C.P. § 998 offer, Defendants Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano were representing themselves.  Thus, Plaintiff argues, the C.C.P. § 998 offer is defective as to Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano and they are not entitled to recover costs.Plaintiff also contends that the Memorandum is defective because Defendants failed to file a Memorandum of Costs worksheet itemizing each category of costs.  Moreover, Plaintiff asserts, the Court found no prevailing party.  Plaintiff also argues that the C.C.P. § 998 Offer was not made in good faith.In opposition, Defendants argue that the Court’s determination as to “no prevailing party” is independent of recovery of costs under C.C.P. §998.  Also, Defendants contend that the May 23, 2023, C.C.P. § 998 Offer was made on behalf of the three Defendants and that counsel was representing all three at the time.  Defendants point the Court to the Substitutions of Attorney signed on May 10, 2023, but not served and filed until late July 2023.Defendants assert that the Memorandum of Costs worksheet is not required but is attached to the Opposition.  Defendants argue that the requested costs are all proper as they were incurred after the May 23, 2023 C.C.P. § 998 Offer.  Defendants also argue that the C.C.P. § 998 Offer was made in good faith.In Reply, Plaintiff reiterates her argument that the C.C.P. § 998 Offer was not made in good faith because it offered Plaintiff only $25,000 and she stood to win $450,000 if she prevailed in her suit.  Plaintiff also contends that because the Substitution of Attorney forms were not filed until after the C.C.P. § 998 Offer was served, Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano were self-represented.  Plaintiff further argues that Defendants have not met their burden to support their cost bill.The Validity of the C.C.P. § 998 OfferIs an Offer to Compromise under C.C.P. § 998 made by an attorney of record for only one Defendant valid when it purports to offer to settle the entire case on behalf of three Defendants, obligates all three to pay money, and two of the Defendants are not represented of record by the attorney at the time that the Offer is made and may be accepted?  NO, the C.C.P. § 998 Offer is not valid as it is not binding on the two Defendants purportedly obligated to pay money to the Plaintiff.“When an attorney is changed, as provided in the last section, written notice of the change and of the substitution of a new attorney, or of the appearance of the party in person, must be given to the adverse party.  Until then he must recognize the former attorney.”  Code of Civil Procedure § 285. “The only attorneys of record for the appellant were Rich, Carlin and Fuidge.  No substitution or change of attorneys was made in the manner provided by sections 284 and 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The attorney of record has the exclusive right to appear in court for his client and neither the party himself nor another attorney should be recognized by the court in the conduct or disposition of the case.  People v. Merkouris, 46 Cal.2d 540, 554, 555, 297 P.2d 999; Wells Fargo & Co. v. City, etc., of S. F., 25 Cal.2d 37, 42, 152 P.2d 625.  Under section 285 written notice of the substitution of a new attorney must be given to the adverse party.  Until then the attorney of record must be recognized as his exclusive representative.”  Epley v. Califro (1958) 49 Cal.2d 849, 854 [323 P.2d 91, 95]This Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in its entirety as the C.C.P. § 998 Offer was not valid for the simple reason that the attorney who made it was not the attorney of record for two of the Defendants that would be purportedly bound by the Offer if it were accepted.  The Offer provided “Defendants Ada Ruby Lozano, Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano, collectively, will pay to Monica Fehn the total sum of $25,000; and…”It is a basic principle of law that an attorney has no authority in court to represent a client until that attorney has properly appeared for the client.  In this case, that required a substitution of attorney as both Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano represented themselves during the period that the Offer to Compromise was outstanding. See Code of Civil Procedure § 284.“‘While the client has an absolute right as above set forth to discharge his attorney at any stage of the proceeding, the substitution of an attorney of record can only be made in the manner provided in section 284, Code of Civil Procedure, 3 Cal.Jur. 639.“It is settled that the attorney of record has the exclusive right to appear in court for his client and to control the court proceedings, so that neither the party himself (citing cases), nor another attorney (citing cases) can be recognized by the court in the conduct or disposition of the case.’  Wells Fargo & Co. v. City and County of San Francisco, 25 Cal.2d 37, 42, 152 P.2d 625, 628.’Code of Civil Procedure, sections 284 and 285 set forth the statutory requirements for substituting attorneys.  Our primary concern here is not with the relationship created by the contract between the signators, but is focused upon the situation resulting to those entitled to rely upon the ostensible relationship launched by the contract and supported by the subsequent conduct of the signators.  The purpose of Civil Procedure, sections 284 and 285, is to guide the courts and protect opposing litigants from just such behind the scenes activities as those involved here.”  People ex rel. Department of Public Works v. Hook (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 618, 623–624 [56 Cal.Rptr. 683, 687]In this case on August 20, 2021, Defendant Ada Ruby Lozano had substituted as her counsel Julia C. McBride of McBride Law Group, P.C.  However, McBride was never substituted as counsel for Javier or Alex Lozano until late July 2023, long after the C.C.P. § 998 Offer had expired.  Instead, on August 30, 2021 both Javier Lozano and Alex Lozano filed and served Substitutions of Attorney substituting themselves as self-represented litigants.  From that moment until when they filed and served their July 26, 2023 Substitution of Attorney form only Javier and Alex Lozano could represent them in this action.  McBride had no authority to speak for either Javier or Alex Lozano and any C.C.P. § 998 Offer of Compromise purporting to settle the case for Alex or Javier Lozano was a nullity.  McBride could not obligate them “… pay to Monica Fehn the total sum of $25,000.”  Had Plaintiff accepted that Offer and filed it with the Court, she could not have enforced it against either Javier or Alex Lozano.It is irrelevant that McBride chose to list in the Offer to Compromise that the Offer was made on behalf of persons she did not represent of record in the action.  She is not capable of conferring authority upon herself simply by serving a document that purports to be on behalf of persons she does not represent of record.“The purpose of these statutes is to have the record of representation clear so the parties may be certain with whom they are authorized to deal.  (People v. Metrim Corp. (1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 289, 294, 9 Cal.Rptr. 584.)  Litigants are not required to investigate the relationship between opposing attorneys of record and their clients.  They and the courts have every right to rely on court records as binding on both litigants and the attorneys appearing of record on their behalf.  (People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. Hook (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 618, 624, 56 Cal.Rptr. 683.)”  McMillan v. Shadow Ridge at Oak Park Homeowner's Assn. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 960, 965 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 550, 554]No doubt, McBride could have obtained and served and filed Substitutions of Attorney either before or simultaneously with the Offer to Compromise establishing her authority to bind her clients to the Offer.  Or she could have obtained the signatures of Javier and Alex Lozano on the Offer to Compromise as they had authority to act on their own behalf.  What she could not do was make an Offer on behalf of persons she did not represent of record purporting to obligate those persons to the Offer terms.Nor may McBride save the invalidity of the Offer to Compromise by pointing to Substitutions of Attorney purportedly signed by Javier and Alex Lozano on May 10, 2023, but not served or filed until late July 2023, long after the May 23, 2023 Offer to Compromise had expired.  (See C.C.P. § 284 and McMillan v. Shadow Ridge at Oak Park Homeowner's Assn. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 960, 965 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 550, 554].)  The Court shall not speculate as to the reason that Substitutions of Attorneys, purportedly signed in May 2023, were not filed and served for months.  The reason is irrelevant to the issue to be determined.  Until filed and served, they are legally irrelevant.This determination disposes of this Motion.  Nonetheless the Court shall address other aspects of this MotionThe Appropriate Filing when Seeking C.C.P. § 998 Based Costs – Demonstrating EntitlementThis Court had determined that there was no prevailing party under C.C.P. § 1032.  That, however, does not preclude the recovery of costs pursuant to C.C.P. § 998.Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs was defective as it did not show an entitlement to recover costs and lacked necessary detail showing when the claimed costs were incurred.  No doubt, in the simple situation where a party is the prevailing party, and hence “entitlement” is already established by virtue of that status, the party claiming costs need not submit in the first instance information to establish “entitlement.”  And timing of costs is not relevant.  This, however, is not such a case.  In this case the Court had ruled that there was no “prevailing party” within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure § 1032.Therefore, in order to show “entitlement” more needed to be shown.  The Memorandum of Costs was filed by Defendants on the basis that they were entitled to recover costs because of their rejected C.C.P. § 998 Offer.  Thus, part of their prima facie showing arguably required that they show the foundational facts supporting the conclusion that there was a C.C.P. § 998 Offer that had been rejected, when it was made, and that costs incurred after the Offer were recoverable.  These three elements were necessary to establish “entitlement” and timing of costs.  Defendants filed their C.C.P. § 998 Offer to Compromise simultaneously with the Memorandum of Costs.  (It is unclear that the naked filing of the C.C.P. §998 Offer without anything more is sufficient to support the “entitlement” to costs listed on the Memorandum of Costs.)  However, because Defendants right to recover costs was statutorily limited to post-Offer costs, their Memorandum of Costs, lacking all information necessary to determine the timing of the costs, was arguably deficient.  On its face, the filing failed to show a basis for concluding that the costs were incurred in the relevant time period and hence were validly claimed under C.C.P. § 998.However, in light of the Court’s ruling on the invalidity of the C.C.P. § Offer, the Court need not base its ruling on this issue.The $25,000 Offer was Made in Good FaithPlaintiff claims that the offer to pay her $25,000 was not made in good faith within the meaning of C.C.P. § 998 as she stood to gain $450,000 if she prevailed.  That is not the test.  A much more detailed analysis is required to evaluate the claimed unreasonableness of the offer.In this case the Offer was made years into the case, when the relevant facts were known to the parties.  The Court has set forth the facts it found in its Statement of Decision.  Those facts, while disputed, were largely known by the time of the May 23, 2023 Offer to Compromise.  While the outcome in May 2023 was far from clear, the Offer to pay $25,000, in light of all the facts was not unreasonable within the meaning of C.C.P. § 998 such that it could be held to be lacking in good faith and hence invalid for that reason.ORDERThe motion is GRANTED.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of ruling.
