[2] That said, Defendants’
assertation (citing to Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518) that
that Elder Abuse is not a cause of action is not entirely accurate. As observed
by the appellate court in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 396, “[t]here is a split of
authority on whether the Elder Abuse Act creates an independent cause of
action or merely provides additional remedies for some other cause of action .
. . ‘We need not resolve this issue as, assuming arguendo that [the Act]
creates an independent cause of action, [plaintiffs'] allegations do not state
a claim against [the Hospital] for ...  abuse of an elder.’” (Id. at
p. 403, fn. 6, emphasis added.)
