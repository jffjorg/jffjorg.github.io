And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is based on the information presented to the court before today's hearing. The case involves the death of Domingo in January 2022. The defendants argue that Elder Abuse is not a cause of action, citing the case Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518. However, the court notes that there is a split of authority on whether the Elder Abuse Act creates an independent cause of action, as observed in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396. The court does not intend to resolve this issue, but rather states that even assuming the Act creates an independent cause of action, the plaintiffs' allegations do not state a claim against the hospital for abuse of an elder.
