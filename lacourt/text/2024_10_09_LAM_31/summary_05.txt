And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The court is considering the plaintiff's unconscionability challenge to the arbitration agreement, which includes a delegation clause. The court cites Malone v. Superior Ct. (2014) and Rent-A-Center, supra, 561 U.S. at p. 70, which state that if a party challenges the entire agreement, including the delegation clause, the clause is severed out and enforced, and the arbitrator will determine whether the agreement is enforceable. However, if the party specifically challenges the delegation clause, the court must determine whether the clause itself may be enforced before delegating the issue to the arbitrator.

The court also notes that MBUSA, as a third-party beneficiary, may be included in the agreement and satisfy the test elucidated in Goonewardene. The court references Baglieri v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (N.D. Cal., Aug. 27, 2024, No. 24-CV-00520-MMC), which states that parties can intend their contract to benefit a third-party beneficiary by simply naming them as a person entitled to compel arbitration.
