And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Noemi Alegria, et al. v. Cesar Rodriguez, et al. The case involves a landlord-tenant dispute, where the plaintiffs, Noemi Alegria and her minor children, are seeking damages from the defendants, Cesar Rodriguez and Santiago Reyes, for various alleged breaches of contract and negligence. The defendants are asking the court to set aside a default judgment entered against Rodriguez.

The judge notes that Rodriguez claims he did not receive the summons and complaint in the case, and that the complaint was left in his garden. He is seeking to set aside the default judgment and default on the grounds that service of process was defective.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to October 31, 2024, and has given the parties until October 18 and 25, 2024 to file supplemental briefs. The judge has also noted that the parties may submit additional briefing as to whether the presumption of proper service has been rebutted.
