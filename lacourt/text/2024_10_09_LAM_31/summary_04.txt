And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration in a lemon law action. The plaintiff, Brandon Kupfer, leased a 2023 Mercedes-Benz C43 from WI Simonson, but the vehicle had issues with the "check engine" and "check brake fluid" warning lights and the transmission began to jerk. The authorized service and repair facility failed to conform the vehicle to the warranties.

The court finds that the arbitration agreement in the Consumer Lease Agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, has standing to compel arbitration as a third-party beneficiary. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration and stays the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration. A post-arbitration status conference is set for July 9, 2025.
