And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for entry of judgment against the defendant, Michael Field, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The defendant has breached his obligations under the agreement, including failing to cooperate with the sale of the property, paying his share of mortgage and other expenses, and maintaining and repairing the property. The judge has ordered the sale of the property, with the plaintiff choosing the listing realtor, listing price, and final sale price. The defendant must cooperate with the sale, including executing required documents, allowing the plaintiff to clean and perform necessary maintenance on the property, and vacating the property during showings and inspections. The plaintiff will be reimbursed from the defendant's share of the sale proceeds for any payment in excess of the plaintiff's share of the mortgage and other expenses, as well as attorney fees relating to the property. The court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. A status conference is set for June 4, 2025, to discuss the sale of the property, distribution of funds, and entry of judgment.
