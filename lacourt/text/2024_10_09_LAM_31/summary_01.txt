And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery in a case involving a breach of a written lease agreement. The plaintiff, Sig Ep Housing of California Beta, LLC, seeks to discover the defendant, Savas Sirkci's, personal financial records to determine whether Sirkci utilized Zumaworks (the signatory to the lease agreement) as an alter ego to shield himself from personal liability.

The Judge has granted the motion in part, ordering Sirkci to produce documents responsive to the request for production of documents (RFP) No. 54 within 45 days of the agreed upon protective order. The relevant time period for the production is from March 2017 to March 2020.

The Judge has also ordered the parties to submit an agreed upon protective order covering the limited use of the financial records within 10 court days of the order. The disclosure of the financial records shall be subject to the protective order.

Additionally, the Judge has declined to impose any sanctions against Sirkci, finding that Sirkci had substantial justification in opposing the motion to compel.
