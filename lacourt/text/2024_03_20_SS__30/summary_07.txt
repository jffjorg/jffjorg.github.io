English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Tracye Jackson's motion for monetary sanctions against Defendants Joshua Tolentino and Caring Hearts, Caring Hands in the reduced amount of $874.15. The Court finds that the Defendants failed to comply with discovery orders and there is no substantial justification for this failure. The Court notes that the Defendants were aware of the discovery requests and had a duty to respond, but instead, they served responses late. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's counsel spent 2.5 hours on the motion and a filing fee of $61.65, which justifies the reduced amount of sanctions.
