The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Wayne Edward Holloway, to vacate a default judgment and reconsider the case. The motion was filed late and the judge finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient grounds for relief. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not shown excusable neglect or mistake, and that the motion is untimely. Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff's reliance on certain statutes is misplaced. As a result, the judge denies the motion.
