And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's counsel's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. The counsel's motion complies with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1362, which requires notice of the motion, a declaration stating the basis for the withdrawal, service of the notice and motion on all parties, and a proposed order relieving counsel. The counsel declares that the basis for the withdrawal is confidential and requests an in-camera hearing to communicate specific facts demonstrating good cause for withdrawal. Since none of the parties opposed the motion and prejudice is unlikely, the motion is granted. The effective date of the order is delayed until the counsel files proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client.
