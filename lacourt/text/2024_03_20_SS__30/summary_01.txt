```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and production of documents, but only partially. The plaintiff had failed to appear for her deposition and had not objected to the deposition notice. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order that her deposition be conducted remotely due to her concerns about COVID-19. The judge found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support her request for a remote deposition and that the parties must comply with the statutes governing depositions, including CCP § 2025.310. The judge has denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
