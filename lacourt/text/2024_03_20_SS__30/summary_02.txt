And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of a disputed claim of a minor and has determined that the settlement is reasonable. The court has also reviewed the fee request and has approved a fee of 25% of the gross settlement. The court has set aside a portion of the settlement proceeds for the minor's benefit and has instructed the petitioner to hold the money in trust for the minor's benefit until the minor reaches the age of majority. The court has also scheduled an OSC (Order to Show Cause) hearing for 60 days to ensure that the settlement proceeds have been deposited. If the parties require the court to retain jurisdiction of the matter after dismissal, they must file a stipulation pursuant to CCP 664.6.
