Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendants is overruled. The complaint alleges that the defendants, including 730 N. La Cienega LLC, Koi LP, and others, transferred assets to render Koi LP judgment-proof. The complaint also alleges that the transfer was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. The Judge concludes that the complaint states a cause of action for fraudulent transfer and that the demurrer is without merit. The Judge also notes that the defendants' arguments regarding the conspiracy theory are not well-taken and that the claim survives despite the sufficiency of the conspiracy allegations.
