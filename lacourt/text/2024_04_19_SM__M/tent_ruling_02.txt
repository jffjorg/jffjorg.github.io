Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants 730 N. La Cienega, LLC, Koi LP, Nick Haque, 734 LCB, LLC, and
Koi Group, Inc. demur to the first cause of action in Plaintiff Cienega
Ventures, LLC’s complaint. Defendants argue that the fraudulent transfer fails
to state all the required elements, and that the complaint states no cause of
action at all.
 
Defendants cite no published authority stating that a fraudulent transfer
needs to be pled with the same specificity as a fraud claim. Defendants cite
the general proposition that fraud must be pled specifically, and general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice. (Lazar v. Superior Ct., (1996) 12
Cal. 4th 631, 645.) However, there is no authority that this rule applies to
fraudulent transfers. Notably, the elements of fraud necessarily include a
known misrepresentation of a material fact, intending to induce and inducing
actual and justifiable reliance by a plaintiff. (Orient Handel v. United
States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 684, 693.) The heightened
particularity for fraud requires pleading facts that "show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered." (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) As will be discussed,
fraudulent transfers share none of these elements, including a misrepresentation.
The heightened pleading standard could not apply to a fraudulent transfer which
does not involve misrepresentations. Simply put, there is no way to plead “how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered” when
no representation was required. Thus, the Court would not hold Plaintiff to the
heightened pleading standard of fraud.
 
Generally, a “fraudulent conveyance is a transfer by the debtor
of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor
from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.” (Kirkeby v. Superior
Court of Orange County (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 648; quoting Yaesu
Electronics Corp. v. Tamura (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 8, 13.) To
plead a fraudulent transfer claim, a plaintiff must establish: 1) transfer made
or obligation incurred by a debtor; 2) with actual intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud any creditor of debtor; 3) without receiving a reasonably equivalent
value in exchange for the transfer or obligation: a) debtor was engaged or was
about to engage in a business or a transaction for which remaining assets were
unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or b) intended
to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that debtor would
incur, debts beyond ability to pay as they became due; and 4) injury to the
creditor. (Civil Code §§3439.04(a), 3439.05.) A transfer can be invalid either
because of actual fraud (Civ. Code § 3439.04(a)) or constructive fraud (Civ.
Code § 3439.04(b), 3439.05). 
 
“Whether a transfer is made with fraudulent intent and
whether a transferee acted in good faith and gave reasonably equivalent value
within the meaning of [Civil Code] section 3439.08, subdivision (a), are
questions of fact.” (Nautilus, Inc. v. Yang, (2017) 11 Cal. App.
5th 33, 40; see Kirkeby, supra, 33 Cal.4th at 651 [fraudulent
transfer sufficiently alleged based on defendant’s transfer of property with
the intent to defraud, hinder or delay creditors in collection].) In
determining intent, the statutory scheme lays out several factors for
consideration, though no single factor is dispositive. (Annod Corp. v.
Hamilton & Samuels (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1298 [proof of
fraudulent intent in conveyances often comes from inferences from the
surrounding circumstances].) Such factors include whether the transfer or
obligation was to an insider, whether the debtor retained possession or control
of the transferred property, whether the transfer was concealed, etc. (See Civ.
Code § 3439.04(b).)
 
Despite Defendants’ arguments to the contrary, Plaintiff
identifies a transfer: “in late 2022, defendant Koi LP transferred to defendant
734 LCB the entirety of Koi LP’s business, operations, and assets, including
but not limited to: the trade name, goodwill, employees, phone numbers, email
addresses, website, menus, recipes, supplier contracts, equipment, cash, and accounts
receivable (the “Transfer”).” (Compl., ¶ 21.) The complaint also alleges that
at that juncture, Defendants reasonably should have expected that they would
incur a debt to Plaintiff. As a matter of fact, during the defense of the underlying
Lease Action, it became clear to 730 North, Haque, and Koi LP that the claims
would survive and reasonably anticipated a substantial judgment against them. (Id.)
730 North, however, had insufficient assets to cover an anticipated judgment.
(Id.) Koi LP, on the other hand, had a restaurant, income and assets, and was a
subtenant of the Premises. (Id.) 
 
The complaint further alleges that “the purpose of the
Transfer was to render Koi LP judgment proof,” i.e., with an intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud Plaintiff to collect on a judgment against Koi LP. (Id.) There
are at least two statutory factors tending to show the requisite intent. For
example, Haque allegedly retains control over all of the entities, including
the transferor and transferee. (Compl., ¶ 49.) Further, the transfer was
made after Koi LP had been sued, the transfer was of substantially all the Koi
LP’s assets, the value of the consideration received by Koi LP was not the reasonably
equivalent to the value of the asset transferred, and Koi LP became insolvent
shortly due to the transfer. (Compl., ¶ 21.) These factors support the
statutorily required intent. 
 
All of the other elements for fraudulent transfer are alleged
as matters of ultimate fact. For instance, the complaint further alleges that
“the Transfer was for no or insufficient consideration” and that Plaintiff has
been harmed by the Transfer in that, as a result of the Transfer, Plaintiff
will be unable to collect on its anticipated judgment in the Lease Action.
(Id., ¶¶ 21, 28.) 
 
Defendants attack the conspiracy allegations. However, Defendants do not
address all the alleged theories of liability, including allegations concerning
agency or alter ego. (Compl., ¶¶ 20, 44, 49.) Thus, even if their arguments
regarding the conspiracy theory were well taken, the arguments would not defeat
the first cause of action or the entire complaint. As these additional theories
form independent bases for liability, the claim survives irrespective of the
sufficiency of the conspiracy allegations.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
