And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Artur Ketikyan, is entitled to enforce the settlement agreement made in open court on September 26, 2023. The settlement agreement was made between the plaintiff and the defendants, including Gurgen Khachatryan, Abraham Stepanian, Ted Khachatryan, WRH, LLC, Westside Residential Holdings, LLC, and Artyom Khachatryan.

The settlement agreement provided for the payment of $1 million within 60 days of the settlement agreement, and also provided for the waiver of certain claims and the confidentiality of the agreement. The parties agreed that the agreement would be enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

The defendants opposed the motion to enter judgment, arguing that the settlement agreement was invalid because the plaintiff could not provide a notarized signature from Mr. Ketikyan. However, the court finds that the notarization requirement was not material to the settlement agreement, and that the plaintiff has apparently complied with the term requiring notarized signatures.

The court concludes that the oral settlement agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the defendants have refused to abide by the express terms of the oral settlement agreement by refusing to pay the promised $1 million to the plaintiff within 60 days of the settlement agreement.

The court orders the plaintiff to prepare a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling. The court also awards the plaintiff prejudgment interest in the amount of $39,703.90, and awards the plaintiff's counsel fees and costs in the amount of $15,000.00, plus costs of $61.65.
