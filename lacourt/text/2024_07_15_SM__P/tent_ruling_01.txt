  Case Number:  23SMCV02548    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
John Tebbens v.
McKay McKinnon, M.D. et al., Case No. 23SMCV02548 
Hearing date July 15,
2024
Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center’s Motions to Compel Discovery from Plaintiff 
 
Plaintiff Tebbens
alleges medical malpractice claims against defendants McKinnon and Cedars-Sinai
Health Ventures dba Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Defendant Cedars moves to
compel the deposition of plaintiff, responses to discovery requests, and to
deem request for admissions admitted, as well as monetary sanctions. Plaintiff
opposes.
 
Compel Discovery Responses
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. CCP §2030.290(b). The same
applies to a party that fails to respond to a request for document production. CCP
§2031.300(b). CCP § 2033.280(b), provides that if a party fails to respond to a
request for admission, “[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted”.
 
CCP §§2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) provides for sanctions unless
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
Defendant served discovery requests on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff has
not responded. On March 15, 2024, the court ordered plaintiff to respond to the
discovery by April 30, 2024. Plaintiff has still not responded. 
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel discovery responses, and deem requests
for admission admitted are GRANTED. However, imposition of sanctions would be
unjust based on plaintiff’s representations that he is focusing on staying
housed due to the injuries sustained. Sanctions are denied. If plaintiff plans
to pursue this case, he must respond with verified answers, without objection, within
15 court days, or the court will consider a motion to strike the answer, based
on plaintiff’s failure to participate in the litigation and obey court orders.
 
Compel Deposition
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” CCP §2025.450(a). Where a motion to compel a party’s
appearance and testimony at deposition is granted, the court shall impose a
monetary sanction, unless the court finds the one subject to sanctions acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).
 
Defendant sent a notice setting deposition for May 2, 2024, which
plaintiff did not respond or object to until 24 hours prior to it. Plaintiff is
to sit for deposition within 30 days on a date convenient to the parties.
GRANTED. The court declines to award sanctions.
