And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Syed, et al. v. Swyft Technologies US, Inc., et al. (Case No. 23SMCV03092). The plaintiffs, Syed and Kundra, have requested entry of default judgment against the defendant, Swyft Technologies US, Inc. The judge notes that the defendant defaulted on January 8, 2024, and the plaintiffs are seeking costs of $950.46, which is justified by the evidence. The plaintiffs are also seeking declaratory relief, which would establish ownership of the defendant's outstanding equity. However, the judge notes that the plaintiffs failed to provide any evidence in support of this requested finding. As a result, the judge is uncertain about the merits of the declaratory relief request and may continue the matter for the plaintiffs to present evidence in support of their claim.
