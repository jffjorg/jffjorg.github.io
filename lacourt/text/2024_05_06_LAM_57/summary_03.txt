Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Zvi Sperling vs. Jacob Sperling. In this case, Zvi Sperling has moved to compel Jacob Sperling to produce documents that Jacob claims are privileged. Jacob Sperling has argued that the documents, which include email communications between himself and his counsel, are protected by attorney-client privilege and/or work product privilege. Zvi Sperling, on the other hand, argues that Jacob's claim of privilege is waived because the communications were disclosed to Naomi Sperling, Jacob's daughter, and Samuel Levy, Jacob's accountant.

The Court has ruled in favor of Jacob Sperling, finding that the attorney-client communications are protected by Evidence Code Section 952, which defines the phrase "confidential communications between client and lawyer" to mean information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence. The Court has also ruled that the disclosure of the communications to Naomi Sperling and Samuel Levy was reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information between Jacob and his counsel or the accomplishment of the purpose for which counsel was consulted.
