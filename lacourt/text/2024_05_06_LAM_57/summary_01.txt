Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine (MIL) filed by both parties. The ruling addresses various issues, including the admissibility of certain evidence, the scope of expert testimony, and the relevance of certain facts.

The judge has granted several MILs, including:

* Excluding reference to non-precedential court or administrative rulings
* Excluding evidence of other claims or lawsuits
* Excluding reference to insurance coverage
* Excluding evidence of settlement negotiations
* Excluding reference to common carrier status

The judge has denied several MILs, including:

* Excluding expert testimony regarding the interpretation and application of the law
* Excluding expert testimony regarding accident reconstruction
* Excluding reference to victim status

The judge has deferred several MILs to a later date, including those related to expert testimony and the scope of deposition testimony.

The judge has instructed the parties to prepare for a hearing on May 6, 2024, to discuss the tentative rulings and any outstanding issues.
