  Case Number:  18STCV07245    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  57 Set forth below are the Court's tentative rulings on the parties' motions in limine.   The Court will entertain argument about these rulings at the hearing on May 6, which is the scheduled start date of the trial in this case.  At the hearing, the Court also will discuss with the parties the witness list, which still shows that this auto accident case will last 20 days.  That is simply too long .   The Court also will, time permitting, discuss the exhibit list and jury instructions. 
BAKLAYAN’S MOTIONS IN LIMINE 
# 1 
Health Insurance or Medicare/Medical Reimbursement Rates
[To be Decided ]
# 2 
Traffic Collision Report  
GRANT as to the officer’s conclusions
in the report.  DENY as to statements
made in the report that constitute admissible hearsay or the officers
observations on scene, which would be admissible as a business record. 
# 3 
Accident Reconstruction Testimony from Office Twycross 
GRANT. 
Twycross is not an accident reconstruction expert.  That said, Twycross can testify about skid
marks and other evidence he may have seen at the scene.  Such testimony does not involve accident
reconstruction.
# 4   
Exclude D Experts Michlaski, Molina, Buzas, Renteria, and Wang
DENIED
# 5   
Civil or Criminal Wrongdoing of Ps Non-Retained Expert Tauber
DENIED.   Evidence Code Section 788 provides that the credibility
of a witness may be impeached through evidence or acknowledgment of the
witness’s prior convictions for crimes of moral turpitude.  (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th
856, 931.)  In a criminal case, the court
must under Evidence Code Section 352 balance the probative value of the
conviction of a crime of moral turpitude for impeachment purposes against
prejudice to the party who has called the witness to testify (often the
defendant himself or herself). (Id. ) 
Impeachment of witnesses based on convictions for crimes of moral
turpitude is appropriate in civil cases, and the court may employ the Section
352 balancing approach required in criminal cases.   (Robbins v. Wong (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 267, 274.)   Fraud is a crime
of moral turpitude.  (People v.
Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.App.4th 393, 433.)  
Factors that are part of the Section 352 balancing test include the
remoteness of the conviction in time and the overlap between the past
conviction and what is being alleged in the case at hand.  Here, Tauber’s conviction for fraud came
around the same time as his treatment of Plaintiff, and Defendants here are
challenging Trauber’s billings for medical expenses, which is  essentially what his fraud conviction was
about.
# 6 
Plaintiff’s Medical Records
DENIED. 
This MIL is too broad.  Medical
records are admissible if they qualify under Evidence Code Section 1271’s business
record exception.  And  statements in the records made by Plaintiff
herself to medical providers are admissible under Section 1220.  Additionally, there may be some statements
made by a provider to the person who made the note that are inadmissible.
# 7  
Case Specific Hearsay Under Sanchez
DENIED. 
Not an appropriate MIL as it just says that Defendants’ experts have to
comply with Sanchez.   Plaintiff
has not pointed to anything in an expert report that indicates that Defendants’
experts will, in contravention of Sanchez, be testifying to case
specific hearsay when that hearsay is not subject to any exception.  This is akin to an MIL that ask the court to
bar the other sides’ witnesses from testifying to irrelevant matters, without
any reference to some particular irrelevant matter to which the witnesses might
testify.
# 8 Medical Malpractice Actions Against
Dr. Obukhoff and Criminal Indictments of Obukhoff
GRANTED.  The medical malpractice actions against Obukhoff
are remote in time.   And this is not a
medical malpractice case.  Any probative
value of the indictment of Obukhoff is outweighed by the prejudice to Plaintiff.  Obukhoff was investigated and charged but not
convicted.  This is different from Tauber,
who was convicted for a crime that was contemporaneous with Plaintiff’s
tratement and that is related to his billing practices, which overlaps with
what Defendants will try to argue about his bills here.
# 9 
Precluding Reference to P’s Treatment on a Lien Basis 
[To be determined]
# 10 Limit Defendants’ Experts to What
They Said in Deposition (Kennemur)
DENIED. 
There is opposition yet. But there is no need to wait for that.  This is not an appropriate MIL.  It just says that Defendants’ experts should
comply with the law, but it does not point to anything that suggests that they
will not do that.
# 11 
Preclude Playing Deposition Video or Reading From Deposition Transcript

[No opposition filed yet.  Deferred until an opposition is filed and
reviewed]
 
UBER
# 1 
Exclude Reference to Non-Precedential Court or Administrative Rulings
GRANTED.  The Court will instruct on the law governing
the relationship between Uber and Hu.  The
Court is concerned that Plaintiff may try to invade the Court’s province and
introduce evidence or argument about non-precedential court or administrative
rulings addressing the relationship between Uber and Uber drivers.   Plaintiff’s opposition did not state that it
will or will not rely on the rulings. 
# 2 Exclude Reference to Assembly
Bill 5
GRANTED   The Court will instruct on the law governing
the relationship between Uber and Hu. 
The Court is concerned that Plaintiff may to try to invade the Court’s
province and introduce or argue about this legislation, which post-dates the
accident that gives rise to the suit and is not retroactive.  Plaintiff’s opposition did not state that it
will or will not rely on the legislation.
# 3 
Exclude Reference to PUC Regulatory Requirement as to Evidence of
Control to Establish Employment or Agency 
GRANTED.  Same as 1 and 2
# 4    Exclude
Use of Prejudicial  Employment
Terminology 
DENIED     Terminology such as “Uber Driver,” or
“calling an Uber” is not prejudicial.  Plaintiff
has to prove vicarious liability.  Saying
that Hu is an “Uber Driver” or that Plaintiff “called an Uber” does not
establish vicarious liability.  And Uber
will be able to negate such references and put Plaintiff to her paces of
proving vicarious liability.    But the Court does not see a basis to
preclude Plaintiff from asserting that Hu is “an Uber Driver,” or that Plaintiff
“called an Uber.”   This does not invade the province of the Court
regarding instructions on vicarious liability. 

# 5 
Exclude Media Coverage/Negative Uber Coverage 
DENIED. 
Media coverage of Uber, positive or negative, is hearsay.   But if
media coverage quotes an Uber representative or entails a video of an Uber
representative speaking, that hearsay may be admissible under Evidence Code
Section 1220.  Of course, even if
admissible hearsay, media coverage has to be relevant, and that could be an
independent ground to exclude depending on what is said in the coverage.  But this MIL’s preemptive strike is too
broad.
# 6 
Exclude Evidence of Other Claims or Lawsuits
GRANTED.   Introduction of such evidence likely will
devolve into a trial within a trial about what those law suits were, or were
not, about and what happened in them.  This
implicates Evidence Code Section 352’s concern with presentation of evidence
that will entail an undue consumption of time.
# 7 Limit Past Medical Expenses Per
Howell
[To Be Determined]
# 8 
Exclude Any Witnesses or Documents or Evidence Not Disclosed in
Evidence
DENIED. 
It is a given that a party may not call witnesses or seek to introduce
documents or evidence not disclosed in discovery.   If there is some particular witness,
document, or piece of evidence that Uber believes, based on the joint witness
or exhibit list, that Plaintiff intends to call/introduce, Uber should raise
that with the Court at the final conference regarding witnesses /exhibits.   Plaintiff will be limited to the witnesses
and exhibits on the witness and exhibit lists, other than impeachment exhibits,
but even as to those, they need to have been disclosed in discovery.  
# 9 
Exclude Reference to 
Commissions and Compensation Structure for Drivers 
DENIED. 
This evidence bears on the nature of relationship between Uber and
drivers who use Uber’s technology and thus bears on the issue of vicarious
liability.  Uber can argue at trial that
this evidence does not show vicarious liability.  But Uber has not shown a basis to have this
evidence excluded.
# 10 Exclude Reference to the Golden
Rule or Reptilian Theory
DENIED. 
Invocations of the Golden Rule are 
improper.  This MIL asks Plaintiff
to obey the law on the Golden Rule.  That
is not a proper use an MIL
As to Reptilian Theory, Uber does note
cite any precedent that describes what this theory is and why references to it
should be excluded
# 11 
Exclude Reference to Any Other Claims or Lawsuits Against Uber Defendants

DENIED. 
From the caption, this MIL looks to be redundant of Uber’s MIL # 6.  The body of the MIL, however, indicates that
the MIL is directed at barring Plaintiff from referring to claims not alleged
in Plaintiff’s complaint.  This is not a
proper subject of a MIL.   The Court will
instruct the jury on the law governing Plaintiff’s claims based on the claims
set forth in the complaint.  As set forth
below, however, the Court is granting Uber’s MIL # 18 barring Plaintiff from referring
to Uber’s status as a common carrier, which is not alleged in the complaint.
# 12 
Preclude Plaintiff From Referencing Damage Award Amounts During Voir
Dire or Opening Statements
DENIED.   Uber cites no precedent to support this MIL.
# 13 Exclude/Preclude Evidence,
Testimony, or Reference to Uber’s Size and Wealth or Financial Condition

GRANTED.  CACI 117, to which Plaintiff has agreed,
instructs the jury that “wealth or poverty is not relevant to any of the issues
that you must decide.”  It appears from her
opposition that, notwithstanding CACI 117,  Plaintiff intends to refer to the finances of
the Uber Defendants.  Counsel for both
sides may ask potential jurors in voir dire if they have a bias against
corporations and thus would favor an individual plaintiff in a suit against a corporation.  But beyond that general reference to Uber’s
status as a corporation, Plaintiff’s counsel shall not present evidence,
testimony or reference to Uber’s size and wealth/financial condition.
# 14  Exclude Witnesses/Attorneys from Commenting
on Standard of Law
DENIED.  Plaintiff’s attorneys are allowed to make
reference in a mini- opening statement during voir dire, and opening and
closing argument to the jury, regarding  the
standards of the law on which the Court will instruct the jurors.  This MIL is so broad that it would preclude Plaintiffs’
attorneys from making that sort of reference. 
Witnesses, too, can make reference during testimony to the standards of
law on which the Court will instruct the jury. For example, a witness can testify
on whether Hu’s driving was reasonable, a particular medical procedure was reasonable,
or a medical bill was reasonable.  That
testimony touches on the legal standards on which the jury will be instructed. 
# 15 Exclude
Witnesses From Courtroom Prior to Testifying
GRANTED.  Evidence Code Section 777 gives trial courts
broad discretion to exclude witnesses from the courtroom prior to testifying,
including expert witnesses.  (People
v. Valdez (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 680, 687.) 
The Court is exercising that discretion here.   This ruling does not to extend to the
Plaintiff herself and to Defendant Hu.  They
are party/witnesses who may be in the courtroom when not testifying.
# 16  Exclude Reference to Settlement Negotiations 
DENIED.   Statements made in connection with
settlement negotiations are not admissible at trial to show liability.   (Evidence Code Section 1152; Simandle v.
Vista de Santa Barbara Associates (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th131, 1323.)  Such statements may, however, be admissible
to show the bias or prejudice of a witness. 
(Moreno v. Sayre (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 116, 126.)   This MIL sweeps too broadly because, if
granted, it would cut off Plaintiff’s right to use a statement in settlement negotiations
to show bias or prejudice.  Whether the
statement is being used for that permissible purpose, or an impermissible one,
is best addressed through objections at trial.
# 17 Reference to Insurance Coverage

GRANTED.  Evidence Code 1155 and CACI 1105 render
irrelevant the existence of insurance or lack thereof for a party.  It would thus seem at first blush that this
MII is unnecessary because it essentially seeks an order directing Plaintiff to
comply with the law, which is not what MILs are supposed to be about.   However, in opposition to the MIL, Plaintiff
stated that the existence of insurance may be relevant if Uber contends that it
lacks resources to pay a large damages award.  Plaintiff cited no authority for  this proposition, and the Court is unaware of
any.  Accordingly, under the circumstances
where Plaintiff seems to believe that there is room to argue about Uber’s insurance
coverage, the Court will grant this MIL.
# 18 
Exclude Evidence Comments and References Regarding Common Carrier

GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege that
Uber is a common carrier.  Plaintiff has
not sought leave to amend her complaint to make that allegation.  Nor did Plaintiff’s responses to discovery
propounded by Uber assert that Uber is responsible for Hu’s conduct because
Uber is a common carrier.
 
HU’S MOTIONS IN LIMINE 
# 1 Preclude Reference to Evidence Property
Requested But Not Produced in Discovery 
DENIED. 
The basis for the Court’s denial of Hu’s MIL # 1 is the same as for its
denial of Uber’s MIL # 8, discussed above.
# 2 
Preclude Plaintiff From Presenting Expert Testimony Not Reviewed Prior
to Expert Deposition and Matters Exceeding the Scope of Deposition 
DENIED. 
The basis for the Court’s denial of Hu’s MIL # 2 is the same as for its
denial of Plaintiff’s MIL # 10, discussed above.
# 3   
Prohibit Plaintiff From Asking Prospective Jurors if They Could Award
Certain Amount of Damages 
DENIED. 
The basis for the Court’s denial of Hu’s MIL # 3 is the same as for its
denial of Uber’s MIL # 12, discussed above.
# 4 
Preclude Plaintiff From Introducing Evidence Regarding Hu’s Liability
Insurance 
GRANTED.   The
basis for the Court’s decision to grant this MIL is the same as for its
decision to grant Uber’s MIL # 17, discussed above.
# 5 
Exclude Reference to Plaintiff as a Victim
GRANTED.   Calling the Plaintiff a “victim” in an auto
accident case is unduly prejudicial.  Plaintiff
may, however, be described as being “wronged” or “injured.”
# 6 
Exclude Plaintiff’s Non-Retained Experts From Testifying at Trial
[To be determined.  This MIL was filed two months ago.  The Court will inquire at the MIL conference
what has happened with respect to depositions of Plaintiff’s non-retained
experts since then.  This will also
related to a conference the Court will have with the parties about why this car
crash case needs to consume four weeks of trial time, which is what the
estimates on the joint witness list project.]
# 7 
Exclude Expert Witness Testimony Regarding Interpretation and/or
Application of the Law and/or Legal Conclusions
GRANTED.   This MIL is directed at Plaintiff’s accident
reconstruction expert Jospeh Yates.  
Yates may testify as to how the accident happened.  That testimony will inform the jury’s determination
whether Hu was negligent and his negligence caused the accident.  But Yates is not allowed to testify that Hu
violated the Vehicle Code or the DMV Handbook because that invades the province
of the Court to instruct on the law and the province of the jury to determine if
that law was violated.
