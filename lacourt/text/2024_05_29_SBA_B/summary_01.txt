And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production without objection. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objection within 20 days. The judge also deems the requests for admission as admitted against the plaintiff. The defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $561.65 is also granted. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses constitutes a waiver of all objections, and that the plaintiff's unverified responses do not substantially comply with the relevant statutes.
