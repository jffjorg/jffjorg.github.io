BACKGROUND

negligence.  
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP
§2030.290
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply:
(a)
The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection
to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.
(2)
The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b)
The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.
(c)
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
CCP
§2031.300
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
apply:
(a)
The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.
(2)
The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b)
The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.
(c)
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
(d)(1)
Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the court
shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to
provide electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered,
or overwritten as a result of the routine, good faith operation of an
electronic information system.
(2)
This subdivision shall not be construed to alter any obligation to preserve
discoverable information.   
CCP
§2033.280
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply:
(a)
The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
            (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230.
            (2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b)
The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).
(c)
The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
Emke requests that the Court order Plaintiff Watt to respond to Emke’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (set one) and Requests for
Production (set One) without objection. Defendant Emke also requests that the
Court deem Emek’s Requests for Admission (Set One).  Defendant Emke requests sanctions in the
amount of $561.65 for each motion to compel. 

            Defendant
Emke served all four sets of discovery on Plaintiff on January 11, 2024.  (Motions, Labat Dec.[1],
¶3.)  Plaintiff failed to serve any responses
by the due date of February 14, 2024 (30 days plus 2 court days for email
service).  (Id. at ¶3.)  After sending two meet and confer emails,
Plaintiff’s counsel responded on February 27, 2024 by email with an agreement
to serve verified responses without objections. 
(Id. at ¶8.)  On March 21,
2024, Plaintiff served unverified responses to the RFAs.  (Motion to Compel RFAs, Labat Dec., ¶11.)  As to the Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production, no responses at all have been
received.  (Motion to Compel Form
Interrogatories, Labat Dec., ¶11; Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories,
Labat Dec., ¶17 [incorrectly numbered] and Requests for Production, Labat Dec.,
¶11.)
            Plaintiff
Watt has waived all objections by failing to serve timely responses. Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses without objection to the Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production within 20
days.  
            Plaintiff
Watt’s unverified responses to the RFAs do not preclude deeming the RFAs
admitted against her.  Unverified
responses are tantamount to no responses at all.  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal. App. 3d 632, 636.)  Unverified
responses also do not substantially comply with CCP §2033.210, which requires
that responses be under oath.  The RFAs
are therefore deemed admitted against Plaintiff Watt.  
            Defendant
Emke requests sanctions in the amount of $561.65 based on 2 hours of work per
motion @ $250/hr, plus $61.65 for the filing fee.  Defendant Emke’s request for sanctions in the
amount of $561.65 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel per motion is
granted.

(1) Defendant
Emke’s Motion to Compel Responses without Objection to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) and Request for Sanctions of $561.65 is granted.  Plaintiff to serve responses without

Defendant Emke’s Motion to Compel Responses without Objection to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Sanctions of $561.65 is granted.  Plaintiff to serve responses without

Defendant Emke’s Motion to Compel Responses without Objection to Requests for
Production (Set One) and Request for Sanctions of $561.65 is granted.  Plaintiff to serve responses without
