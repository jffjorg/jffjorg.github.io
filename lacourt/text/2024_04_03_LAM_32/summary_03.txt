And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the motion to bifurcate the trial between the two incidents is not warranted. The judge believes that the incidents are related and that a single trial would be more efficient and avoid confusion. The judge also notes that the extent of liability attributable to one incident necessarily depends on the other incident. The judge finds that bifurcation would not be conducive to the ends of justice and would instead lead to duplicate litigation and inconsistent findings.
