Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court granted defendants' motion to compel responses in part. The court did not deem admissions made, and the court did not waive plaintiffs' objections. The court imposed sanctions on plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $1,410 to be paid within 30 days. The court reduced the reasonable hours of work by defense counsel from 4.25 hours to 3 hours. The court also awarded the defendants the $60 filing fee. The court found that plaintiffs' failure to timely respond to requests for admission necessitated the filing of a motion to deem matters admitted and that the delay was caused by mistake or excusable neglect. The court further found that plaintiffs' failure to verify their late responses was not substantially justified.
