     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to tax costs 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 2, 2022, Plaintiff Angela
Walton initiated this employment action against Defendants County of Los
Angeles and Alexandro Villanueva. The operative pleading is the First Amended
Complaint filed July 11, 2022. The FAC asserts (1) Labor Code retaliation, (2)
FEHA discrimination, (3) FEHA retaliation, and (4) FEHA failure to prevent. 
            Plaintiff is a detention facility
captain employed by the County. (FAC ¶¶ 23, 24.) Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff
Villanueva personally intervened in Plaintiff’s exercise of her duties and
actively undermined Plaintiff’s authority. (Id., ¶ 25.) Plaintiff also
filed a Policy of Equity (“POE”) complaint against her supervisor, Commander
Josie Woolum in August 2021 for harassment. (Id., ¶ 26.) Shortly after,
Plaintiff was demoted and lost her command at the detention center, a decision
allegedly made by Sheriff Villanueva in conjunction with Commander Woolum and
other chiefs. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants discriminated
against her based on her status as an African-American female. (Id., ¶
28.) Plaintiff also alleges retaliation as a result of her serving as a witness
against LASD, complaining about her supervisors’ violations of Civil Service
Rules, and opposing other misconduct. (Id., ¶¶ 29-43.) 
            After a trial, the jury returned a
defense verdict on the single claim for whistleblower retaliation. Accordingly,
the Court granted judgment for Defendant on February 2, 2024. 
            On February 15, 2024, Defendant
filed a memorandum of costs (MOC) claiming $19,496.12 total. 
            On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to tax costs. Defendant filed its opposition on March 20,
2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on March 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
The statutory scheme for cost recovery
establishes three categories of trial preparation expenses: (1) one category
allowable as a matter of right to the prevailing party (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(a)); (2) one category disallowable unless expressly authorized elsewhere
by law (id., subd. (b)); and (3) one category allowable or disallowable
in the court’s discretion (id., subd. (c)(4)). Even where costs are
deemed allowable, such costs are only recoverable to the extent that they are
(1) reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id.,
subd. (c)(2)-(3).)
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128.) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff challenges Item 4 in the MOC for
deposition costs. Defendant claims $14,081.25 for deposition costs. Plaintiff
seeks to reduce this amount by $2,744.25 on the grounds that certain costs
related to the deposition transcripts are not allowed or are unreasonable. Plaintiff
challenges costs such as supplemental surcharges, rough drafts, priority
requests, litigation package, logistics and processing, and hosting and
delivery. 
However, Plaintiff does not indicate how
Section 1033.5 disallows these costs. To the contrary, Section 1033.5 expressly
allows costs associated with “[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing
necessary depositions.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).) Nor does
Plaintiff explain why the costs are unreasonable. The costs are supported by
receipts attached to Defendant’s MOC, whereas Plaintiff’s motion includes no
proof relating to the necessity of the challenged costs. The Court finds that
the costs are reasonable and necessary.   
In reply, Plaintiff argues that “junk fees”
are disallowed, invoking SB 478 and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700. SB
478 amends existing law regarding false advertising and has nothing to do with
cost recovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Rule 3.1700 sets
forth the procedural requirements for seeking or striking prejudgment costs. It
says nothing about “junk fees.” Plaintiff offers no factual or legal support
for her argument that the challenged fees are “junk fees.” Plaintiff accuses
Defendant’s deposition servicer of “unrestrained avarice” and “insipidity,” and
engaging in a “feeding frenzy of deposition costs.” These attacks do nothing to
demonstrate the unreasonableness of any of Defendant’s claimed costs. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is
DENIED.
