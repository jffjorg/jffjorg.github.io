  - Leave to amend is liberally granted absent prejudice to the opposing party.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiffs seek to add causes of action for violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and California Commercial Code. The judge finds that the proposed claims arise from the same facts, are made sufficiently ahead of trial, and will not significantly increase the discovery burden. The judge concludes that leave to amend is warranted.
