     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs Krystal
Latoya Montgomery, Jeremiah Daquan Montgomery, Anterrika DeShante Willis, and
Kristina Lashay Simpson, individually and as guardians at litem for
various minors, filed this action against Defendants George Morcos and Mervat
Morcos. The complaint alleges (1) breach of the implied warranty of
habitability, (2) negligence, (3) nuisance, and (4) violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4.  
            On February 29, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant motion to compel responses to discovery and to establish
admissions. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on March 21, 2024. Defendants
filed their reply on March 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).) 
DISCUSSION
Defendants propounded the subject
interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission on January
8, 2024. (Michels Decl. ¶ 4.) On February 13, 2024, Plaintiffs served late
responses that were unverified and contained objections. (Id., ¶ 5.) Unverified
responses are tantamount to no response at all. (Appleton v. Super. Ct. (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Therefore, Plaintiffs essentially did not respond to
the discovery requests. A motion to compel responses in the first instance,
unlike a motion to compel further, does not require prior meet and confer or a
separate statement. 
Plaintiffs served verifications on March
13, 2024, after this motion was filed. (Ohn Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs additionally
request relief from their waiver of objections based on a calendaring error. (Id.,
¶ 3.) The court may relieve a party from a waiver of objections if (1) the
party serves substantially compliant responses, and (2) the failure to timely
respond was caused by mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).) Plaintiffs’ responses were substantially
code-compliant even if not perfectly compliant. Defendants retain the right to file
motions to compel further. The Court also finds that the delay was caused by
mistake or excusable neglect. Therefore, objections are not waived. 
However, sanctions are mandatory,
regardless of substantial justification, whenever a party’s failure to timely
respond to requests for admission necessitates the filing of a motion to deem
matters admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Plaintiffs also provide no
substantial justification for failing to verify their late responses.
Therefore, sanctions are warranted. Defense counsel claims an hourly rate of
$450, which is reasonable. (See Michels Decl. ¶ 26.) However, based on the
simplicity of the motion, the Court reduces the reasonable hours to 3 hours.
Defendants are also entitled to recover the $60 filing fee. Therefore, the
total amount of sanctions is $1,410. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel
responses is GRANTED in part. Admissions are not deemed admitted, and
objections are not waived. The Court sanctions Plaintiffs and their counsel in
the total amount of $1,410, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
