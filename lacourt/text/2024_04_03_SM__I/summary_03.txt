And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the ex parte application and will not grant a continuance of the trial. Instead, the court will discuss the plaintiffs' depositions. The court has imposed a mediation completion date of September 30, 2023, but the parties ignored the order and plan to mediate in May 2024. The court will hear depositions from the plaintiffs and will not grant continuances just because the parties have not finished discovery or mediation. The court expects full compliance with its orders and will not grant continuances lightly. The court will hear opposition from the defense before issuing a final order.
