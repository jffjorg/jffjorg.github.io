And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendant is OVERRULED and the motion to strike is DENIED. The defendant argued that the plaintiff, a foreign corporation, is not registered to do business in California and therefore cannot sue in California. However, the judge ruled that the plaintiff is required to register to do business in California only if it is doing business in the state. Since the plaintiff asserts that it does not do business in California, the lack of registration is not a bar to the suit. As for the motion to strike, the judge ruled that the allegation that the defendant's actions were deliberate is sufficient to survive a pleading motion. The defendant has one court day to answer the allegations.
