And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's untimely opposition to stay the case due to bankruptcy proceedings. The court notes that no notice of bankruptcy stay was filed. Assuming the case is not stayed, the court sets forth its merits ruling. However, if the court is convinced that it lacks jurisdiction, it will issue no orders. The judge grants the alternative motion for abatement and abates the case pending further order. The court will set a status conference hearing in a year to monitor the appeal in the related case YC070538. The judge also mentions two other cases that raise similar issues and warns the plaintiff that if those cases also raise the same issue, this case will not go forward and the plaintiff may be declared vexatious.
