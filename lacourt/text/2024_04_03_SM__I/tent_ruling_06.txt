 Case Number:  23SMCV05550    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is OVERRULED and the motion to strike is
DENIED.  The gist of the demurrer is that
plaintiff is a foreign corporation that is not registered to do business here
and thus cannot sue here.  But defendant
misperceives the law.  A foreign company
is required to be registered to do business in California if it does business
in California.  But plaintiff asserts
that Bella Designs does not do business here. 
It might well own the car that defendant allegedly hit, but that is not
doing business.  Because there is no
obligation for plaintiff to be registered here, the lack thereof is no bar to
suit.  As to the motion to strike, the
allegation is that defendant’s actions were deliberate.  If that is true, it is malicious enough to
survive a pleading motion (and easily so).
 
Defendant has 1 court day to answer.  The short period of time is deliberate.
