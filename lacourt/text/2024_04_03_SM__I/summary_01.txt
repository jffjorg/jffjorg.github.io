And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from jury waiver, citing an administrative error as the reason for the defendant's failure to post jury fees. The judge acknowledges that the defendant failed to deposit fees as ordered by the court, but believes that the failure was due to an administrative oversight rather than a deliberate waiver. The judge also finds that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff, as there was ample time for the plaintiff to prepare for a jury trial after the defendant announced its intention to seek a jury trial. The judge notes that the case was continued due to a summary adjudication motion, and that the parties had already agreed to waive jury in 2021 (a COVID-related stipulation). The judge concludes that the defendant's failure to post fees was an administrative error and grants the defendant's motion for relief from jury waiver.
