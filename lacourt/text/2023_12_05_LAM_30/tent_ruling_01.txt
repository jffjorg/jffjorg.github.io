Case No. 20STCV35783
 
Tentative Ruling re: 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Spacecraft
Construction LLC (Plaintiff) moves for terminating sanctions against Defendants
Valentina Bianco, Boas Err LLC, Farbach LLC, Property Management Associates,
Inc., Patrick Lacey, Jason LaPoint, Altrove LLC, and L.A. Puglia LLC
(collectively, Defendants) on Plaintiff’s Complaint, and against Cross-Complainants
Altrove LLC and L.A. Puglia LLC (collectively, Cross-Complainants) on their
Cross-Complaint. The unopposed motion is granted.
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone
engaging in a misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating
sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or
by entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A
violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are
appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).)  
            A terminating sanction is a “drastic
measure which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court has
discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate
to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at 793.) “The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” 
(Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal. App. 4th 967, 992.)
            “A trial court has broad discretion
to impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions….: (1) absent unusual circumstances, there
must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must be
willful.” (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; But see Reedy
v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291 [“willfulness is no longer a
requirement for the imposition of discovery sanctions.”].)
 
On May 25, 2023, the Court entered a
Consolidated Order granting Plaintiff’s 20 unopposed motions to compel
responses against Defendants, based on Defendants’ failure to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production. The Court ordered Defendants to produce responses
within 7 days. The Court also directed Defendants and their counsel to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel. 
On September 15, 2023, the Court
entered a second Consolidated Order granting Plaintiff’s 4 unopposed motions to
compel deposition against Defendants Valentina Bianco, Boas Err LLC, Farbach
LLC, and Property Management Associates, Inc., who had failed to appear for
their noticed depositions. The Court ordered those defendants to appear for
deposition within 30 days and pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel.
Plaintiff noticed the four defendants’
depositions for October 3 and 4, 2023. (Borsuk Decl. ¶¶ 12-13, Ex. 4.) However,
on September 29, Defendants’ counsel told Plaintiff’s counsel that his clients
would not appear because he had a Covid infection, and requested that the
depositions be moved past the 30-day window ordered by the Court. (Borsuk Decl.
¶ 14, Ex. 5.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that
Defendants have still failed to produce discovery responses as ordered by items
8 through 20 of the Consolidated Order. (Borsuk Decl. ¶ 7.) Additionally,
Defendants have not paid the full amount of monetary sanctions under the first
Consolidated Order, and have paid none of the monetary sanctions due under the
second Consolidated Order. (Borsuk Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
            The motion is unopposed. The Court
finds that terminating sanctions are warranted based on Defendants’ willful
failure to comply with the Court’s discovery orders.
