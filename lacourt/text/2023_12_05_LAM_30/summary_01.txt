```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of granting the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the Defendants. The Court finds that the Defendants have willfully failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders, including failing to produce discovery responses and failing to appear for deposition. The Court has previously ordered the Defendants to produce responses and pay monetary sanctions, but they have not complied. The Court concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted and grants the Plaintiff's motion.
