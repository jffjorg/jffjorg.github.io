And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Bijan Damavandi (Plaintiff) and Iraj Kohanbashiri (Defendant) regarding a motion for summary adjudication. The Plaintiff is seeking an order directing the Defendant to convey his interest in Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc. to the Plaintiff. The Defendant has not presented any facts in opposition to the motion and has requested a continuance to allow for further discovery. However, the Court has denied the request, finding that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate the need for further discovery and has not shown any specific facts that would support opposing the motion. The Court has granted the motion for summary adjudication, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the Plaintiff's cause of action for specific performance.
