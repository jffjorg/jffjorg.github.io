 Hearing Date:  August 6, 2024



 
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s medical examination is
GRANTED.  
 
            On 6/8/2024, Plaintiff Alice
Zandpour (Plaintiff) filed suit against Bank of Southern California, N.A.
(Defendant), alleging: (1) gender discrimination; (2) national origin
discrimination; (3) failure to prevent discrimination; (4) retaliation; (5)
retaliation; (6) wrongful constructive termination; (7) intentional
misrepresentation; and (8) unlawful business practices. 
 
            On 7/15/2024, Defendant moved to
compel a mental evaluation of Plaintiff.
 
Discussion  
            
Defendant seeks to have Plaintiff evaluated by Defendant’s medical
examiner, Matthew Carroll, M.D., a Board Certified psychiatrist and
neurologist, on September 3, 2024, at Veritext Legal Solutions, 611 Anton Blvd
#500, Costa Mesa, CA 92626, commencing at 9:00 a.m.
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.020(a),
“[a]ny party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a physical or mental
examination of (1) a party to the action . . . in any action in which the
mental or physical condition . . . of that party or other person is in
controversy in the action.” If the parties cannot stipulate to the mental
examination of a plaintiff, this Court may order such examination “for good
cause shown.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2032.320(a).)
 
Where a plaintiff alleges injuries for which the plaintiff seeks
damages, the mental or physical condition of the plaintiff is placed “in
controversy,” and “good cause” exists for a defendant to compel a mental or
physical examination of the plaintiff. Interpreting a similar federal rule, the
United States Supreme Court has held that in situations like the case at hand,
the pleadings alone are sufficient to meet the requirements of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 35, which permits a mental or physical examination where the
plaintiff’s condition is “in controversy.” (Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(a)(1); see
Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 119 (1964).) The California Supreme
Court applied this principle in the employment context, stating that “[a] party
who chooses to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly
deny his mental state is in controversy.” (Vinson v. Superior Court, 43
Cal. 3d 833, 839 (1987); see also Reuter v. Superior Court, 93 Cal. App.
3d 332, 340 (1972) (a plaintiff’s allegations in the pleadings place mental
condition “in controversy” and support an order for mental examination of
plaintiff); Doyle v. Superior Court, 50 Cal. App. 4th 1878, 1886- 87
(1996).)
 
Further, it is proper to compel an IME where good cause exists.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2032.320(a).) Good cause is shown where the discovery sought
is relevant to the subject matter and the facts suggest the need for discovery.
In particular, good cause exists to compel a plaintiff to submit to a mental
examination where the plaintiff pleads emotional distress damages as the result
of alleged harassment in the workplace. (Vinson, supra, 43 Cal.
3d at 840-41.)
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendant’s alleged
conduct she suffered, and continues to suffer, various physical, psychological,
and emotional damages, including “humiliation, emotional distress, and physical
and mental pain.” (Complaint ¶¶ 52, 63, 72, 79, 85, 96). Plaintiff’s Prayer for
Relief also seeks general damages, which include emotional distress damages.
(Complaint, Prayer for Relief.) Likewise, Plaintiff’s verified discovery
responses also demonstrate that her mental condition is at issue in this
matter.
 
As such, the Court finds good cause to compel Plaintiff’s medical
examination. While the Court finds Plaintiff’s proposed limitation of
questioning to one year prior to the alleged wrongs, or April 1, 2021, to the
present to be unreasonable, the Court does find a 10-year time limit to be
reasonable, and will not prejudice Defendant’s ability to obtain relevant
context from Plaintiff’s social, interpersonal, familial, medical, and
occupational history. 
 
Any risk of overbreadth or irrelevance is mitigated by the fact
that Defendant does not seek to ask Plaintiff about every medical or
psychotherapeutic injury that does not relate to her claimed injuries. (Carroll
Decl. ISO Reply ¶ 6 [“I will only be asking Plaintiff questions about her
history that, based on my credentials and experience, are relevant to my
assessment of her claim of damages in this case”].) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
medical examination is granted.  
 
It is so
ordered.
