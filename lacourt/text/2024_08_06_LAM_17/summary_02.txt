Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's medical examination. The plaintiff, Alice Zandpour, alleges gender discrimination, national origin discrimination, failure to prevent discrimination, retaliation, wrongful constructive termination, intentional misrepresentation, and unlawful business practices against the defendant, Bank of Southern California, N.A. The defendant seeks to have the plaintiff evaluated by a medical examiner to assess the extent of the plaintiff's alleged injuries and damages. The Judge finds good cause to compel the medical examination based on the plaintiff's allegations of emotional distress, physical, and mental pain, and the relevance of the examination to the subject matter of the case. The Judge also finds that the defendant's proposed limitations on the examination are reasonable, and will not prejudice the defendant's ability to obtain relevant context from the plaintiff's social, interpersonal, familial, medical, and occupational history.
