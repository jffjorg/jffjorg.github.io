And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Alexander Collin Baker, et al. (Case No. 21STCV14842). The case involves a dispute over the denial of Adam Bravery's motion for summary judgment. Bravery had filed a motion to set aside the May 30, 2024 order denying his motion for summary judgment, arguing that the ruling was in error. However, the Judge has denied Bravery's motion, finding that it was filed long after the 10-day deadline and that it does not set forth new facts or law, but rather attempts to relitigate the merits of the MSJ. The Judge has also cited several California case law precedents, including Powell v. County of Orange, Cox v. Bonni, and New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, in support of his ruling.
