 Hearing
  Date:  August 5, 2024



 
            Adam
Bravery’s motion to set aside is DENIED.
 
On 4/20/2021,
Broadcast Music, Inc (BMI) filed an complaint in interpleader against Alexander
Collin Baker (Baker), Clara Veseliza Baker aka Clair  Marlo, and Adam Bravery, LLC (Bravery, LLC). 
 
On 8/17/2021,
Baker and Bravery, LLC filed a cross-complaint (XC) against BMI and Erika
Stallings, alleging: (1) declaratory judgment; (2) declaratory judgment; (3)
breach of contract; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) constructive fraud; (6)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (7) fraudulent inducement.
 
On 5/30/2024,
the Court denied Adam Bravery’s motion for summary judgment.
 
On 7/9/2024,
Adam Bravery moved to set aside the 5/30/2024 order.
 
Discussion 
 
Adam Bravery’s motion argues that the
5/30/2024 ruling denying his motion for summary judgment was in error, and sets
forth argument and law as to why summary judgment should be granted in his
favor.
 
As such, Adam Bravery’s motion, while
filed as a motion to set aside, is, in substance, a motion for reconsideration.
(See Powell
v. County of Orange
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577 “…regardless
of the name, a motion asking the trial court to decide the same matter
previously ruled on is a motion for reconsideration…”)
 
Accordingly,
this motion is subject to the procedural requirements of a motion for
reconsideration. (See Cox v. Bonni (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 287, 378, noting that “[a] trial court may not grant a party's motion for reconsideration
that does not comply with section 1008.”)
 
Pursuant to CCP section 1008,
subdivision (a), a motion for reconsideration must be brought “within 10
days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and
based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to
the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”  (New York Times Co. v.
Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
 
            Here,
Adam Bravery filed this motion on 7/9/2024, long past the 10-day deadline
following the 5/30/2024 order. Moreover, Adam Bravery’s motion does not set
forth any new facts or law, but rather attempts to relitigate the merits of his
MSJ. The motion must be denied. (Cox, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p.
378.)  
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Adam Bravery’s motion to set aside is denied. 
 
 
It is
so ordered.
