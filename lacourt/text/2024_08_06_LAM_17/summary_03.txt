The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to consolidate the case with Case No. 23STCV18385. The motion is denied, without prejudice, due to procedural defects. The plaintiff failed to file a notice of motion to consolidate in the second case, and there are unclear proof of service for non-represented parties. The court has considered the legal standard for consolidation and the procedural requirements for bringing a motion to consolidate, as outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.350 and Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1048, subdiv. (a). The judge has also noted that a consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the parties, but is intended to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure.
