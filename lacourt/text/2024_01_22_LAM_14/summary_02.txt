Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between two parties over a piece of property. The plaintiff is seeking to partition the property and is claiming that the defendant has failed to pay his share of expenses. The defendant has demurred to the entire complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first and third causes of action (breach of contract and quiet title) and has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second and fourth causes of action (partition and accounting).

The judge notes that the plaintiff has not clearly and completely pled a claim for breach of contract or quiet title, but has fulfilled the pleading requirements for partition and a derivative accounting action. The judge also notes that the parties have a dispute over the nature of the contract and the statute of frauds, and that the plaintiff has not alleged any adverse claims to title.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff has a claim for an accounting, which will assist in determining the final payment to which each party is entitled, but that the plaintiff has not yet clearly and completely pled a claim for breach of contract or quiet title.
