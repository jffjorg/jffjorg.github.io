And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the motion filed by Paramount Plaza, allowing it to file a First Amended Complaint changing the complaint from one for unlawful detainer to one for breach of contract. The judge's decision is based on the strong policy favoring amendment of pleadings, as long as the amendment does not prejudice the opposing side. Since the motion was unopposed, the judge concludes that the delay in filing the amended complaint is unwarranted and that the resulting additional costs for trial preparation, witness depositions, and other discovery will be minimal.
