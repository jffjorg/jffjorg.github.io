 Case Number:  22STCV24943    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is the unopposed motion of Defendant Keyes European, LLC ("Keyes") for attorney's fees and costs associated with its motion to strike the Plaintiff's claims against Keyes under Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16(c), the "anti-SLAPP" statute.  The Court is declining to award Keyes its attorney's fees incurred prior to February 17, 2023, which related to Keyes' effort to join the anti-SLAPP motion filed by co-Defendant Rami Gishi. The Court (per Judge Steven Kleifield) rejected that effort.  That determination resulted in Keyes having to file an ant-SLAPP motion of its own  The fees Keyes incurred from February 17, 2023 onward relate to Keyes's own motion.  Based on the Court's review of the billing records of Keyes' counsel and the declaration of counsel, the Court is awarding Keyes $14,595 in attorney's fees for the period February 17, 2023 through December 31, 2023.  This reflects 27.8 hours of work at counsel's then-hourly billing rate of $525.  In the Court's view, that amount of hours and counsel's billing rate are reasonable.  The Court is awarding Keyes attorney's fees of $3,888 for the period January 1, 2024 to the present.  That amount reflects an entry on the billing records for .7 hours of work on January 4, 2024, plus 6.5 hours of work related to the motion for attorney's fees itself (5.5 for the opening brief plus 1 hour for attending the hearing on the motion) at counsel's current hourly billing rate of $545.  The total amount of attorney's fees the Court is awarding to Keyes is $18,483.  Keyes also is entitled to $1,073.89 in costs that it is seeking.
