And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, The Longford Condominium Association, to terminate sanctions against the Defendants/Cross-Complainants, Heidi Tabib and Roya Tabib, due to their willful failure to comply with multiple discovery orders. The Judge finds that Longford has made a persuasive case for the imposition of terminating sanctions and notes that the Tabibs have failed to comply with discovery orders, failed to appear at hearings, and failed to provide discovery. The Judge grants Longford's motion and sets a hearing date of October 25, 2024, at which time the Tabibs must appear. If they fail to appear, the Court will grant Longford's motion for terminating sanctions by striking their answer to Longford's complaint and entering a default against them. If they do appear, the Court will grant Longford's alternative request for issue and evidentiary sanctions.
