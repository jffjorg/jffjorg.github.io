And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The plaintiff argues that the defendants are not prevailing parties because the action was dismissed without prejudice. However, the judge finds that the defendants are prevailing parties under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1032(b) because the plaintiff did not recover any relief against them.

The judge also finds that several of the defendants' costs are not reasonable or necessary. Specifically, the judge rules that the defendants' filing fees are excessive, and that their request for expert fees and jury consultant fees is not allowed. The judge also concludes that the defendants failed to provide supporting documentation for their costs, which is fatal to their claim for costs.

Finally, the judge concludes that the defendants' opposition to the motion to tax costs fails to rebut the plaintiff's arguments, and therefore, the motion to tax costs is granted.
