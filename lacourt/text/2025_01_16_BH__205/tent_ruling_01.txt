  Case Number:  20SMCV00492    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDGAR A. MEINHARDT, et al.,    Plaintiffs, v.  SUNNY ACRE, LLC, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  20SMCV00492     Hearing Date:  January 16, 2025      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO    TAX COSTS         BACKGROUND This action arises out of a refinance loan transaction.   In 2019, Plaintiff Corp Realty USA LLC (“Borrower”) refinanced its loan with Defendants Sunny Acre LLC (“Sunny Acre”) and Tsasu LLC (“Tsasu”) (the “Lender Defendants”), in the amount of $3.5 million (the “2019 Loan”).  Defendants Universal Commercial Capital and Eric Tran were the mortgage broker involved in originating the refinance loan.  The 2019 Loan was secured by a Deed of Trust recorded against the title to Borrower’s real property located at 10936 Pacific View Drive, Malibu, California 90265 (the “Property”), and a Promissory Note Secured By Deed Of Trust (“Promissory Note”) signed by Borrower in 2019.   In response to the Lender Defendants’ recording of a Notice of Default and then a Notice of Sale following the Borrower’s immediate default in mortgage payments, Plaintiff Edgar A. Meinhardt filed the instant action in March 2020 seeking to halt Lender Defendants’ foreclosure sale of the Property and asserting various claims regarding the refinance loan provided to Plaintiff in 2019.  On June 4, 2024, this Court dismissed the entire action, based on the parties’ failure to comply with the Court’s Trial Preparation Order and the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court regarding the filing of the required pre-trial documents at the Final Status Conference.  The Court then entered a final Judgment of Dismissal, which dismissed the action without prejudice.  This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs.  Plaintiff argues there was no prevailing party as the action was dismissed without prejudice, and the Court rejected Defendants’ four proposed judgments which identified Defendants as the prevailing party.  When Defendants applied ex parte to have one of their proposed judgments entered, the Court denied the ex parte and noted “the proposed judgment filed by Defendants appears to be inconsistent with and exceed the dismissal without prejudice ordered by the Court on September 9, 2023 and affirmed by the Court’s denial on June 4, 2024 of the Motion to Vacate that dismissal.”  (Oct. 28, 2024 Minute Order.)   No opposition is reflected on the Court’s docket.   LEGAL STANDARD Generally, a “prevailing party” is entitled to costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.).  “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing of the¿notice of entry of judgment… The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.) The losing party may contest the costs that a prevailing party seeks.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1034(a).)  The challenging party has the burden of demonstrating that those costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. (Adams v. Ford Motor Co.,¿(2011) 199 Cal. App. 4th 1475, 1486; 612¿South LLC v. Laconic Limited Partnership, (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1285.)  Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5.)  “Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5(c)(2); Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  A “properly verified memorandum of costs is considered prima facie evidence that the costs listed in the memorandum were necessarily incurred.”  (Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308; see also Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)   This puts the burden on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  If items are properly objected to, they are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) The memorandum of costs need not contain invoices, billings, or statements.  (Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308; see also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(a)(1) (only verification required).) “Documentation must be submitted only when a party dissatisfied with the costs claimed in the memorandum challenges them by filing a motion to tax costs.”  (Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308.)     REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Plaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice of the Court’s own ruling granting in part and denying in part Defendants’ motion for attorneys fees.  The Court denies the request.  It is unnecessary to ask the Court to take judicial notice of its own orders in this action.  All that is necessary is to call the Court’s attention to the order.   DISCUSSION Plaintiff argues that Defendants are not a prevailing party because the dismissal of his action was without prejudice.  But under Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(b), a “prevailing party” includes a “defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  Here, Plaintiff did not recover any relief from Defendants, and therefore, Defendants are a “prevailing party.” Plaintiff next argues that Defendants’ filing and motion fees of $2,634.42 should be taxed because the average cost of filing fees is $15 to $21 but Defendants list fees of over $60.  Plaintiff’s assertion is not supported by any fee schedule and is inconsistent with the Court’s knowledge of the typical amount of filing fees. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants’ request for expert fees of $8,100 for a real estate expert is not allowed.  The Court agrees.  Code Civ. Proc. § 1033 provides that expert fees not ordered by the Court are not allowable as costs.  The Court did not order the retention of a real estate expert.  Accordingly, these costs will be taxed. Plaintiff further argues that line item 12 for models, enlargements or photocopies is not allowed because the models etc. were for trial exhibits that were not used at trial.  The Court agrees.  Under Code of Civil Proc., § 1033.5(a)(13) expenses for trial exhibits are allowed “only if they were reasonably useful for the trier of fact” so it follows that “fees are not authorized for exhibits not used at trial.” (Ladas, 19 Cal.App.4th at 775 (reversing trial court's award of costs for unused exhibits); see also Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550 (“On its face this statutory language excludes as a permissible item of costs exhibits not used at trial, which obviously could not have assisted the trier of fact”).)  For this reason, line item 12 for a total of $8,370.00 will be taxed.   Plaintiff next argues that line item 16 (other) for jury consultant fees should also be taxed.  The Court agrees.  Code of Proc., § 1033.5(b) states that costs for investigation of jurors or in preparation of voir dire are not allowable as costs, except where expressly authorized by law.  Defendants have not identified any law that authorizes these jury consulting fees.  Therefore, Defendants’ request for jury consultant fees for $8,370.00 at line Item 16 (other) is not allowed.   Additionally, Plaintiff argues that when costs are put at issue via a motion to tax costs, the party seeking the costs must submit supporting documentation of those very costs.  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1265; Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308.)  Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ opposition fails to provide supporting documents, which is fatal to their claim for costs.  (Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308) (documentation of the costs must be submitted).)  No opposition is reflected on the Court’s docket.  And accordingly, the Court concludes Defendants failed to submit the required documentation to rebut Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs.    CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs.     IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: January 16, 2025   ___________________________ Edward B.
