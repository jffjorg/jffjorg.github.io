And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying non-party Elmer Sherman's motion to intervene in the case. Sherman claims he has "custody" and "physical control" over the Property, which is located at 23320 Dale Road, in Calabasas, California. The City of Calabasas petitioned for appointment of a receiver to take control of the Property due to numerous health and safety violations, including unpermitted construction of a three-level structure and a septic system that was not suitable for the structure, causing untreated sewage to discharge onto the ground surface and raw sewage to spill down the hillside. Sherman's motion to intervene is procedurally defective because it fails to attach a copy of the proposed answer in intervention. As a result, the judge denies the motion.
