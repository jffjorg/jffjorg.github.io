 Case Number:  23SMCV05118    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   SUMMER JOY CROSLEY,   Plaintiff, v.  E&S RING MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV05118     Hearing Date:  January 16, 2025      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS E&S RING    MANAGEMENT CORPORATION AND    GATEWAY KW-ESPRIT ONE OWNER,    LLC’S MOTION TO COMPEL    PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES TO FORM    INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE,    SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE,    AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF    DOCUMENTS, SET ONE AND REQUEST    FOR SANCTIONS     BACKGROUND  This action arises from a landlord-tenant dispute.  Plaintiff Aubrey Barton II entered into a lease agreement with Defendants E&S Ring Management Corporation and Gateway KW-Esprit One Owner, LLC for residential property located at 13924 Marquesas Way, #1308, Marina Del Rey, California 90292 (the “Property”).  Plaintiff alleges uninhabitable conditions at the Property.   The operative complaint alleges claims for (1) Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code section 1941.1; (2) Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Healthy and Safety section 17920.3; (3) Negligence; (4) Nuisance; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Breach of Contract; (7) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; and (8) Fraud.  On June 14, 2024, Defendants propounded Form Interrogatories – Set One, Special Interrogatories – Set One, and Requests for Production – Set One, to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s responses were due by July 17, 2024.  (Tofanyan Decl., ¶ 3.)  On June 28, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff requested an extension to provide discovery responses. Defendants granted the extension, making discovery responses due by July 26, 2024.  (Tofanyan Decl., ¶ 4.)  Since the extension, counsel for Plaintiff moved to be relieved as counsel, which was granted on October 28, 2024.  As of November 18, 2024, Defendants have not received responses from Plaintiff. (Tofanyan Decl., ¶ 5.)  Given Plaintiff’s failure to respond, Defendants requested an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) with this Court. The IDC was set for November 25, 2024. On November 11, 2024, Defendants sent correspondence to Plaintiff in an effort to obtain his position as it relates to the outstanding discovery to prepare the Joint Statement required prior to the IDC.  Defendants received no response.  (Tofanyan Decl., ¶ 6.)  This hearing is on Defendants’ three motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROGs”), Special Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROGs”), Document Demands (Set One) (“RFPs”) and request for sanctions.  There was no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.   LEGAL STANDARD A motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a), § 2031 subd. (a) and (b); see¿Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿¿ Failing to timely respond waives any objections. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)¿ To move to compel initial responses, a movant must show: (1) proper service (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.080, subd. (a)); (2) expiration of the deadline for the initial response, 30 days after service or on date agreed to by the parties (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subds. (a),¿(b)); and (3) no timely response (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.90).¿ There is no “meet and confer” requirement where there is a total failure to respond to discovery.¿ (Sinaiko, 148 Cal.App.4th at 411.)¿ There is also no separate statement requirement for a motion to compel initial responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b).)¿ Where the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against a party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the person or entity acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.90, 2033.280, subds. (c);¿Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1348.)¿ In addition, the court may award sanctions for any misuse of discovery process.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010¿and¿2023.030.)¿ A failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.¿ (Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿ DISCUSSION Interrogatories Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a) provides that if a party fails to serve a timely response to served interrogatories, that party waives any objections, and the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses thereto.  Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’ FROGs and SROGs were due by July 26, 2024.  As of the date of filing the motion, no responses have been provided.  Accordingly, pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, this Court grants the motion to compel responses to the interrogatories within 15 days of the Court’s Order. Document Demands Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a) and (b) provides that if a party fails to serve a timely response to a demand for production, that party waives any right to serve objections to the demand, including ones based on privilege or work product protection, and the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses thereto.  Plaintiff’s responses to Defendants’ RFPs were due by July 26, 2024.  As of the date of this motion, no responses have been provided.  Accordingly, pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, this Court grants the motion to compel responses to the RFPs within 15 days of this Court’s Order. Sanctions Defendant requests sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the FROGs, SROGs and RFPs.  Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 states: “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Likewise, Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300 states: “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Although §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300 impose sanctions only when a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, Local Rule 3.1348 allows the Court to impose sanctions “in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” Moreover, the Court may award sanctions for discovery abuses which include the failure to timely respond to discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§¿2023.010 subd. (d),¿2023.030).)  “Courts are authorized to exercise their discretion to award discovery sanctions for abuse of the discovery process.”  (NewLife Sciences, LLC v. Weinstock (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 676, fn. 10 (citing Code Civ. Proc., §§¿2023.010,¿2023.030).) Here, Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the discovery requests.  Defendants provided Plaintiff with an extension to respond, but as of today, Plaintiff has not responded and has provided no justification for her failure to timely respond.  Indeed, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motions to compel and for sanctions.  Accordingly, sanctions are warranted.   In determining the appropriate amount of sanctions, the Court¿starts¿with the¿lodestar¿which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable hours spent.¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also¿Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  Defense counsel’s hourly rate is $200.  She is an associate and has been practicing law for three years.  The Court concludes this rate is reasonable in the prevailing legal market in Los Angeles.  As to the hours spent on the motion, counsel attests she spent two hours 4.5 hours drafting the three motions; she expects to spend one hour preparing for and attending the hearing which hour accounts for all three motions as they are all scheduled to be heard on the same date.  The Court concludes these hours are reasonable.  Defendants also incurred a filing fee of $60 for each motion.  The Court will award total sanctions in the amount of $1,080.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to compel and request for sanctions.  The Court will award sanctions in the amount of $1,080 against Plaintiff.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: January 16, 2025   ___________________________ Edward B.
