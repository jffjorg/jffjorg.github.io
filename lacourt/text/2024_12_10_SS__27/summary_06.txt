And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted a motion to intervene brought by Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company, which is the insurer of Justin Roger Ring, the defendant in a negligence lawsuit filed by Elisa Lopez. The lawsuit stems from a motor vehicle accident, and Ring has failed to appear in the action. Blue Hill wants to intervene to protect its interests as the insurer of Ring. The court has found that Blue Hill has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and that the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case. The court has also found that the reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the existing parties. Blue Hill is ordered to file and serve its proposed answer-in-intervention within 10 days.
