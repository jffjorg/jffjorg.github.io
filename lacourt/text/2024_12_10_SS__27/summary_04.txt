And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion filed by counsel for the plaintiff, Maliyah McKnight, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on November 19, 2024, but the court notes that the counsel failed to provide notice within the minimum statutory period, which is at least 16 court days before the hearing. The court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and communication is a proper ground for withdrawal, but the untimely filing of the motion is a procedural issue that warrants denial. The judge advises the parties to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing to argue the motion.
