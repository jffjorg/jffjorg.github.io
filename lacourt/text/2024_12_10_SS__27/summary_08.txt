Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Roberto Frausto Acevedo, was injured in an auto negligence accident and filed a complaint against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The defendant propounded discovery requests, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant filed motions to compel responses and was granted. The plaintiff was awarded monetary sanctions, but has still failed to comply with the discovery orders. The court finds that terminating sanctions are appropriate given the plaintiff's lack of engagement and failure to abide by the court's orders. The court previously denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions based on the possibility that the plaintiff was in a correctional facility, but has since been informed that the plaintiff is not in prison. Therefore, the court grants the motion to terminate sanctions.
