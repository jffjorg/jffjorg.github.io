And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to continue the trial, which was filed by the defendants, Target Corporation and Merelin Barrios. The defendants seek a six-month continuance to file a motion for summary judgment, which they claim is necessary due to the lack of discovery and the need to depose the plaintiff, Enedino Espinoza. The plaintiff opposes the continuance, arguing that the defendants should have filed their motion for summary judgment by the deadline.

The Judge notes that the defendants have filed a timely motion for summary judgment, which was electronically served on October 22, 2024. The Judge also finds that the remaining defendants have not completed the necessary discovery and that the parties have been unable to meet and confer to complete the deposition of the plaintiff.

The Judge cites several cases that hold that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is timely filed. The Judge concludes that the defendants have shown good cause for a continuance and grants the motion to continue the trial to June 16, 2025. The Judge also continues the final status conference to June 2, 2025.
