Background
On
November 22, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment,
dismissing all four causes of action but allowing Plaintiff to file a motion to
amend to add a cause of action for ratification. Plaintiff now moves the court
for leave to file her third amended complaint which includes her ratification
theory.
Legal Standard

When
a party moves to amend a pleading, “courts generally should permit amendment to
the complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.
[Citations.]” (Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007) 151
Cal.App.4th 168, 175.) In ruling on this type of motion, prejudice to another
party is the main concern. (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486.) The type of prejudice the court is to be concerned with should
be something beyond simply having to cope with a potentially successful new
legal theory of recovery that has been revealed during discovery. (Ibid.)
Instead, the court should look for delays in the trial date, loss of critical
evidence, extensive increase in the costs of preparation and other similar
circumstances that create prejudice to another party. (Melican, supra, 151
Cal.App.4th at p. 176.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subd. (a)(1).)  A motion to amend a pleading must
also be supported by a declaration which specifies the following: (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) 

Discussion
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has complied with all the procedural requirements
for amendment under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b), and does not find
Plaintiff to be tardy in seeking the amendment 
Defendant
makes several arguments against the amendment. First, Defendant argues that the
Third Amended Complaint improperly includes the four causes of action that have
already been dismissed. In reply, Plaintiff contends that the motion to amend
was filed before the Court granted summary adjudication on the existing claims.
Plaintiff claims that that she is not attempting to use this motion to revive
the dismissed claims. The Court directs Plaintiff to file a new amended
complaint that accounts for the Court’s recent summary adjudication/judgment
ruling.
Second,
Defendant argues that the amendment is futile. Although the Court may deny
leave to amend when an amendment would be “futile” (Foxborough v. Van Atta
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 217, 230–231), this standard applies only when the
proposed amendment fails to state a cause of action on its face. The standard
for futility aligns with the demurrer standard, requiring the Court to assume
the truth of the allegations in the proposed amended complaint and to assess
whether those allegations, if proven, could establish a viable cause of action.
(Cal. Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d
274, 281.) 
 Here, the
proposed Third Amended Complaint states a cause of action based on the facts
alleged. TAC alleges that Uber was notified of the subject collision, but its
only response was to determine whether Moquete was logged on or off the app at
the time of the accident. Uber did not investigate the collision or terminate
Moquete despite having knowledge of the incident. Uber continued to employ
Moquete for several months following the collision, and he was not deactivated
from Uber’s platform. Uber’s conscious disregard for its duty to conduct
adequate background checks and monitor drivers’ driving histories allowed
Moquete to continue operating as an Uber driver despite his dangerous
background 
Defendant
argues that the proposed amendment is futile by asserting facts outside the
complaint—namely, that the driver was allegedly acting solely in his personal
interest at the time of the incident. While Defendants have submitted exhibits
such as deposition excerpts, discovery responses, and declarations, these
constitute extrinsic evidence, which is inadmissible when assessing the
sufficiency of a proposed amendment. Defendants have not requested judicial
notice of these purported facts, nor have they demonstrated that such facts are
indisputably true or properly subject to judicial notice. Even if judicial
notice were requested, the Court could only take notice of the existence of the
documents, not the truth of the facts contained within them. (Steed v.
Department of Consumer Affairs (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 112, 121.)
Moreover,
Defendant's argument that the amendment is futile based on facts introduced
through extrinsic evidence is premature and more appropriately addressed in a
subsequent motion for summary judgment. The futility standard does not allow
the Court to engage in fact-finding or resolve disputes over the evidentiary
basis for the allegations at the pleading stage. The Court's focus at this
juncture should be limited to determining whether the proposed amendment
alleges facts sufficient to state a legally cognizable claim. Since the
proposed amendment includes allegations that, if proven, could support a cause
of action for ratification, Defendant's factual disputes and evidentiary
challenges are not grounds to deny leave to amend at this stage.
Third,
Defendant cites various cases to support the proposition that actions taken by
an individual outside the scope of employment cannot be ratified. Defendant
relies on Anderson v. Fay Improvement Co.
(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 738, where the court addressed whether Paul Fay, Jr.
acted as an agent for Atlas Realty Company or Standard Building Corporation.
The court found no evidence to support a finding of agency or ratification, as
Fay Jr.'s actions were undertaken solely on behalf of his own company, without
any authority from or representation of Atlas Realty or Standard Building. This
case is distinguishable from the present case, as it does not address whether a
temporary cessation of work, such as being logged off an app, does
not amount to an agency relationship for purposes of ratification. Defendant
also relies on Emery v. Visa International Service Association (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 952, where the court found no evidence of an agency relationship
between Visa and the merchants using Visa’s platform. The merchants operated
independently, with no direct contractual or operational control by Visa.
Similarly, in Burton v. Campbell (2024) __ Cal.App.5th __ [2024 WL
4831304], the court found no agency relationship between Severson and Burton.
Key facts included Burton’s admission that she was not Severson’s client when
demand letters were sent, the absence of any mention of Burton in the letters,
and statements that the letters were sent for broader purposes unrelated to
Burton. These cases are distinguishable because they address situations where
no agency relationship existed at any point. 
Defendant
further cites Kim v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 252, and Marez
v. Lyft, Inc. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 569, where courts held that drivers
were not acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the alleged
incidents because they were logged off the platform. However, these cases donot
address the issue of ratification and is limited only to the issue of scope of
employment. But, ratification, by its very nature, applies to conduct that
occurs outside the scope of employment. The Court is not entirely persuaded by
Defendant’s cited cases, as they do not conclusively address whether a
temporary cessation of work, such as being logged off an app, constitutes the
same lack of agency relationship for purposes of ratification as demonstrated
in Anderson, Emery and Burton. Furthermore, it is the Court's
general policy to freely grant amendments and to hear cases on their merits. In
light of this policy, the Court finds it more appropriate to address this cause
of action through summary judgment.
Fourth,
Defendant argues that allowing Plaintiffs to amend the complaint to substitute
Checkr for a fictitious defendant would cause prejudice to Uber. Specifically,
Defendant contends that the claim against Checkr is unrelated to the claims
against Uber and should not be used to keep Uber in the lawsuit. Additionally,
Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs should not be allowed to make this amendment
because the statute of limitations for claims against Checkr has passed.
Plaintiffs
concede that their claim against Checkr is unrelated to the claims against Uber
but a separate action against Checkr. If that is the case, Plaintiff is asked
to amend her complaint to explicitly distinguish the claims lodged against
Checkr from those lodged against Uber. Furthermore, Should Checkr wish to argue
the statute of limitations defense, they may do so through a demurrer.
The
present hearing is continued to January 17, 2024, at 1:30 pm. The Court orders Plaintiff to file
a new amended complaint addressing the issues detailed above within 10 days.
Furthermore, Defendant may file a response to the newly amended complaint at
least 10 days prior to the hearing.
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Uber’s PMK deposition is continued to the same day, pending
the Court's determination on the motion to amend, as the deposition would be
moot if the Court decides to deny the amendment.
