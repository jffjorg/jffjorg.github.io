Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Intex Realty Corp., argued that it was not liable for the trip-and-fall incident that occurred on its property because California Cartage Company, LLC, the lessee, had exclusive control over the premises. The Court found that the lease agreement between Intex and Cal Cartage assigns responsibility for the parking lot to the lessor (Intex), and that the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous. The Court also rejected the defendant's argument that the parties' intent, as evidenced by extrinsic evidence and performance under the contract, demonstrates otherwise. The Court concluded that the defendant failed to meet its initial burden and that the motion for summary judgment is denied.
