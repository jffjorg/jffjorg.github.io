Claimant Name:  Christopher Cosme Ostria, a minor 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV00375 MARIA EVA OSTRIA MATA, et al.
vs LADERION TREYVONNE ORMAN
 
Ruling: Deny 
 
TENTATIVE 
 
The Court excuses the personal
appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by
telephone or video conference call.
 
The Court rules as follows on the
expedited petition filed December 3, 2024, by Petitioner Maria Eva Ostria Mata
(“Petitioner”). 
 
Again, Petitioner has not been appointed guardian ad litem
for Claimant. The Court observed this defect in the previous petition. (See Min.
Order, 11/4/24.) Petitioner must be appointed before filing a revised petition.

Furthermore, as stated in the previous minute order, Petitioner
must file a regular petition (MC-350) and not an expedited petition because the
total settlement described in items 11 and 12 exceeds $50,000.
Therefore, the petition is denied.  
¿Moving
party is ordered to give notice.

the subject motion without leave.
