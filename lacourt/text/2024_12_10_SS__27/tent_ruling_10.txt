CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV24947 DONNEL STINSON vs GEVORG KHACHATRYAN, et al.
Moving Party: Defendants Gevorg Khachatryan and Vardan Aghayan
Responding Party: None
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: The Court will hear from the parties.
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff Donnel Stinson (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Gevorg Khachatryan and
Vardan Aghayan (“Defendants”) alleging negligence from a motor vehicle
accident. 
 
On February 5, 2024, Defendants served Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Production, Set One on Plaintiff. (Daldumyan Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff failed to timely
respond. Plaintiff did not respond to meet and confer emails sent on March 21,
2024 and April 8, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5-6.) On May 31, 2024, the Court granted
Defendants’ unopposed motions to compel responses to the written discovery.
(Min. Order, 5/31/24.) Plaintiff was ordered to serve verified responses
without objections within 20 days. The Court also imposed $1,309.95 in monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally.
The sanctions were due within 20 days. (Ibid.) On June 3, 2024,
Defendants filed and served notice of the ruling on Plaintiff. 
 
Defendants now assert that Plaintiff has
failed to serve responses to the Form Interrogatories and to pay the monetary
sanctions. (Daldumyan Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendants concede that Plaintiff served
responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Production on May 10,
2024. (Id. ¶ 10.)  However, in a
late-filed Opposition, Plaintiff contends that form interrogatory responses were
provided to Defendants. The Court will hear from Plaintiff why Plaintiff failed
to engage in meet and confer efforts and why, especially in light of that failure,
the Court should now consider the very late-filed Opposition.  The Court will also seek to determine
whether, in fact, Plaintiff responded to the form interrogatories.
