Background
 
Plaintiff
Maliyah McKnight’s (Plaintiff) counsel of record, Corral Law PC, Laiken Law
Group and Attorneys Nathalie E. Corral and Ashley A. Laiken (Counsel), move to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends relief is necessary
because there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and
communications. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
Counsel has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Counsel seeks to be relieved as
counsel on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship and communication. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).) 
 
However, the
Court notes that Counsel failed to provide notice within the minimum statutory
period. Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b), moving papers must be served and filed at
least 16 court days before the hearing. If served by mail, the period is
extended by five calendar days.  Applying
this, 16 court days before the current hearing was November 14, 2024. Adding five calendar days for service by mail, and this motion needed
to be served and filed by November 8, 2024. Because this motion was not filed
and served until November 19, 2024, it is untimely.
 
Thus, the
present motion is DENIED on procedural grounds.
