On December 3, 2024,
Petitioner filed a new petition. However, numerous issues remain uncorrected,
and several new problems have arisen:
Application:

Item
     4b still needs to be checked and completed.
The
     total settlement amount is listed as $7,500 under Item 11, but Item 17
     states the total settlement amount as $12,000. This inconsistency needs to
     be fixed.
Attachments
     9 and 11c still need to be provided.
Attachment
     19b(6) needs to be provided.
Petitioner
     states that all expenses have been paid by private insurance, Medicare, or
     Medi-Cal. If this is the case, the relevant portions of Item 13 relating
     to the details regarding how payment was made must be completed.
     Additionally, Petitioner must attach proof of the fees and expenses
     incurred, as it is unclear to whom the medical expenses are being paid.

Proposed order:

Item
     6 of the proposed order must be completed.
Item
     6b needs to be checked.
Item
     8(b) is incorrect, as Petitioner is not asking to deposit the funds into a
     blocked account. The correct method of payment needs to be provided.

NO LATER THAN December 23, 2024,
PLAINTIFF IS TO SUBMIT A NEW DEFAULT JUDGMENT PACKAGE CORRECTING THESE DEFECTS.
IF NO CORRECTED REQUEST IS FILED OR IF A SIMILARLY DEFICIENT REQUEST IS FILED,
THE COURT WILL SET AN OSC FOR SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF UP TO $1,001.
NON-APPEARANCE CASE REVIEW RE: ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS CONTINUED TO
January 3, 2025.
