And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the expedited petition filed by Petitioner Maria Eva Ostria Mata to approve a minor's compromise. The petition is defective because the Claimant, Christopher Cosme Ostria, has not been appointed a guardian ad litem. Additionally, the total settlement described in the petition exceeds $50,000, which requires a regular petition (MC-350) to be filed instead of an expedited petition. The judge has excused the personal appearance of the Claimant and the guardian ad litem, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. The parties are ordered to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing on December 10, 2024.
