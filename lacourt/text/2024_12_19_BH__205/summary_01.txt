Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Bluestone Lane Coffee. The plaintiff, Carmen Aguilar, was struck on the head by an outdoor umbrella belonging to the defendant and suffered serious injuries, including a concussion and post-traumatic headaches. The plaintiff filed a complaint and statement of damages, but the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff then requested the entry of the defendant's default, which was granted by the Clerk's Office. The plaintiff has now requested a default judgment in the amount of $250,872.20, which includes $250,000 in special damages and $872.20 in costs. The judge has found that the plaintiff has properly complied with the requirements for a default judgment and that the defendant has failed to respond to the complaint and statement of damages. Therefore, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for a default judgment.
