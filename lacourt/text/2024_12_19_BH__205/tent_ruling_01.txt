  Case Number:  22SMCV01778    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  August 22, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Carmen Aguilar v. Bluestone Lane Coffee  CASE NUMBER:  22SMCV01778  COMP. FILED: October 7, 2022    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Carmen Aguilar  RESPONDING PARTY: Bluestone Lane Coffee   BACKGROUND  This is a personal injury case.  Plaintiff Carmen Aguilar was struck on the head by an outdoor umbrella belonging to Defendant Bluestone Lane Coffee.  The incident caused serious injuries to Plaintiff’s head, neck and right shoulder.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and suffered post-traumatic headaches.   On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges two claims for general negligence and premises liability.  On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Statement of Damages, seeking (1) $1,000,000 for pain, suffering and inconvenience; (2) $500,000 for emotional distress; (3) $50,000 for medical expenses, and (4) $250,000 for future medical expenses.    Plaintiff personally served Defendant with the Complaint and Statement of Damages on December 1, 2022.  Defendant was obligated to respond.  Defendant did not do so.  Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on March 11, 2024.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on March 20, 2024.  Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $250,872.20, which is comprised of: (1) $250,000 in special damages, and (3) $872.20 for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code Civ. Proc. § 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.)  Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff has submitted supporting declarations in support of the damages she seeks.  A memorandum of costs in the amount of $872.20 is set forth in Item 10 of the CIV-105 form.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendant more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess of the amount stated in the Statement of Damages, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendant, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.  Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $250,872.20.
