Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Employbridge, LLC, with leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff, Ana Soto-Trejo, failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by Labor Code § 2699.3(a) before filing the PAGA complaint. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's notice was untimely and did not comply with the administrative procedures required by the Labor Code. The Judge also notes that the relation back doctrine cannot be used to frustrate the intent of the Legislature to require compliance with administrative procedures. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defect.
