Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Employbridge, LLC, with leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff, Ana Soto-Trejo, failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by Labor Code § 2699.3(a) before filing the PAGA complaint. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's notice was untimely and did not comply with the administrative procedures required by the Labor Code. The Judge also notes that the relation back doctrine cannot be used to frustrate the intent of the Legislature to require compliance with administrative procedures. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defect.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Employbridge, LLC, to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff, Ana Soto-Trejo, alleges various labor code violations against the Defendants, including Employbridge, LLC.

The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies and failed to timely file a notice of alleged violations with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. The Plaintiff argues that the notice was timely filed and that the relation back doctrine allows the Plaintiff to add the Defendant Employbridge, LLC, despite the lack of timely notice.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to follow the procedures required by Labor Code § 2699.3(a)(1)(A) and thus has not exhausted its administrative remedies as to Defendant Employbridge, LLC. The Court sustains the demurrer on these grounds, but allows for the Plaintiff to amend.

In making this decision, the Court considered the legislative intent behind the notice requirement and the relation back doctrine, as well as the Court's duty to ensure that the Plaintiff complies with the administrative procedures required by Labor Code § 2699.3 before filing an action.

The Court allows the Plaintiff to amend and add the Defendant Employbridge, LLC, if the Plaintiff complies with Labor Code § 2699.3 after the amendment. The Court notes that if the Plaintiff were to amend after compliance with Labor Code § 2699.3, the Court believes that the Plaintiff would be able to add Defendant Employbridge, LLC, in accordance with the relation back doctrine.
