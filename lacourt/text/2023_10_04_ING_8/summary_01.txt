Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Matthew R. Stall, on behalf of himself, his father's estate, and a trust. The plaintiff, Vincent M. Lucy, opposes the motion. The Court notes that the defendant's original memorandum of points and authorities exceeded the page length limit, but was permitted to file a truncated version. The defendant then filed an amended memorandum, which the plaintiff objects to, claiming that it contains substantive changes rather than just stylistic improvements. The Court agrees that the defendant took advantage of its own mistake to make changes to its brief after reading the opposition brief and evidence. The Court is willing to continue the hearing and trial if the plaintiff is allowed to file a sur-reply addressing the changed or additional arguments in the defendant's brief. The Court's tentative ruling would have been to deny the motion for summary judgment and to request oral argument on certain issues.
