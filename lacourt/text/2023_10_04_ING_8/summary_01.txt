Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Matthew R. Stall, on behalf of himself, his father's estate, and a trust. The plaintiff, Vincent M. Lucy, opposes the motion. The Court notes that the defendant's original memorandum of points and authorities exceeded the page length limit, but was permitted to file a truncated version. The defendant then filed an amended memorandum, which the plaintiff objects to, claiming that it contains substantive changes rather than just stylistic improvements. The Court agrees that the defendant took advantage of its own mistake to make changes to its brief after reading the opposition brief and evidence. The Court is willing to continue the hearing and trial if the plaintiff is allowed to file a sur-reply addressing the changed or additional arguments in the defendant's brief. The Court's tentative ruling would have been to deny the motion for summary judgment and to request oral argument on certain issues.

## English Summary:

The judge is considering a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the Defendant, Matthew R. Stall, in a case brought by Vincent M. Lucy. The Defendant's initial brief exceeded the page limit allowed by court rules, but the judge permitted a truncated version. The Plaintiff objected to a subsequently filed amended brief, arguing it contained substantive changes that were not properly addressed in the truncated version. 

The judge acknowledges the Plaintiff's concerns and is willing to continue the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to file a sur-reply addressing the changes in the Defendant's brief. Despite this potential continuance, the judge states that their initial tentative ruling would have denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment on most of the Plaintiff's claims. The judge did plan to request oral argument on certain specific causes of action.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant on June 30, 2023. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion on August 30, 2023, and the defendant filed a reply brief on September 8, 2023. The defendant then filed an amended memorandum of points and authorities on September 18, 2023, which the plaintiff objected to on September 19, 2023. The defendant also objected to the plaintiff's objection on September 25, 2023.

The judge notes that the defendant's amended memorandum of points and authorities contains new and additional arguments and points, which were not present in the original brief. The plaintiff argues that this is procedurally unfair and that the defendant is trying to take advantage of its own mistake by making substantive changes to its opening brief after having read the opposition brief and opposition evidence.

The judge is willing to continue the hearing and trial if the plaintiff believes it should be given the opportunity to file a sur-reply addressing only the changed or additional arguments or points in the redlined version of the amended brief. The judge also concurs with some of the plaintiff's objections and finds that the defendant has opportunistically taken advantage of its own wrong to make substantive changes to its opening brief.

In its tentative ruling, the judge would have denied the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication, except for the 3rd and 4th causes of action, which would have required oral argument. The judge would have found that the defendant failed to carry its initial burden of showing that no triable issue of material fact exists as to all four elements of a breach of oral contract case, and would have found triable issues of fact concerning the two-year statute of limitations because the alleged breach of oral contract did not take place until Decedent's death in 2019, less than two years before the suit was filed.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vincent M. Lucy v. Matthew R. Stall, et al. The Defendant, Matthew R. Stall, had filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Plaintiff, Vincent M. Lucy, opposed. The Defendant then filed an Amended Memorandum of Points and Authorities, which the Plaintiff objected to, arguing that it contained substantive changes and new arguments. The Court has decided to permit the Plaintiff to file a sur-reply addressing the changed or additional arguments in the Amended Memorandum and to continue the hearing and trial. The Court's tentative ruling would have been to deny the Motion for Summary Judgment and to request oral argument on certain causes of action, but the Court is willing to give the Plaintiff the opportunity to respond to the Amended Memorandum before making a final decision. The trial date will need to be moved due to the Court's vacation schedule.
