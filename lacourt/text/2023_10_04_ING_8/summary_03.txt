```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by General Motors LLC (GM) is overruled, meaning that the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud. The judge has also denied GM's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint, which state that GM concealed the transmission defect in the vehicle purchased by the plaintiff. The judge found that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud, despite GM's argument that the allegations are insufficient and fail to meet the requirements for a fraud claim.

The judge also denied GM's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, finding that the prayer is not frivolous and is supported by the allegations in the complaint.
