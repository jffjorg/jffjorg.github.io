And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for reconsideration of the order granting the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The defendant claims that it was not served with the motion to compel, but the court finds that the proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. The court also finds that no valid evidence establishes any new evidence to support a motion for reconsideration. However, the court has the inherent power to reconsider its own interim orders at any time on its own motion, and it finds that it is in the interest of justice to vacate the order and set a new hearing. The court vacates the order and sets a new hearing for August 20, 2024 at 8:30 am, with any opposition to the motion to compel due to be filed and served on or before August 2, 2024 and any reply due on or before August 9, 2024.
