Middleton v. South Pasadena Care Center, LLC, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Trial
Preference 
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff Dianah Middleton, by and through her Guardian ad
Litem (Plaintiff), filed a complaint against Defendants South Pasadena Care
Center, LLC and Yehuda Schmukler (Defendants). The complaint alleges elder
abuse and negligence. 
            On

did not file an opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            “A
party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age may petition the court for
a preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both of the
following findings: (1) The party has a substantial interest in the action as a
whole [and] (2) The health of the party is such that a preference is necessary
to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 36, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION

court grants Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference for the following reasons.
First, Plaintiff is over the age of 70. (Attarchi Decl., ¶ 8.) Second, Plaintiff
has a substantial interest in this action. And third, Plaintiff has provided
the declaration of a physician, who opines that Plaintiffs may die within the
next six months. (Attarchi Decl., ¶¶ 7-10.) (Swaithes v. Superior Court (1989)
212 Cal.App.3d 1082, 1086.)
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference. The court sets trial for
June 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The court will issue further orders at the hearing.
