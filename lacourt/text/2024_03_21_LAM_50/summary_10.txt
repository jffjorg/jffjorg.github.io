Summary:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the unlawful detainer actions with the main action and to enjoin or stay the unlawful detainer proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged various causes of action, including breach of contract, negligence, and retaliation, arising from the defendants' alleged failure to maintain the subject property and their subsequent service of 60-day notices to terminate tenancy. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate good cause to consolidate the actions and that the stay of the unlawful detainer proceedings was already consistent with the requirements of Civil Code section 3423 and Code of Civil Procedure section 526.
