Judge Beaudet's tentative ruling discloses her own claim with Allstate Insurance for water damage in 2016, which was paid without dispute or litigation. She believes this claim will not cause her to be biased in the case, but provides an opportunity for parties to file a verified statement of disqualification if they disagree. The Case Management Conference will be continued if a waiver is not given, and notice of the disclosure and order must be provided to all parties.
