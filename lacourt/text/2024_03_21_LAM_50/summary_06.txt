And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in a case involving the appointment of a guardian ad litem for Defendant Sheila Clapkin. The case is 22STCV30789, and the hearing date is March 21, 2024. The plaintiff, Shana Levin, and Tamara Levin, an individual and as Trustee of The Michael Arnold Levin Irrevocable Trust, filed this action against JosLevin Realty Corp. of L.A., Sheila Clapkin, and others.

The defendant, Andrew Clapkin, has moved for an order appointing a guardian ad litem for Sheila Clapkin without a conservator. The Court has denied the motion due to a procedural defect. The Court found that Andrew Clapkin failed to comply with the mandatory procedures to appoint a guardian ad litem, as set forth in Local Rule 2.8(e) of the Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The Court also found that Andrew Clapkin misinterpreted Code of Civil Procedure section 372, which provides that a guardian ad litem may be appointed "by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending." The Court noted that there is no authority to support Andrew Clapkin's assertion that Local Rule 2.8(e) is inapplicable.

The Court denied the motion without prejudice to seeking appointment of a guardian ad litem in accordance with Local Rule 2.8(e). The case is remanded to the parties for further proceedings.
