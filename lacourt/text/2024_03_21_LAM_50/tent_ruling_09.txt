[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Cesar Cotto (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant Claim
Jumper Acquisition Company LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff seeks judgment in the
total amount of $9,074.00, comprising $8,000.00 in damages, $504.00 in costs,
and $570.00 in attorney fees. Plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief. (See
proposed judgment.) 
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First,
Plaintiff’s
proposed judgment concerning Plaintiff’s requested injunctive relief provides, inter
alia, that Plaintiff seeks a “(1) A preliminary and permanent injunction
requiring Defendant within six (6) months after the date of this order, to: (a)
Take all steps necessary to make its website ‘www.claimjumper.com’ readily
accessible to and usable by blind and visually impaired individuals; and (b)
Change Defendant’s corporate policies, practices, and procedures to provide for
regular maintenance of ‘www.claimjumper.com’ so that it remains readily
accessible to and usable by blind and visually impaired individuals.” 
The
prayer for relief in the Complaint in this action alleges that Plaintiff seeks
“[a] preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendant to take the steps
necessary to make www.claimjumper.com readily accessible to and usable by blind
and visually-impaired individuals...” (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3.)
However, the Complaint does not appear to allege that Plaintiff seeks a
preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendant to “provide for
regular maintenance of ‘www.claimjumper.com’ so that it remains readily
accessible to and usable by blind and visually impaired individuals.” (See
Proposed Judgment, p. 2:1-3.) The Court notes that “¿[a]
complaint…shall contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief
to which the pleader claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages
is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)¿.) ¿Code of Civil Procedure section 580, subdivision (a)¿ “¿limits a trial
court’s jurisdiction to grant relief on a default judgment to the amount stated
in the complaint.¿” (¿Dhawan v. Biring (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968¿.) “[I]n all
default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.)
In
addition, Plaintiff seeks $8,000.00 in damages. Paragraph 6 of the Prayer for
Relief of the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff seeks “[a]n additional
award of $4,000.00 as deterrence damages for each violation pursuant to Johnson v. Guedoir, 218 F. Supp. 3d 1096; 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150740 (USDC Cal, E.D. 2016)…”
(Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 6; see also Manning, Jr. Decl., ¶ 7.)
However, the Court notes that this case is a non-binding federal district court
case.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss further proceedings with Plaintiff at
the hearing.
