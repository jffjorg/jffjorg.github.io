(California Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d))
  - "Plaintiff seeks to seal the portion of her Opposition which identifies the financial terms of the settlement, as well as information regarding settlement discussions, both of which the parties have agreed shall be 'confidential' and not disclosable." (Mot. at p. 6:14-16)
  - "Public disclosure of the financial settlement terms would violate the confidentiality provision of the parties' settlement... thus satisfying the 'overriding interest' requirement for sealing these records." (Mot. at p. 6:23-25)
  - "The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored as it merely seeks to seal the financial terms of the settlement agreement, and not the entire Opposition." (Mot. at p. 7:23-25)

And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is on the motion by the plaintiff to file parts of her opposition to the defendants' motion to enforce settlement under seal. The plaintiff had previously filed a motion to seal the opposition, but it was denied by the court on February 20, 2024. However, the plaintiff re-filed the motion on February 27, 2024, which is unopposed. The judge grants the motion and orders that the requested financial settlement terms in the opposition be sealed. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this order. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to seal the financial settlement terms, which are confidential and not disclosable. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. The judge cites to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550, which provides the criteria for sealing court records. The judge also cites to Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, which holds that a contractual obligation not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest within the meaning of rule 2.550(d).
