[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
MOTION BY
  PLAINTIFF TO FILE PORTIONS OF HER MARCH 13, 2023 OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT UNDER SEAL



 
Background 
Plaintiff Lydia
Cincore-Templeton (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on July 24, 2020, against
Defendants Beverly Smith, Cheryl Hickmon, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. (collectively,
“Defendants”). 
The operative Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) was filed on October 13, 2021. The TAC asserts causes of
action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, (3) violation of Unfair Competition Law, (4) declaratory relief,
(5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6) negligence, and (7) intentional
interference with prospective economic, reputational, and political relations. 
On February 8, 2023,
Defendants filed a motion to enforce settlement. On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a “Partial Opposition by Plaintiff Lydia Templeton to Defendants’ Motion
to Enforce Settlement.” 
Plaintiff filed a previous
motion on January 25, 2024 to file her March 13, 2023 opposition to Defendants’
motion to enforce settlement under seal. The Court’s February 20, 2024
minute order in this action provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Motion to
Seal BY PLAINTIFF TO FILE HER MARCH 13, 2023 OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION
TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT UNDER SEAL filed by Lydia Cincore-Templeton on 01/25/2024
is Denied.” The Court’s February 20, 2024 minute order further provides that
“[o]n or before February 27, 2024 Plaintiff will file a new motion regarding
the issues raised in the tentative, particularly whether the proposed sealing
need only cover the financial terms.” 
On
February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion “for an
order to file her March 13, 2023 Opposition to defendants’ motion to enforce
settlement documents under seal.” The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion 
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) If the
presumption of access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under
seal “if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No
less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
In
support of the motion, Plaintiff submits the declaration of her counsel.
Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that at a September 7, 2022 Mandatory
Settlement Conference, the parties settled this matter. (Quiller Decl., ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]fter not obtaining a settlement agreement
executed by both parties, the defendants filed a motion to enforce the
settlement, with a hearing date of March 24, 2023. On or about March 13, 2023,
I filed a partial opposition to defendants’ motion to enforce settlement…Within
that opposition, I identified the terms of the settlement agreement.” (Quiller
Decl., ¶ 4.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[s]ubsequently, defense counsel
conveyed to me his belief that the terms of the agreement are confidential.” (Quiller
Decl., ¶ 5.) In addition, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[o]ne of the
sticking points in finalizing the settlement agreement is for this Court to
issue an Order sealing the Opposition.” (Quiller Decl., ¶ 9.)
In the motion, Plaintiff states that she “seeks to seal the portion of
her Opposition which identifies the financial terms of the settlement, as well
as information regarding settlement discussions, both of which the parties have
agreed shall be ‘confidential’ and not disclosable.” (Mot. at p. 6:14-16.) Plaintiff
asserts that “[p]ublic disclosure of the financial settlement terms would
violate the confidentiality provision of the parties’ settlement (memorialized
in the Parties’ Memorandum of Understanding) thus satisfying the ‘overriding
interest’ requirement for sealing these records.” (Mot. at p. 6:23-25.) 
Plaintiff cites to Universal City
Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1283, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[i]ndependent of its broader
requests, defendant requests that we seal the October 14, 1998, settlement
agreement. We agree with defendant that its contractual obligation not to
disclose can constitute an overriding interest within the meaning of rule 243.1(d).”[1]

Plaintiff also asserts that “[k]eeping the terms of the settlement
agreement public would prejudice the defendants against potential future
plaintiffs.” (Mot. at p. 7:2-3.) In addition, Plaintiff argues that “[k]eeping
the terms of the settlement public as to the plaintiff could prejudice her
reputation and/or underpin her societal standing.” (Mot. at p. 7:6-7.) 
            Plaintiff also argues that the
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest. Plaintiff asserts that “[w]orking
backwards, the ‘overriding interest’ is satisfied by the simple fact that the
terms of the agreement require that the agreement be confidential. Therefore,
there are no less restrictive means other than to seal the Opposition…” (Mot.
at p. 7:21-23.) Plaintiff also asserts that “[t]he proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored as it merely seeks to seal the financial terms of the settlement
agreement, and not the entire Opposition.” (Mot. at p. 7:23-25.) 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to seal the “financial
settlement terms” in Plaintiff’s “partial” opposition filed in this action on
March 13, 2023. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion to file portions of her March 13, 2023 opposition to
Defendants’ motion to enforce settlement under seal is granted. 
Pursuant to ¿California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (e)¿,
the Court directs the clerk to file this order, maintain the March 13, 2023
“Partial Opposition by Plaintiff Lydia Templeton to Defendants’ Motion to
Enforce Settlement” sealed in a secure manner, and clearly identify the
opposition as sealed by this order.¿¿ 
In addition, as discussed above, Plaintiff “requests
that this Court grant [the] motion and order that the requested financial
settlement terms in the Opposition be sealed.” (Mot. at p. 8:9-10.) Thus, Plaintiff
shall file a redacted version of the March 13, 2023 opposition in which only the
“financial settlement terms” are redacted. 
Plaintiff is
ordered to provide notice of this order.¿
