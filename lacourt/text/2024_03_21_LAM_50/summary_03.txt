And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's claim for a civil penalty for breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge found that Defendant failed to meet its initial burden of demonstrating that Plaintiff's claim for a civil penalty is without merit. The judge noted that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act does not require consumers to take any affirmative steps to secure relief for the failure of a manufacturer to service or repair a vehicle to conform to applicable warranties, and that Plaintiff's failure to make a prior request for repurchase or replacement does not bar his claim for civil penalty. The judge also cited to Krotin v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 294, which held that the Act does not require consumers to take any affirmative steps to secure relief for the failure of a manufacturer to service or repair a vehicle to conform to applicable warranties.
