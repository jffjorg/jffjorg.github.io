The judge has denied the Defendants' motion to vacate the Statement of Decision issued on January 16, 2024. The Statement of Decision was issued in favor of the Plaintiff and provided for the payment of $67,853.33 to the Plaintiff and Lifetime Realty. The Defendants had filed a Request for Statement of Decision on January 8, 2024, and the Plaintiff's counsel emailed the proposed Statement of Decision to the Defendants' counsel on January 12, 2024. The Court signed the Statement of Decision on January 16, 2024, before the expiration of the time period to file an objection. The Defendants filed objections to the proposed Statement of Decision on January 22, 2024, but the judge found that the premature signing of the Statement of Decision did not constitute reversible error unless actual prejudice is shown, and the Defendants failed to demonstrate any prejudice.
