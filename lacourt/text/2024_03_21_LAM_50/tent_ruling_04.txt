TENTATIVE RULING RE:
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO VACATE STATEMENT OF DECISION 



 
Background
Plaintiff Ashley Kim
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on July 15, 2022 against Defendants Realtex
Properties, Inc. and James Ha (jointly, “Defendants”). 
Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint on September 22, 2022, alleging causes of
action for (1) breach of contract and (2) unfair competition. 
On December 29, 2023,
the Court issued a minute order in this matter, providing, inter alia,
that “[t]he Court, having taken the matter under submission on
12/28/2023 for Non-Jury Trial, now rules as follows: The Court hereby renders
its Tentative Decision. It will become the Statement of Decision unless, within
10 days after announcement or service of the Tentative Decision, a party
specifies those principal controverted issues as to which the party is
requesting a Statement of Decision or makes proposals not included in the
Tentative Decision.” 
The Court’s December 29,
2023 minute order further provides, inter alia, that “[t]herefore,
in its Tentative Decision, the Court decides in favor of Plaintiff and against
all defendants as follows: First nine units to open escrow: 1. Listing
commission $42,620. 2. Selling commission: $23,433.33 3. Transaction
coordination fee: $1800 Total: $67,853.33 This sum to be paid to Plaintiff and
Lifetime Realty by Realtex and James Ha. In the event a Statement of Decision
is requested pursuant to CRC 3.1590(d), that Statement of Decision is to be
prepared by Plaintiff.” (Emphasis omitted.) 
On January 8, 2024,
Defendants filed a Request for Statement of Decision. 
On January 16, 2024, the
Court issued a Statement of Decision. The Statement of Decision is dated
January 16, 2024, and was filed
on the same date. 
Defendants now move to vacate
the Statement of Decision dated January 16, 2024. Plaintiff opposes.[1]  A reply was filed.  The Court has considered all filings.
Discussion
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d), “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its
own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so
as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” 
Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1590, subdivision (d), “[w]ithin 10 days after announcement or
service of the tentative decision, whichever is later, any party that appeared
at trial may request a statement of decision to address the principal
controverted issues. The principal controverted issues must be specified in the
request.” As set forth above, the Court’s December 29, 2023 minute order in
this case indicates, inter alia, that “[t]he Court hereby renders
its Tentative Decision.” Ten days later, on January 8, 2024, Defendants filed a Request for Statement of Decision.

Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1590, subdivision (f), “[i]f a party requests a statement of
decision under (d), the court must, within 30 days of announcement or service
of the tentative decision, prepare and serve a proposed statement of decision
and a proposed judgment on all parties that appeared at the trial, unless the
court has ordered a party to prepare the statement. A party that has been
ordered to prepare the statement must within 30 days after the announcement or
service of the tentative decision, serve and submit to the court a proposed
statement of decision and a proposed judgment. If the proposed statement of
decision and judgment are not served and submitted within that time, any other
party that appeared at the trial may within 10 days thereafter: (1) prepare,
serve, and submit to the court a proposed statement of decision and judgment or
(2) serve on all other parties and file a notice of motion for an order that a
statement of decision be deemed waived.” 
As discussed, the Court’s December 29, 2023 minute order
provides, inter alia, that “[i]n the event a Statement of
Decision is requested pursuant to CRC 3.1590(d), that Statement of Decision is
to be prepared by Plaintiff.” (Emphasis omitted.) 
Defendants’ counsel indicates that “[o]n January 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel a proposed Statement of Decision.” (Kim
Decl., ¶ 5.) Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1590, subdivision (g), “[a]ny party may, within 15 days
after the proposed statement of decision and judgment have been served, serve
and file objections to the proposed statement of decision or judgment.”
The Court notes that 15
days after January 12, 2024 is January 27, 2024. As noted by Defendants, the Court’s
signed Statement of Decision was issued before this date, on January 16, 2024.
Defendants assert that “the Honorable Rolf Treu, by waiting only four days from
the date that defendants’ counsel received via email the proposed Statement of
Decision, was deprived of defendants’ input for his Statement of Decision.”
(Mot. at p. 4:9-11.) 
In addition, Defendants
note that on January 22, 2024, Defendants filed objections to the proposed
statement of decision. These
objections were thus filed less than 15 days after January 12, 2024, the
date “Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel a proposed Statement of
Decision.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 5.) 
In their opposition to the instant motion, Defendants cite to Heaps v. Heaps
(2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 286, 292, where the
Court of Appeal found as follows: 
 
“The judge
signed the statement of decision on October 2, 2003, which was less than 10
days after September 23, when the respondents submitted a proposed statement of
decision. The trial judge clearly signed the statement of decision before the
time to file objections had expired. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 232(e) [‘Any party affected by the judgment may, within 10 days
after service of the proposed judgment, serve and file objections thereto…[¶]
The court shall, within 10 days after expiration of the time for filing
objections to the proposed judgment … sign and file its judgment.’].)…
 
However, as this court recently noted in In re Marriage of Steiner (2004) 117
Cal.App.4th 519, 524–525 [11 Cal. Rptr. 3d 671], the premature signing
of a proposed statement of decision does not constitute reversible error
unless actual prejudice is shown. Here, none is. The main purpose of an
objection to a proposed statement of decision is not to reargue the merits, but
to bring to the court’s attention inconsistencies between the court’s ruling
and the document that is supposed to embody and explain that ruling. In fact,
if objections do not present deficiencies to the trial court, ‘the appellate
court will imply findings to support the judgment.’ (In re Marriage of Arceneaux (1990) 51 Cal.3d
1130, 1134 [275 Cal. Rptr. 797, 800 P.2d 1227].)
 
As it turned
out, Mary Ann did file objections, but those objections did not identify any
inconsistencies with the intended decision. Her objections were 67 pages
arguing that the evidence should be reweighed in her favor. Those objections
went to the underlying merits of the proposed
decision, not its conformity with what the trial
court had previously announced…Therefore, we conclude that the trial court’s
error was harmless.” (Emphasis in original.) 
Plaintiff acknowledges that here, the Court signed the statement of
decision before the expiration of the time period to file an objection. (Opp’n
at p. 3:15-16.) However, Plaintiff asserts that this does not result in any
prejudice to Defendants. Plaintiff cites to the Court’s December 26, 2023
minute order, which provides, inter alia, that “[b]oth sides have orally
stipulated to waive daily settled statement. Both sides have orally stipulated
to waive an appeal.” (See December 26, 2023 minute order, p. 1.)
Plaintiff argues that “[i]n light of the fact…that both parties waived appeal
and stipulated not to preserve any record of testimonial evidence (no court
reporter and no daily settled statements),” prejudice cannot be demonstrated.”
(Opp’n at p. 2:10-13.) Plaintiff also agues that “like the Heaps case,
the objections that Defendants filed in the instant case are nothing more than
a 15-page long endeavor to ‘retry’ the case…” (Opp’n at p. 3:26-27, emphasis
added.) 
The Heaps Court found that “the
premature signing of a proposed statement of decision does not constitute reversible error unless actual prejudice is shown.”
(Heaps v. Heaps, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 292 [emphasis
in original].) Moving party, in its motion, makes no showing whatsoever of any
prejudice.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
motion to vacate the January 16, 2024 Statement of Decision is denied.
Defendants are ordered
to give notice of this Order.
