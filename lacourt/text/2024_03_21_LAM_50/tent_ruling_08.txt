JOHN
  J. JAMGOTCHIAN., 
                        Plaintiff(s),
            v.
 
MERCURY

  al., 
                        Defendant(s).


 
  Case No.:  23STCV13350
 
    DISCLOSURE AND ORDER
 



            
Judge Beaudet hereby discloses that she
had a claim with Allstate Insurance for water damage that occurred at her home
in October 2016.  The claim was
paid.  There was no dispute or
litigation.  Judge Beaudet does not
believe that her claim with Allstate will cause her to be biased for or against
any party in this case.  After discussion with Court counsel,
Judge Beaudet does not believe that there are any legal grounds for recusal,
and she notes that she has both a statutory and ethical duty to preside over
any case in which she is not disqualified. 
However, if you believe
differently, you will have until April 2, 2024 to file IN DEPT 50 (not the
filing window) and serve a verified statement of disqualification per CCP §170.3(c)(1)
(the “Statement”).  If you do not file and
serve a Statement, grounds for recusal will be deemed waived.
    Unless there is a waiver by
all parties as to this disclosure, the
Case Management Conference will be continued to June 18, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in
Department 50.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this Disclosure and Order,
including notice to any new parties who are added to the case and to file proof
of service of same promptly after service. Any new party has 14 calendar days
from the date of service to file the Statement in Department 50.
 
DATED:  March 20, 2024                                          ___________________________
