And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the two cases, 23LBCV02065 and 23CMSC00902, due to several reasons. First, the notice of motion does not comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.350(a)(1)(A), as it does not list each party to each case and their respective attorneys. Second, the Court cannot locate the declaration of Aaron D. Fhima, which is the basis for the motion. Third, the plaintiff in the small claims case, Lopez, has not been properly served with the motion papers. Additionally, the Court finds that it is not in the interest of justice to consolidate the small claims case, as Lopez chose to file in pro per and has limited her potential damages. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the denial.
