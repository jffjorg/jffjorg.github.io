And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for fees and costs filed by Palo Woods, LLC, the plaintiff. The motion seeks to recover $671,537 in fees and costs incurred in connection with the litigation. Fitness, the defendant, opposes the motion, arguing that the results of the action were a "mixed bag" and that Palo Woods over-litigated the case. The Judge agrees that the fees are high, but finds that the fees incurred in connection with the tort claims are sufficiently intertwined with the fees incurred in connection with the contract claims that apportionment is not necessary. The Judge reduces the fee award by 50% to $335,768.50. The ruling is without prejudice to Palo Woods's right to seek recovery of costs in a manner permitted by the Rules of Court.
