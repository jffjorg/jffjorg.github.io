Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the City of Long Beach (Defendant). The Defendant seeks to compel further responses from Plaintiff Raeann Vengoechea, who filed an action against the City for a dangerous condition of public property.

The judge grants the motion to compel in part, finding that Plaintiff's responses to certain discovery requests, including FROG 6.5, are insufficient. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide a detailed answer to the question of whether she is taking any medications as a result of the accident.

The judge also denies the motion to compel in part, finding that Plaintiff's responses to other discovery requests, including FROG 8.8, are sufficient. The judge agrees with Plaintiff that calculating future lost income involves expert opinions and is not readily calculable.

The judge does not grant sanctions, finding that both parties took their positions in good faith and did not engage in abusive or dilatory behavior. The judge orders Plaintiff to serve further responses to the discovery requests within ten days.

The parties are directed to submit their intentions to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the court, and if no one appears at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
