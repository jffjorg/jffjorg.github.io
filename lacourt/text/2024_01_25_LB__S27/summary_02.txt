And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The defendants, Dr. Javahery, Dr. Szper, and Dr. Pak, contend that they complied with the standard of care in their treatment of the plaintiff, Randolph Barringer, and that their actions did not cause or contribute to his claimed damages. The defendants have submitted an expert declaration from Dr. Martin H. Weiss, who concluded that their care and treatment of the plaintiff complied with the standard of care.

The judge has found that the defendants have met their burden to establish that they are entitled to summary judgment. The burden now shifts to the plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact. However, the plaintiff has failed to submit any opposition to the motion, so the motion is granted.

The defendants are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling, and the parties must email the court to indicate whether they intend to submit on the tentative. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
