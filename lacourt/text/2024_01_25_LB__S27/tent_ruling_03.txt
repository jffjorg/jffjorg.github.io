 Case Number:  23LBCV00755    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Philadelphia Indemnity
Insurance Company filed this action against numerous defendants for
interpleader.  It issued a commercial
insurance policy to FC Venezia, Inc. dba FCS Transportation with a policy limit
of $750,000 that covered an automobile accident its insured was involved
in.  It concedes it must pay out the
policy limits, but the various injured parties were unable to agree concerning
the apportionment of proceeds.  
 
2.     Petition
to Approve Compromise of a Minor
The parties have agreed to a global
settlement of this action, pursuant to which Signature Executive
Transportation/Ravi Transportation will contribute $750,000 and FC Venezia,
Inc. dba FCS Transport, presumedly through its insurer, Philadelphia, will
contribute $750,000.  If the settlement
is approved, $375,000 will go to Corbus, who was seriously injured in the subject
accident.  The remainder will go to the
Jensen family, whose husband/father was killed in the subject accident.  $675,000 will go to Jensen’s surviving
spouse, and $112,500 will go to each of Jensen’s children.  One of Jensen’s children, Eliza, is a minor
(15 years of age), and therefore the Court must approve the compromise before the
settlement is finalized.  
 
The Court has reviewed the settlement
and finds it is fair and reasonable.  The
Court notes that Counsel will take $28,125 in attorneys’ fees from the settlement,
which constitutes 25% of the gross settlement amount, and which the Court finds
to be reasonable.  Cost of $1096.99 will
also be taken out of the settlement.  The
net settlement amount is $83,278.01, which amount will be used to purchase a
single premium deferred annuity that Eliza cannot withdraw prematurely without
authorization of the Court.  
 
Pursuant to CRC 7.952, Plaintiff
and Petitioner must appear and testify to the satisfaction of the Court before
the Court grants the petition.  If the Court
is satisfied with their testimony at the hearing, the Court will grant the petition.  The Court notes that petitioner lodged a
proposed order on the petition with the petition, and the Court will sign the
proposed order at the time of the hearing if it is satisfied with the terms of
the settlement.
