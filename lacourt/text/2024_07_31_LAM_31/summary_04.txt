And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case involving the alleged unauthorized use of photographic images. The plaintiff, Arami Cheyenne Walker, claims that her image was used by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) without her consent. The defendant, the Board of Regents, University of California, has demurred to each of the plaintiff's amended complaints, and the court has granted leave to amend each time. The plaintiff has now filed a third amended complaint, which the defendant seeks to strike in its entirety or strike portions of it. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to file a supplemental complaint and grants the defendant's motion to strike the third amended complaint. The court directs the plaintiff to file a fourth amended complaint that omits the "Appropriation and Invasion of Privacy 2022" claim and does not add or alter the allegations as previously set forth in the second amended complaint.
