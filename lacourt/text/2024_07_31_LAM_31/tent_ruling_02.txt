[1] Defendants also argue that Plaintiff
lacks standing to initiate this action because Plaintiff did not attach a death
certificate to the FAC.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.32 (c) provides that “A certified copy of the decedent’s
death certificate shall be attached to the affidavit or declaration.”  Defendants, however, confuse the requirements
for bringing a survival action and a wrongful death claim.  Section 377.32 pertains to survival
actions.  As discussed above, Plaintiff
does not bring a survival action.


[2] Defendants center their argument
entirely on the requirement of heightened foreseeability and spend little, if
any time, addressing the remaining Rowland factors.
