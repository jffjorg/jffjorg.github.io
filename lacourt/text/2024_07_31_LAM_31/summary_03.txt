```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion to Quash Subpoena for Records of Voorheis & Voorheis Inc. is granted. The court finds that the deposition subpoena is premature because Plaintiff has not made a written demand for expert witness information, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, et seq. Since no demand was made, neither party is required to comply with the statutory exchange requirements for expert witness information. The court concludes that the subpoena is quashed, and Urbino Construction may withhold the information sought by the subpoena based on attorney-client privilege and work product protections. The judgment is dated July 31, 2024.
