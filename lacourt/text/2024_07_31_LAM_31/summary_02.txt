And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiff lacks standing to initiate the action because no death certificate was attached to the FAC. The Judge rejects this argument, pointing out that the requirement for a death certificate only applies to survival actions, which is not the case here. The Judge also notes that the Defendants failed to address the remaining Rowland factors in their argument and focused solely on the requirement of heightened foreseeability.
