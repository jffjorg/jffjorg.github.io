And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Alice Ross v. Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA). The case involves a retirement plan employment discrimination claim, alleging that LACERA negligently failed to enroll the plaintiff in the proper retirement plan and then retaliated against her for filing a complaint. LACERA demurred to the complaint, arguing that the claims were time-barred due to the statute of limitations. The court agrees with LACERA's argument, finding that the statute of limitations has run against LACERA in all causes of action. The court sustains LACERA's demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint or make changes to the existing complaint to cure the defects.
