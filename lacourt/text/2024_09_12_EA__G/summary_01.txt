And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Yuning Su and Plus & Beyond Express, LLC (P&B) in part, with 20 days leave to amend, for the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 11th causes of action. This means that the plaintiffs, Dynatrans, Inc and Shaoyue Li, will need to re-file these claims with additional specificity. The demurrer is overruled in part as to the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th causes of action, allowing these claims to proceed.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' arguments and the applicable legal standards. The judge found that the Complaint was insufficiently pled in certain respects, including the failure to allege specific facts and the lack of specificity in certain allegations. The judge also noted that the parties had failed to meet and confer as required, and that P&B had failed to properly respond to the Complaint.
