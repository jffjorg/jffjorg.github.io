     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff antonio leon’s motion to
  enforce judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 22, 2019, Plaintiffs
Antonio Leon and Blanca Leon filed this action against Defendants James Jaber,
MD, Georgia Bode, MD, and Los Angeles Community Hospital, asserting causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice and (2) loss of consortium. The First
Amended Complaint was filed on May 8, 2019. Blanca Leon’s claims were
dismissed, leaving Antonio Leon’s medical malpractice claim. 
            The matter came on for trial between
January 29, 2024 and February 9, 2024, after which the jury returned a verdict
for Plaintiff against Defendant Bode. Plaintiff was ordered to prepare a
judgment. 
            Plaintiff filed a proposed judgment
on February 15, 2024. Defendant filed her objection to the judgment on February
21, 2024, arguing that Plaintiff’s Section 998 offer was invalid and that
Plaintiff incorrectly calculated the settlement offset.  
            On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to enforce judgment to address Defendant’s objections.
Defendant filed her opposition on March 7, 2024.
DISCUSSION
I.
Validity of the Section 998 Offer
            An offer under Section 998 “shall
include a statement of the offer, containing the terms and conditions of the
judgment or award, and a provision that allows the accepting party to indicate
acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is accepted. Any
acceptance of the offer, whether made on the document containing the offer or
on a separate document of acceptance, shall be in writing and shall be signed
by counsel for the accepting party or, if not represented by counsel, by the
accepting party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 998(b).) 
            While “Section 998 does not require
a particular form of acceptance provision,” a valid offer “must include some
indication of how to accept the offer.” (Perez v. Torres (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 418, 425, fn. 6.) “Section 998 does not specify that the acceptance
must contain any specific words or that it be made in a particular manner,
other than it be in writing and signed by the appropriate person.” (Whatley-Miller
v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1110.) “[N]o ‘magic language’ or
specific format is required for either an offer or acceptance under section 998.”
(Rouland v. Pacific Specialty Ins. Co. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 280, 288.)

            Here, Plaintiff’s Section 998 offer
provided that “if this offer is not accepted in writing prior to trial, or
within thirty (30) days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be
deemed withdrawn and cannot be given in evidence at the trial.” (Collins Decl.,
Ex. A.) Defendant argues that the offer fails to specify that it could be
accepted by a signed writing and generally fails to specify any method of
acceptance at all. 
            However, the law does not require a
particular format for the acceptance provision, and there is no “magic
language” to satisfy Section 998. In particular, “[n]othing in the statute's
language requires an offer to include either a line for the party to sign
acknowledging its acceptance or any specific language stating the party must
accept the offer by signing an acceptance statement.” (Rouland, supra, 220
Cal.App.4th at p. 288.) Plaintiff’s offer indicated that it could only be
accepted in writing within a specified time frame. This meets the requirement
to provide “some indication” of how to accept the offer. (See Perez, supra,
206 Cal.App.4th at p. 425, fn. 6.) 
            Defendant argues that Rouland
is distinguishable because the offer there, while not providing a signature
line or expressly demanding a signature, at least instructed the plaintiffs to
file their acceptance with the trial court. (Rouland, supra, 220
Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) The Court of Appeal found that the signature
requirement was “implicit in the offers' identified means of acceptance because
any acceptance the Roulands sought to file with the court necessarily would
have to be in writing and signed by their counsel.” (Id. at p. 288.)
While those were the specific facts in Rouland, the Court of Appeal also
concluded generally that “[a]s long as a section 998 offer specifies the manner
of acceptance, the steps for completing the acceptance may be implicit in the
identified means of acceptance.” (Ibid.)
            Here too, the steps for completing
acceptance may be implied in the specified manner of acceptance. Again, the
offer specifies that any acceptance must be made in writing. It is implicit
that a written acceptance be signed by defense counsel. Therefore, the offer
satisfies the requirements of Section 998. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled
to prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3291.  
II.
Settlement Offset
“Where a release, dismissal with or
without prejudice, or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given
in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of
tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort, or to one or more other
co-obligors mutually subject to contribution rights, it shall . . . reduce the
claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release, the
dismissal or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it,
whichever is the greater.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877(a).) “However, tortfeasors
are jointly liable for only economic damages.” (Collins v. County of San
Diego (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 1035, 1064.) Under Prop 51, tortfeasors are
proportionately liable for noneconomic damages. (Civ. Code, § 1431.2.) “Accordingly,
as the Court of Appeal recognized, when a pretrial settlement does not
differentiate between economic and noneconomic losses, a postverdict allocation
is required because ‘only the amount attributable to the joint responsibility
for economic damages may be used as an offset.’” (Rashidi v. Moser
(2014) 60 Cal.4th 718, 722.) 
To calculate the allocation, it must first
be determined what percentage of the jury’s total award is attributable to
economic damages, and then apply that percentage to the settlement amount to
determine the offset. (Espinoza v. Machonga (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 268,
277.) Here, the jury awarded $9,474,350.29 in economic damages and $19,250,000
in noneconomic damages, for a total award of $28,724,350.29. Plaintiff entered
a settlement for $980,000. Under the traditional formula, the proportion of the
award attributable to economic damages would be 33.9% ($9,474,350.29 /
$28,724,350.29). Therefore, the offset amount would be $332,220 (33.9% x
$980,000). 
However, MICRA limits noneconomic damages
to $250,000. If the $250,000 cap is considered in calculating the total award,
the total award would only be $9,724,350.29 ($9,474,350.29 + $250,000). That
means the proportion of the award attributable to economic damages would be
97.4% ($9,474,350.29 / $9,724,350.29). Accordingly, the offset amount would be
$954,520 (97.4% x $980,000). While both parties agree that an offset is
appropriate, they disagree on which formula to use. The issue is whether, for
purposes of calculating a settlement offset, the trial court uses the total
amount of damages actually awarded by the jury, or the total amount after applying
the cap imposed by MICRA.
In Mayes v. Bryan (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1075, 1098, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s
calculation of the defendants’ liability for purposes of determining whether
the plaintiffs could recover prejudgment interest based on their Section 998
offer. The trial court’s calculation did what Defendant advocates for
here—calculate the proportion attributable to economic damages by using a
denominator that accounts for the MICRA cap. (Id. at p. 1099.) After the
economic damages were offset accordingly, the trial court additionally awarded
only $50,000 in noneconomic damages, or 20% of $250,000, because the jury
allocated 20% liability to the non-settling defendants. (Ibid.) The
plaintiffs argued that “it was unfair for the court to first reduce the
noneconomic verdict of $ 3 million to the statutory MICRA maximum of $ 250,000
and then reduce it further under Proposition 51 to reflect the percentage of
fault attributed to the settlement plaintiffs received.” (Ibid.)  
The Court of Appeal held that the trial
court was correct to “apply the MICRA cap to the total noneconomic damage award
before it determined the pro rata liability of each defendant.” (Mayes,
supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101.) “[B]ecause the plaintiff could not
recover more than $ 250,000 in noneconomic damages from all health care providers
for one injury, the noneconomic damages should be apportioned based on the
relative fault of each health care provider.” (Ibid.) In other words,
“[t]he $ 250,000 MICRA maximum for noneconomic damages must be apportioned
according to Proposition 51.” (Id. at p. 1102.) Mayes resolved “the
interplay between MICRA and the percentages of fault of the various defendants
under Proposition 51.” (Ibid.) 
On the other hand, the court in Collins
distinguished Mayes on the grounds that in Mayes, “the jury was
also tasked with determining the settling defendants' proportionate liability.”
(Collins, supra, 60 Cal.App.5th at p. 1065.) In such a case, “failing to
reduce under MICRA before apportioning the settlement ran afoul of
Proposition 51 because it would result in the settling defendants paying
noneconomic damages that were inconsistent with the portion of fault set by the
jury.” (Ibid.) “No such concern is present” where there is no issue of
apportionment of fault. (Ibid.) Instead, “application of MICRA before
calculating the setoff is not required because MICRA applies to damages awarded
at trial, and not settlements, which are ‘not the same as damages.’” (Id.
at pp. 1066-67.) 
Here, as in Collins, the jury did
not apportion liability amongst the different defendants. Rather, Defendant
Bode was determined solely responsible for Plaintiff’s damages. Unlike Mayes,
there is no issue of Defendant “making up the amounts the settling parties did
not pay.” (Mayes, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1102.) Therefore, “the
relevant ratio is the actual economic damages as a percentage of the total
damages suffered by [Plaintiff], not the ratio between the economic damages and
the amount of damages that [Plaintiff] can recover.” (Francies v. Kapla
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1387.) Defendant will not be “held liable for any
portion of noneconomic damages attributed to another defendant by the
finder of fact” and will still “receive[] the benefit of MICRA.” (See Collins,
supra, 60 Cal.App.5th at p. 1067, emphasis in original.)  
Defendant argues that Collins was
wrongly decided and that the case illogically concludes that a MICRA-protected
defendant would settle for substantially more than their potential liability.
However, Defendant cites no authority disapproving of or distinguishing Collins.
Moreover, a MICRA-protected defendant may settle for a substantial amount
notwithstanding the MICRA cap if the defendant expects substantial economic
damages. And of course, “[t]he settlement includes not only damages, but also
the value of avoiding the risk, expense, and adverse public exposure that
accompany going to trial. There is no conceptual inconsistency in allowing a
plaintiff to recover more from a settlement or partial settlement than he could
receive as damages.” (Hoch v. Allied-Signal, Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
48, 67-68.) MICRA was not intended “to include settlement recoveries in the cap
on noneconomic damages. To the contrary, we have noted that the Legislature had
jury awards in mind when it enacted the cap, and that only a collateral impact
on settlements was contemplated.” (Rashidi, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p.
726.) 
In sum, the offset applicable to economic
damages is to be calculated using the jury’s actual award. Therefore, the
offset amount is $332,220 as determined above. The MICRA cap will apply when
calculating Plaintiff’s total recovery. The calculation proceeds as follows:
·       Economic damages:
$9,474,350.29 - $332,220 = $9,142,130.29;
·       Noneconomic
damages: $250,000;
·       Total =
$9,392,130.29. 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to $9,392,130.29, plus prejudgment interest. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to enforce
judgment is GRANTED.
