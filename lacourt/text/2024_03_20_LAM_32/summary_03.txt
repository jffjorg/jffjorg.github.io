And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief was moot because they had disavowed any right to the composer's royalties. However, the judge found that this concession only confirmed that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment, and that the controversy is still ongoing. The judge also rejected the defendants' claim that the law of the case doctrine applies, as the Court of Appeal's decisions did not conclusively establish the defendants' rights to the royalties. The judge concluded that the defendants' motion for reconsideration is denied.
