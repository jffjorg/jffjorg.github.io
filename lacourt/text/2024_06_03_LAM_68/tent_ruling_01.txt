SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 11, 2022,, Defendant Jeff Kern, et al. entered into an agreement with
Plaintiff APB Properties, Inc. for the purchase of certain commercial property
located at 6342 Pacific Bl., Huntington Park. The purchase price was
$2,050,000, with a 90-day escrow period. Kern deposited $60,000. Subsequent
negotiations based on requests for repair led to a reduction in price, with
escrow closing date remaining May 31, 2022. Plaintiff buyer failed to follow through
on the purchase. APB Properties, Inc. seeks the $60,000 deposit as liquidated
damages.
 
On
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Written Contract
and Declaratory Relief. Kern filed a cross-complaint for Breach of Contract of
Contract and Declaratory Relief on April 13, 2024, with the answer filed on
April 14, 2023. Kern alleges APB Properties, Inc. withheld material information
on the condition of the property, thereby breaching the purchase contract. 
 
On
May 19, 2023, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration. On December
27, 2023, the court terminated the arbitration order and lifted the stay. APB
Properties, Inc. answered the cross-complaint on December 28, 2023. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff/Cross-
Defendant, APB Properties, Inc. (APB) move to compel response to Request for
Production of Documents (set one), served on Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Jeff

time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
APB
represents service of Request for Production of Documents (set one) on January
4, 2023. The discovery was served on former counsel. New counsel substituted
into the case on January 26, 2024. Moving counsel contacted new counsel, but
received no update on the outstanding discovery. [Declaration of Harris Cohen.]
 
The motion is granted. Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Jeff
Kern is ordered to serve verified responses to request for production of
documents (set one) without objections within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a-b).)
 
Sanctions in the amount of $872.50. The mandatory statutory
minimum required for request for production of documents is now $1,000, but
since counsel only requested $872.50, the court declines to raise the minimal
level beyond the noticed amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.040,  2023.050, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Sanctions payable in 30 days and imposed jointly against responding party and
