And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Scott Sakamoto and Jamie Sakamoto, have filed a special motion to strike the second cause of action for fraud in the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants argue that this cause of action arises from protected activity, which includes communications made to the bonding company and the Contractors State License Board. The court finds that the defendants have satisfied the first prong of the statute, which requires them to show that the challenged cause of action is based on protected activity. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a probability of prevailing on the fraud cause of action, as the allegations do not properly state a claim for fraud against the defendants. Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion and strikes the second cause of action for fraud with prejudice.
