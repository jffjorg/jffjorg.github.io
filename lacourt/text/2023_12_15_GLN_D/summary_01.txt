And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to relieve the attorney (A.H. Chan Law Firm, PC) as counsel for Defendant David Chang. The attorney is seeking to be relieved due to the client's failure to respond to attempts to communicate and failure to pay additional deposit as agreed. The client has not appeared in court or responded to the attorney's attempts to contact them. The judge has continued the hearing multiple times due to concerns about notice being served on the client. The latest proposed order has been submitted with the current future dates and will be accepted by the court. The motion is granted, and the attorney will be relieved effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
