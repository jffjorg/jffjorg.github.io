And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by plaintiff Ramon F. Zavala Armenta against defendant Kia America, Inc. The court notes that the parties are aware that this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation), which was signed by the court on January 24, 2023. The order provides that any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the court. The court finds that plaintiff may not compel further responses to the special interrogatories without first obtaining a stipulation or court order based on good cause permitting the propounding of such additional discovery. The court also notes that the order provides for specified discovery in connection with production of documents, including the production of certain records and documents. The motion to compel further responses to interrogatories is denied without prejudice, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the order. The court also points out to the parties that any additional requests for documents may only be propounded by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
