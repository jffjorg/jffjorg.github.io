STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud and
enforcement of governing documents for a homeowner’s association under the
Davis-Stirling Act. Plaintiff sued Formosa Gardens HOA (“Defendant HOA”) and
Alexsei Durack and Kevin Ngoc Khuat (“Individual Defendants”) alleging breach
of governing documents, multiple violations of the Davis-Stirling Act (Civ.
Code § 5200 et seq.), fraud, theft in violation of Penal Code section 496,
conversion, intentional interference with contractual relations, and
declaratory relief. 
 
            Defendants
move for attorney’s fees following the Court’s ruling on Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendants move for attorney’s
fees following the Court’s ruling on Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Adjudication. On December 13, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Adjudication as to Plaintiff’s causes of action for breach of governing
documents, violation of various provisions of the Davis-Stirling Act (Civil
Code section 5205 et seq) and declaratory relief but denied summary
adjudication as to the claims for fraud, conversion, and intentional
interference with contractual relations. (December 13, 2024 Minute Order.) 
 
            Defendants
claim that they are entitled to attorney’s fees in the amount of $223,425.00
following the Court’s granting of summary adjudication as to the claims under
the Davis-Stirling Act. Defendants rely on Civil Code section 5975, subdivision
(c), which states that “[i]n an action to enforce the governing
documents, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs.” (Civ. Code § 5975(c) [emphasis added].) Although the Davis-Stirling Act
does not define “prevailing party,” the Code of Civil Procedure defines that
term as follows:
 
“Prevailing
party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than
monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the
court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion
costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules
adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) Here, the action
remains ongoing, as the Court has not granted summary adjudication of the tort
causes of action. Thus, no party has obtained a net monetary recovery or a
dismissal, and Plaintiff has not conclusively failed to recovery any relief
against these parties. Further, there is no question that Plaintiff’s remaining
claims may be said to involve the enforcement of the HOA’s governing
documents.  Plaintiff’s surviving claims
for fraud, conversion, and interference with contract are grounded on
allegations that Plaintiff was defrauded by the individual Defendants into
paying $15,894 in past due assessments which were not actually owed based on
their false representations that they were the rightfully elected Board of
Directors and on their false assertions that there were legitimate assessments
on Plaintiff’s unit that were past due and had to be paid to close escrow. (FAC
¶¶ 132-140.)  Because these claims remain
unresolved, Defendants’ motion is simply premature. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED. This ruling is without
prejudice to a subsequent motion for attorney’s fees following a final
resolution of the merits of the case, whether by trial, settlement, or other
appropriate means. 
 
            Moving parties to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
