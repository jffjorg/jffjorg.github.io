And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $223,425.00. The defendants claimed entitlement to these fees based on Civil Code section 5975(c), which states that the prevailing party in an action to enforce governing documents shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs. However, the judge ruled that the defendants' motion is premature because the action remains ongoing, with the plaintiff's claims for fraud, conversion, and intentional interference with contractual relations remaining unresolved. The judge noted that the defendants have not obtained a net monetary recovery or a dismissal, and the plaintiff has not conclusively failed to recover any relief against the defendants. The judge's ruling is without prejudice to a subsequent motion for attorney's fees following a final resolution of the merits of the case.
