And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition from Defendant American Honda Motor Co. to confirm an arbitration award. The petition was filed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1285. The judge notes that, unless the parties agree to confirm the award, the petition must be set for a hearing as a noticed motion. The judge also cites relevant California Code of Civil Procedure sections, including 1290, 1290.2, and 1290.4, which regulate the process for confirming arbitration awards. Since the arbitration agreement does not specify a manner of service, the judge directs the plaintiff to file a noticed motion to confirm the award and sets it for hearing on the court's regular calendar.
