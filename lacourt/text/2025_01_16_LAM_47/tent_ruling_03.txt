 Case Number:  21STCV46621    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  47 The Court notes that Defendant
American Honda Motor Co. has filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1285, that is set for a status
conference today.  
 
Unless the parties stipulate to confirm the award, the
Petition must be set for hearing as a noticed motion.  Under CCP section
1290, any proceeding “under this title [the California Arbitration Act] is
commenced by filing a petition.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 1290.) Section 1290.2
states that “[a] petition under this title shall be heard in a summary way in
the manner and upon the notice provided by law for the making and hearing of
motions, except that not less than 10 days’ notice of the date set for the
hearing on the petition shall be given.” (CCP 1290.2.) Moreover, subdivision
(c) of section 1290.4 states that “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person on whom
service is to be made has previously appeared in the proceeding or has
previously been served in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section,
service shall be made in the manner provided in Chapter 5 (commencing with
Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 2 of this code. (Code Civ. Proc. section
1290.4(c).) 
 
Since both parties have appeared in the action and the
arbitration agreement attached to the petition doesn’t provide for a specific
manner of service, CCP 1010 et seq governs, and that statute requires that the
notice state when the motion will be made. (Code Civ. Proc. section
1010.)  Accordingly, the Court directs Plaintiff to file a noticed motion
to confirm the award based on his Petition and set it for hearing on the
Court’s regular calendar.
