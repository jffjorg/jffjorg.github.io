And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for attorney's fees, which was filed after the court granted their motion for summary adjudication on some claims. The defendants claimed they were entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $223,425.00, citing Civil Code section 5975, subdivision (c), which states that the prevailing party in an action to enforce governing documents shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs. However, the judge ruled that the defendants' motion was premature because the action remains ongoing, and the court has not granted summary adjudication on the tort causes of action. The judge also noted that the defendants' claims for prevailing party status were based on their successful summary adjudication motion, but this did not necessarily mean they were entitled to attorney's fees. The judge reserved the right to reconsider the motion for attorney's fees following a final resolution of the merits of the case.
