[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTIONS
  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (2) 
 




 
 
Daniel B. Lopez of U.S. Law Group (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for Defendants Bijan Mawji and Mawji Tait Holdings Inc. 
The Court notes that Counsel has provided sufficient reason for
withdrawal. However, the proofs of service filed with the motions indicate that
Counsel’s clients and Plaintiffs were served with the moving papers on October
17, 2024 “by USPS mail and/or e-filing and/or e-mail and/or electronic
transmission.” Thus, it is unclear if the parties were served by mail or
electronic service. The Court notes that California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (d) contains different
requirements depending on whether the motion was served by mail or electronic
service. 
In addition, the Court notes that under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[u]nless otherwise
ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall
be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing…However, if the
notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the
hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if the place of mailing and
the place of address are within the State of California…and 20 calendar days if
either the place of mailing or the place of address is outside the United
States…” 
Here, sixteen court days prior to the November 12, 2024 hearing is
October 18, 2024. 
As
to service on Counsel’s clients, the proofs of service filed with the motions
list addresses in “Vancouver, BC.” As discussed above, “if the notice is served
by mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be
increased by…20 calendar days if either the place of mailing or the place of
address is outside the United States…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Twenty
calendar days prior to October 18, 2024 is September 28, 2024. However, the
proofs of service filed with the motions indicate that the moving papers were
served on October 17, 2024. In addition, as to service on Plaintiffs, five calendar
days prior to October 18, 2024 is October 13, 2024. However, as discussed, the
proof of service filed with the motions indicate that the moving papers were
served on October 17, 2024. Thus, it appears that the motions were not timely
served under Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b). 
Lastly, the Court notes that Item 6 of the proposed order pertaining
to Defendant Mawji Tait Holdings is blank. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the motions without
prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
