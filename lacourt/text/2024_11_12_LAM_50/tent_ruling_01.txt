Summary
Of Facts Common To Both The Breach Of Contract And Fraud Causes Of 
Action
 
A.        Testimony
of Plaintiffs Diego Ascencio and Celestino Preciado.
For the period of 2018-2020, title to the property in this
case located at 
4903
S. Van Ness Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90062 (the “Property”) was held in
the name of Plaintiffs Edelmira Giron (“Edelmira”) and Diego Ascencio (“Diego”).[3]
(Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 9, lines 3-15). Edelmira is Diego’s
mother. Plaintiff Celestino Preciado is Diego’s father-in-law (“Celestino”). (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 8, lines 17-22).  
Celestino located an advertisement placed by Defendant in
the El Clasificado newspaper, stating that he is a contractor and his contact
information. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 1 and 1b: Defendant’s Advertisement in
“El Clasificado” and the certified translation attached thereto.] Defendant’s
advertisement stated that Defendant was able to "To Legalize Rooms Without
Permits As Dwellings, General Construction, Remodels And Additions, Painting,
Roofing, Windows, In Order To Raise The Value Of The Home.· Roofing And –
Roofing Guaranteed." At first, Defendant identified himself as “Jose,” but
then later told Plaintiffs that his name was “Epitacio;” specifically when he
provided Plaintiffs with the receipt for payment, he indicated his name was
Epitacio. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 50,
line 3 through Page 54, line 3).
            Defendant also placed another
advertisement in the El Clasificado newspaper stating that Defendant’s services
were: "To Legalize Rooms With No Permits, Legalize Garage -- Garage As
Dwelling, Doing Construction, Remodel, Additions, Painting, Roofing, Windows To
Raise The Value Of The Home, Blueprint Permits Guaranteed." Defendant’s
name on this ad was “Jose” and he had the same phone number. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 2 and 2b: Defendant’s Advertisement in “El
Clasificado” and the certified translation attached thereto.]  (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 54, line 4 through Page 55, line 18). Defendant placed another advertisement in El
Aviso.com stating that Defendant had a license and his services were: ·"We
Legalize And We Convert ADU Garage And Room For Dwelling, General Construction,
Remodel, Additions, Roofing, And Roofing Permits And License." Defendant’s
name on this ad was “Jose” and he had the same phone number. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 3 and 3b: Defendant’s
Advertisement in “Elviso.com” and the certified translation attached thereto.]   [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 4 and 4b:
Defendant’s Advertisement in “Elviso.com” and the certified translation
attached thereto.] Celestino understood this to mean that Defendant
was able to perform the services listed and that he was a licensed contractor. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 55, line 19 through Page 58, line 4). When Celestino
called the number on the ads, he spoke with Defendant. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 58, lines 6-8).
            Celestino then introduced Defendant
to Edelmira and Diego. Edelmira and Diego also authorized Celestino to speak
with Defendant regarding the work to be completed on the Property. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 58, lines 9-11, 18-21). In or about May 2018, Diego
contacted Defendant to legalize the ADU located in the back of the Property. The
Defendant said he would do the drawings first because that was the first step.
They reached an agreement to do the drawings for $15,000. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 10, lines 8-28,
page 11, lines 1-5). Diego paid him $5,000 and asked if he was licensed. Defendant
said that he was licensed. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 7: a copy of the receipt for
$5,000 from Defendant to Defendant crossing out the name of “Jose”, the name
Defendant originally claimed.] (Transcript No. 1,
dated 5/29/24, Page 11, lines 9-25; Page 14, lines 8-16, 24-28; Page 15, lines
1-9, Page 58, lines 12-14).
Diego met with Defendant again on July 26, 2018. Defendant said
he needed more measurements and an additional $5,000.00. Diego paid him $5,000.00.
[Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 8; Receipt from Defendant to Diego for payment of
$5,000.00.] (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page
15, lines 11-28; Page 16, lines 1-14). On the receipt that Defendant
provided to Diego, he wrote a number and told Defendant that it was his
contractor’s license number after Diego inquired about it. He later learned that it was his driver’s license number. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 16, line 27 through Page 17, line 23).
Thereafter, Defendant told Diego that there was an easement
issue with the drawings and that he needed an additional $5,000.00, which Diego
paid. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 9: Receipt from Defendant to Diego that states it
is for the “Plan Easement Process” for $5,000.00.] [Plaintiff’s Exhibit
10: Receipt from Defendant to Diego for $5,000.00 for blueprints.]
(Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 17, line 28; Page 18, lines 1-4, 12-16;
Page 19, lines 3-8).
Diego then paid the Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety the amount of $4,000 for permits for the Property which were approved. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 20, lines 1-10).
After the drawings were approved by the Los Angeles Department
of Building and Safety, Diego hired Defendant to complete construction on the
Property, and Defendant agreed. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 20, line
22 through Page 21, line 13, Page 21, line 28 through Page 22, line 17). [Plaintiffs’
Exhibit 5 and 5b: Contract dated November 11, 2019, and certified translation
thereof.] Defendant drafted the Contract, and under the Contract, Defendant
was to complete all construction on the Property, except painting. Celestino
paid Defendant a down payment of $5,000 on the contract and another $5,000
toward the balance. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 21: Bank
statement of Celestino listing check number 2957 to Defendant in the amount of
$5,000 dated November 16, 2019,
and listing check
number 2963 to Defendant in the amount of $5,000]. The
Defendant did not carry out the terms of the contract, instead complaining that
it was too much work. So Diego and Celestino and Defendant then entered into
another contract for the foundation and framing. The Contract specified that
the work to be completed was to be laying the concrete floor and framing. This
Contract was for $21,000, with a deposit of $7,000, another payment of $9,000,
and a balance of $5,000 to be paid on the date the inspector signed off on the
framing. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 6 and 6b: Contract Dated December 24, 2019,
and a certified translation thereof]. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page
24, lines 18-28; Page 25, line 1 through Page 26, line 26).
Celestino paid Defendant the down payment of $7,000 and the
additional payment of $9,000. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 20: Bank statement of Celestino
listing check numbers 2965 and 2966 to Defendant in the amounts of $7,000 and $9,000,
respectively]. (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 64, line through Page
65, line 12.)  After Defendant
received the payment of $16,000, Defendant told Diego and Celestino that the
work had passed inspection, so the balance of $5,000 was due on the Contract,
and they could move on to the plumbing work. Celestino then paid Defendant the
amount of $5,000 on or about January 25, 2020. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 11:
Copy of check from Celestino to Defendant in the amount of $5,000].  (Transcript No. 1,
dated 5/29/24, Page 27, line 23 through Page 29, line 20; Page 59, lines 11-21;
Page 63, lines 1-28; Page 64, lines 1-28; Page 67, lines 1-28). After issuing
that check, Celestino voided the check and paid Defendant $5,000 in cash. [Plaintiffs’
Exhibit 12: Copy of receipt for payment made in cash from Celestino to
Defendant in the amount of $5,000].  (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 68, lines 4-10, 24-28; Page 69, lines 1-23). Based
on Defendant’s representation that the inspector approved the work, Celestino
then hired plumbers to complete the work and paid the plumbers $6,000. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 70, lines 6-16). Once hired, Celestino asked
Defendant to go to the site and look at the work the plumbers were doing. Defendant
requested to be paid $200 to do this, and Celestino paid him.  [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 13: Copy of receipt dated
June 26, 2020, from Defendant to Celestino for the payment of $200.] (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 70, lines 17-28; Page 71, lines 1-9). The work was
completed by the plumbers and Celestino then called the inspector to complete
the final inspection. The inspector advised Celestino that he could not sign
off because the wall between the bathroom and kitchen had to be torn down to
create two feet of room. The inspector stated that he already explained this to
Defendant because it was part of the work that Defendant had to complete.  (Transcript No.
1, dated 5/29/24, Page 71, lines 12-17). [Plaintiff’s Exhibit 16:
Notice of Violation from the Los Angeles Department of
Building and Safety dated December 6, 2019.] The violation
notice was for the Footing, Foundation, And Slab, stating the
following:

Existing Footing:· Minimum 12- 12-BY-12 INCHES;  Remove Drywall For Insulation.
As Per Title 24, 'Expose All Plumbing And Electrical, Expose
     Framing, Provide Epoxy Barrier On Existing Concrete, Provide Permits For
     The Front Addition, Expose All Underground Mechanical To The ADU.
Additional Correction May Follow.

(Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 31, lines 20-22;
Page 34, lines 2-14).
On or
about July 21, 2020, the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety issued
another violation notice stating the following: "Go
Back To The Plan Check To Show Site
Condition On Plan Or Make Site Comply With The Approved Plans,
Also Footings, Frame, And Plumbing." [Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17: Notice of Violation from the Los Angeles Department of
Building and Safety dated July 21, 2020.] (Transcript No. 1, dated
5/29/24, Page 36, lines 16-28; Page 37, lines 1-4). On November
19, 2020, another violation notice was issued by from the Los
Angeles Department of Building and Safety, stating the following:
"Follow
The Approved Set Of Plans For Framing and Shear Wall." [Plaintiff’s Exhibit 18: 
Notice of Violation from the Los Angeles Department of
Building and Safety dated November 19, 2020.]  (Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 37, lines 13-16,
Page 38, lines 18-19). Despite not passing inspection, the Plaintiffs paid
Defendant the remaining balance under the contract of $5,000, based on Defendant’s
misrepresentation that all of the work had passed inspection. When Celestino
spoke with Defendant about this, Defendant refused to fix the work and stated
that he was going to keep the blueprints.[4]
(Transcript No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 71, lines 18
through Page 72, lines 1-12). The Property remains the same. (Transcript
No. 1, dated 5/29/24, Page 72, lines 14-16). 
B.        Testimony of Defendant.
            Defendant testified that he
completed the blueprints for the construction of the Property and was paid
$20,000 by Plaintiffs. (Transcript No. 2, dated 6/13/24, Page 39, lines 1-17).  Defendant testified he is not a licensed
contractor and he does not have a handyman license. (Transcript No. 2, dated 6/13/24,
Page 36, lines 14-28; Page 37, line 1, 12-14). Defendant testified that his
brother had a contractor’s license under which he works but that Defendant
himself is not licensed. Defendant also testified that he has been
self-employed for the last 10 years. Defendant testified that he was in a
partnership with his brother; however, at his deposition on May 31, 2024,
Defendant denied being in a partnership with anybody. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit
14: Deposition Transcript of Defendant, dated May 31, 2023, Page 18, Lines
25-end of page, and Page 19, Line 1]. 
(Transcript No. 2, dated 6/13/24, Page 14, lines 12 through 16, Page 15,
lines 1 through 11, Page 37, lines 15-26; Page 38, lines 26-28).
Defendant testified that as to the second contract, the
services to be provided by him were the concrete foundation and framing.
Defendant testified that he charged Plaintiff Celestino $200 to check on the
work of the plumbers. Defendant testified that he personally received $20,000
under the first contract and issued receipts to Plaintiffs. Defendant testified
that there was a second contract for $35,000 that was canceled, and another
contract was drafted in its place. Defendant testified that he drafted and
signed both of these contracts. As to the pending contract, Defendant testified
that he was paid $16,000 upfront by Plaintiffs, and that the remaining $5,000
was due when the work that includes the framing passed inspection. (Transcript
No. 2, dated 6/13/24, Page 23, line 17 through Page 24, line 7, Page 39, lines 2
through Page 40, line 28). 
C.        Testimony
of Inspector Enrique Preza.
            The Inspector, Enrique Preza (“Inspector”)
testified that the initial violation notice dated December 6, 2019, was more or
less a kind of pre-inspection, and they needed to expose everything that was
built without a permit. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 16: Notice of Violation from
the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety dated December 6, 2019.]  The Inspector testified that the reason he
would have issued the violation notice dated July 21, 2020, would be because the
site did not match the plans, there were corrections that needed to be done,
the site needed to match what the approved plans had or they had to go back to
plan check and do a revision to show the site conditions on the plan. He would
not have issued the notice of violation if the framing had been “okay.” [Plaintiff’s
Exhibit 17: Notice of Violation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety dated July 21, 2020.] (Transcript No. 3,
dated 6/24/24, Page 12, line 1 through Page 15, line 1). The
Inspector further testified that due to the fact that the wall was going to be
inside the restroom, the restroom had to be relocated and the plans had to
reflect this change and the plumbing had to move according to the plans. As of
July 21, 2020, the framing was not approved. (Transcript No. 3, dated 6/24/24, Page
15, lines 2-28, Page 21, line 28; Page 22, lines 1-9).
            The
Inspector further testified that the Notice issued on November 19, 2020,
required the wall to be completed pursuant to the plans, including ensuring the
sheathing, the plywood on the wall for earthquake - for seismic movement. So
the contractor needed to follow where those shear walls were going to be
installed according to the plans. The Inspector noted that this work included
the framing and the other work associated is also done by the person completing
the framing. The Inspector testified that as of the November 19, 2020 notice
date, the framing was not correctly completed. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 18: Notice
of Violation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety dated
November 19, 2020.] (Transcript No. 3, dated 6/24/24, Page 17, lines 1-22).
            D.        Testimony of Gerardo Flores.
            Defendant’s Brother, Gerardo Flores
(“Gerardo”) refused to answer directly whether Defendant is his employee and
whether he gave him a W-2 at the end of the year. He testified that Defendant
files his own taxes based on the earnings he received from his jobs. He described
Defendant as “not fully an employee” and he gives him bonuses when he helps him
out. He did not testify that Defendant works under a license he may have. [Transcript No. 4, dated 07/01/24, Page 22, Line 12 through Page 23, line 24
19-26; Page 25, Lines 15-20].  Gerardo
testified that he has never met with any of the Plaintiffs. [Transcript No. 4,
dated 07/01/24, Pages 23, Lines 27-28; Page 24, Lines 1-9]. 
E.         Stipulated
Facts.
            a) 
Plaintiffs and Defendant stipulated that the ADU (additional dwelling
unit) on the Property was previously unpermitted and that was the reason Plaintiffs
hired Defendant to legalize the ADU. [Transcript No. 2, dated
06/13/24), Page 31, Line 17 through Page 32, line 11].
            b) 
Plaintiffs stipulated that they paid Defendant $20,000 to complete the
drawings for the ADU legalization. The drawings were completed by Defendant and
were approved and they have the drawings. [Transcript No.
3, dated 06/24/24, Page 28, Lines 12-16].
 
 
 
 
A.   
Did Defendant Breach His Contract With
Plaintiffs? If So, What Amount Of Damages Did Plaintiffs Prove? 
 
“To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract,
the plaintiff must prove (1) the
contract,
(2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance,
(3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” ((Richman v. Hartley (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
The Contract. 
Here, there were three contracts between Plaintiffs and
Defendant: the first for the Defendant to complete and provide the blueprints
for legalizing the ADU on the Property; the second for the construction of the
ADU, which was later cancelled by the parties because of Defendant’s complaint
that it involved too much work; and the third contract for Defendant to provide
the concrete foundation and framing for the ADU. The payment of the remaining balance on the third contract
of $5,000 was contingent on the framing passing inspection. 
Plaintiff’s Performance of the Contract. 
Plaintiffs paid $20,000 to Defendant for the blueprints for
legalizing the ADU. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 7, 8, 9
and 10.] Plaintiffs paid $31,200 for Defendant’s performance
under the aborted second contract and the third contract for the concrete
foundation and framing and for reviewing the work of the plumbers.  
$10,000:
[Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 21]
$16,000: [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 20]
$5,000:
 [Plaintiffs’
Exhibit 12]
$200: [Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 13]
It was
undisputed that Plaintiffs paid, and Defendant received, the total amount of
$51,200. 
 
Defendant’s Breach.  
Defendant failed to correctly complete the concrete
foundation and framing for the ADU as
contracted
and in accordance with the approved blueprints. [Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 16, 17
and 18]
            Resulting
Damage to Plaintiffs for Breach of Contract. 
Plaintiffs have proven that they have been damaged for
breach of contract in the amount of $31,000 representing Defendant’s failure to
deliver the concrete foundation and framing in compliance with the blueprints
and the City requirements, despite having been paid $31,000.
B.     Did Defendant Defraud
Plaintiffs? If So, What Amount Of Damages Did Plaintiffs Prove Resulted From The
Fraud? 
 
            Civil Code Section 1572 provides that
actual fraud “consists … of the following act[] committed by a party to the
contract, or with his connivance, with intent to deceive another party thereto,
or to induce him to enter into the contract: …The suggestion, as a fact, of
that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true…”
Here, Defendant intentionally misrepresented that he was a
licensed contractor when he was not, and that the work he was contracted to
complete, passed inspection, when it did not. Defendant admitted in his
testimony that he was not licensed. Defendant’s brother, Gerardo, did not testify
that Defendant worked under any license that Gerardo had and he never met the
Plaintiffs. It was clear from the evidence in this case, that Defendant
fraudulently held himself out as having a contractor license, both in
advertising and in person when meeting with the Plaintiffs. 
Additionally, Defendant did not complete the construction
work competently on January 20, 2020, as he informed the Plaintiff. The framing
did not pass inspection as indicated by the Inspector’s testimony. Defendant knowingly lied to
Plaintiffs about passing inspection in order to wrongfully get paid in full.
At the time the above representations were made by
Defendant, they were known to be false by Defendant. These fraudulent
representations were made for the purpose of deceiving and inducing the
Plaintiffs to enter into the contract and to pay the amounts described above,
which they did in reliance upon Defendant’s representations.
Under Business and Professions Code section
7031, subdivision (d), when a license is controverted, proof of the license
shall be made by producing a verified certificate of licensure from the
Contractor State License Board. Here, Defendant has admitted that he is not
licensed, and failed to provide any evidence of having a license. Business and Professions Code Section 7031(b), provides
that “a person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may bring
an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all
compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or
contract.”
Defendant admitted to receiving the total amount of $51,200
from Plaintiffs. Consequently, under Business and Professions Code Section
7031(b), Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the $51,200 paid to Defendant. In
addition, after being told by Defendant that the Inspector approved the framing
and it had passed inspection, Plaintiff Celestino Preciado paid $6,000 for
plumbers to complete the plumbing work on the ADU in reliance upon the
statements of Defendant. Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the additional
$6,000 for a total of $57,200.
C.   
If Plaintiffs Proved Fraud, Are They
Entitled To Recover Punitive Damages From Defendant?
 
Plaintiffs
did not put on any evidence of Defendant’s ability to pay punitive damages. Facts
relevant
to an assessment of punitive damages include the defendant’s ability to pay. Bigler-Engler
v Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal. App. 5th 276, 307. Without evidence
of the defendant’s ability to pay, the Court cannot determine if the amount
requested is excessive and therefore inappropriate. (Ibid.)
Consequently, Plaintiffs are not entitled to an award of punitive damages from
Defendant.
 
II.              
CONCLUSION
            The Court finds in favor of  Plaintiffs on their breach of contract and
fraud causes of action. Because Plaintiffs cannot recover on both causes of
action, the Court assumes that Plaintiffs elect to recover under their fraud
cause of action, including the remedy provided by Business and Professions Code
section 7031(b) of recovering the $51,200 paid to Defendant. Additionally,
Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the $6,000
they paid for plumbers to complete the plumbing work on the ADU in reliance
upon the false statements made by Defendant. The total amount Plaintiffs are
entitled to recover against Defendant is $57,200.
            In their Closing Brief, Plaintiffs have
requested prejudgment interest on the $51,200, but they have not provided any
authority for the awarding of such prejudgment interest.
Plaintiffs also have requested attorney fees in their Closing
Brief. The basis for awarding such fees is not identified. Plaintiffs may seek
attorney fees if they have a basis therefor by filing a regularly noticed
motion. 
     Within ten days after this Statement of
Decision becomes final, Plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve a proposed
judgment in accordance with this Statement of Decision (with a courtesy copy
delivered to Dept. 50). 
The
Court hereby dismisses the Doe defendants if not dismissed previously. 
            Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this Tentative
and Proposed Statement of Decision.
