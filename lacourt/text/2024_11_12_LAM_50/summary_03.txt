And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by Counsel, Daniel B. Lopez, to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Bijan Mawji and Mawji Tait Holdings Inc. The Court notes that Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, but the proofs of service filed with the motions indicate that Counsel's clients and Plaintiffs were served with the moving papers on October 17, 2024, which is unclear whether it was served by mail or electronic service. The Court also notes that the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing was not met, as the proofs of service filed with the motions indicate that the moving papers were served on October 17, 2024, rather than the required date of October 18, 2024. Therefore, the Court denies the motions without prejudice and orders Counsel to give notice of this order.
