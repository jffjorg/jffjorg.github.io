[1]Plaintiffs allege
that “Michael Peddicord claimed in court that he was acting on behalf of the
owner of both companies, then created a new company named Norwalk Electronics
Supply Inc., corporate #5907924, on or about September 18, 2023, merely two
days after the last hearing date. He asserted that all taxes had been paid and
that Norwalk Electric Supply was restructured under William Appliance. This
maneuver was clearly an attempt to circumvent the legal issues surrounding the
original corporation.” (Compl., ¶ 34.) The Court notes that it is not entirely
clear how these allegations relate to the alleged unlawful detainer actions. 


[2]In the instant
motion, Defendants argue that “[t]he trespass to land claim involves Defendants’
physical entry onto the Plaintiffs’ property and actions like posting legal
documents and obstructing access. The posting of legal documents and related
activities were connected to Defendants’ exercise of legal rights or actions
taken in furtherance of their Unlawful Detainer (UD) claims. Therefore, this
conduct constitutes protected activity under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (e), especially when these
actions were part of and related to judicial proceedings.” (Mot. at p. 16:6-11,
emphasis omitted.) This is not disputed by Plaintiffs, who do not oppose the
instant motion. 


[3]The Court also
notes that in Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
275, 281, the Court of
Appeal found that “[t]he prosecution of an unlawful detainer action indisputably is
protected activity within the meaning of section
425.16. The constitutional right to petition…includes the basic act of
filing litigation or otherwise seeking administrative action.” (Internal
quotations and citations omitted.)
