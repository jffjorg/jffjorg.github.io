And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the issue of whether the actions taken by the defendants were protected activity under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The defendants argue that their actions, including posting legal documents and obstructing access, were connected to their exercise of legal rights or actions taken in furtherance of their unlawful detainer claims, and therefore constitute protected activity. The plaintiffs do not oppose this motion. The Judge notes that the creation of a new company, Norwalk Electronics Supply Inc., by Michael Peddicord, two days after the last hearing date, appears to be an attempt to circumvent legal issues surrounding the original corporation. However, the Judge also notes that the prosecution of an unlawful detainer action is protected activity under section 425.16, as held in Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275. The Judge will consider these factors in making a final ruling on the issue.
