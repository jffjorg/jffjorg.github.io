Summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by the defendants (Shengli Ge, Peng Liang Gong, and CTC Investment Properties, Inc.) to the plaintiff's (Chao Xu) Second Amended Complaint for professional negligence. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to conduct a background check on the tenant, Grayson Bosworth, which resulted in damage to his property. The defendants argue that the economic loss rule applies and that the plaintiff cannot recover damages for the alleged negligence. The court finds that the exculpatory provision in the contract between the parties is unenforceable and that the plaintiff has amended the complaint to add allegations of property damage. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled.
