And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jose Rodriguez v. Ford Motor Company, denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the plaintiff's second cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has pled allegations sufficient to satisfy the fraud exception to the economic loss rule, and that the defendant's alleged concealment of the transmission defect constitutes a duty to disclose.

The Court concludes that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that the defendant knowingly concealed the alleged 10R80 Defect, and that the defendant had a duty to disclose this information to the plaintiff. The Court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment are rooted in the sale of the vehicle, and that the defendant's alleged failure to disclose the defect constitutes a breach of its duty to disclose.

The Court notes that the case is currently on review by the California Supreme Court, and that the Supreme Court's decision may affect the precedent set by this case. However, the Court finds that the case law supports the plaintiff's claim, and that the defendant's alleged fraudulent concealment constitutes a sufficient basis for liability.

The Judge orders that the parties submit on this tentative ruling, and that they indicate their intention to submit on the tentative by email to the Court. The Court will adopt the tentative as the final order if no parties submit on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing.
