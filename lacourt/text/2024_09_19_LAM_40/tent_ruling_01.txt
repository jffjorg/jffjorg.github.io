 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Loretta
  Antoinette Webb’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Aghasi Smbatyan’s Complaint. 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Aghasi Smbatyan (Smbatyan)
sued Defendant Loretta Antoinette Webb (Webb) pursuant to a February 20, 2024,
Complaint alleging causes of action for (1) Motor Vehicle, (2) General
Negligence, and (3) Intentional Tort.  The
claims arise from a motor vehicle incident that occurred on February 27, 2022,
at Fairfax Avenue and Beverly Boulevard, in Los Angeles, CA, 90036. Smbatyan
alleges that Webb negligently owned and operated a vehicle and drove recklessly
with disregard to high risk of injury to another, causing a collision with Smbatyan’s
vehicle, intentionally causing injury and damage. (Compl., ¶¶ MV-1, MV-2, GN-1,
IT-1.)
B. Motions Before the Court
On May 29, 2024, Webb filed a
Motion to Strike and Demurrer to the Complaint’s third cause of action for
Intentional Tort. According to the proof of service on file with the Court,
Webb properly served both motions on Smbatyan’s counsel via overnight courier and
electronic service on May 29, 2024. 
No opposition or reply has been
filed. 
 
II. Motions
A.   
Meet and Confer
The Court notes that Webb has met
the meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Margaryan Decl., ¶ 4.)
B.   
Motion to Strike
Webb moves to strike the following
portions from the Complaint: 
1.    
Paragraph 14.a.2., in its entirety, including the
words: “punitive damages.”
2.    
The words: “defendant intentionally caused the damage
to plaintiff”, found in Paragraph IT-1, on page 6.
3.    
The words: “recklessly and with disregard to high risk
of injury to another.”
4.    
Any and all references to punitive and/or exemplary
damages, and related allegations.
Webb argues that allegations in the
Complaint are insufficient to support a request for punitive or exemplary
damages because “the factual and ultimate allegations presented fail to
demonstrate the requisite elements of malice, oppression, and/or fraud
required” (Mot. to Strike pp. 4-5.) 
Based on the demurrer analysis
below, Smbatyan has not presented facts sufficient to show that he is entitled
to punitive or exemplary damages because he has not pleaded any facts
demonstrating that Webb acted in a malicious or oppressive manner. Smbatyan
has also not pleaded facts sufficient to show that Webb acted intentionally.  
Thus, Webb’s motion to strike is
GRANTED. 
C.   
Demurrer
1)    
Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
2)    
Analysis
The Complaint alleges the following
regarding the third cause of action for Intentional Tort: “Plaintiff […] Aghasi
Smbatyan alleges that defendant […] Loretta Antoinette Webb […] was the legal
(proximate) cause of damages to plaintiff. By the following acts or omissions
to act, defendant intentionally caused the damage to plaintiff […] Defendant(s),
driving recklessly and with disregard to high risk of injury to another, caused
a collision with with [sic] plaintiff’s vehicle, resulting in property damage
and personal injuries to the plaintiff.” (Compl. ¶ IT-1.) 
Webb demurs to the intentional tort
cause of action on the grounds that Smbatyan has failed to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action for an intentional tort. She argues that there
is not a generic intentional tort cause of action and that Smbatyan fails to
allege ultimate facts supporting a specific intentional tort claim. (Demurer p.
7.) Webb argues that “conclusory allegations that Defendant acted intentionally”
do not suffice to establish the state of mind required for an intentional based
claim. (Demurer p. 8.)
Here, the allegations in the
Complaint do not identify a particular intentional tort. Under California
Rule of Court, Rule 2.112(2), “[e]ach separately stated cause of action, count,
or defense must specifically state its nature.” Additionally, Smbatyan
has not alleged any facts that demonstrate Webb’s conduct was intentional. 
There is
no opposition to the motion.
Accordingly, Webb’s demurrer to the third
cause of action for intentional tort is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
III. Conclusion
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Third Cause of Action – Intentional Tort is SUSTAINED,
with leave to amend. 
 Defendant’s Motion to Strike is
GRANTED.
