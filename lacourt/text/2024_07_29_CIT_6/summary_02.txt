And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the information presented, I find that the defendant's counter-notice fails to address the plaintiff's allegations of breach. The plaintiff's notice of breach was properly served, and the defendant's failure to respond to this notice constitutes a failure to fulfill contractual obligations. The plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000, plus legal fees. The defendant's offer of $50,000 is insufficient and is rejected. The case will proceed to a full trial on the merits. The parties are directed to file their trial briefs by April 15, 2024."
