Defendant: Zhilin Han 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an abatement action. On January 13, 2021, plaintiff City of El Monte
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Chi Ian Ho (Ho), Zhilin Han
(Han), and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action for violation of El
Monte Municipal Code, violation of Unfair Competition Law, and violation of
MAUCRSA. 
            On
February 8, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Ho from this action with prejudice. 
            On
March 5, 2024, default was entered against Han. On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a request for entry of default judgment against Han.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
declaration of nonmilitary status against each defendant whom default judgment
is sought; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds
for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’
fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $1,235,653.79,
including $1,216,620.00 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $14,056.20 in attorney
fees, and $4,977.59 in costs. The Court finds some issues with Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment, mainly regarding the damage
calculations. Plaintiff’s damage calculations are comprised of $162,000.00 for the
First Cause of Action for various violations of the El Monte Municipal Code,
$0.00 for the Second Cause of Action based on Unfair Competition Law
violations, and $1,054,620.00 for the Third Cause of Action for violations of
the Medical Adult/Use Cannabis Regulation Safety Act (MAUCRSA). The $162,000.00
appears properly explained and accounted for, but the $1,054,620.00 conflicts
with the amount demanded in the complaint. (Plaintiff’s Factual Summary, ¶¶
30-35; Compl., p. 10, ¶ 11.) The complaint only prayed for $10,500.00 for the
MAUCRSA violations on the Third Cause of Action. (Id.; see Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824 [“[I]n all default
judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.”]; see also Becker v. S.P.V. Constr. Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
[prayer for damages in excess of $20,000 will not support a default judgment
for more than that amount].)
A default judgment is void when
the damages are in excess of the damages specified in the complaint. (See Yeung
v. Soos (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 576.) The trial court lacks jurisdiction to
enter a judgment against a defaulting defendant which awards greater relief
than that sought in the plaintiff’s complaint. (See In re Marriage of Lippel
(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1160, 1167.) 
The Court also notes some discrepancies in
the Proposed Judgment submitted on the regular pleading form, i.e., the version
not submitted on Form JUD-100. The Court notes that the proposed language
therein mentions Defendants being jointly and severally obligated, but there is
only one defendant in this action, i.e., Han. (See Proposed Judgment, ¶ 4;
Request for Dismissal (2/8/24) [Defendant Ho]; Request for Dismissal (5/14/24)
[Doe Defendants].) The other portions of the Proposed Judgment are addressed solely
to Han, so it appears this may have been an inadvertent mistake. (See Proposed
Judgment, ¶¶ 1-3.) As such, this language is potentially problematic and cannot
be used.CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
