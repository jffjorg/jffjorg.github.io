And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date. The plaintiff, Heather Vanian, filed a complaint against several defendants in 2021, alleging negligence related to surgery she underwent in 2019. She is seeking a continuance of the trial, which is currently scheduled for May 8, 2024. The judge has considered the parties' agreement to the continuance, as well as the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, which govern the granting of continuances. The judge has found that the plaintiff has made a showing of good cause to continue the trial date, as she is scheduled to undergo additional surgeries and will not be fully recovered until late 2024. The judge has granted the motion and advanced the trial date to approximately January 20, 2025.
