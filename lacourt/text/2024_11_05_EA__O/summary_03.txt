And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is overruled. The plaintiff has filed a partition action to divide a property in which both parties own a half-interest. The defendant claims that the Family Court has jurisdiction over the property issues due to a previous dissolution judgment, but the judge finds that the cases are not related and that the complaint states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for partition. The judge notes that the dissolution judgment is not provided and that there is no explanation as to why it would prohibit the current partition lawsuit. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the case will proceed.
