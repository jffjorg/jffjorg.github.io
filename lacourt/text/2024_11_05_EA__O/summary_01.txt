The ruling is based on the fact that RKA Consulting Group did not find any imminent threat of collapse, but rather substandard building conditions, and that the vacate order was valid since substandard conditions existed. The ruling also finds that the plaintiffs' claims of negligent acts against RKA Consulting Group are moot.
