[1] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural background only provides the pertinent
filings. 


[2] As a prefatory matter, and as with Plaintiffs’
opposition to Avalon’s MSJ, Plaintiffs quote portions of the court’s previous
rulings for the proposition that the court has spoken on an issue. (See e.g.,
Opp. pp. 2-3 [regarding economic loss rule]; Opp. p. 17 [“However, none of
these cases are relevant since this Court already decided in its tentative
ruling to Khatri’s Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement ….”].) But
what this court decided on previous rulings was predicated upon arguments and authority
it had at the time of making of those rulings. Additionally, what Plaintiffs
cite to is largely obiter dicta. (RKA also relies upon a court’s prior
statement. See Reply p.7:27-28.) 
   


[3] Plaintiffs’ objections need not be addressed as they
evidence is not being used resolve any relevant legal issues.
This section is merely for context. 
 


[4] Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objection to SS No. 10 on the
grounds that McEwen’s declaration lacks foundation is overruled as McEwen, as a
legal representative of the City, has personal knowledge of this fact. 


[5] And it
is also unclear how the government tort claim would govern the exact nature of
allegations as to RKA when RKA is an independent contractor, and per
Plaintiffs’ own recitation of law, Government Code section 810.2 does not
include an independent contractor as an ‘employee.’ (Opp. p. 9:20-22.)
