And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses several issues in the case between RKA and Avalon. The court notes that previous rulings were based on the arguments and authority available at the time and are largely obiter dicta. The court overrules RKA's evidentiary objection to SS No. 10, citing that McEwen, as a legal representative of the City, has personal knowledge of the fact. The court also clarifies that Government Code section 810.2 does not apply to independent contractors like RKA. The court's decision is based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws.
