 Case Number:  24PSCV02030    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANT'S DEMURRER is OVERRULED because the
complaint states sufficient facts to constitute a partition COA. 
 
Background
 
This is a partition action. 
 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff FREDERIC P. SCHMITT filed suit
against BERNARDINA M. SCHMITT, an individual; DOES 1-20, INCLUSIVE, ALL PERSONS
UNKNOWN CLAIMING LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RIGHT, TITLE, ESTATE LIEN, OR INTEREST IN
THE REAL PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THE COMPLAINT ADVERSE TO PLAINTIFF’S INTEREST,
OR ANY CLOUD UPON PLAINTIFF’S TITLE/INTEREST THERETO NAMED HEREIN AS DOES 21-40
alleging that Plaintiff and Defendant own half-interest and that Plaintiff
seeks partition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property.
 
On August 2, 2024, Defendant filed a ‘Notice of Related
Case’ indicating that the real property at issue and the same parties were
involved in case KD 096153. 
 
On August 5, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer. 
 
On August 12, 2024, the court issued the following minute
order Re: Notice of Related Case stating in the relevant part the following:
“The Court finds both cases originated in the East District, and the Notice of
Related is to be determined by the Supervising Judge of the East District . . .
The Court finds that the following cases, 24PSCV02030 and KD096153, are not
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).”
(emphasis added). 
 
On October 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
 
To date, as of Sunday, November 3, 2024, the reply has been
received (due 5 court days before hearing). 
 
 
Discussion[1]
 
Defendant demurs on the grounds that the Family Court
assigned to the dissolution matter has jurisdiction to resolve any property
issues between the parties as indicated in the Judgment in that matter. More
specifically, the demurrer states that the Judgment equally divided the
abovementioned property between the parties, but gave no specifics as to how
and when such division should occur. (Demurrer p. 4:4-8.) In opposition, the
Plaintiff essentially states the same thing as to the Dissolution Judgment failing
to “explain how the Parties would move forward with joint ownership, including
ultimately to sell the Subject Property.” (Opp. p. 2:6-8.) Notwithstanding, the
cases have been deemed NOT RELATED and as noted by Plaintiff, a copy of the
Dissolution Judgment is not provided, there is no request for judicial notice,
nor is there any explanation as to why that would be prohibit the current partition
lawsuit.
 
Therefore, as the complaint complies with the five elements
of CCP section 872.230 (¶1, ¶8, ¶12, ¶15), then the face of the
pleadings does sufficiently state a COA for partition. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
