And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and has scheduled a hearing on the issuance of a Preliminary Injunction. After considering the representations made by the plaintiff, the judge granted the TRO without opposition. However, at the hearing, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he will prevail on the merits of his claim. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated Civil Code § 2923.6(f), etc., but failed to adequately prove that the property is his residence. The defendants did not violate CCP § 2923.5 because the property is not considered an "owner-occupied residential real property" or "residential real property that is occupied by a tenant and that contains no more than four dwelling units." Therefore, the TRO is dissolved and a Preliminary Injunction is denied. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
