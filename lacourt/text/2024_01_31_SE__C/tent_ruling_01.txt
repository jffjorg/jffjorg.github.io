Plaintiff’s
Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
No opposition
filed as of January 30, 2024.
 
Plaintiff Fredy Tobar (Plaintiff) moves for an
order for terminating sanctions against Defendant Office Chairs, Inc.
(Defendant).
Background
On
August 13, 2019, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against Defendants Affluent
Staffing, LLC and Office Chairs, Inc. for discrimination, wrongful termination,
and Labor and Government Code violations arising out of a workplace injury in
July 2017. Plaintiff alleges that Norberto Garcia was his supervisor and
Defendant’s production manager for 25 years.
Legal
Standard
If
a party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses or
attendance at a deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions. (CCP § 2025.450(h); § 2030.290(c); § 2031.300(c).) “To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method … the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose … [monetary,
issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process ….” (CCP § 2030.030.) “Misuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: … (d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery … (g) Disobeying a
court order to provide discovery ….” (CCP § 2030.010.)
Discussion

Plaintiff moves for terminating sanctions and
monetary sanctions after Defendant violated this Court’s September 14, 2023 order
compelling the deposition of Defendant’s employee Norberto Garcia within 20
days. 
1)          
Terminating Sanctions
Terminating sanctions are not warranted. “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’ ” (Los Defensores, supra, 223
Cal.App.4th at 390.) Here, Defendant has failed to
comply with this Court’s Order compelling Garcia’s deposition because
Defendant’s counsel states that Garcia is ill and potentially
“terminal.” (Ariavand Decl., ¶ 16.) Defendant’s counsel sent a doctor’s note
from Grace Life Medical Center from June 2, 2023 which places Garcia on
extended disability from June 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. (Ariavand Decl.,
Ex. C.) Thus, Defendant’s actions are not willful because Garcia appears to be
ill to some extent. Further, a less severe sanctions can address Plaintiff’s inability
to obtain testimony from Garcia because the Court can impose an issue sanction.
Therefore, terminating sanctions are not warranted because Defendant’s actions
were not willful and a less severe sanction can address Plaintiff’s inability
to obtain evidence. 
2)          
Issue Sanctions
Issue sanctions are appropriate because
Defendant has misused the discovery process. The court may impose issue
sanctions against a party that misuses the discovery process. (CCP § 2023.030(b).)
Misuses of the discovery process include failing to submit to a deposition,
disobeying a court order, and failing to meet and confer to informally resolve
disputes. (CCP § 2023.010.) Defendant has failed to produce Garcia for three
noticed depositions and failed to provide available dates for a deposition.  Further, Defendant’s counsel stopped
communicating with Plaintiff’s counsel after September 24, 2023, to attempt to
resolve the dispute. Additionally, Defendant and its counsel have failed to pay
the sanction from the September 14, 2023 Order. Thus, issue sanctions are
appropriate for Defendant’s misuse of the discovery process.
An issue sanction can prohibit a party from
opposing a claim. (CCP § 2023.030(b).) Defendant is prohibited from opposing
Plaintiff’s claims that Defendant violated Government Code § 12940 and Labor
Code § 1198.5 and Plaintiff was wrongfully terminated.
3)          
Monetary Sanctions
Monetary sanctions are appropriate because
Defendant’s misuse of the discovery process necessitated this Motion and
Defendant failed to obey a court order compelling Garcia’s deposition.
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant and
its counsel in the amount of $2,165.65 which consists of four hours for
drafting the Motion, 1 hour drafting a reply, and 1 hour attending the hearing
at a rate of $350.00 and the $61.65 filing fee. This Motion is unopposed and
the Motion is not complicated, therefore, the Court reduces the amount of
sanctions to $1,111.65.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. An issue sanction is
imposed against Defendant, prohibiting it from opposing Plaintiff’s claims that
Defendant Office Chairs, Inc. violated Government Code § 12940 and Labor Code §
1198.5 and Plaintiff was wrongfully terminated. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED and imposed
against Defendant Office Chairs, Inc. and its counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $1,111.65. This sanction is to be paid
within 20 days of this Order.
