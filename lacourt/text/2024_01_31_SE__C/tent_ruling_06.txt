Today’s hearing on

Pietro Pozo’s (Plaintiff) ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining
Order (TRO).

filed this Complaint on December 13, 2023 against Defendants alleging:
1.   
Violation
of Civil Code § 2923.6(f)
2.   
Violation
of Civil Code § 2924.10

Business Practices
Plaintiff
alleges as follows. He is the legal owner of real property commonly known as
228 North Hicks Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90606 (the Property). Plaintiff claims
that, in exchange for a loan, he signed the property to Defendant Hu through a
Deed of Trust which she assigned to Defendant County Records. Plaintiff was
unable to pay the balance of the loan on October 22, 2022. However, Defendants
never made contact with Plaintiff related to foreclosure or the loan prior to
recording a notice of default on August 17, 2023 and then, a notice of
trustee’s sale on November 21, 2023.
Legal
Standard
“As
its name suggests, a preliminary injunction is an order that is sought by a
plaintiff prior to a full adjudication of the merits of its claim.” (White
v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554 (emphasis omitted).) “[A]n order
granting or denying a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication
of the ultimate rights in controversy. Its purpose is to preserve the status
quo until the merits of the action can be determined.” (Socialist Workers
etc. Committee v. Brown (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 879, 890-891 (citations
omitted).) 
“In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers: (1) the likelihood that the moving party will prevail on the merits
and (2) the interim harm to the respective parties if an injunction is granted
or denied. The moving party must prevail on both factors to obtain an
injunction.” (Pittsburg Unified School Dist. v. S.J. Amoroso Construction
Co., Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 808, 813-814.)
Discussion

This Court granted Plaintiff’s TRO on
representations from Plaintiff that the property was his primary residence
(Pozo Decl. ¶ 2) and that Defendants did not contact Plaintiff to explore
options to avoid foreclosure in violation of CCP § 2923.5. (Pozo Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.)
The TRO was not opposed. 
Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate there is a
likelihood he will prevail on the merits because he has failed to adequately
prove that the Property is his residence. CCP § 2923.5 applies only to
“owner-occupied residential real property” or “residential real property that
is occupied by a tenant and that contains no more than four dwelling units ….”
(CCP § 2924.15.) The Property was not in livable
condition at the time Plaintiff declared that he was occupying it as a primary
residence. It appears that the back wall of the house was completely missing
and opening the entire house. (Gonzalez Decl., Ex. 2.) Additionally, the house
on the Property has burned down since December 2023. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 3, Exs.
6-9.) Thus, the Property is not Plaintiff’s or a tenant’s residence. Therefore,
CCP § 2923.5 does not apply and Defendants were not required to contact
Plaintiff. Thus, a preliminary injunction is denied and the TRO is dissolved
because Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that there is a likelihood that he
will prevail on the merits.
Defendants have
submitted numerous exhibits to their opposition but have failed to adequately
authenticate them in a declaration or by other means. Therefore, those exhibits
shall not be considered by this Court.
 
Accordingly, the TRO is
DISSOLVED and a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
