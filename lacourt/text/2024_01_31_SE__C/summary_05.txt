And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, Plaintiff Judith Zarate filed a complaint against the City of Norwalk for personal injuries sustained while working as a cross guard outside Glazier Elementary School. The City filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant Norwalk La Mirada School District, and La Mirada filed a cross-complaint against the City.

The Proposed Intervenor, Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company, seeks to intervene in the action because it is Plaintiff's workers' compensation carrier and has paid benefits to Plaintiff resulting from the same incident that gives rise to this action.

The Judge has granted the Proposed Intervenor's motion for leave to file a complaint-in-intervention, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 387(a) and Labor Code sections 3850(b) and 3853. The Judge has also noted that an employer's insurer may join as a party plaintiff under Labor Code section 3850(b).

Accordingly, the Proposed Intervenor is directed to file its complaint-in-intervention attached to its motion within 20 days of this order.
