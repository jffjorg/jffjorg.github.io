Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted
is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Yamamoto Equity, Inc. (Plaintiff)
moves to deem matters admitted.
Background
On
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant Samantha Rose
Warner, as Trustee of the Samantha Rose Warner Trust (Defendant) for Breach of
Contract and Specific Performance arising out of the sale of real property
commonly known as 8654 Bluford Avenue, Whittier, CA 90602. Plaintiff alleges
that the parties signed a contract for the sale of Defendant’s real property,
however, Defendant then refused to convey the deed to Plaintiff. 
Legal
Standard
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply … (b) The requesting party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted … (c) The court shall make this
order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280.)
Discussion

Here, Plaintiff served their Requests for
Admission (set one) on May 23, 2023, on Defendant. (Klingerman Decl. ¶ 3.) The
Requests were served on Defendant, who is personally representing herself, by
FedEx and by email. (Klingerman Decl., Ex. 1.) FedEx sent a proof of delivery
on May 24, 2023, at Defendant’s address of record, 8654 Bluford Ave., Whittier,
CA 90602. Defendant has not served responses as of the date of this hearing.
Thus, Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission (set one) are deemed admitted.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Matters Admitted is GRANTED.
