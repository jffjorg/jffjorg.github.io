And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case between Plaintiffs Evelyn Celeste Garcia and Angel Olmeda Juarez against Defendant General Motors, LLC. The Defendant demurred to the Fourth Cause of Action for Fraud, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge agrees and sustains the demurrer. Additionally, the Defendant moved to strike the request for punitive damages, which the Judge grants. The Judge also grants 30 days leave to amend the complaint. The ruling is based on the alleged fraudulent inducement by General Motors, LLC in the sale of a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado with a transmission defect. The Judge takes judicial notice of a similar case, Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc., which found that a plaintiff had adequately alleged that a defendant was aware of a defect in a vehicle. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead their fraud cause of action and that the underlying claim is inadequate.
