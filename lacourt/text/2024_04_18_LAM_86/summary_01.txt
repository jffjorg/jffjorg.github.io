Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling and English text:

**Case Number:** 23STCP01669

**Hearing Date:** April 18, 2024

**Department:** 86

**Case:** Robertson Tinio vs. California Board of Registered Nursing

**Tentative Ruling:** The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a proposed decision revoking Robertson Tinio's registered nurse (RN) license, with a three-year probation period. Tinio is challenging this decision, seeking a writ of administrative mandamus.

**Standard of Review:** The court will exercise its independent judgment, reviewing the evidence and making its own findings of fact.

**Gross Negligence, Incompetence, and Unprofessional Conduct:** The ALJ found that Tinio was grossly negligent, incompetent, and engaged in unprofessional conduct during his employment at Vibra Hospital. This finding is supported by the written statements and testimony of the nurses who precepted Tinio, as well as the expert opinion presented by the Board.

**Evidentiary Value of Written Statements and Testimony:** Despite being prepared after Tinio resigned from Vibra Hospital, the written statements and testimony of Thornton and Tiraterra have evidentiary value. There is no indication of coercion or inaccuracy in the statements.

**Findings:** The ALJ's findings are supported by the evidence, and Tinio's conduct poses a risk to patient health and care. The judge's decision is not arbitrary or capricious.

**Conclusion:** The court will review the evidence and make its own findings of fact, exercising its independent judgment.
