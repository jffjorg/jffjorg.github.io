And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to change the venue of the case from the Glendale Courthouse to the Compton Courthouse without prejudice. The judge granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice, taking notice of the complaint, corporate statements of information for the defendants, and other relevant documents. The judge found that the case was filed in the proper county under both Code of Civil Procedure sections 395 and 395.5. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a transfer was warranted, as the declaration of the plaintiff's counsel did not provide any facts showing the necessity of a transfer to the Compton Courthouse. The judge indicated that the plaintiff would need to provide more evidence to support a transfer.
