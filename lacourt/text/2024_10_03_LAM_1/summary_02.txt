And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiffs' motion to change the venue of the case from the Glendale Courthouse to the Santa Clarita Courthouse is denied without prejudice. The judge has granted the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice, allowing them to present evidence from the complaint, Retail Installment Sales Contract, and corporate statement of information for Defendant Kia of Valencia.

The judge has determined that the case was properly filed in the Glendale Courthouse, as it is located in the same county as Defendant Kia of Valencia's principal place of business. The judge has also found that the Retail Installment Sales Contract shows that the seller of the subject vehicle is Car Pros Kia Glendale, not Defendant Kia of Valencia.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a sufficient reason to transfer the case to the Santa Clarita Courthouse, citing the lack of factual evidence presented in the declaration of Plaintiffs' counsel. The judge has informed the plaintiffs that they have not met their burden to warrant a district transfer and that they must provide more evidence to support their motion.
