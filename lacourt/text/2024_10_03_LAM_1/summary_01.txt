The judge has denied the plaintiff's unopposed motion for a change of venue, but without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested to transfer the case from the Glendale Courthouse to the Torrance Courthouse. The judge found that the case was properly filed in Los Angeles County and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a need for a transfer. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice, allowing the court to take judicial notice of certain documents related to the case. The judge's ruling is based on the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court and the California Code of Civil Procedure.
