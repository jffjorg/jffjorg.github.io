And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, The Willows Community School, to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Protection of the Educational Rights of Kids, et al.

The plaintiffs brought the lawsuit against the school for breach of contract and declaratory relief. The school demurred to both causes of action, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the declaratory relief claim and that the breach of contract claim failed because the school's Covid-19 vaccine policy did not breach the enrollment contract.

The judge agreed with the school that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the declaratory relief claim because they did not have a beneficial interest in the controversy. The judge also agreed with the school that the breach of contract claim failed because the school's Covid-19 vaccine policy did not breach the enrollment contract. The judge found that the school's policy did not exceed its authority and that the plaintiffs failed to allege a breach of the contract.

The judge overruled the school's demurrer to the breach of contract claim and sustained the demurrer to the declaratory relief claim. The judge also denied the plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint.

The ruling means that the school's demurrer to the breach of contract claim is overruled, and the plaintiffs can proceed with their claim. However, the plaintiffs' declaratory relief claim is dismissed, and they cannot bring a new claim on this issue.
