[1] At the hearing, specially
appearing counsel for Defendants argued the ex parte application should be
denied because Plaintiffs improperly served notice of the application by
electronic service in the absence of an agreement to accept electronic
service.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.251(c)(3)B).)  Defendants are
incorrect.  The proof of service of the
ex parte application indicates service was made by overnight delivery and
electronic service.  The ex parte
application was properly served. 


[2] Defendants also cite Center for
Self-improvement & Community Development v. Lennar Corp. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1543 for the proposition that a court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction where a Notice to Quit is defective as a matter of law.  That case, however, is a Proposition 65 case
involving a defective certificate of merit. 
It has no application here.
