And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on an ex parte application. The defendants argued that the application should be denied because the plaintiffs improperly served notice of the application by electronic service without an agreement to accept electronic service. However, the judge has found that the proof of service shows that the application was properly served, both by overnight delivery and electronic service. The judge also rejected the defendants' cite of a previous case, Center for Self-improvement & Community Development v. Lennar Corp., which involved a defective certificate of merit and is not applicable to this case. The judge intends to deny the defendants' argument and allow the ex parte application to proceed.
