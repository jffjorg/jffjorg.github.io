I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is an unlawful detainer action.  On April 23, 2024, plaintiffs Joseph and
Evaristo and Catherine Evaristo, as Trustees of the Evaristo Family Trust Dated
May 4, 2016 (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a Judicial Council Form Complaint against
defendants Aina Dumlao and Bru Muller (collectively, Defendants) for failure to
pay rent for the property at 3450 N. Cahuenga Blvd. West, Unit #510, Los
Angeles, CA 90068 (the Property).  The
lease agreement and three-day notice to pay rent or quit are attached as
exhibits to the Complaint.  Defendants
are self-represented.
 
On September 13, 2024, Defendants filed a Demurrer to the
Complaint.  The hearing was scheduled for
October 16, 2024.
 
On September 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte
Application for an Order Denying, or, in the Alternative, Advancing the Hearing
Date or Shortening Time for the Hearing on Defendants’ Demurrer.  The court granted the ex parte application on
September 18, 2024.[1]  Pursuant to the court’s order, the hearing
was advanced and continued to September 24, 2024.  Defendants were directed to file their
opposition by September 20, 2024.
 
On September 18, 2024, Defendants filed an Amended Demurrer
to the Complaint.
 
On September 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  The opposition was served by overnight
delivery and electronic service.
 
No reply was filed.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
            A demurrer
for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿ When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged
facts as true.¿ (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)¿ “Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of
the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are
subject to judicial notice.”¿ (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
A.   
Judicial Notice      
 
Defendants’ unopposed request for judicial notice is
GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
 
B.    
Analysis 
 
In essence, Defendants advance two grounds in support of
their Amended Demurrer to the Complaint. 
Each ground lacks merit.  
 
First, Defendants argue the court does not have jurisdiction
over this action because there is another civil action pending between the same
parties asserting the same causes of action. 
Not so.  On March 31, 2024, Defendants
filed LASC Case No. 24STCV07207 against Plaintiffs alleging causes of action
for breach of warranty of habitability and influencing to vacate, among
others.  (See Request for Judicial Notice
(RJN) A.)  Although Defendants’ causes of
action in Case No. 24STCV07207 and the instant unlawful detainer action arise
from the parties’ landlord-tenant relationship, the causes of action are not
the same.  This is so because “[a]n
unlawful detainer action is a summary proceeding designed to adjudicate the
right of immediate possession; the only claims that are cognizable in such a
proceeding are those bearing directly on the immediate right of possession.”  (Hong Sang Mkt., Inc. v. Peng (2018)
20 Cal.App.5th 474, 490.)  In other
words, Defendants’ separately filed civil action does not involve the same
issue (right of possession of the property) and does not preclude Plaintiffs’
unlawful detainer action.  
 
Second, Defendants argue the Complaint is defective because (1)
the “pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,
as the Notice to Quit alleged monthly rent amount of $4,750.00, fails to match
up with the rent of $3,850.00, as stated in Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1 of the
Complaint” and (2) “Plaintiffs’ assert, at point 6.d of said Complaint, ‘RENT
WAS LATER INCREASED TO $4,750.00,’ but they do so without attaching a copy of
any written document whereby said increase to $4,750.00, was agreed to by all
relevant parties.” (Amended Demurrer,  ¶¶
21, 32, emphasis in original.)  In short,
Defendants argue the Notice to Quit was defective.
 
These are improper factual challenges.  In ruling on a demurrer, the allegations are
accepted as true.  (Nolte, supra,
236 Cal.App.4th at p. 1406.)  Defendants
may raise these challenges at trial or through motion for summary judgment.  Defendants’ cited authority only proves this
point.  (See Minelian v. Manzella (1989)
215 Cal.App.3d 457 (appeal of adverse judgment); Ernst Enterprises, Inc. v.
Sun Valley Gasoline (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 355 (appeal of an order granting
summary judgment in favor of plaintiff); Canal-Randolph Anaheim, Inc. v.
Wilkoski (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 477 (appeal of judgment in favor of tenant); Johnson
v. Sanches (1942) 56 Cal.App.2d 115 (appeal of judgment in favor of respondent).)[2]  Defendants fail to show any defects on the
face of the Complaint.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The Demurrer is OVERRULED.   
 
Defendants are ordered to file and serve their Answer to the
Complaint within 5 days of the date of this order.
 
 
Dated:   September 24,
