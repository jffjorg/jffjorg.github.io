And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a judgment creditor, PHILADELPHIA INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY, and a judgment debtor, Mehdi Omrani. The judgment creditor seeks an order for sale of the dwelling located at 5514 Sylvia Avenue, Tarzana, CA 91356, to satisfy the judgment debt of $92,060.

The judge finds that the procedural requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §704.770 were not met, as the judgment creditor did not properly serve the order to show cause and other required documents on the judgment debtor. Therefore, the judge continues the application to allow the judgment creditor to properly serve the order to show cause and other required documents.

The judge orders the judgment creditor to give notice of the continuation of the application.
