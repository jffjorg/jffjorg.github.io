LEGAL
AUTHORITY
Under CCP §695.010(a), except as
otherwise provided by law, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to
enforcement of a money judgment.  
Under CCP §699.710, except as
otherwise provided by law, all property that is subject to enforcement of a
money judgment pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 695.010) of
Chapter 1 is subject to levy under a writ of execution to satisfy a money judgment.

            Under CCP §704.740, “(a) Except as
provided in subdivision (b), the interest of a natural person in a dwelling may
not be sold under this division to enforce a money judgment except pursuant to
a court order for sale obtained under this article and the dwelling exemption
shall be determined under this article. . . .” 
Under CCP §704.750, “(a) Promptly
after a dwelling is levied upon . . ., the levying officer shall serve notice
on the judgment creditor that the levy has been made and that the property will
be released unless the judgment creditor complies with the requirements of this
section.  Service shall be made
personally or by mail.  Within 20 days
after service of the notice, the judgment creditor shall apply to the court for
an order for sale of the dwelling and shall file a copy of the application with
the levying officer.  If the judgment
creditor does not file the copy of the application for an order for sale of the
dwelling within the allowed time, the levying officer shall release the
dwelling. 
            Under CCP §704.760, “[t]he judgment
creditor’s application shall be made under oath, shall describe the dwelling,
and shall contain all of the following: 
(a) A statement whether or not the
records of the county tax assessor indicate that there is a current homeowner’s
exemption or disabled veteran’s exemption for the dwelling and the person or
persons who claimed any such exemption. 
(b) A statement, which may be based
on information and belief, whether the dwelling is a homestead and the amount
of the homestead exemption, if any, and a statement whether or not the records
of the county recorder indicate that a homestead declaration under Article 5
(commencing with Section 704.910) that describes the dwelling has been recorded
by the judgment debtor or the spouse of the judgment debtor. 
            (c) A statement of the amount of any
liens or encumbrances on the dwelling, the name of each person having a lien or
encumbrance on the dwelling, and the address of such person used by the county
recorder for the return of the instrument creating such person’s lien or
encumbrance after recording.” 
Under CCP §704.770, “(a) Upon the
filing of the application by the judgment creditor, the court shall set a time
and place for hearing and order the judgment debtor to show cause why an order
for sale should not be made in accordance with the application.  The time set for hearing shall be not later
than 45 days after the application is filed or such later time as the court
orders upon a showing of good cause. 
            (b) Not later than 30 days before
the time set for hearing, the judgment creditor shall do both of the
following:  
(1) Serve on the judgment debtor a
copy of the order to show cause, a copy of the application of the judgment
creditor, and a copy of the notice of the hearing in the form prescribed by the
Judicial Council.  Service shall be made
personally or by mail.
(2) Personally serve a copy of each
document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant of the dwelling or, if there is
no occupant present at the time service is attempted, post a copy of each
document in a conspicuous place at the dwelling.” 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and judgment creditor
Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company requests an order for sale of the
dwelling located at 5514 Sylvia Avenue, Tarzana, CA 91356, in accordance with
CCP §704.750, et seq.  Plaintiff asserts
that the total unpaid judgment is $92,060.
The Court issued a writ of
execution on June 12, 2024.  The
Sheriff’s Department served the notice of levy upon judgment creditor’s counsel
on November 14, 2024.  The application
was filed on November 19, 2024.  The
proof of service filed on December 10, 2024 indicates that defendant/judgment
debtor was served with the application by posting and by mail on December 3,
2024.
In opposition, defendant contends
that he was not properly served and that he does not have an interest in the
real property.
            The Court finds that the procedural
requirements under CCP §704.770 were not met and that the proof of service on
the judgment debtor is deficient.  CCP §704.770(a)
requires that the Court order the judgment debtor to show cause why an order
for sale should not be made in accordance with the application.  The Court notes that plaintiff submitted a
proposed OSC on eCourt but that the Court was unaware of it until the hearing
and did not sign it and thus there was no order.  CCP §704.770(b) requires that the judgment
debtor be served with a copy of the order to show cause.  The proof of service indicates that the
judgment debtor was served with an OSC but there was no OSC ordered by the
Court.
            The application is CONTINUED to
allow the Court to order an OSC and for the judgment creditor to properly serve
it and the other required documents in accordance with CCP §704.770.
