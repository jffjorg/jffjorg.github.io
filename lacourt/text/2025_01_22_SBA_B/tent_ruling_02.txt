On November 2, 2023, the Court
sustained defendants Cates and Dodd’s demurrer to the complaint with leave to
amend.
On November 2, 2023, defendants
Cates and Dodd filed a cross-complaint against Ecosmart Builders, LLC, Kamyar
K. Rezani, Farzad Zamani, JG Builders, Inc., and Jose Guadalupe Ramirez for (1)
breach of written contract, (2) breach of oral contract, (3) misrepresentation,
(4) negligence, (5) statutory recovery of compensation paid, (6) recission, (7)
fraud, and (8) unfair business practices.
On November 22, 2023, plaintiff JG
Builders, Inc. dba Ecosmart Builders filed a FAC for breach of contract.
On April 4, 2024, the Court
sustained with leave to amend the demurrers to the second, third, and seventh
causes of action in the cross-complaint and overruled the demurrers as to the
eighth cause of action.  The motions to
strike were granted with leave to amend as to claim for punitive damages.

LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Admissions
CCP §2033.220 states:  “(a) Each answer in a response to requests
for admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits. 
(b) Each answer shall:  (1) Admit so much of the matter involved in
the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as
reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.  (2) Deny so much of the matter involved in
the request as is untrue.  (3) Specify so
much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which the
responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.
(c) If a responding party gives
lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part
of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a
reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been
made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to
enable that party to admit the matter.”
Under CCP §2033.290, “(a) On
receipt of a response to request for admissions, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that either or both of the following apply:  (1) An answer to a particular request is
evasive or incomplete.  (2) An objection
to a particular request is without merit or too general. . . . (d) The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
CCP §2033.230 states:  “(a) If only a part of a request for
admission is objectionable, the remainder of the request shall be answered.  (b) If an objection is made to a request or
to a part of a request, the specific ground for the objection shall be set
forth clearly in the response. . . .”
CCP §2033.010 states:  “Any party may
obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing with
Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 2019.010), by a written request that any other party
to the action admit . . . application of law to fact.  A request for admission may relate to a matter
that is in controversy between the parties.”
DISCUSSION
Cross-defendant
Kamyar K. Rezani requests an order compelling cross-complainant Nancy Dodd to respond
further to cross-defendant’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 32.
No. 32
requests:  Admit that JG Builders Inc was
authorized to do business as “EcoSmart Builders” from January 29, 2019 through
the present.
Cross-complainant
Dodd responded, “Objection to the extent the Request calls for a legal
conclusion.  Admit that JG Builders, Inc.
filed a dba to use ‘Ecosmart Builders.’”
Cross-defendant
Rezani argues that cross-complainant’s response is incomplete, nonresponsive, evasive,
improper, and irrelevant, and that her objection is without merit and that
cross-complainant failed to perform a proper investigation.
In
opposition, cross-complainant argues that her response is proper.  She contends that she responded “so much of
the request as possible by admitting the fact that JG Builders, Inc. did file a
dba to use ‘EcoSmart Builders’” because “this dba was filed for use in
furtherance of fraud upon” Dodd and that Dodd cannot admit that the use of
“EcoSmart Builders” by Ecosmart to commit fraud was in fact “authorized.”
The Court
rules as follows:  The objection that the
request calls for a legal conclusion does not have merit and thus, it is
overruled, pursuant to CCP §2033.010.  That
statute states:
“Any
party may obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing
with Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 2019.010), by a written request that
any other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified
documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application
of law to fact.”  (Bold
added.)
Admitting
this request requires that the responding party apply the law to the facts.
 
Further,
the response is improper to the extent that it does not admit or deny whether
JG Builders is “authorized to do business” as EcoSmart Builders.
“[W]hen a
party is served with a request for admission concerning a legal question
properly raised in the pleadings he cannot object simply by asserting that the
request calls for a conclusion of law.  He
should make the admission if he is able to do so and does not in good faith
intend to contest the issue at trial, thereby ‘setting at rest a triable
issue.’ (Cembrook v. Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco,
Supra, 56 Cal.2d 423, 429, 15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303.)  Otherwise he should set forth in detail the
reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny the request. (Lieb v.
Superior Court In and For Orange County, 199 Cal.App.2d 364, 368, 18
Cal.Rptr. 705.)”  Burke v. Superior
Court of Sacramento County (1969) 71 Cal.2d 276, 282 [78 Cal.Rptr.
481, 488, 455 P.2d 409, 416]
The
motion is thus GRANTED.
 
            Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP §§2030.300(d), 2031.310(h).
Cross-defendant Rezani requests $2,750
against cross-complainant Dodd and her counsel Ryan Baldino, Esq.  Cross-complainant requests sanctions in the
amount of $1,995.  The Court finds that
sanctions are not warranted and, thus, the requests are DENIED.
ORDER
The
motion is GRANTED.
Cross-complainant
Nancy Dodd is ordered to respond further to cross-defendant Kamyar Rezani’s
Request for Admission, Set One, No. 32, within fifteen days.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
