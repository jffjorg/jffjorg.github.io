  Case Number:  24STCV05925    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Hearing on Demurrer without Motion to Strike
to Answer
 
Jonathan Mitchell’s Demurrer without Motion to Strike
to Answer is overruled.  
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Johnathan Mitchell filed this action against
Defendant Aptive Environmental LLC, alleging violations of the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act.
Defendant filed its Answer, asserting 26 affirmative
defenses on May 22, 2024.
Plaintiff filed a Declaration of Demurring Party in Support
of Automatic Extension on June 4, 2024.
Plaintiff filed a Demurrer without Motion to Strike to
Defendant’s Answer on July 3, 2024.
The motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Demurrer
to Defendant’s Answer. Plaintiff demurs to each of the 26 affirmative defenses
in Defendant’s Answer. Defendant filed an opposition.  Plaintiff filed a reply.  
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706. In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual allegations,
(2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded, and (3)
judicially noticed matters. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or
law. Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638. Because a demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the
complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of
action. Rakestraw v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
39, 43. Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer. § 430.10, subd. (e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126. 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint
the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644. “Whether the plaintiff will
be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-610.
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.[1]“ Uncertainty exists where
a complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet. Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2. 
A demurrer to an answer challenges the sufficiency of
the factual allegations of the answer. A defendant must plead ultimate facts
rather than conclusions to state viable affirmative defenses. The allegations
must be “averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which
constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint.” FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d. 367, 384.
 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff demurs to the Answer filed by Defendant under
section 430.20 on the grounds that each of Defendant’s affirmative defenses fails
to state sufficient facts to constitute an affirmative defense. Plaintiff
further demurs to affirmative defenses 2 and 6 to 26 on the grounds they are
uncertain.  
Defendant opposes the demurrer on the grounds that it
is untimely, and the declaration submitted to extend time does not comply
with section 430.41. Defendant further argues that the affirmative defenses are
properly pleaded and alternatively requests leave to amend.
A demurrer to an answer must be filed within 10 days
after service of the answer. § 430.40. Defendant served the Answer on 5/22/24
via email. Because the deadline to file a demurrer fell on a Saturday the
demurrer was due on 6/3/24. See § 12a. However, here, Plaintiff did not
file his demurrer until 7/3/2024.  Accordingly,
whether Plaintiff’s demurrer is timely depends on whether Plaintiff was
entitled to an automatic extension under section 430.41, subdivision (a)(2).
Section 430.41 requires a
meet and confer process via telephone, video conference, or in person before
filing a demurrer, 5 days before the demurrer is due. If the parties are not
able to meet and confer, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day
extension by filing and serving a declaration under penalty of perjury that a
good faith meet and confer was made and explaining why the parties could not
meet and confer. § 430.41, subd. (a)(2). Plaintiff did not attempt to meet and
confer until Friday, 5/31/24, only 3 days before the filing deadline, and did
so in a letter. Alizadeh Decl.; Demurrer, Exh. 1. Therefore, Plaintiff did not
comply with either the deadline to meet and confer or the requirement that the
meet and confer occur in person or over telephone or video conference. Because the
declaration shows Plaintiff failed to comply with the meet and confer
requirements, Plaintiff is not entitled to an automatic extension. Therefore,
the Demurrer is untimely. 
The Court has discretion to consider an untimely
demurrer. Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 749-750. However,
the Court chooses not to exercise its discretion based on Plaintiff’s failure
to timely meet and confer in compliance with section 430.41, subdivision (a)(2).
The Court overrules the demurrer as untimely.
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff's demurrer to the Answer is overruled.
