And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer without motion to strike to answer filed by Plaintiff Johnathan Mitchell against Defendant Aptive Environmental LLC. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of each of the 26 affirmative defenses asserted by the Defendant in its Answer. The Court has determined that the demurrer is untimely because the Plaintiff failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The Court has discretion to consider an untimely demurrer, but chooses not to exercise its discretion in this case due to the Plaintiff's failure to timely meet and confer. Therefore, the Court overrules the demurrer and denies Plaintiff's request to strike the Defendant's Answer.
