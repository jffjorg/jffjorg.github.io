 Case Number:  21SMCV01961    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Jones, et al. v.
The Farmer Limited Partnership et al., Case No. 21SMCV01961 
Hearing Date
September 26, 2023 
Motion for Order
Clarifying or in the Alternative Motion Contesting Application for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement 
 
Plaintiffs Jones
allege defendants failed to honor an option agreement for the purchase of a
house. Defendants Farmer and The Farmer Limited Partnership allege their real
estate brokers and agents, non-parties Grether, Mark and Compass California,
Inc. (collectively “Compass”), negligently drafted the option agreement. On
April 21, 2023 plaintiffs settled with defendants R&LS Investments, Inc.,
Phelps and Pacific Union International, Inc. 
 
The Farmer parties
seek clarification that a determination of good faith settlement would not bar
future claims against Compass, although the motion names Compass and Grether as
“settling parties.” A good-faith settlement determination cannot cover Compass,
since none of the Compass parties is named nor moved for determination of a
good faith settlement. 
 
Although page five
of the request names “Compass California, Inc.” as a settling party, the notice
identifies only R&LS Investments, Inc., Phelps and Pacific Union
International as settling defendants. 
 
The Farmer
partners do not otherwise dispute the request for determination of good faith
settlement. The court grants the motion as to R&LS Investments, Phelps and
Pacific Union International only. 
 
To the extent
moving parties intended to include Compass in the request for determination,
the Compass parties are NOT included within the court’s order, as they are not
parties. GRANTED.
