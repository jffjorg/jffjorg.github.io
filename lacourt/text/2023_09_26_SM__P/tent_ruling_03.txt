Aguilar et al. v.
Vargas, Case No. 23SMCV00572
Hearing Date
September 26, 2023 
Plaintiffs Aguilar
and Ortiz’s Motion to Set Aside or Vacate Dismissal (UNOPPOSED) 
 
This motor vehicle
case was dismissed August 24, 2023 due to plaintiffs’ failure to appear at a
June 6, 2023 hearing. Plaintiffs’ counsel Galajian states his failure to appear
was due to a calendar error, and he never received notice of the August 24,
2023 Order to Show Cause hearing. Plaintiffs move to set aside the dismissal. 
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken against a party
through “his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
Relief is appropriate when a party’s attorney is responsible for the mistake or
neglect. E.g., Dingwall v. Vangas, Inc. (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 108.
Relief under §473 should be liberally granted because public policy favors
resolution of disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default. E.g.,
Fasuvi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 685. 
 
It appears that
the clerk of the court listed an incorrect address for plaintiff’s counsel when
the case was filed. The court sent notices to an incorrect address. The mail
was never returned to the court, so the court did not discover the error until
this motion was filed. See Galajian declaration ¶¶1-3. The motion is timely. Considering
the public policy preference for resolving matters on the merits, and the
apparent mistake of the court, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court
to refuse to vacate the dismissal. GRANTED.
