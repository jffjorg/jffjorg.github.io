The court grants the motion as to R&LS Investments, Phelps, and Pacific Union International, but explicitly excludes Compass and Grether from the order.

## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion filed by The Farmer parties regarding a good faith settlement agreement reached with other defendants in this case (R&LS Investments, Phelps, and Pacific Union International). The Farmer parties want to clarify that this settlement won't prevent them from pursuing claims against Compass, a real estate company, in the future. 

The judge points out that Compass is not a named party in the settlement agreement and therefore cannot be included in the determination of good faith.  The judge grants the motion for a good faith settlement determination only for R&LS Investments, Phelps, and Pacific Union International, explicitly excluding Compass.

The court does not include Compass in the order since they are not a party in the case.
