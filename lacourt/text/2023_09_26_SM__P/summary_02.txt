And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by the defendants, The Farmer Limited Partnership, seeking clarification on whether a determination of good faith settlement would bar future claims against Compass California, Inc. and Mark Grether, despite naming them as "settling parties". The judge rules that a good-faith settlement determination cannot cover Compass, as none of the Compass parties are named or moved for determination of good faith settlement. The court grants the motion as to R&LS Investments, Phelps, and Pacific Union International, but explicitly excludes Compass and Grether from the order.
