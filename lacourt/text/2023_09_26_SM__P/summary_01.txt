And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions filed by the parties and has made the following tentative rulings.

First, the court denies Rubin's motion for judgment on the pleadings, as the allegations in the complaint are not contradictory to the testimony given by Stiffelman in an arbitration hearing.

Second, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, as the complaint does not adequately plead these claims.

Third, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for conversion, as the complaint does not identify a specific sum of money allegedly converted.

Fourth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for negligence, as the complaint does not adequately plead a duty of care.

Fifth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for unjust enrichment, as the complaint does not allege wrongful conduct.

Sixth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution, as the complaint does not allege that Stiffelman has suffered actual loss through payment.

Seventh, the court grants Stiffelman's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but reduces the amount of sanctions to $1,000.

Finally, the court orders Stuart Rubin to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days, and to provide a declaration that he has conducted a diligent search for any responsive documents.
