Second, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, as the complaint does not adequately plead these claims.

Third, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for conversion, as the complaint does not identify a specific sum of money allegedly converted.

Fourth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for negligence, as the complaint does not adequately plead a duty of care.

Fifth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for unjust enrichment, as the complaint does not allege wrongful conduct.

Sixth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution, as the complaint does not allege that Stiffelman has suffered actual loss through payment.

Seventh, the court grants Stiffelman's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but reduces the amount of sanctions to $1,000.

Finally, the court orders Stuart Rubin to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days, and to provide a declaration that he has conducted a diligent search for any responsive documents.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in the case of Stiffelman et al. v. Rubin et al. The first motion is Defendant Joseph Rubin's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argues that the first amended complaint does not include specific allegations against him and that its allegations contradict Stiffelman's sworn testimony in a previous arbitration hearing. The judge has denied this motion, citing the precedent set in Garcia v. Sterling, which holds that a court cannot conclude that a pleading is false based on allegedly conflicting deposition testimony.

The judge has also granted in part and denied in part Stiffelman's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Stuart Rubin. The judge has ordered Stuart Rubin to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days and has awarded Stiffelman $1,000 in discovery sanctions.

Additionally, the judge has considered Joseph Rubin's arguments that various causes of action in the first amended complaint are deficient, including the claims for fraud, conversion, negligence, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief for equity and contribution. The judge has granted Joseph Rubin's motion to dismiss certain causes of action with ten days leave to amend, but has denied other motions without leave to amend.

This tentative ruling is for the hearing of case 19SMCV01908, scheduled for September 26, 2023. The ruling addresses several motions, including Joseph Rubin's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Stiffelman's Motion to Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents from Stuart Rubin.

Joseph Rubin's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted with ten days leave to amend in regards to the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims (First, Second, Seventh & Eighth Causes of Action) due to insufficient specificity. The conversion claim is also granted with ten days leave to amend for not identifying a specific sum. The negligence claim is granted without leave to amend as Stiffelman does not adequately allege a duty of care. The unjust enrichment claim is granted with ten days leave to amend for not alleging wrongful conduct. The declaratory relief for equity and contribution claim is granted with ten days leave to amend for not alleging Stiffelman suffered "actual loss through payment."

Stiffelman's Motion to Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents from Stuart Rubin is granted. Stuart Rubin is ordered to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days and provide a declaration if he was unable to locate any responsive documents following a diligent search. Stuart is also ordered to pay $1,000 in discovery sanctions payable within 30 days.

**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 19SMCV01908
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** P

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses two motions: (1) Defendant Joseph Rubin's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and (2) Plaintiff Stiffelman's Motion to Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents from Stuart Rubin.

**Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings:**

1. Joseph Rubin's motion: The court rejects the motion, finding that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) are sufficient and not contradicted by Stiffelman's sworn testimony in a May 2021 arbitration hearing.
2. Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims: Stiffelman's claims are deficient for lack of specificity, and are granted with ten days leave to amend.
3. Conversion: The FAC's conversion claim is granted with ten days leave to amend, as it does not clearly distinguish between acts allegedly done by Joseph and Stuart.
4. Negligence: The FAC's negligence claim is barred under the economic loss rule, and is granted without leave to amend.
5. Unjust Enrichment: The FAC's unjust enrichment claim is granted with ten days leave to amend, as it does not allege wrongful conduct.
6. Declaratory Relief for Equity and Contribution: The FAC's indemnity and contribution claim is granted with ten days leave to amend, as it does not allege Stiffelman suffered "actual loss through payment".

**Motion to Compel further Responses:**

1. Special Interrogatory No. 20: Stuart Rubin failed to produce financial records for Glenroy Coachella Holdings, LLC, and is required to supplement his response with a sworn statement that he performed a diligent search but was unable to locate the records.
2. Request for Production of Documents No. 15: Stuart Rubin failed to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse", despite the court's orders. The court orders Stuart to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days, and awards Stiffelman $1,000 in discovery sanctions payable within 30 days from Stuart Rubin.

**Significant Statements:**

* The court will judicially notice the existence of Stiffelman's sworn testimony in the arbitration hearing, but not the truth of the matters contained therein.
* The FAC's conversion claim is sufficient to survive a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
* The FAC's negligence claim is barred under the economic loss rule.
* The FAC's unjust enrichment claim is insufficient to set forth a claim for unjust enrichment.
* The FAC's indemnity and contribution claim is insufficient to support an indemnity claim.
* The court orders sanctions in the amount of $1,000 for Stuart Rubin's failure to comply with discovery requests.
