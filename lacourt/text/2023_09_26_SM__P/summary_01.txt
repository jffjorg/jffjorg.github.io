First, the court denies Rubin's motion for judgment on the pleadings, as the allegations in the complaint are not contradictory to the testimony given by Stiffelman in an arbitration hearing.

Second, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, as the complaint does not adequately plead these claims.

Third, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for conversion, as the complaint does not identify a specific sum of money allegedly converted.

Fourth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for negligence, as the complaint does not adequately plead a duty of care.

Fifth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for unjust enrichment, as the complaint does not allege wrongful conduct.

Sixth, the court grants Rubin's motion to dismiss the cause of action for equitable indemnity and contribution, as the complaint does not allege that Stiffelman has suffered actual loss through payment.

Seventh, the court grants Stiffelman's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but reduces the amount of sanctions to $1,000.

Finally, the court orders Stuart Rubin to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days, and to provide a declaration that he has conducted a diligent search for any responsive documents.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in the case of Stiffelman et al. v. Rubin et al. The first motion is Defendant Joseph Rubin's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argues that the first amended complaint does not include specific allegations against him and that its allegations contradict Stiffelman's sworn testimony in a previous arbitration hearing. The judge has denied this motion, citing the precedent set in Garcia v. Sterling, which holds that a court cannot conclude that a pleading is false based on allegedly conflicting deposition testimony.

The judge has also granted in part and denied in part Stiffelman's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Stuart Rubin. The judge has ordered Stuart Rubin to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days and has awarded Stiffelman $1,000 in discovery sanctions.

Additionally, the judge has considered Joseph Rubin's arguments that various causes of action in the first amended complaint are deficient, including the claims for fraud, conversion, negligence, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief for equity and contribution. The judge has granted Joseph Rubin's motion to dismiss certain causes of action with ten days leave to amend, but has denied other motions without leave to amend.

This tentative ruling is for the hearing of case 19SMCV01908, scheduled for September 26, 2023. The ruling addresses several motions, including Joseph Rubin's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Stiffelman's Motion to Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents from Stuart Rubin.

Joseph Rubin's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted with ten days leave to amend in regards to the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims (First, Second, Seventh & Eighth Causes of Action) due to insufficient specificity. The conversion claim is also granted with ten days leave to amend for not identifying a specific sum. The negligence claim is granted without leave to amend as Stiffelman does not adequately allege a duty of care. The unjust enrichment claim is granted with ten days leave to amend for not alleging wrongful conduct. The declaratory relief for equity and contribution claim is granted with ten days leave to amend for not alleging Stiffelman suffered "actual loss through payment."

Stiffelman's Motion to Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents from Stuart Rubin is granted. Stuart Rubin is ordered to produce all documents referencing "Lighthouse" within ten days and provide a declaration if he was unable to locate any responsive documents following a diligent search. Stuart is also ordered to pay $1,000 in discovery sanctions payable within 30 days.
