And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Aguilar et al. v. Vargas, Case No. 23SMCV00572. The case was dismissed on August 24, 2023, due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at a June 6, 2023 hearing. The plaintiffs, represented by counsel Galajian, claim that the failure to appear was due to a calendar error and that they never received notice of the August 24, 2023 Order to Show Cause hearing.

The Judge has considered the plaintiffs' motion to set aside or vacate the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure §473(b). This section allows the court to set aside a dismissal taken against a party due to "his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." The Judge has found that the court's clerk listed an incorrect address for the plaintiff's counsel when the case was filed, which resulted in the court sending notices to an incorrect address. The mail was never returned to the court, and the error was not discovered until the motion was filed.

Considering the public policy preference for resolving disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default, and the apparent mistake of the court, the Judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal.

## English Summary

The tentative ruling in case number 23SMCV00572 concerns a motion by plaintiffs Aguilar and Ortiz to set aside the dismissal of their motor vehicle case. The case was dismissed on August 24, 2023, due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at a hearing on June 6, 2023. Plaintiffs' attorney, Galajian, states this was due to a calendar error and that he never received notice of the August 24th hearing.

The judge finds that the court clerk listed an incorrect address for Galajian when the case was filed, leading to notices being sent to the wrong address. This error was not discovered until the motion to set aside dismissal was filed. 

Based on the circumstances, particularly the court's own error and the public policy preference for resolving disputes on their merits, the judge grants the motion to vacate the dismissal.

Here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

In the case of Aguilar et al. v. Vargas, with the case number 23SMCV00572, Judge made a tentative ruling. This is regarding the future hearing, where Plaintiffs Aguilar and Ortiz made an unopposed motion to set aside a prior court order, as it resulted from what seems a legitimate case of accidental procedural fault rather than deliberately committed default and would thereby technically nullify, eliminate an in place previously final decree against Vargas issued back at 2023 on month eight  and also because during all intervening instances through before stated and possibly unknown technical slip that ultimately might get eventually be held out because plaintiffs actually hadn’t committed it; even although those very real same underlying and otherwise core originating foundational operative real underlying legally critical original grounds would need probably ultimately stay entirely officially exist after possible lifting away accidental in-force-right-now final dismissal via today stated Order.
