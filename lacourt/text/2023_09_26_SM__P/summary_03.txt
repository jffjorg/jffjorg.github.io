And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Aguilar et al. v. Vargas, Case No. 23SMCV00572. The case was dismissed on August 24, 2023, due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at a June 6, 2023 hearing. The plaintiffs, represented by counsel Galajian, claim that the failure to appear was due to a calendar error and that they never received notice of the August 24, 2023 Order to Show Cause hearing.

The Judge has considered the plaintiffs' motion to set aside or vacate the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b). This section allows the court to set aside a dismissal taken against a party due to "his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." The Judge has found that the court's clerk listed an incorrect address for the plaintiff's counsel when the case was filed, which resulted in the court sending notices to an incorrect address. The mail was never returned to the court, and the error was not discovered until the motion was filed.

Considering the public policy preference for resolving disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default, and the apparent mistake of the court, the Judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal.
