And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the attendance of defendant Gregory Castillo at trial and production of documents. The motion was filed by plaintiff John Doe, who alleges that Castillo performed a digital penetration on him without medical justification during a medical examination.

Castillo objected to the subpoena and notice to appear, which were served late. The court finds that Castillo's objections are valid, but that the motion is premature. The court declines to find any violation on a subpoena/notice to appear potion of the motion given the trial remains currently set for November 15, 2023, with potential referral to a long cause courtroom.

The court also declines to compel Castillo's attendance at trial and production of documents, finding that any failure to appear for trial may be addressed at the time of trial. The court defers any sought-after compelled testimony and/or document production to the time of any potential motions in limine and objections made during trial.

The motion is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff is to give notice to all parties.
