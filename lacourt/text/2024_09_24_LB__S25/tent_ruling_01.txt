  Case Number:  23LBCV01083    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn June 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants General Motors, LLC and Does 1 to 10, alleging violations of the Song-Beverely Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”), the breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and fraudulent inducement – concealment. Plaintiffs allege that on or about October 24, 2018, a warranty contract was entered into with Defendant regarding a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado with the vehicle identification number 1GCPWCED8KZ131718 (“Vehicle”). (Compl., ¶¶ 9, 10.) Plaintiffs assert that despite this warranty, Defendant did not offer to repurchase or replace the Subject Vehicle when the defects and nonconformities manifested during the warranty window for the Subject Vehicle. (Compl., ¶¶ 14-19.) On August 16, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer with motion to strike. On January 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”). On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to and a motion to strike portions of the FAC. On September 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike. On September 18, 2024, Defendant filed replies.Meet and ConferBefore filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The requirement has been met. (Pappas Decl., ¶ 2.)DemurrerDefendant demurs to the 5th cause of action (Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment) on the grounds that the claim fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and the claim fails to allege a transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose.The Court notes in Defendant’s Reply, the argument that Plaintiffs’ claim is time-barred was raised. As this argument was not raised in the moving papers and Plaintiffs had noopportunity to respond to this defense, the Court will not consider the argument for the purposes of this motion.Legal StandardA demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)Failure to State of Cause of Action“The elements of fraud,” including a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, “are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)The elements of a cause of action for fraudulent concealment are: (1) concealment of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose; (3) the defendant intended to defraud by failing to disclose; (4) plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as it did had it known the fact; and (5) damages.” (Butler America, LLC v. Aviation Assurance Company, LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 136, 144.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)A concealment cause of action has a more relaxed specificity requirement as compared to affirmative misrepresentations because a concealment claim does not assert that Defendant actively or affirmatively defrauded the public in general of Plaintiff in particular. The rule of specifically pleading how, when, where, to whom and by what means, misrepresentations were communicated is intended to apply to affirmative misrepresentations and not to concealment. (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356 at 1384.)Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' 5th cause of action fails as Plaintiffs have not plead fraud with the requisite specificity. The Court disagrees. While it is true that the FAC fails to allege the names of the persons who concealed facts or knew of a transmission flaw, other than the location of Defendant’s authorized dealer (Martin Chevrolet in Torracne, California), details of that nature are required in affirmative misrepresentation cases, not concealment cases. Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficiently detailed to state a cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. (See FAC ¶¶ 29, 31, 37-38, 66, 69-70, 73-74, 76 [concealment], 62-63, 66-69, 71 [knowledge of falsity], 74 [intent to induce reliance], 65, 69, 74, 76 [justifiable reliance], 76 [damages].)Transactional RelationshipDefendant argues that Plaintiffs’ fraud claim fails because Plaintiffs do not allege a transactional relationship between Defendants and Plaintiffs or other circumstances that would give rise to a duty to disclose.Defendant primarily relies on Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276 (“Bigler-Engler”), as the basis for its argument that Plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite transaction or relationship with Defendant to support a claim of fraud. The Bigler-Engler Court explained that a duty to disclose facts “arises only when the parties are in a relationship that gives rise to the duty, such as ‘“seller and buyer, employer and prospective employee, doctor and patient, or parties entering into any kind of contractual arrangement[]”’” and, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship, a fraudulent omission case may be grounded on one party's exclusive knowledge of material facts, activeconcealment of material facts or suppression of material facts in the context of a partial disclosure, but only where the parties share some sort of relationship in which a duty to disclose may arise. (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 311 [citing to Shin v. Kong (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 498, 509].) The Bigler-Engler Court goes further to state that “Such a transaction must necessarily arise from direct dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant; it cannot arise between the defendant and the public at large.” (Id. at 312.)However, there is conflicting case law on the need for a direct relationship between a plaintiff and a party who is accused of failure to disclose material information. (See Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1199; OCM Principal Opportunities Fund, L.P. v. CIB World Markets Corp. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 835, 859 [holding a vender “has a duty to disclose material facts not only to the immediate purchasers, but also to subsequent purchaser when the vendor has reason to expect that the item will be resold”].)In this case, the relationship between Plaintiffs and Defendant arises from a specific contractual connection - the 2019 Limited Warranty and Owner Assistance Information manual (the “Manual”). (See FAC, Exh. A.) The Manual “contains important information about [the Subject Vehicle's] warranty coverage.” (FAC, Exh. A [pages prior to Table of Contents].) Specifically, Defendant stated in the manual that it “requests that the vehicle be returned to the selling dealer for all warranty repairs” and it “will cover repairs to the vehicle during the warranty period” subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this manual. (Id., Exh. A at 1 and 4.) The relationship arising from the warranty provided by Defendant specifically to Plaintiffs, and not merely to the general public, constitutes a sufficient transactional connection to support a claim for failure to disclose. (See Scherer v. FCA US, LLC (S.D. Cal. 2021) 565 F.Supp.3d 1184, 1194 [discussion of Bigler-Engler case and holding that a failure to disclose claim is properly grounded on contractual relationship reflected in the warranty agreement].)Further, Plaintiffs’ FAC provides a sufficient basis for disclosure without a transaction between the parties as it pleads (1) Defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to Plaintiffs via “pre-production testing data, early consumer complaints about the Transmission Defect made directly to Defendant GM and its network of dealers, aggregate warranty data compiled from GM’s network of dealers, testing conducted by Defendant in response to these complaints, as well as warranty repair and part replacements data received by Defendant GM from Defendant GM’s network of dealers, amongst other sources of internal information;” (FAC ¶ 72a); and (2) concealment of this safety defect was material “in that a reasonable person would have considered them to be important in deciding whether or not to purchase the Vehicle.” (FAC ¶ 74.)Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to the 5th Cause of Action is overruled.Motion to StrikeDefendant moves to strike Plaintiffs’ demand for punitive damages in the Prayer for Relief (FAC at 14:26) on the grounds that punitive damages are unavailable under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.As for the 1st to 4th causes of action, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages outside the civil penalty under the Song-Beverly Act. Civ. Code § 1794(c) provides that the buyer can recover for a civil penalty not exceeding two times the amount of actual damages, if the buyer establishes that the seller's failure to comply with obligations under the Act was willful. “The penalty under section 1794(c), like other civil penalties, is imposed as punishment or deterrence of the defendant, rather than to compensate the plaintiff. In this, it is akin to punitive damages.” (CACI No. 3244; Kwan v. Mercedes Benz of N. Am. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184 (citing Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 226-228 [improper to impose punitive damages as well as §1794 civil penalty].) Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages based on the Song-Beverly Act is not available.However, with regards to punitive damages based on the 5th cause of action (Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment), the Court finds that Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to reasonably find Defendant's malice. Plaintiffs allege that the engine defects present a safety hazard and pose unreasonable risk of accident and injury to customers. (FAC ¶¶ 63-64, 66.) Also, as discussed above, Plaintiffs plead facts to show Defendant's knowledge of the defects and conscious disregard of such risks and safety of others despite its knowledge. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support a prayer for punitive damages as to the 5th Cause of Action.Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Strike’s Plaintiff’s Prayer for Relief re Punitive Damages (FAC at 14:26) is denied.Tentative RulingThe Demurrer to the 5th cause of action is OVERRULED. Defendant's accompanying motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED. As the Fifth Cause of Action (Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment) has been properly alleged, Plaintiffs have pled facts from which it can be reasonably inferred that Defendant acted with fraud under Cal. Civ. Code § 3294.
