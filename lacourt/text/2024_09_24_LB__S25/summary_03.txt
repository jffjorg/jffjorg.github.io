And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant in this case. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, and 5th causes of action are overruled, meaning that the plaintiff's allegations in these causes of action are sufficient to state a claim. The judge has also ruled that the demurrer to the 7th cause of action is sustained with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will have the opportunity to revise its allegations in this cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 8th and 9th causes of action with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will also have the opportunity to revise its allegations in these causes of action.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike various paragraphs of the plaintiff's complaint, with the exception of paragraphs 3:18-21, 17:23-34, 18:7-9, 19:5-8, 20:9-12, and 20:24-25, which were granted in part.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence and premises liability may be sufficient to state a claim, but that the plaintiff may need to revise its allegations in certain causes of action in order to state a claim for elder abuse and financial abuse.
