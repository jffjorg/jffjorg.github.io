 Case Number:  24LBCV00281    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Red Curb Investments, LLC and Does 1 to 100, alleging negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff asserts he was a tenant in an apartment located at 1524 W. 206th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90501. Plaintiff alleges Defendant was the owner for that property and Plaintiff’s landlord. Although the Los Angeles Housing Department issued various violations about the apartment complex to Defendant and Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the leaking water from the ceiling numerous times, Plaintiff claims Defendant failed to repair waterproof the roof and/or fix the ceiling in Plaintiff’s apartment. On or about February 26, 2023, Plaintiff alleges his apartment’s ceiling collapsed and he was injured.Legal StandardDemurrer Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)Motion to Strike Legal StandardA party may move to strike matters from an opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false or improper. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435, 436, subd. (a).) Motion to strike may also target all or any part of pleadings not filed or drawn in conformity with the applicable laws, rules or orders. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) A Motion to Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action. (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) To obtain punitive damages in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) The clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability . . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1211.)Meet and ConferCode Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2), and § 435.5, subd. (a)(2) & (3) meet and confer requirements are satisfied.Demurrer DiscussionDefendant demurs to the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th causes of action on the ground that each cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.1st Cause of Action – Breach of Implied Warranty of HabitabilityTo establish a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, Plaintiff must establish (1) “the existence of a material defective condition affecting the premises' habitability,” (2) “notice to the landlord of the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant's discovery of the condition,” (3) “the landlord was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency, and” (4) “resulting damages.” (Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1297.) Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged: the existence of a materially defective condition affecting the habitability of the premises (FAC ¶¶ 14-16, 21); Defendant was on notice of the defective condition(s) (by the Los Angeles Housing Department and Plaintiff (FAC ¶¶ 18, 20-21) and Defendant was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency (FAC ¶27). The demurrer to the 1st cause of action is OVERRULED.2nd Cause of Action – Breach of Covenant of Quiet Use & EnjoymentThe implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when there is an eviction, actual or constructive, of the tenant. (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 292 [citing Standard Live Stock Co. v. Pentz (1928) 204 Cal. 618, 625.]; see also Kulawitz v. Pacific Woodenware & Paper Co. (1945) 25 Cal.2d 664, 670 [“Any interference by the landlord by which the tenant is deprived of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises amounts to a constructive eviction if the tenant so elects and surrenders possession, and the tenant will not be liable for rentals for the portion of the term following his eviction.”]) Thus, to state a cause of action under breach of the covenant of quiet use and enjoyment, a plaintiff must show that he or she had a lease agreement with the landlord, that he or she was in lawful possession of the land, and that he or she was also either actually or constructively evicted. Plaintiff has alleged a rental//lease agreement with Defendant that Defendant, a landlord, interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the dwelling as a tenant by failing to remedy the untenantable conditions in Plaintiff’s dwelling. (See FAC ¶¶ 9, 11, 17, 18, 43, 45.) The demurrer to the 2nd cause of action is OVERRULED.5th Cause of Action – Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4Civ. Code § 1942.4 prohibits a landlord of a dwelling from demanding rent, collecting rent, issuing a notice of a rent increase, or issuing a three-day notice to pay rent or quit “if all of the following conditions exist prior to the landlord's demand or notice: (1) The dwelling substantially lacks any of the affirmative standard characteristics … is deemed and declared substandard as set forth in Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code because conditions listed in that section exist to an extent that endangers the life, limb, health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or the occupants of the dwelling; (2) a public officer or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the landlord or the landlord's agent in writing of his or her obligations to abate the nuisance or repair the substandard conditions; (3) the conditions … have not been abated 35 days beyond the date of service of the notice specified … and the delay is without good cause; (4) the conditions were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant or lessee in violation of Section 1929 or 1941.2.”Plaintiff sufficient pled that the dwelling is untenantable pursuant to Civ. Code, § 1941.1, subd. (a)(1) and substandard under Health & Saf. Code, § 17920.3; a public officer/employee (e.g. the Los Angeles Housing Department) sent notices to Defendant concerning the failure to maintain the roof covering in weatherproof condition and (2) need to ensure the roof is free from deterioration and defect, among other violations; (3) the conditions were not abated 35 days beyond the date of service of the notice; and (3) the conditions were not cause by an act or omission of Plaintiff. (See FAC ¶ 13-16, 20, 21, 75, 78-79, 80.) The demurrer to the 5th cause of action is OVERRULED.6th Cause of Action – Nuisance“Although the central idea of nuisance is the unreasonable invasion of [a property interest] . . . and not the particular type of conduct subjecting the actor to liability, liability nevertheless depends on some sort of conduct that either directly and unreasonably interferes with it or creates a condition that does so.” (Lussier v. San Lorenzo Valley Water Dist. (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 92, 100.) Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that Defendant, by failing to comply with the Los Angeles Housing Department Notices for Municipal Code violations, e.g. weatherproof roofing, directly and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s dwelling and created a nuisance. Failure to repair the leaking ceiling, ultimately led to its collapse. (FAC ¶¶ 17, 18, 30, 88.) Defendant’s demurrer to the 6th cause of action is OVERRULED.7th Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional DistressThe essential elements for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) outrageous conduct; (2) an intent to cause or a reckless disregard of the possibility of causing emotional distress; (3) severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4) actual and proximate cause of the emotional distress by the outrageous conduct. (Symonds v. Mercury Sav. & Loan Ass’n (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1458,1468.) Outrageous conduct is conduct that “exceed[s] all bounds usually tolerated by decent society, of a nature which is especially calculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress of a very serious kind.” (Ochoa v. Superior Court (1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 166 fn. 5.)Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action for IIED. Defendant’s failure to make timely repairs, after alleged notice, or provide alternative housing for Plaintiff, does not support an allegation that Defendant intentionally caused or recklessly disregarded the possibility of causing emotional distress. Further, Plaintiff merely provides a conclusory allegation that he suffered severe emotional distress. (FAC ¶¶ 95, 97). Without factual allegations supporting the nature or extent of Plaintiff’s mental suffering, this alleged distress does not rise to the level of “emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it.” (Pittman v. City of Oakland (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1047 [mere allegation that plaintiff suffered shame, humiliation and embarrassment without further factual explanation fails to state claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress]; see also Bogard v. Employers’ Casualty Company (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 602, 617-618 [finding that the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer when appellants alleged they suffered severe emotional distress but failed to set forth factual allegations indicating the nature or extent of any mental suffering incurred as a result of Employers’ alleged outrageous conduct.]) The demurrer as to the 7th cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.8th Cause of Action – Elder Abuse – Physical & Emotional HarmWelf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.07, subd. (a)(1) defines elder abuse to include “[p]hysical abuse, neglect, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental suffering.” The elements of elder abuse include: Defendant had responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult, such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care; Defendant knew of conditions thatmade the elder or dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own basic needs; Defendant denied or withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult's basic needs; and the neglect caused the elder or dependent adult to suffer physical harm, pain or mental suffering. (Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 406-407.)Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to constitute a claim of physical and emotional elder abuse. There are no facts alleging that Defendant had the responsibility for meeting the basic needs of Plaintiff or withheld services or goods. Although it is unlikely Plaintiff will be able to amend a subsequent complaint to support this cause of action, the court will SUSTAIN WITH LEAVE TO AMEND Defendant’s demurrer to the 8th cause of action.9th Cause of Action – Elder Abuse – Financial AbuseWelf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a), provides that ‘“financial abuse’ of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any of the following: (1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both; (2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both; (3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.” Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action for Elder Abuse: financial Abuse. Mere allegations that Plaintiff is over 65 years of age and Defendant failed to make repairs and continued collecting rent from Plaintiff despite Housing Department Notices of the dwelling’s untenantable conditions does not rise to the level of financial abuse of an elder under Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30(a). Although it is unlikely Plaintiff will be able to amend a subsequent complaint to support this cause of action, the court will SUSTAIN WITH LEAVE TO AMEND Defendant’s demurrer to the 9th cause of action.Tentative RulingThe demurrer is OVERRULED as to the 1st 2nd, 5th and 6th causes of action and SUSTAINED WITH 15 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to the 7th, 8th and 9th causes of action.Defendant’s Motion to Strike as to page 3:18-21 is DENIED, as to page 17:23-34 is GRANTED (as moot); as to page 18:7-9 is GRANTED (as moot); as to page 19:5-8 GRANTED (as moot); as to page 20:9-12 is GRANTED (as moot); and as to page 20:24-25 GRANTED (as moot).
