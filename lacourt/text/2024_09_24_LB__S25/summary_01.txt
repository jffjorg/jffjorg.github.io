And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by Defendant General Motors, LLC, and the motion to strike filed by the same defendant. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the 5th cause of action (Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment) in the complaint filed by Plaintiffs. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the 5th cause of action has been properly alleged.

The judge has also ruled on the motion to strike, which challenged the Prayer for Relief seeking punitive damages. The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support a prayer for punitive damages as to the 5th Cause of Action.

The judge's ruling is based on the following findings: (1) the relationship between Plaintiffs and Defendant arising from the warranty provided by Defendant specifically to Plaintiffs constitutes a sufficient transactional connection to support a claim for failure to disclose; (2) Plaintiffs have pled facts to show Defendant's knowledge of the defects and conscious disregard of such risks and safety of others despite its knowledge; and (3) the 5th cause of action has been properly alleged.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any further briefing or oral argument.
