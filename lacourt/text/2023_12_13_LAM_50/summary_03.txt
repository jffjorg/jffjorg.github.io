  - "Points raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument."
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute provides that the phrase ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.'"

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Award Metals, Inc. (plaintiff) and Runway (defendant). The plaintiff alleges that the defendant negligently removed or failed to install a point of operation guard on a power press, which was authorized by the defendant under conditions known to create a probability of serious death or injury. The judge notes that this allegation is virtually identical to one in a separate cause of action for violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 4558, and that the demurrer should have been sustained as to this cause of action.

The judge also declines to consider arguments raised by Runway for the first time in its reply brief, as these arguments were not raised earlier in the case and would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter them.

Additionally, the judge notes that the defendant's lobbying and other activities seeking to influence regulatory and legislative bodies fall within the definition of "act in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue" under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.
