Summary in English:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sooyeon Jin (Plaintiff) vs. Keith Bae and James Bae (Defendants). The Plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $313,334.03, comprising damages of $313,334.03. However, the Court notes several defects with the submitted requests for default judgment. The Court denied the Plaintiff's previous requests for default judgment without prejudice and requires further support to prove up the requested damages. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's claims against James Bae are unclear and that the Plaintiff seeks damages against both James Bae and Keith Bae, despite only having a purchase agreement with James Bae. The Court denies the Plaintiff's requests for default judgment without prejudice and orders the Plaintiff to arrange a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment packages.
