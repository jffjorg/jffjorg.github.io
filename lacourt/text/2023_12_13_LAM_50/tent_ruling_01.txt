TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  
 



 
Plaintiff Sooyeon Jin (“Plaintiff”) appears to request entry of
default judgment against Defendants James Bae and Keith Bae in the total amount
of $313,334.03, comprising
$313,334.03 in damages.  
            The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted requests for default judgment.  
First, on October 13, 2023, the Court issued a
minute order denying Plaintiff’s previous requests for default judgment without
prejudice. The Court’s October 13, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[p]ursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Status Conference Review of
Default Judgment scheduled for 10/13/2023 is continued to 12/13/23 at 10:00 AM
in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.”
On October 24, 2023,
Plaintiff filed two proposed judgments and a supplemental declaration. However,
Plaintiff did not file any revised requests for default judgment. The Court
notes that “[a] party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form
CIV-100)…” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) To the extent Plaintiff is relying on her previous
requests for default judgment filed on August 31, 2023, such requests indicate
that Plaintiff seeks damages in the total amount of $340,000.00
against both James Bae and Keith Bae. However, the latest proposed judgments
submitted on October 24, 2023 indicate that Plaintiff seeks $313,334.03 in
damages against James Bae and Keith Bae. 
Second, Plaintiff states in her supplemental declaration that
“[o]n or around May 21, 2020, JAMES BAE, seller, and I, buyer, entered into a
purchase agreement of the business, Birdies Norco, located in 1845 Hamner Ave.,
Suite A, Norco, CA 92860…for $270,000.00.” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 1.) However, it is unclear why Plaintiff is
purportedly entitled to $270,000.00 under her claims alleged against
James Bae and Keith Bae in this action. In addition, Plaintiff seeks damages
pertaining specifically to Keith Bae. (See, e.g., Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶
10.) It is unclear why Plaintiff also seeks these damages against James Bae. The Court finds that further support is
necessary to prove up the requested $313,334.03 in damages.
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s requests for default
judgment without prejudice.  Plaintiff to arrange a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment packages.
