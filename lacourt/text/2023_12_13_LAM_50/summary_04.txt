And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors, LLC in a case involving a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV purchased by Garrett Matsunaga. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action of the complaint, which alleged fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair business practices. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint and the law. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint do not state a claim for relief for the first, second, and third causes of action, and that the demand for punitive damages is not supported by the allegations in the complaint.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the order, and has ordered the defendant to file and serve its answer within 30 days of the order.
