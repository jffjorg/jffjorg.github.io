And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment and has granted the alternative motion for summary adjudication as to the ninth and eleventh causes of action.

The judge has also found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the plaintiff was terminated due to his disability or other reasons, whether the defendants failed to accommodate the plaintiff's disability, and whether the defendants retaliated against the plaintiff for exercising his rights under FEHA and CFRA.

The judge has also found that the plaintiff has a valid claim under Labor Code section 1102.5 and that there is a triable issue as to punitive damages.

The judge has ordered the parties to appear on the scheduled hearing date to discuss the tentative ruling and to file any additional written arguments or evidence.
