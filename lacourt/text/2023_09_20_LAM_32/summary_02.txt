And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment and has granted the alternative motion for summary adjudication as to the ninth and eleventh causes of action.

The judge has also found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the plaintiff was terminated due to his disability or other reasons, whether the defendants failed to accommodate the plaintiff's disability, and whether the defendants retaliated against the plaintiff for exercising his rights under FEHA and CFRA.

The judge has also found that the plaintiff has a valid claim under Labor Code section 1102.5 and that there is a triable issue as to punitive damages.

The judge has ordered the parties to appear on the scheduled hearing date to discuss the tentative ruling and to file any additional written arguments or evidence.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22STCV19939
* Hearing Date: September 20, 2023
* Dept: 32

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Joel Solis
* Defendants: Aurora Charter Oak-Los Angeles, LLC, et al.

**Disputed Issues**

* Disability discrimination
* FEHA retaliation
* Failure to engage/accommodate
* CFRA interference
* Wrongful termination
* Defamation
* Labor Code sections 226 and 1102.5
* Labor Code section 98.6
* Punitive damages

**Summary of Ruling**

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and grants their alternative motion for summary adjudication as to the ninth and eleventh causes of action. The judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination, FEHA retaliation, failure to engage/accommodate, CFRA interference, wrongful termination, defamation, and Labor Code sections 226 and 1102.5. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claim under Labor Code section 98.6 is valid. Finally, the judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages, finding that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation personally engaged in oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Significant Statements**

* "The Code of Regulations that Defendants rely on also dictates that the mildness of a condition is 'determined on a case-by-case basis.'"
* "Courts 'liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.'"
* "Whether an employee actually sought medical treatment is not dispositive in determining whether the employee had a serious medical condition."
* "The record here, at the very least, creates a triable issue of fact as to whether [Plaintiff's] statements concerning time off for [COVID] were sufficient to trigger [Defendants'] obligation to inquire further into the details of [Plaintiff's] request."
* "Once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an activity proscribed by Section 1102.5 was a contributing factor in the alleged prohibited action against the employee, the employer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the employee had not engaged in activities protected by Section 1102.5."
