And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not presented a right-to-sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) demonstrating exhaustion of administrative remedies. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had adequately alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies in the First Amended Complaint and that the defendants did not set forth a legal basis for a motion to dismiss. The judge also noted that even if the court were to consider the evidence filed with the defendants' motion, it would show that the plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter and therefore exhausted his administrative remedies.

## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling deals with a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by Varouj Shekerdemian against Desai Holdings USA, LLC and Rakesh David Desai. 

Shekerdemian alleges discrimination, harassment, and other wrongful actions by Desai, including misclassifying him as an independent contractor and creating a hostile work environment. 

The defendants argued that Shekerdemian should have first filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) before suing them in court. However, the judge found that Shekerdemian adequately stated that he had exhausted his administrative remedies by obtaining a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH.

The judge denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, meaning the case will proceed to further legal proceedings.

The Judge's tentative ruling summarized in English text:

In the case 21STCV36602, the Judge reviews Desai Holdings USA, LLC and Rakesh David Desai's (Defendants) motion to dismiss the case filed on August 25, 2023. The Judge considers the motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion is based on plaintiff Varouj Shekerdemian's failure to present a right-to-sue letter from DFEH demonstrating exhaustion of administrative remedies. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 6, 2023.

The Judge denies the motion due to the following reasons:

1. Defendants do not provide a legal basis for a "motion to dismiss."
2. Plaintiff has adequately alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies.
3. Defendants do not cite any authority requiring plaintiff to do more at the pleading stage.
4. The notice attached as Defendants' Exhibit A shows that plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter and exhausted his administrative remedies.

The Judge's ruling concludes that Plaintiff Varouj Shekerdemian has demonstrated exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the motion to dismiss is denied.
