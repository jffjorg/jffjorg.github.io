And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not presented a right-to-sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) demonstrating exhaustion of administrative remedies. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had adequately alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies in the First Amended Complaint and that the defendants did not set forth a legal basis for a motion to dismiss. The judge also noted that even if the court were to consider the evidence filed with the defendants' motion, it would show that the plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter and therefore exhausted his administrative remedies.
