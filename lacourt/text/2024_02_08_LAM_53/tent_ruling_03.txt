  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to quash service of
  summons and complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Specially appearing defendant
David Miscavige       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Jane Doe
Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court denies specially appearing defendant David Miscavige’s
request for judicial notice, filed on February 1, 2024, because (1) new
evidence is not permitted with reply papers, and (2) the documents to be
judicially noticed are not relevant to a material issue presented by this
motion.  (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537; Malek Media Group LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020)
58 Cal.App.5th 817, 825.)
DISCUSSION
Specially appearing defendant David Miscavige (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order quashing service of the summons and complaint by plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”).
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: [¶] (1) To
quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  “[A]
motion to quash under section 418.10, subdivision (a)(1) is a limited
procedural tool to contest personal jurisdiction over the defendant where the
statutory requirements for service of process are not fulfilled.”  (Stancil v. Superior Court (2021) 11
Cal.5th 381, 390.) 
Defendant contends that he was not properly served with the summons
and complaint as set forth in the proofs of service filed by Plaintiff on
October 19, 2023.[1]  Plaintiff’s October 19, 2023 filing entitled
“Proof of Service Upon Defendant David Miscavige” attaches two proofs of
service as to Defendant.  
The first proof of service states that Defendant was served, by
substituted service, with the summons and complaint in this action on September
22, 2023 by leaving the documents with “‘John Doe’ – Security guard, person in
charge” at Scientology Media Productions, located at 4401 Sunset Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California 90027.  (Oct. 19,
2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 1, POS-010, ¶¶ 2-4, 5, subd. (b).)  The summons and complaint were thereafter
mailed to Defendant at the place where the copies were left.  (Id., ¶ 5, subd. (b)(4).)  Supporting this proof of service is a
“Declaration of Diligence[,]” which states that the process server attempted
personal service on Defendant on September 13, 2023, September 15, 2023, and
September 22, 2023 at different locations. 
(Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 2 [Declaration of Diligence].) 
The second proof of service states that Defendant was served, by
substituted service, with the summons and complaint in this action on September
22, 2023, by leaving the documents with “Chuck ‘Doe’ – Security guard, person
in charge” at the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International, located
at 5930 Franklin Avenue, Hollywood, California 90028.  (Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 3,
POS-010, ¶¶ 2-4, 5, subd. (b).)  The
summons and complaint were thereafter mailed to Defendant at the place where the
copies were left.  (Id., ¶ 5,
subd. (b)(4).)  Supporting this proof of
service is the “Declaration of Diligence” describing the process server’s
attempts to personally serve Defendant on September 13, 2023, September 15,
2023, and September 22, 2023 at various locations.  (Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 4
[Declaration of Diligence].) 
Both proofs of service were completed by a registered process server
and therefore establish a presumption of the facts stated therein.  (Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 1, POS-010,
¶ 7; Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 3, POS-010, ¶ 7; Fernandes
v. Singh (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 932, 940 [“The return of a registered
process server ‘establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return’”] [emphasis in original];
Evid. Code, § 647.)
The court finds that Defendant has met his burden to rebut the
statutory presumption of the facts stated in the returns by submitting evidence
showing that he was not served by substituted service in compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure section 415.20.  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390 [“Because of
the statutory presumption, defendant was thus required to produce evidence that
he was not served”].)
“If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable
diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served . . ., a summons
may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s
dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other
than a United States post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be
informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd.
(b).) 
As noted by Defendant, the two proofs of service state that
substituted service was made at Defendant’s usual place of business.  (Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 1,
POS-010, ¶ 5, subd. (b)(1); Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Ex. 3,
POS-010, ¶ 5, subd. (b)(1).)  Defendant
has presented evidence establishing that neither 4401 Sunset Boulevard nor 5930
Franklin Avenue (i.e., the locations at which service was made) is his
dwelling, abode, or usual place of business. 
(McShane Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Reynolds Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.)
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has met his burden to show that
substituted service at 4401 Sunset Boulevard and 5930 Franklin Avenue was
improper.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20,
subd. (b) [substituted service may be made by leaving a copy of the summons and
complaint at the person’s “usual place of business”].) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met her burden of proving the
facts requisite to effective service.  (American
Express Centurion Bank, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 387 [“When a
defendant argues that service of summons did not bring him or her within the
trial court’s jurisdiction, the plaintiff has ‘the burden of proving the facts
that did give the court requisite jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to
an effective service’”].)
Plaintiff has submitted the declaration of her counsel, Carmen Scott,
in which Scott attests to Plaintiff’s attempts to locate and serve Defendant.[2]  Scott asserts that 4401 Sunset Boulevard is
“the location of Scientology Media Productions . . . and upon information and
belief [Defendant] maintains an office at this location.”  (Scott Decl., ¶ 38.)  Similarly, Scott asserts that 5930 Franklin
Avenue “is the site of the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre
International, at which Religious Technology Center [citation], of which
[Defendant] is the head, also maintains an office.”  (Scott Decl., ¶ 39 [internal citation
omitted].)  However, Plaintiff did not
cite any other evidence establishing that Defendant maintains his usual place
of business at 4401 Sunset Boulevard and 5930 Franklin Avenue. 
The court finds that the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is
insufficient to show that Defendant’s “usual place of business” is located at
either 4401 Sunset Boulevard or 5930 Franklin Avenue.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd.
(b).)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not met her burden to prove the facts requisite to effective
substitute service on Defendant by leaving the summons and complaint with the
security guards (1) at Scientology Media Productions, 4401 Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California 90027, or (2) at Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre
International, 5930 Franklin Avenue, Hollywood, California 90028.  (Oct. 19, 2023 Proof of Service, Exs. 1, 3.) 
The court therefore grants Defendant’s motion to quash.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
ORDER

The court grants specially appearing defendant David Miscavige’s
motion to quash service of summons and complaint. 
The court orders that the service on specially appearing defendant
David Miscavige of the summons and complaint, as described in the proofs of
service of summons attached as Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 3 to plaintiff Jane Doe’s
October 19, 2023 filing entitled “Proof of Service Upon Defendant David
Miscavige,” is quashed.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court orders specially appearing defendant David Miscavige to give
notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
