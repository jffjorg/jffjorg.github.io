And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against the defendant, Wendy Bruget. The plaintiff seeks to strike the defendant's answer to the First Amended Complaint and award monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,321. The court grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, but denies the request for terminating sanctions. The court finds that the defendant failed to serve responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests within the time ordered by the court, and therefore grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,412.50. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
