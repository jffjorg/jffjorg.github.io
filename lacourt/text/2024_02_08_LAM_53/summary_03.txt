And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by David Miscavige, a specially appearing defendant in the case. The judge has denied the plaintiff's attempt to serve the defendant by leaving the summons and complaint with security guards at two locations. The judge has found that the locations where the service was made are not the defendant's dwelling, abode, or usual place of business, and therefore the service is invalid. The judge has granted the motion to quash and orders that the service on the defendant is quashed. The defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
