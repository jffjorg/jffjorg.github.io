And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC. The first motion is to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set three, numbers 64-67. The court denies the motion in part, finding that one of the demands is overbroad and protected by attorney work product protection and the right to privacy of nonparties. However, the court grants the motion as to the other three demands, ordering the plaintiff, Mansoureh Aghayan, to serve further written responses and produce documents responsive to those requests.

The second motion is to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set two, numbers 117 and 120. The court grants the motion, finding that the objections to these interrogatories are without merit. The court also awards monetary sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,375, finding that the plaintiff's evasive and incomplete answers and lack of cooperation warrant such an award.

The court orders the plaintiff to serve further, full, and complete answers to the special interrogatories and to pay the monetary sanctions within 20 and 30 days, respectively. The court also orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
