Nos. 64-67
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, Nos. 117 and

The court
considered the moving and qualified opposition papers filed in connection with each
motion.  No reply papers were filed in
connection with either motion. 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET THREE, NOS. 64-67
Defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC (“Defendant”) moves
the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan (“Plaintiff”)
to provide further verified responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Three, numbers 64-67, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,135.
The court notes that Plaintiff filed, on January 8, 2024, a “Qualified
Opposition to Motions to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents (All Sets),” in which Plaintiff states that verified responses to
Requests for Production “nos. 1 and 2” were served on January 8, 2024.  (Opp., p. 1:20-22.)  However, those demands are not the subject of
this motion, which, as set forth above, concerns Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Three, numbers 64-67. 
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 64 because that demand
is overbroad since it calls for the production of information that is protected
by the attorney work product protection and the right to privacy of nonparties
and therefore the objections in that demand are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(3).)  
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 65-67 because the
objections in those demands are without merit. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling on this motion,
the court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition of
sanctions unjust and therefore denies Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO, NOS. 117 AND 120
Defendant moves the court for an order (1) compelling Plaintiff to
serve further answers to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two, numbers
117 and 120, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and
against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,420.
The court notes that Plaintiff filed, on January 8, 2024, a “Qualified
Opposition to Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
Set One and Set Three.”  However, that
qualified opposition does not concern the special interrogatories that are at
issue in this motion (i.e., interrogatories from set two). 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Special Interrogatories, number 117 because the objections to that
interrogatory are without merit.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Special Interrogatories, number 120 because (1) the answer to that
interrogatory is evasive and incomplete, and (2) the objections to that
interrogatory are without merit.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3).) 
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd
(d).)  The court finds that $1,375 (5 hours
x $275 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against
Plaintiff in connection with this motion. 
(Hassell Decl., ¶ 16.)

20 days of the date of this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Mansoureh
Aghayan to pay monetary sanctions to defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation
Centre LLC on that motion in the amount of $1,375 within 30 days of the date of
this order.
