[1] Defendant
filed a separate motion to quash service of summons on August 29, 2023, which
challenges the proof of service filed by Plaintiff on July 26, 2023.  (Aug. 29, 2023 Motion to Quash Service of
Summons, p. 7:8-18.)  That motion is set
for hearing on February 15, 2024. 


[2]
The court notes that Plaintiff has presented evidence and argument relating to
Defendant’s residence at 6331 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California
90028 and 1710 Ivar Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90028.  (See, e.g., Scott Decl., ¶¶ 6, 10.)  However, this motion concerns service on
Defendant at the addresses 4401 Sunset Boulevard and 5930 Franklin Avenue.  The court makes no findings as to whether
Plaintiff has shown that Defendant resides at those addresses or that service
at those addresses was proper.
