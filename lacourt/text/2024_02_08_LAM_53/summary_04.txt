The court notes that the plaintiff has presented evidence and argument related to the defendant's residence, but this motion only concerns service on the defendant at specific addresses (4401 Sunset Boulevard and 5930 Franklin Avenue). The court has not made any findings as to whether the plaintiff has shown that the defendant resides at these addresses or that service was proper.
