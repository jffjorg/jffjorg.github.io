  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions
  and monetary sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam
& Associates, Inc.      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Wendy Bruget
Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
moves the court for an order (1) imposing terminating sanctions against
defendant Wendy Bruget (“Defendant”) by striking her answer to the First
Amended Complaint, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $4,321.
If
a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides, in relevant
part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”¿¿¿¿  
On October 25, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel
Defendant’s initial responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, and ordered Defendant (1) to serve full and complete
verified responses, without objections, to the discovery, and to produce to
Plaintiff all responsive documents in Defendant’s possession, custody, or
control within 20 days of the date of service of the order, and (2) to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,540 within 30 days of the
date of service of the order.  (Oct. 25,
2023 Order, p. 2:14-26.)  Plaintiff filed
a “Notice of Ruling” on October 25, 2023, notifying the parties (including
Defendant) of the court’s order granting its motion to compel.  (Pl. Notice of Ruling, Oct. 25, 2023, Proof
of Service.) 
In support of its motion, Plaintiff produced evidence showing that
Defendant did not serve responses and produce responsive documents within 20
days of the date of service of the court’s order.  (Ezra Decl., p. 13:16-17 [as of December 8,
2023, counsel for Plaintiff “ha[d] received no further follow up from
[Defendant’s counsel] as to when the documents would be produced or the
sanctions paid”].)  In opposition,
Defendant asserts that she served Plaintiff with her responses on January 23,
2024.  (Day Decl., ¶ 2.)  The court notes that, while Defendant has not
submitted evidence of those responses with her opposition papers, Plaintiff’s
reply papers do not dispute that responses have been served.  (Reply, p. 2:6-8 [acknowledging that
Defendant served documents on January 23, 2024].) 
First, the court finds, after considering the totality of the
circumstances and the representations by the parties that Defendant has since
served responses and produced responsive documents, that terminating sanctions
against Defendant are not warranted.  (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 290.)  To the extent that Plaintiff believes that
the responses served by Defendant are incomplete or deficient, Plaintiff may
seek other appropriate relief to obtain further responses.  
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s request that the court impose
terminating sanctions against Defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) 
Second, the court finds that Defendant violated the court’s October
25, 2023 order by failing to serve responses within the time ordered by the
court.  (Opp., p. 2:6-7 [“Admittedly, the
responses were served after the twenty-day period described in the Court’s
ruling of October 25, 2023”].)  
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2023.030, subd. (a), 2023.010, subd. (g) [misuse of the discovery
process includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery].)  The court finds that $3,412.50 ((4.5 hours x
$745 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Ezra Decl., ¶ 8.) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions
and monetary sanctions as follows. 
            The court denies plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions. 
            The court grants plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s motion for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders defendant Wendy
Bruget to pay sanctions to plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.
in the amount of $3,412.50 within 30 days of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 8, 2024
