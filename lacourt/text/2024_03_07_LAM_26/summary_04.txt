And here is the summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court denies the petition filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner) seeking approval for the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from David Olguin (Payee) to Petitioner. The Payee filed a declaration stating his intent to cancel the transaction, and subsequently sent a letter to Petitioner stating his cancellation of the transaction. The court granted Petitioner's ex parte application to advance the hearing, but continued the hearing to March 7, 2024 after Petitioner's counsel advised that he had not received the declaration. The court finds that Petitioner received written notice of cancellation before the hearing, and therefore the petition must be denied. The court dismisses the action and orders the court clerk to give notice to Petitioner, who is also required to give notice to Payee and file proof of service of such.
