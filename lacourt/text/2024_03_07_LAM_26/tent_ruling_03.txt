 Case Number:  22STCV34229    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  26 On December 6, 2023, Defendants Justin
White (“White”), Applied Approach Services, Inc. (“Applied”), Deena Manion
(“Manion”), and David Bifulco (“Bifulco”), whom the Court will refer to as “Moving
Defendants” filed the instant motion for an order appointing a discovery
referee.  On February 23, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  On
February 29, 2024, Moving Defendants filed a reply.
In his opposition papers, Plaintiff Ament
claims poverty and an inability to contribute toward the fees and expenses of a
discovery referee.  In their reply papers,
Moving Defendants have submitted extensive evidence to refute Plaintiff’s claim
of poverty.  
In general, it is improper to consider
reply evidence.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102
Cal.App.4th 308, 316.)  Evidence filed
for the first time in a reply may violate the opposing party’s due process
rights if considered by the Court.  (Ibid.) 
Thus, evidence and exhibits presented in support of a reply are not
generally allowed. (See Nazir v. United
Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 249.)  
Here, Plaintiff Ament has not had an
opportunity to address the evidence that Moving Defendants have submitted with their
reply.  The Court will provide Plaintiff with
an opportunity to respond to Moving Defendants’ reply evidence so that the
Court may properly consider all evidence submitted by the parties, including
evidence submitted with the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental
opposition papers.
In response to Moving
Defendants’ reply evidence, Plaintiff may file and serve no later than March 21,
2024: (1) supplemental evidence (with no page limitation) and (2) a supplemental
opposition brief (not to exceed 5 pages). 
If Plaintiff would like, Plaintiff may also address in the supplemental
opposition any factors that would affect the Court’s selection of the different
referees proposed by the parties.
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants Justin White, Applied Approach Services, Inc., Deena
Manion, and David Bifulco’s motion for a discovery referee is CONTINUED to April
12,  2024 at 8:30 am.
Moving Defendants are to provide notice of
this order and file proof of service of such.
