And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's complaint and the defendant's demurrer. The defendant argues that the complaint is uncertain as it lumps all defendants together, making it unclear what U-Haul specifically did. However, the court finds that the demurrer is moot because the plaintiff has already dismissed U-Haul Arizona. The court concludes that the demurrer is without merit and will not be sustained.
