U-HAUL CO. OF ARIZONA’S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER
TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT is MOOT because Defendant has been dismissed
from the action. 
 
Background
 
This is a negligence case arising from a motor vehicle
accident.
 
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants
U-Haul Co. of Southern Arizona and U-Haul Co. of California (collectively
“U-Haul Defendants”); Eddie Chongham; Glenn Ray Johnson and Ernestina Johnson (collectively,
“Johnson Defendants”) for (1) motor vehicle and (2) negligence. 
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed U-Haul Defendants. 
 
On April 25, 2024, Johnson Defendants filed their answer. That same day, U-Haul of Arizona
filed the instant demurrer. 
 
On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Chongham.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant demurs on the grounds that the complaint is
uncertain as it lumps all Defendants making it unclear as to what U-Haul
specifically did. Though the court would sustain the demurrer on said grounds,
the demurrer is MOOT because Plaintiff has dismissed U-Haul Arizona. 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as moving Defendant is no longer a
named party in the action, the demurrer is MOOT.
