Standard
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
is either discretionary or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be
made no more than six months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must
contain a “straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need
not contain an explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence surprise or neglect. (Martin
Potts & Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.) Relief must be granted
“unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . ..” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
Analysis
 

Defendant Ross Helford moves to set
aside the default judgment “requested” by Plaintiff on November 6, 2023, which
resulted from Defendant’s inadvertence, surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect.
By this, the Court can only conclude that Defendant means default which
was entered on November 6, 2023. No default judgment existed when this motion
was made on June 24, 2024. Further, Defendant made this motion more than six
months after entry of default and after actual notice of this action. Defendant
had notice since at least November 9, 2023, when he filed a substitution of
attorney. Defendant does not explain why he did not file a motion for relief from
default within six months of actual notice of this action. Additionally, the
motion is substantively defective because Defendant does not provide any
evidence in support of his arguments. Defendant only supplies an unsigned
declaration attesting to his mistake, which is of no evidentiary value.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
