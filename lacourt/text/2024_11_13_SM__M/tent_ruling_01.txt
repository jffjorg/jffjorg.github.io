Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   11/13/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Shawmut Woodworking & Supply Inc. demurs to the first cause
of action for fraud and second cause of action for negligence misrepresentation
in Plaintiff Gavin Polone’s Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”).
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) Negligent misrepresentation
requires the defendant to make false statements believing them to be true, but
without reasonable ground for such belief. (Bily v. Arthur Young & Co.
(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407.) “An action for promissory fraud may lie where a
defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff to enter into a contract.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.)  In California, fraud, including negligent
misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies,
Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands that a
plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) “[I]n the case of a corporate defendant, the
plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.” (West v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
Following the prior demurrer, the Court granted
leave for Plaintiff to allege additional facts concerning the
misrepresentation, including Schram’s authority to speak on behalf of Shawmut
at the time of the representations. As set forth below, the TAC alleges
sufficient facts concerning Schram’s authority and representations. 
 
The TAC establishes Schram’s authority to speak on
behalf of Shawmut. Schram was acting as an employee of Shawmut and made the
subject misrepresentations pursuant to that employment. (TAC ¶¶ 10, 17, 21.) Further,
Schram had authority to speak on behalf of Shawmut as a “Project Executive” for
Shawmut. (¶ 17.) Schram became a Project Executive for Shawmut by no later than
January 11, 2018, though the TAC alleges that his agency begun before that date.
(TAC ¶ 17.) 
 
The TAC also demonstrates that Schram made specific
misrepresentations which induced Plaintiff into signing the subject
construction contract with Shawmut. In December 2017, Schram informed Plaintiff
that he “was selling his construction company to a larger commercial
contracting firm based in Boston called Shawmut… that he was staying on after
the sale and would still directly supervise the Project… Polone would need to
sign a contract with Shawmut rather than Winters-Schram… using Shawmut would be
good for Polone because Polone would get a much larger company (Shawmut) with
all of its resources behind the Project and Mr. Schram would still be running
it.” (TAC ¶¶ 15-16.) The TAC adds that that in Spring 2018, Plaintiff had
numerous calls and in-person meetings with Schram where he repeated these
representations. (¶ 15.) Such communications occurred after January 11, 2018,
but before signing the agreement in May 2018. 
(TAC ¶¶17-19.)
Plaintiff
recalls that the foregoing information was conveyed orally but does not recall
whether it was a phone call or in-person. (Id.) Thus, the TAC establishes when
the misrepresentations were made, and that they were made orally, via telephone
or in person with Schram. Further details on the representation may be explored
through discovery.
 
These allegations establish Schram was Shawmut’s agent
in December 2017 when he made the initial misrepresentations, considering their
pending deal and that Schram was moving his business to Shawmut
at this time. This is true even if he had not become a “project executive” until
January 2018. Even ignoring this, the newly added facts show that Schram made
the same misrepresentations in Spring 2018, when Schram indisputably had
authority to speak for Shawmut. These additional allegations are not “sham” allegations
that are contradicted by the prior pleadings and must be accepted as true for
the purpose of this demurrer.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
