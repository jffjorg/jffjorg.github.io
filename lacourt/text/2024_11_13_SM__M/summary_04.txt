And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Paul Montgomery Shore. The plaintiff, Sean Kehoe and Kirra Lyn Pott, has alleged six causes of action against the defendant, including battery, assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, premises liability, and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action for battery and assault, finding that the allegations are not contradictory or ambiguous. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the alleged conduct is not mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, finding that the allegations show conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff.

The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
