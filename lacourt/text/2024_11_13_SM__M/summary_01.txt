And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Shawmut Woodworking & Supply Inc., to the third amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Gavin Polone. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The judge has reviewed the pleadings and has concluded that the complaint does adequately state a cause of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The judge has found that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to show that the defendant's agent, Schram, made misrepresentations to the plaintiff about his company and its intentions, and that the plaintiff relied on those misrepresentations to his detriment. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show that Schram had authority to speak on behalf of the defendant and that the misrepresentations were made with the intent to induce reliance. The judge has therefore overruled the demurrer and has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
