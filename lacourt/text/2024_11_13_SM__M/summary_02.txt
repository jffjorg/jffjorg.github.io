And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to set aside a default judgment in a case brought by LA Housing Outreach LLC against Medoff, et al. The defendant, Ross Helford, seeks to set aside the default judgment, which was entered on November 6, 2023, due to his own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge notes that the defendant did not file his motion until June 24, 2024, more than six months after the default judgment was entered, and that he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. The judge also notes that the defendant had actual notice of the action as early as November 9, 2023, when he filed a substitution of attorney. As a result, the judge denies the motion, citing the lack of evidence and failure to meet the statutory deadline for filing the motion.
