And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to the interrogatories. The defendant served the interrogatories on the plaintiff on August 2, 2024, and despite sending a follow-up letter on September 12, 2024, the plaintiff failed to respond. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond warrants the grant of the motion to compel, and orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses within 10 days without objection.
