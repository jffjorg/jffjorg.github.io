And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel the production of documents. The defendant failed to submit a separate statement as required and did not show good cause justifying the production of the requested documents. The court also finds that the plaintiff testified that he had possession of responsive documents but did not produce them. As a result, the court denies the motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
