MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Alexandra R.

Salas on April 10, 2024)                     
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
(1)  
Motion
for Relief from Waiver (Form Interrogatories)
(2)  
Motion
for Relief from Waiver (Special Interrogatories)
(3)  
Motion
for Relief from Waiver (Document Demands) 
The court considered the moving, limited joinder, and opposition
papers filed in connection with each motion.  
The court (1) sustains plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s objection to the April
16, 2024 reply memorandum, and therefore (2) did not consider the reply papers
filed by defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC on April 16, 2024, because the
reply was not filed at least five court days before the hearing on these
motions.[1]
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER (FORM
INTERROGATORIES)
Defendant Alexandra R.
McIntosh, APC (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order granting her relief
from her waiver of objections regarding the Form Interrogatories, Set One,
served on her by plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”).
“The court, on motion, may
relieve [a] party from th[e] waiver [of objections upon failing to serve a
timely response to interrogatories] on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2020.230, and 2030.240[,] [and] [¶] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
First, the court finds that
Defendant’s motion and request to be relieved from her waiver of objections are
not moot and therefore rules on the merits of Defendant’s motion.
Second, the court finds that
Defendant has shown that she has since served verified responses to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories that are in substantial compliance with sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2020.230, and 2030.240.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1); Def. Ex. R [Def. Responses to Pl. Form
Interrogatories].) 
Third, the court finds that
Defendant has shown that her failure to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories was the result of her mistake and excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a)(2).)  
Defendant has submitted her
declaration, in which she states that (1) Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on September 24, 2020; (2) four days later, on September 28, 2020,
Defendant filed and served her special motion to strike Plaintiff’s operative
complaint; (3) on October 12, 2020, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff that
included a statement that she was objecting to the discovery; (4) the court
granted Defendant’s special motion to strike in its entirety on June 2, 2021;
(5) the Court of Appeal issued its remittitur on August 12, 2022, affirming the
court’s order as to five causes of action and reversing the order as to two
causes of action; and (6) after the remittitur was issued, Defendant did not
keep track of the deadline by which to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery because
she thought the requests were moot.  (McIntosh
Decl., ¶¶ 6-9, 12-14; Def. Ex. I.)  The
court finds that Defendant’s declaration is sufficient to show that she failed
to serve timely responses to the Form Interrogatories based on (1) her mistaken
belief that the discovery was moot, and (2) her mistake and excusable neglect
in failing to calendar her deadline to respond to this discovery given that this
action was stayed pending the resolution of her special motion to strike and
the appeal of the court’s order granting her motion.  (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 14.) 
The court therefore grants
Defendant’s motion for relief from her waiver of objections to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)
Fourth, the court denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions made in his consolidated opposition
papers.
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER (SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES)
Defendant moves the court for
an order granting her relief from her waiver of objections regarding the
Special Interrogatories, Set One, served on her by Plaintiff.
“The court, on motion, may
relieve [a] party from th[e] waiver [of objections upon failing to serve a
timely response to interrogatories] on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2020.230, and 2030.240[,] [and] [¶] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
First, the court finds that
Defendant’s motion and request to be relieved from her waiver of objections are
not moot and therefore rules on the merits of Defendant’s motion.  
Second, the court finds that
Defendant has shown that she has since served verified responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories that are in substantial compliance with sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2020.230, and 2030.240. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1); Def. Ex. S [Def.
Responses to Pl. Special Interrogatories].)
Third, the court finds that
Defendant has shown that her failure to serve timely responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories was the result of her mistake and excusable neglect
based on (1) her mistaken belief that she thought the discovery was moot upon
the granting of her special motion to strike, and (2) her mistake and neglect
in failing to keep track of the deadline by which she was required to respond
to this discovery.  (McIntosh Decl., ¶
14.) 
The court therefore grants
Defendant’s motion for relief from her waiver of objections to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
Fourth, the court denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions made in his consolidated opposition
papers.
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER (DOCUMENT
DEMANDS)
Defendant moves the court for an order granting her relief from her
waiver of objections regarding the Inspection Demand for Documents served by
Plaintiff. 
“The court, on motion, may relieve [a] party from th[e] waiver [of
objections for failure to serve a timely response to a demand for inspection]
on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: [¶]
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and
2031.280[,] [and] [¶] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
First, the court finds that
Defendant’s motion and request to be relieved from her waiver of objections are
not moot and therefore rules on the merits of Defendant’s motion.
Second, the court finds that Defendant has shown that she has since
served verified responses to the document demands that are in substantial
compliance with sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and
2031.280.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a)(1); Def. Ex. T [Def. Responses to Pl. Demand for
Documents].) 
Third, the court finds that Defendant has shown that her failure to
serve timely responses was the result of mistake and excusable neglect based on
(1) her mistaken belief that the discovery was moot upon the granting of her
special motion to strike, and (2) her mistake and neglect in failing to
properly calendar the deadline by which she was required to respond to this
discovery.  (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 14.) 
The court therefore grants Defendant’s motion for relief from her
waiver of objections to Plaintiff’s Inspection Demand for Documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Fourth, the court denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions made in his consolidated opposition
papers.
