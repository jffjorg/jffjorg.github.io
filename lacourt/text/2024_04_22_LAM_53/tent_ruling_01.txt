  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Sommer Ray Beaty
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Anthony Aiello
Motion to Compel
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion.
The court did not consider the opposition papers filed and served by
plaintiff Anthony Aiello on April 10, 2024, because the opposition was not (1)
filed with the court at least nine court days before the hearing on this motion
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)), and (2) served on defendant Sommer Ray
Beaty at least nine court days plus two court days for electronic service
before the hearing on this motion (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b), 1010.6,
subd. (a)(3)(B)).
DISCUSSION
Defendant Sommer Ray Beaty
(“Defendant”) moves the court for an order compelling plaintiff Anthony Aiello
(“Plaintiff”) to produce documents responsive to her Requests for Production in
Defendant’s Amended Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiff, which was served
on Plaintiff on March 25, 2021.  (Selik
Decl., Ex. A-1.) 
First, the court finds that
Defendant did not submit a separate statement as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(5)
[“The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: [¶¶] (5) To
compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things at a
deposition”].)  Here, although Defendant
states in her motion that Plaintiff testified that several categories
responsive to the document demands were in his possession and would be
forthcoming, Defendant did not identify the categories of documents which
Plaintiff testified that he had possession of and instead referred the court to
separate documents in support of that assertion.  (Mot., pp. 4:8-11, 7:8-14.)  However, Defendant was required to file a
separate statement that  (1) sets forth
this information and (2) is “full and complete so that no person is required to
review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full
response.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1345, subd. (c).)   
Second, the court finds that
Defendant has not met her burden to “set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the production” of the documents requested by failing to identify
the document demands as to which Plaintiff testified that he had possession of,
but did not produce, responsive documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)  
Thus, because Defendant (1)
did not comply with the separate statement requirement, and (2) did not show
good cause justifying production, the court denies Defendant’s motion.  (Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166
Cal.App.4th 871, 893 [court has discretion to deny motion that does not comply
with separate statement requirement]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Sommer Ray Beaty’s
motion to compel.           
The court orders plaintiff
Anthony Aiello to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  April 22, 2024
