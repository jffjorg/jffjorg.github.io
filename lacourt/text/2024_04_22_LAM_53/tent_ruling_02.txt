RESPONDING PARTIES:    Cross-complainants Cristina Marie Dam and

(1)  
Demurrer
to Cross-Complaint
(2)  
Motion
to Strike Portions of Cross-Complaint 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with the
demurrer and motion to strike. 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Tina Vo (“Vo”) and
Cathy Kay (“Kay”) filed the operative Second Amended Complaint in this action
on February 5, 2024, alleging 10 causes of action against defendants Cristina
Marie Dam (“Dam”), Liberate Hollywood, Inc. (“Liberate”), and Liberation Inc. 
On July 17, 2023, Dam and
Liberate (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”) filed a Cross-Complaint against
Vo and Kay (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”), alleging seven causes of action
against them for (1) breach of fiduciary duty (direct); (2) breach of fiduciary
duty (derivative); (3) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (4) fraud
in the inducement – intentional misrepresentation; (5) intentional infliction
of emotional distress; (6) negligent misrepresentation; and (7) negligence.
Cross-Defendants now move the
court for an order (1) sustaining their demurrer to each cause of action
alleged in the Cross-Complaint, and (2) striking from the Cross-Complaint
various allegations and the requests for punitive damages and attorney’s fees.
DEMURRER
The court overrules
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty (direct) because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action since Dam has sufficiently pleaded the existence of a fiduciary
relationship between the parties.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
“A fiduciary relationship is
any relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the
parties is in duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of
the other party.”  (Hodges v. County
of Placer (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 537, 546 [internal quotations and citations
omitted].)  “‘Traditional examples of
fiduciary relationships in the commercial context include trustee/beneficiary,
directors and majority shareholders of a corporation, business partners, joint
adventurers, and agent/principals. 
[Citations.]’  [Citation.]”  (Id. at p. 547.)  Cross-Complainants have alleged that (1)
cross-defendant Vo convinced cross-complainant Dam to provide 10 percent in
equity to each of the Cross-Defendants in exchange for a $250,000 capital
investment (Cross-Compl., ¶ 29); (2) pursuant to their agreement, Kay
became an officer of Liberate and took a part in the management of the business
on behalf of Cross-Defendants (Cross-Compl., ¶ 30); (3) Kay began to take
over much of the control over Liberate from Dam (Cross-Compl., ¶ 32); (4)
Cross-Defendants became officers of Liberate when they requested management
control over the business; and (5) Cross-Defendants were “insiders and officers
with management duties and control over” Liberate (Cross-Compl.,
¶ 67).  The court finds that these
allegations are sufficient to allege the existence of a fiduciary relationship
between Dam and Cross-Defendants as business partners.  (Hodges, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th
at p. 547.) 
The court overrules
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty (derivative) because it states facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since (1) Cross-Complainants have alleged the existence of a
fiduciary relationship between the parties for the same reasons as set forth
above (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 29-30, 32, 75), (2) Cross-Complainants have
alleged more than “[t]he mere absence of an asset” in support of this cause of
action, and (3) this cause of action is not ambiguous or unintelligible and
therefore is not uncertain.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e), (f); Hodges, supra, 41
Cal.App.5th at p. 547; Demurrer, p. 8:14-15.) 
The court overrules
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action for aiding and abetting
breach of fiduciary duty because it states facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since Cross-Complainants have alleged facts establishing that
Cross-Defendants assisted or encouraged the other in breaching her fiduciary
duties to Cross-Complainants by alleging that (1) Cross-Defendants demanded that
dividend payments be made to Kay (Cross-Compl., ¶ 32), showing knowledge
and assistance in the breach of fiduciary duty based on their improper demand
for payments that no other shareholders received, and (2) Cross-Defendants knew
that Liberate was not operating as planned when they withdrew capital from the
business and when they demanded Dam write a check for $250,000 (Cross-Compl.,
¶¶ 40-41), showing knowledge and assistance in the breach of fiduciary
duty based on their improper demand for the investment reimbursement (Cross-Compl.,
¶¶ 83, 86-87).  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.10, subds. (e), (f); Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 83 [alleging breaches of
fiduciary duty to be their demands for dividends payments and for investment
reimbursement], 86 [alleging early demand for dividend payments to be
sabotage], 88 [alleging demand for payments that no other shareholder received
to be self-dealing and breach of fiduciary duty]; Nasrawi v. Buck
Consultants LLC (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343 [elements of a claim for
aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty].) 
The court overrules
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraud in the
inducement – intentional misrepresentation because it states facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action since Cross-Complainants have alleged the facts
supporting this cause of action with sufficient particularity[1] by alleging (1) who made
the subject representations (i.e., Cross-Defendants) (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 96,
100), (2) to whom they made the representations (i.e., Dam), and (3) the
timeframe during which the representations were made, i.e., (i) during the
relationship between Kay and Dam (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 25-27, 36), which is
alleged to have commenced in July 2017 (Cross-Compl., ¶ 20) and ended in
September 2017 (Cross-Compl., ¶ 37), and (ii) the day after Kay and Dam
ended their relationship in September 2017 (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 37-38,
47).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e); Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 96 [alleging representations to be that Kay and Vo
would have a family together and that Vo would contribute to the business for
the business’s success], 98, 100 [Vo misled Dam to believe that the second
agreement was a valid agreement between the parties when it was illusory], 109;
Foster v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1028 [fraud must be pleaded
with particularity].)
The court overrules cross-defendant
Kay’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against Kay since Dam has alleged facts establishing that Kay’s conduct
was “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a
civilized community” and therefore has alleged the element of extreme and
outrageous conduct.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e); Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051
[internal quotations and citations omitted]; Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 20-21, 33
[cross-defendant Kay “tried to stab Ms. Dam with scissors”].) 
The court sustains
cross-defendant Vo’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress because it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action since Dam has not alleged facts establishing that Vo’s
conduct was “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a
civilized community” and therefore has not alleged the element of extreme and
outrageous conduct as to Vo.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Hughes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp.
1050-1051 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
The court sustains
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since Cross-Complainants did not identify any misrepresentations
in support of this cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Borman v. Brown
(2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1060 [elements of negligent
misrepresentation].)  Although the court
acknowledges that Cross-Complainants have alleged the existence of various
alleged misrepresentations in the general background portion of the
Cross-Complaint, the facts in support of this cause of action do not specify
which representations form the bases for this cause of action.  Instead, Cross-Complainants have alleged that
“Cross-Defendants owed a duty to Cross-Complainant” and “breached their duty to
use reasonable care in making business decision and demanding dividend payments
from” Cross-Complainants.  (Cross-Compl.,
¶ 131.)
The court overrules
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the seventh cause of action for negligence because
it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since
Cross-Complainants have alleged that (1) Cross-Defendants owed them a duty, (2)
Cross-Defendants breached their duty to use reasonable care in making business
decisions and demanding dividend payments from Cross-Complainants, and (3) as a
result of their breach, Cross-Complainants have suffered damages “with the
closure of the business due to Cross-Defendants’ conduct that destroyed Ms.
Dam’s ability to run the business.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 136, 138-139; Peredia
v. HR Mobile Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687; Lopez v.
Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795 [“Ordinarily,
negligence may be pleaded in general terms”].) 
MOTION TO STRIKE
Cross-Defendants move the court for an order striking from the
Cross-Complaint            (1) paragraphs
67, 69, 75, 77, 83, 100, 108, 122, 131, 137, and 138 as irrelevant; (2) the
requests for punitive damages made in paragraphs 73-74, 81-82, 94-95, 114, 129,
paragraph four in each prayer for relief as to the first through fifth causes
of action, and paragraph six in the prayer labeled “On All Causes of Action;”
and (3) the requests for attorney’s fees and costs made in paragraph 3 in each
prayer for relief as to the first through fifth and seventh causes of action,
paragraph seven of the sixth cause of action, and paragraph two in the prayer
labeled “On All Causes of Action.”
First, the court denies as moot Cross-Defendants’ motion to strike
paragraph 131 because (1) this paragraph is alleged in support of the sixth
cause of action, and (2) the court has sustained Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to
this cause of action. 
Second, the court denies Cross-Defendants’ motion to strike paragraphs
67, 69, 75, 77, 83, 100, 108, 122, 137, and 138 because Cross-Defendants have
not shown that the allegations made in those paragraphs are irrelevant, false,
or improper.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a); PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680,
1638 [“use of the motion to strike should be cautious and sparing” and should
not be used as “a procedural ‘line item veto’ for the civil defendant”].)
Third, the court denies Cross-Defendants’ motion to strike the
requests, prayers, and supporting allegations for punitive damages because
Cross-Complainants have alleged facts establishing that Cross-Defendants are
guilty of fraud.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
436; Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) 
Fourth, the court grants Cross-Defendants’ motion to strike Cross-Complainants’
prayers for “Attorney Fees” as set forth in (1) paragraphs 3 of the prayers on
the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action, (2)
paragraph 7 of the prayer on the sixth cause of action, and (3) paragraph 2 of
the prayer on “All Causes of Action,” because Cross-Complainants did not
identify a statute or contract to support their requests for attorney’s
fees.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)
