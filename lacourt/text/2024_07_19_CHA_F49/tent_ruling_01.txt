NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order granting Plaintiff’s Expedited Petition to  Approve Minor’s Compromise filed on June 26, 2024 (the “Petition”)   TENTATIVE RULING: The Petition is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This case arises from alleged personal injury and damages  sustained by Plaintiffs as the result of a motor vehicle collision that  occurred on July 2, 2022.    On October 12, 2022, Plaintiffs Elide Romeo and Elizier  Romeo (“Plaintiffs”) filed their Complaint against Defendants Mane Matinyan  (“Matinyan”), Garrett Holden Hixon, Michelle Hixon (collectively, “Hixons”),  and Does 1 to 30, alleging: (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General  Negligence. Subsequently, Defendants Hixons and Matinyan filed their respective  Answers to the Complaint on December 2, and 7, 2022, respectively.   On December 2, 2022, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Hixons  filed their Cross-Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Defendant Matinyan for (1)  Indemnification, and (2) Apportionment of Fault. Subsequently, on January 27,  2023, Defendant/Cross-Defendant Matinyan filed an Answer to the  Cross-Complaint.   On  February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs submitted a Request for Dismissal, dismissing with  prejudice Defendants Hixons and the Cross-Complaint. The request was  subsequently entered by the Clerk on the same day.   On June  26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Expedited Petition to Approve Minor’s  Compromise (the “Petition”).    On July  9, 2024, the Court set the Petition for hearing for July 19, 2024, pursuant to  California Rules of Court rule 7.950.5(c)(3) and Probate Code section 3505.   No  Opposition papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   “[T]he  protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a  role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor’s best  interests…[I]ts¿primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to  provide for the minor’s injuries, care and treatment.” (Goldberg v. Sup. Ct.¿(1994)  23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)¿  ¿  A  petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under¿Code  of Civil Procedure¿section¿372 must comply with California Rules of Court,  rules¿7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner  and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the  reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant.¿(Cal. Rules of Court,  rule¿7.950.)¿The person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person  who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on  compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their  personal appearance.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, rule¿7.952.)¿  ¿  An order  for deposit of funds of a minor or person lacking decision making capacity and  a petition for the withdrawal of such funds must comply with¿California Rules  of Court, rules¿7.953 and 7.954.¿(Cal. Rules of Court¿3.1384; see¿also¿Super.  Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)¿  ¿  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Rule 7.950, a petitioner may fully complete form MC-350EX to  expedite their petition for approval of a minor’s compromise where:¿(1) The  petitioner is represented by an attorney authorized to practice in the courts  of this state; (2) The claim is not for damages for the wrongful death of a  person; (3) No portion of the net proceeds of the compromise, settlement, or  judgment in favor of the minor or disabled claimant is to be placed in a trust;  (4) There are no unresolved disputes concerning liens to be satisfied from the  proceeds of the compromise, settlement, or judgment; (5) The petitioner's  attorney did not become involved in the matter at the direct or indirect  request of a person against whom the claim is asserted or an insurance carrier  for that person; (6) The petitioner's attorney is neither employed by nor  associated with a defendant or insurance carrier in connection with the  petition;¿¿(7) If an action has been filed on the claim: (A) All defendants  that have appeared in the action are participating in the compromise; or (B)  The court has finally determined that the settling parties entered into the  settlement in good faith; (8) The judgment for the minor or disabled claimant  (exclusive of interest and costs) or the total amount payable to the minor or  disabled claimant and all other parties under the proposed compromise or  settlement is $50,000 or less or, if greater: (A) The total amount payable to  the minor or disabled claimant represents payment of the individual-person  policy limits of all liability insurance policies covering all proposed  contributing parties; and (B) All proposed contributing parties would be  substantially unable to discharge an adverse judgment on the minor's or  disabled person's claim from assets other than the proceeds of their liability  insurance policies; and (9) The court does not otherwise order.¿(California  Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5(a).)¿  ¿  The court  ordinarily must rule on an expedited petition no more than 35 days after it is  filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5(b).)¿The expedited petition must be  determined by the court without a hearing unless a hearing is requested by the  petitioner at the time the expedited petition is filed, an objection or other  opposition to the petition is filed by an interested party, or a hearing is  scheduled by the court¿on its own motion or where it decided not to grant an  expedited petition in full as requested.
