**Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The judge's tentative ruling denies several of the plaintiff's demurrers, including the demurrer to the breach of contract claim, the elder abuse claim, and the claim for declaratory relief. The judge also denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer and cross-complaint. The judge finds that the defendant's conduct, including alleged breaches of contract and elder abuse, is sufficient to support the existence of malice, oppression, or fraud, and therefore denies the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages.
