House Holdings, Inc. is GRANTED with 30 days leave to amend .
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
STRIKE
Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a
notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., §
435(b)(1)). The notice of motion to strike a portion of a pleading shall quote
in full the portions sought to be stricken except where the motion is to strike
an entire paragraph, cause of action, count or defense. (California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1322.)
The grounds for a motion to
strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or form any matter
of which the court is required to take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437(a)). The court then may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading and strike out all or any part of any pleading
not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) When the defect which
justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave
to amend. (Perlman v. Municipal Court
(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 568, 575.)
Plaintiff Dominick Martin
(Plaintiff) moves to strike the answer filed by Defendant Congregation Ale
House Holdings, Inc. (Defendant) on the grounds that Defendant filed the answer
in pro per, without representation of counsel, which it cannot do as a
corporation in unlimited civil proceedings. (Motion at p. 3.)
Plaintiff is correct. “As a
general rule, it is well-established in California that a corporation cannot
represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona or through an
officer or agent who is not an attorney.” (Caressa Camille, Inc. v.
Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) A
pleading filed by a self-represented corporation  is subject to strike. (See CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1150.)
The motion is therefore GRANTED, with leave granted to
Defendant to file an amended answer through counsel.
