[1] According to counsel’s declaration filed on 2/20/24,
he did not attend the 1/31/24 hearing because he “was under the impression”
that should Plaintiff depose Sun, which Defendants agreed to, supplemental
discovery responses would be unnecessary such that the IDC would be taken off
calendar. According to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s declaration filed on 4/9/24, the
agreement was contingent upon Defendants taking Plaintiff’s settlement offer,
which they refused. In fact, after the conversation, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed
the IDC brief with the court and served it upon Counsel Andion.


[2] According to Counsel Andion’s declaration, Sun “does
not yet have a definitive diagnosis and medical treatment is ongoing.” (Andion
Decl., p. 2.) She went to the emergency room on 2/23/24, which appears to be
the same date of Sun’s scheduled deposition. While Defense Counsel may have
provided Plaintiff’s Counsel with a copy of Sun’s medical records, it is not
attached to his declaration. 
 


[3] Plaintiff seeks an award of monetary sanctions
against Defendant Sunshine and/or its counsel, Mr. James Andion, in the amount
of $5,560.00 per motion (6 hours writing moving papers, 3 hours anticipated in
reviewing and preparing a reply to the opposition, 2 hours traveling, $60
filing fee at $500/hour). Should sanctions be awarded, they will drastically
reduced as the motions do not involve substantial legal analysis and largely
consist of attachments.
