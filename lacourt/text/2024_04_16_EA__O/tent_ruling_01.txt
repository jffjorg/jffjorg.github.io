Background
 
This case arises from a partnership dispute. Plaintiff

SUNSHINE EDUCATION ACADEMY (corporation) (“Defendant Sunshine”) and Wenying
Sun: Plaintiff was established in 2017 and it later determined to invest an
education business in Southern California. In November 2018, Plaintiff and
Defendant Sunshine entered into an Investment Agreement whereby Plaintiff
agreed to invest $200,000 in Defendant Sunshine for 51% its shares; Sun (CEO and
General Manager of Sunshine) is a 49% shareholder of Sunshine. In 2022,
Plaintiff requested Defendants to provide certain financial documents of
Sunshine because Plaintiff was preparing a non-immigration petition for its
owner to enter the United States. 
However, Defendant Sun had refused to produce them.

Discussion
 
Documents
 
Plaintiff seeks product of documents of the following:
 
-       
Any and all financial records, including but not
limited to books, ledgers of YOURS from 2018 to present; 
-       
Any and all business records RELATIING TO YOUR business
transactions from 2018, including but not limited to the invoices, receipts of
payments in any form such as cash, credit cards, checks, wire transfer, and
etc; 
-       
Any and all DOCUMENTS RELATING TO the use of
Plaintiff’s investment funds in the amount of $200,000.
 
As to all, Defendants either responded that the documents
will be provided or that Defendants have not yet located said documents, but
they will subsequently be provided should they be found.
 
The documents, however, have not been produced. 
 
Here,
the court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendants have made “without substantial
justification, unmeritorious objections to discovery.” (C.C.P. section
2023.010(e).) After all, the requests are for business records, thus they are
relevant, and they are documents within the control of Sun, who is the manager
and controller of this company. If there is a person who knows the location of the documents or who
knows of the person who has custody of the documents, it is Sun. As
cited by Plaintiff, a party must make a good faith effort in obtaining
documents responsive to the request (Regency Health Services, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1496), but here, there is no
declaration that such preliminary efforts have been exercised. What is more, “a
party cannot plead ignorance to information which can be obtained from sources
under his control.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.) 
 
To the extent that Defense Counsel has filed a declaration,
he explains that Sun “looks extremely ill” and thus because “she is not well,”
he cannot produce the documents. (Andion Decl. pp. 1-2.) The court is
unpersuaded. Though the court is sympathetic to any ailment Sun may
have,[2]
as noted by Plaintiff’s Counsel, Counsel Andion is not a medical doctor who can
make an evaluation on Defendant Sun’s medical condition. 
 
Thus, absent
a medical note affirmatively concluding that Sun does not have the capacity whatsoever
to participate in litigation (or lacks capacity to direct another
party in locating the documents), Defendants are to produce the documents
within 30 days of this order. Monetary sanctions will be determined
at the conclusion of the hearing.[3]

 
Interrogatories
 
As for the interrogatories, they seek, inter alia, the name,
addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons who have knowledge of facts
identified in the denial/affirmative defenses. 
 
Defendants respond to each with the following: “Defendant's
personnel did everything that was required by agreement between the parties.
Defendant's personnel kept Plaintiff's principal, Guidong Gao, informed about
all business developments, including the difficulties presented by the global
pandemic. Defendant's personnel provided Mr. Gao or his attorneys with all
information that he or his attorneys requested, and Defendant's personnel
provided Mr. Gao or his attorneys with all documents that he or his attorneys
requested.” 
 
Here,
as noted by Plaintiff, the responses are incomplete because they do not
identify EACH denial and EACH special or affirmative defense in its responses
and for EACH denial and defense, Defendants did not provide facts, witnesses
and documents in support. 
 
To the extent that Defendants have opposed the motion, their
argument is the same as above: they “would be happy to provide further
responses to form interrogatories” (Andion Decl, p. 2), but Counsel Andion is
unable to due to Sun’s health. But even is Sun is gravely ill, responding to
form interrogatories is one to be done by Counsel Andion and there is no
declaration that Sun does not have the ability to speak to her attorney
to provide him with the complete information. 
 
Thus,
the court orders complete responses to the form interrogatories within 30 days
of this order. Monetary sanctions are TBD. 
 
Communication Between the Attorneys
 
Counsel Andion takes issue with Plaintiff’s Counsel
communicating with him via email instead of both email and US mail. 
 
Plaintiff in Reply contends that Defense counsel’s use of
electronic communications at the outset of litigation waives request for US mail.

As this matter does not require legal adjudication, the
court encourages the parties to resolve this point on their own.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motions are GRANTED; monetary
sanctions are TBD.
