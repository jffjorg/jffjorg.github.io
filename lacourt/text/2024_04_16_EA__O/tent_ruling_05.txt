[1] According to the complaint, Zavala claims damages in
excess of 10 million dollars. (Complaint pp. 5-6.) 
 


[2] Based on the complaint, it appears no written
settlement agreement was signed. (See Complaint p. 6 [“Travelers has offered,
and continues to offer, to pay Zavala and has tendered to Zavala the sum of
$415,000 as provided for in the parties’ agreement… Zavala has failed and
refused, and continues to fail and refuse, to perform the conditions of the
contract on his part in that he sued Coastal Pacific and Alcantar and
refuses to execute a settlement agreement or release as provided in the
agreement.”], emphasis added.) 


[3] Defendant generally and specifically denies each,
every, and all allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint, including each and every
purported cause of action contained or alleged therein. (Answer p. 1:23-25.) 


[4] As identified by Plaintiff in opposition (Opp. p.
15:25-26), the demurrer is a general demurrer, and not otherwise uncontested by
Plaintiff in reply. 
 


[5] For clarity, Zavala has not stated even one
proper affirmative defense. (See Opp. p. 12:5-6 [“The Court should accordingly
overrule Travelers’s Demurrer upon finding either that Zavala has stated a
general denial or that Zavala has stated any one or more affirmative
defenses.”].)
