And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling is in response to the motion to strike the complaint filed by the defendant, Francisco Naranjo-Zendejas. The plaintiff, Lorenzo Gamez Fortaneli, alleges that the defendant fraudulently transferred ownership of the property and seeks to establish quiet title. The defendant argues that the complaint was not properly verified because the plaintiff is not fluent in English and therefore cannot read or understand the complaint. However, the court finds that the complaint does not state that the plaintiff cannot read, write, or speak English, but rather that he does not read or write English proficiently. Additionally, the court rules that even if the plaintiff cannot read or understand English, the defendant has not provided authority that requires a certified translation of the complaint. The court concludes that the complaint was sufficiently verified and denies the motion to strike the complaint."
