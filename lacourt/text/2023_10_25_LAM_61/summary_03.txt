```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the anti-SLAPP motion filed by Defendant Kimball, Tirey & St. John, LLP, finding that the complaint against them arises from protected activity. The complaint alleges that the defendant served an alleged forged notice of hearing in an underlying unlawful detainer case, which is a protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer filed by Defendant PIH Health Good Samaritan Hospital, finding that the complaint against them fails to state a cause of action for medical malpractice. The complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim for medical malpractice, and the defendant is correct that the complaint is uncertain and does not comply with the formatting requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 2.112.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and the allegation that PIH is a public entity as moot, as these claims are no longer relevant in light of the demurrer being sustained.
