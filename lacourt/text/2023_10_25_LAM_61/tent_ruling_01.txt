Responses to Form Interrogatories from CV Communities, LLC is DENIED. Sanctions

Plaintiff to provide notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER 
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
Defendant City of Palmdale (Palmdale) seeks
further responses to Form Interrogatories No. 50.1 through 50.6 from Plaintiff
CV Communities, LLC (Plaintiff), on the grounds that Plaintiff offered
responses subject to meritless objections, and failed to respond substantively
to the interrogatories.
These interrogatories sought information
concerning the contracts that are the subject of this case, and specifically
sought the identification of each agreement, and any modifications made
thereto, any breaches, excuses of performance, terminations, ambiguities, or
grounds for unenforceability. (Mackprang Decl. Exh. 1.) Plaintiff responded on
June 8, 2023, by reference to two agreements — the 2015 Final Conditions of
Approval and Palmdale Joint Community Facilities Agreement — subject to
objections based on overbreadth, vagueness, undue burden, and privilege.
(Separate Statement.) Palmdale met and conferred with Plaintiff as to the
objections and equivocal language used in the responses — such as “on
information and belief” and “to Responding Party’s knowledge” — and on June 26,
2023, Palmdale received amended responses removing prefatory objections (though
maintaining the objections asserted as to each interrogatory individually) and
removing the equivocating language. (Mackprang Decl. ¶¶ 4–11.) Palmdale filed
the present motion on July 5, 2023, without further efforts at informal
resolution.
Palmdale failed to meet and confer before
filing the present motion. The sole substantive inadequacy identified in
Plaintiff’s interrogatory responses is the limitation of their responses to the
2015 Final Conditions of Approval and Palmdale JCFA, matters which they did not
broach in their informal correspondence prior to filing the motion. Indeed,
Plaintiff notes in opposition that Palmdale’s own responses to the same
interrogatories were limited to the same agreements. (Mircheff Decl. Exh. 5 at
pp. 14–21.)
Palmdale in reply argues that it broached
these defects in its informal correspondence by reference to the responses’
lack of a “complete and straightforward response.” (Reply at p. 2.) But
Palmdale’s own correspondence makes clear that the specific defect it took
issue with was the inclusion of equivocal language in the responses concerning
Plaintiff’s knowledge and belief, which Plaintiff rectified with the provision
of further responses. (Mackprang Decl. Exhs. 3, 8.)[1]
The motion is therefore DENIED.
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the
amount of $6,000.00, representing  six
hours of attorney work at $550 per hour, plus 4.5 hours of attorney work at
$600 per hour. (Mircheff Decl. ¶¶ 20–22.) 
Sanctions are awarded against
Palmdale and its counsel in the amount of $1,100.
