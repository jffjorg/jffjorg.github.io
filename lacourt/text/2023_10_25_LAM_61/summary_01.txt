And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant City of Palmdale's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from the plaintiff CV Communities, LLC is denied. The plaintiff has provided amended responses to the interrogatories, and the defendant's objections to the responses were meritless. The defendant failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion, and the sole substantive inadequacy identified in the plaintiff's responses is the limitation of their responses to the 2015 Final Conditions of Approval and Palmdale Joint Community Facilities Agreement.

The judge also awards sanctions against the defendant City of Palmdale and its counsel in the amount of $1,100. The plaintiff had sought sanctions in the amount of $6,000.00, but the judge found that this amount was excessive.
