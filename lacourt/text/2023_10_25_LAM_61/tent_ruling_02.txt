[1] As noted
in ruling on Palmdale’s prior motions to compel further, the mere fact that
discovery responses are offered “subject to and without waiving” objections
does not furnish a basis to bring a motion to compel, where those objections do
not limit the party’s substantive response. 
(Cf. American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees
v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 268.) Palmdale here
failed to confer about the only substantive issue it raises in its motion.
