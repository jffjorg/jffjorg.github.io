  - The Court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection) in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.
  - In order to testify as an expert in a medical malpractice case, a person must have enough knowledge, learning, and skill with the relevant subject to speak with authority, and he or she must be familiar with the standard of care to which the defendant was held.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiff's claims against Dr. Liau, denied the motion as to the plaintiff's claims against the Regents and Dr. Hudson, and denied the motion without prejudice as to the plaintiff's claims against Dr. Lai.

The court's reasoning is that the defendants have met their burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the plaintiff's claims against Dr. Liau, and the plaintiff has failed to provide competent evidence to establish that Dr. Liau caused the plaintiff's harm. The court has also found that the plaintiff has created a triable issue of material fact as to the claims against Dr. Hudson and the Regents, but the defendants have established that there is no triable issue as to the claims against Dr. Liau.

The court has also excluded the declaration of Dr. Meitzen, the plaintiff's expert, as to Dr. Liau's standard of care, as Dr. Meitzen is not qualified to render an opinion on the standard of care applicable to Dr. Liau.

The court has ordered the parties to give notice of its tentative ruling.
