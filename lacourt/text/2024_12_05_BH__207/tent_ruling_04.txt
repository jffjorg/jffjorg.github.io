MOTION
 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiffs Michael Kibler (“Michael”) and Ann Kibler
(“Ann”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) against Defendants LiveOne, Inc. (“LiveOne”); PodcastOne, Inc.
(“PodcastOne”); Robert Ellin (“Ellin”); Joshua Hallbauer (“Hallbauer”); Aidan
Crotinger (“Crotinger”); Splitmind LLC (“Splitmind”); Siamak Khakshooy
(“Khakshooy”); Tanaz Koshki (“Koshki”); and ABC Corps (“ABC”) alleging five
causes of action for (1) violation of Beverly Hills Municipal Zoning Laws; (2)
public nuisance; (3) private nuisance; (4) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (5) aiding and abetting tort, for allegedly operating a
commercial office, business event center, professional podcast interview and
music recording studio in the middle of a Beverly Hills residential
community.  (FAC ¶ 1.)
 
Defendant LiveOne moves to compel the depositions of both Plaintiffs
and for monetary sanctions.  Plaintiffs
oppose the motion and LiveOne replies.[1]  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     Deposition
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
Here, on June 21, 2024, LiveOne served the subject deposition notices on
Plaintiffs, scheduling Ann’s deposition for July 19, 2024 and Michael’s
deposition for July 24, 2024. (Sepidnameh Decl. Exs. A and B.)  
 
On July 12, Plaintiffs objected to the Notice of Deposition for Ann,
indicating they were unavailable that date. 
(Ex. C to Sepidnameh Decl.)  On
July 18, 2024, Plaintiffs objected to the Notice of Deposition for Michael on
the same grounds.  (Ex. E to Sepidnameh
Decl.)
 
After receiving no response to repeated requests to meet and confer,
on July 25, LiveOne’s counsel attempted to schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”) but again received no response from Plaintiffs’ counsel.  (Sepidnameh Decl. ¶ 10.)  LiveOne ultimately scheduled an IDC for
September 10, 2024.
 
On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel offered to meet and confer, and
on August 8, proposed a global deposition schedule whereby eight other
depositions would take place before Ann’s deposition.  (Sepidnameh Decl. Ex. I.)   LiveOne’s
counsel attempted to negotiate moving Ann’s deposition earlier in the schedule,
but Plaintiffs’ counsel refused until after they received firm dates for
Defendants’ and other witness depositions. 
(Pham Decl. ¶ 4.) 
 
At the IDC, the Court confirmed there is no “priority rule” for
depositions, but indicated that where a party has noticed a deposition, the
opposing party should not normally try to insert other depositions first, and
proposed taking one Plaintiff’s deposition, then Plaintiff could take one or
two of Defendants’ depositions, then the next Plaintiff’s deposition, etc.  (Pham Decl. ¶ 6.)   Accordingly,
LiveOne’s counsel proposed a deposition schedule in line with that suggested at
the IDC, but Plaintiffs’ counsel refused to provide any alternative dates for
Plaintiffs’ depositions.  (Pham Decl. at
¶¶ 7-8 and Ex. K.)  
 
Plaintiffs oppose the motion on the grounds that there is no “priority
rule” and they disagree that Ann’s deposition should proceed first, even though
it was noticed first.
 
Ultimately, Plaintiffs have provided no reason for their failure to
appear for deposition, other than the gamesmanship of not wanting to sit for
deposition first.  Therefore, the Court
grants LiveOne’s motion and compels
both Plaintiffs to appear for deposition per Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, and orders Plaintiffs to appear for deposition within 20 days of
notice of the Court’s order, unless LiveOne stipulates otherwise.  
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
LiveOne
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motion to compel deposition.  The Court finds Plaintiffs’ refusal to appear
for deposition to be abuses of the discovery process, warranting monetary
sanctions.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010, subd. (d), 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  
 
Accordingly,
the Court will impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $2,010, which represents three hours of Yass
Sepidnameh’s time to prepare the moving and reply papers at the hourly rate of
$420 and one hour of Teri T. Pham’s time to attend the hearing at the hourly
rate of $750.    
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants LiveOne’s
motion to compel Plaintiffs to appear for deposition per Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450, and orders both Plaintiffs to appear for deposition
within 20 days of notice of the Court’s order, unless LiveOne stipulates
otherwise.  
 
Further,
the Court orders Plaintiffs, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions
in the amount $2,010 to LiveOne, by and through counsel for LiveOne, within 20
days of notice of the Court’s orders. 
 
LiveOne shall provide notice
of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.

of the Superior Court
[1] The
Court does not generally consider evidence filed with a reply brief, because it
creates due process problems, as it deprives the other party of a fair
opportunity to respond.  (See San
Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th
308, 316 [“due process requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be
addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to
prevail”]; see also Wall Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co.
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)  Therefore,
the Court disregards the Supplemental Sepidnameh Declaration submitted with the
Reply.TENTATIVE RULING - NO. 2

MOTIONS
 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiffs Michael Kibler (“Michael”) and Ann Kibler
(“Ann”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) against Defendants LiveOne, Inc. (“LiveOne”); PodcastOne, Inc.
(“PodcastOne”); Robert Ellin (“Ellin”); Joshua Hallbauer (“Hallbauer”); Aidan
Crotinger (“Crotinger”); Splitmind LLC (“Splitmind”); Siamak Khakshooy
(“Khakshooy”); Tanaz Koshki (“Koshki”); and ABC Corps (“ABC”) alleging five
causes of action for (1) violation of Beverly Hills Municipal Zoning Laws; (2)
public nuisance; (3) private nuisance; (4) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (5) aiding and abetting tort, for allegedly operating a
commercial office, business event center, professional podcast interview and
music recording studio in the middle of a Beverly Hills residential
community.  (FAC ¶ 1.)
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further production from LiveOne regarding
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of Documents, sets 1 and 2 (“RPD”).  LiveOne opposes the motions and Plaintiffs
reply.
 
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 
            Separate Statement
 
            California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires that any motion involving the content of
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for why an order
compelling further responses is warranted.
 
            Plaintiffs
have provided a separate statement with respect to the RPD in compliance with
the Rules of Court.
 
ANALYSIS    
 
1.     RPD
 
“The purpose of the discovery rules is to enhance the truth-seeking
function of the litigation process and eliminate trial strategies that focus on
gamesmanship and surprise.  In other
words, the discovery process is designed to make a trial less a game of
blindman's bluff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts
disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.” 
(Juarez v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc.
(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389 [cleaned up].)  

 
            With respect to demands for
inspection of documents or other items, the Discovery Act provides as follows:
 
The party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to
each item or category of item by any of the following:  (1) A statement that the party will comply
with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the
date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related
activities.  (2) A representation that
the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item.  (3) An objection to the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  Further,
per Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, “[i]f a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling  . . .  thereafter fails to permit the inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's statement of
compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.”

            Foremost, the Court notes
that in response to each RPD set forth above, LiveOne responded that at minimum
it would product all non-privileged, responsive documents.  Based solely on LiveOne’s responses, the
Discovery Act then compels it to produce such responsive documents per Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320.  And to
the extent that LiveOne withholds any responsive documents based upon a privilege,
LiveOne shall prepare and serve a privilege log in conjunction with its further
production of non-privileged, responsive documents.  (See Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement, RPD Nos.
33-46.)  
 
            Nevertheless,
regarding RPD Nos. 1-14, Plaintiffs contend that LiveOne should be required to
search the emails of certain employees Plaintiff have listed that are likely to
have discoverable information.  LiveOne
argues that Plaintiffs seek by their requests “to harass and burden LiveOne
with demands for overbroad, ambiguous and irrelevant requests for all documents
‘relating to’ the house.”  Specifically,
LiveOne explains that running the searches suggested by Plaintiffs results in
tens of thousands of emails, the vast majority of which are completely
unrelated to the subject property or this litigation.  
 
            The Court disagrees
that documents “relating to” the subject property are overbroad or irrelevant,
as the subject property, where LiveOne contends Mr. Crotinger lived for only
about one year, is the direct subject of this litigation.  Yet, the Court is sympathetic to the practical
issue that the proposed search terms may not be useful in efficiently
identifying responsive documents, and therefore will not order LiveOne to use
Plaintiffs’ proposed search terms.  Instead,
the Court compels the parties to meet and confer to facilitate a more complete
production of documents relating to the subject property.
 
            For RPD Nos. 33-46,
LiveOne contends that the requested insurance documents are privileged.  Plaintiffs argue that this Court already
determined they were not.
 
            As explained in connection with the
Court’s prior ruling on LiveOne’s Motion to Strike, the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act (“Act”) defines “privileged information” as any
individually identifiable information that both (1) relates to a claim for
insurance benefits or a civil or criminal proceeding involving an individual
and (2) is collected in connection with or in reasonable anticipation of a
claim for insurance benefits or civil or criminal proceeding involving an
individual.  (Ins. Code § 791.02, subd.
(v).)  An “individual” is defined as a
“natural person.”  (Id. at subd.
(i).)   However, as the Court of Appeal
explained:
 
We find nothing in the Insurance Code provisions cited by defendants
which would require a restrictive interpretation of the Civil Discovery Act of
1986. Defendants point to the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act.
(Ins. Code, § 791 et seq.) That act is part of this state's regulation of the
business of insurance. It was enacted “to establish standards for the
collection, use and disclosure of information gathered in connection with
insurance transactions by insurance institutions, agents or insurance-support
organizations; ...” (Ins. Code, § 791.) The act applies to, and restricts,
information gathering practices and disclosures of information by insurers. It
does not purport to create a privilege against discovery by an insured party
who is a party to a lawsuit. Moreover, the provisions of the insurance act
yield where disclosure is “[o]therwise permitted or required by law” or is
“[i]n response to a facially valid administrative or judicial order, including
a search warrant or subpoena.” (Ins. Code, § 791.13, subds. (g), (h).)
 
(Irvington-Moore,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.)  
 
Thus, the cited provisions of the Insurance Code do not prevent
discovery or disclosure of otherwise discoverable insurance information to
parties to a lawsuit, such as Plaintiffs, and LiveOne does not raise any other
grounds of privilege.  
 
As such, the Court finds that the insurance documents should be
produced.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
grants Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further production of documents responsive
to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1 and 2, Nos. 1-14 and 33-42,
per Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320. 
Further, the Court orders LiveOne to serve the further production of
responsive documents within 30 days of notice of the Court’s orders.  
 
            Plaintiffs shall provide notice of
the Court’s order and file a proof of service regarding the same.
