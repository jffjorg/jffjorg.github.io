And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Defendants Elm Luxury Investments, LLC and Araks Amirian to set aside the defaults and default judgment entered against them on September 26, 2024. The judge found that neither Defendant received actual notice of the summons and complaint until September 25, 2024, and that the strong public policy to try cases on their merits supports granting the motion. The judge also noted that the Defendants' counsel contacted the Plaintiffs, who are unrepresented by counsel, and requested that they stipulate to set aside the default, but the Plaintiffs refused. Therefore, the judge concludes that it is appropriate to set aside the defaults and orders the defaults entered against the Defendants to be set aside.
