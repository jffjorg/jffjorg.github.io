And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Counsel (Dariush Adli and Anthony Son of Adli Law Group PC) to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Sewby LLC and Jaleh Marie Factor. Counsel has cited irreconcilable differences compromising the relationship of trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship, making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the employment effectively. The motions are unopposed.

The judge notes that Counsel has filed the required forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053, but has failed to provide proof of service demonstrating service of these forms on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action. Therefore, the judge is continuing the hearing on the motions to January 28, 2025, to enable Counsel to serve the moving papers and file the proofs of service demonstrating compliance on or before January 21, 2025.
