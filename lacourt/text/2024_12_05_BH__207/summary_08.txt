English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint in a case involving a breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, retaliation, and aiding and abetting discrimination/retaliation. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for aiding and abetting discrimination/retaliation, finding that the complaint adequately states a claim. However, the judge has granted the motion to strike certain portions of the complaint, including the request for punitive and exemplary damages, as well as damages for humiliation, embarrassment, and mental anguish, as these remedies are not available under the contract-based breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge has also granted leave to amend, but only if the motion to strike is denied. The case management conference has been continued to March 3, 2025.
