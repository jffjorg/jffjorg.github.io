[1] The Demurrer page indicates the demurrer is brought
pursuant to subdivisions (d) and (e). 
Subdivision (d) pertains to a defect/misjoinder of parties.  The memorandum of points and authorities does
not address defect/misjoinder, but does argue that the complaint is
uncertain.  Therefore, the Court
interprets the demurrer as being brought pursuant to subdivisions (e) [failure
to state facts to constitute a cause of action] and (f) [uncertainty] and that
reference to subdivision (d) [defect/misjoinder] was a typographical error.
