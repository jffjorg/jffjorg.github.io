Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor and is inclined to find the settlement reasonable. The court intends to approve the petition after brief questioning of each claimant and the guardian ad litem. The court has scheduled a hearing for February 21, 2024, and will advance the petitions for minors compromises set for February 22, 2024, February 23, 2024, and February 27, 2024 to today's date. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing them to appear remotely via LACourtConnect. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) regarding proof of deposit for June 27, 2024, requiring the moving party to give notice.
