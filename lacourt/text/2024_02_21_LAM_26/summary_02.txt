And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by defense counsel, James P. Gutierrez, to be relieved as counsel for defendants Jose Almendares and Luis Almendares. Counsel has failed to confirm within 30 days that the clients' address is current, as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362. Counsel's declaration contradicts his claim that he confirmed the address by telephone, and it appears that counsel has not made reasonable efforts to locate a current address for the clients. Therefore, the court denies the motion to be relieved without prejudice. Before renewing the motion, counsel must make diligent and reasonable efforts to obtain a current address for the clients.
