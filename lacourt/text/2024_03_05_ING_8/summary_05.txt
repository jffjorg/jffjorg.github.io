Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the plaintiffs, Laura and Frank Einsetler, against the defendant, Villa Capri Townhomes Homeowners Association. The plaintiffs sought to compel the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission. The defendant failed to respond to these requests, and the plaintiffs moved to compel a response.

The judge granted the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests, requiring the defendant to serve verified responses to the propounded discovery requests without objections by March 26, 2024. The judge also granted the motion to deem the requests for admission as admitted, with the more severe consequence of deeming the RFAs admitted to be imposed if no verified admissions, denials, or statements of inability to admit or deny are timely served by that date.

The judge also addressed the issue of sanctions, noting that the plaintiffs sought sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $2,880 per motion to compel initial responses and $2,800 for the motion to deem RFAs as admitted. However, the judge found that the declarations supporting the sanctions were conclusory and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the claimed hourly rate. Therefore, the judge continued the hearing on the sanctions issue pending receipt of additional evidence bearing on the claimed hourly rate.
