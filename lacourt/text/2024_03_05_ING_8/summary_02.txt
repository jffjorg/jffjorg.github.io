Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action, which are for recovery of personal property, specific performance, and conversion, respectively. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the contract is unconscionable, which would require a trial to resolve. The defendant has shown that there is evidence of procedural unconscionability, including unequal bargaining positions and lack of negotiation of the terms of the contract. The court also finds that the specific performance cause of action rests on a term of the contract that may be unconscionable. The trial date is set for April 2, 2024.
