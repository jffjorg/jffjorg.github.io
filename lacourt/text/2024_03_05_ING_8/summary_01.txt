```

And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint (FAC) should be argued in court. The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action to the Complaint, but the Judge is concerned about the delay in seeking leave to amend and the potential prejudice to the Defendant. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has known about their claims since February 2021, but has only now sought to amend the Complaint on the eve of trial. The Judge requires oral argument to explain the delay and will consider denying the motion if the Plaintiff has had the supplementary discovery responses for years without seeking to amend the Complaint. If the motion is granted, the trial will likely be postponed again to allow the Defendant time to respond to the new claims.
