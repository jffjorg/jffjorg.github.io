Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Antonio Trujillo. The court sustains the demurrer in part and overrules it in part.

The court sustains the demurrer as to the cause of action for quiet title as to Defendant Trujillo because the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The court overrules the demurrer as to the cause of action for violation of Penal Code § 496 because the complaint alleges that Defendant Trujillo knew or should have known that the property was obtained by unlawful means.

The court sustains the demurrer as to the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress because the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts as to Defendant Trujillo's conduct.

The court denies the request for judicial notice of certain documents because they are outside the scope of the complaint.

The court grants leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
