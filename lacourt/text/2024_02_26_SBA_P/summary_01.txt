And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Bolive, Inc. The reason for this is that the plaintiff failed to provide original, copies, or a declaration explaining the unavailability of a written agreement. The plaintiff has also not provided sufficient evidence to support the claims made in the complaint. The judge has also calculated the interest on the past-due payments and has found that the damages may be made certain by calculation. However, the judge has denied the request for attorney's fees. The hearing date is set for February 26, 2024.
