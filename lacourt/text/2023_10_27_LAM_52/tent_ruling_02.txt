 Case Number:  22STCV37866    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  52 Cross-Defendant Gohar Tsilikyan’s
Motion to Strike the First Amended Cross-Complaint
Cross-defendant
Gohar Tsilikyan, trustee of the Gohar Tsilikyan Living Trust Dated May 1, 2018,
moves to strike the entire first amended cross-complaint filed by cross-complainants
Narek Eric Kazarian and Spectrum Lending, LLC.
Cross-defendant moves to strike the first amended
cross-complaint because it was untimely. 
“The court may dismiss the complaint as to that defendant when: [¶¶] … after
a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff
fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either party moves
for dismissal.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (f)(2).)  Dismissal is not
mandatory as the statute “places the decision within the court’s discretion.”  (Harlan v. Department of Transportation
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 874.)
On September 1, 2023, the court sustained
cross-defendant’s demurrer to the cross-complaint with 20 days’ leave to
amend.  Cross-complainants concede they
did not timely file the first amended cross-complaint.  
The court exercises its discretion not to strike the
first amended cross-complaint.  Doing so
would not serve the interests of justice. 
“[T]he law favors disposing of cases on their merits.”  (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 980.)  Cross-complainants
filed the first amended cross-complaint less than one week after the deadline.  Their delay is excusable and does not warrant
the severe consequence of striking their pleading.  
Cross-defendant Gohar
Tsilikyan’s motion to strike the first amended cross-complaint is denied.
