Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer of defendants Rodeo Realty, Inc. and Betty Galvan to the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action alleged by plaintiff CoriAndre Crane. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike several portions of the first amended complaint, including the prayer for attorney fees and the allegations related to punitive damages.

The judge's ruling is based on the grounds that plaintiff's allegations do not state a cause of action against the defendants, and that the plaintiff failed to disclose sufficient facts to support her claims. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer and motion to strike.
