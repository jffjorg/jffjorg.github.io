  Case Number:  22STCV33976    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff  Century Rooter and Jetting Service, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File Second  Amended Complaint Plaintiff Century Rooter and  Jetting Service, Inc. moves for leave to file a second amended complaint to add  new claims for conversion of additional property. Courts have discretion to permit an amendment  to any pleading “in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper.”  (CCP § 473(a)(1).)  “This discretion  should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy  favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court  (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)   Courts exercise their discretion “liberally to permit amendment,” and  “[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in which  denial of leave to amend can be justified.”   (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,  1428.)   No defendant has opposed this motion.  Permitting the amendment is in the  furtherance of justice.   Plaintiff Century Rooter and  Jetting Service, Inc.’s motion for  leave to file second amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to file the  second amended complaint (attached to as Exhibit A to the declaration of  Stephen Loomis Bucklin) forthwith.
