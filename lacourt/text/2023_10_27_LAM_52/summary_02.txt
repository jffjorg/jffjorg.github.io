And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the first amended cross-complaint filed by cross-complainants Narek Eric Kazarian and Spectrum Lending, LLC. Cross-defendant Gohar Tsilikyan, trustee of the Gohar Tsilikyan Living Trust Dated May 1, 2018, moves to strike the pleading, arguing it was untimely. The court sustained cross-defendant's demurrer to the cross-complaint with 20 days' leave to amend, but cross-complainants failed to file the amended pleading on time. Despite this, the court has exercised its discretion not to strike the first amended cross-complaint, as doing so would not serve the interests of justice. The court has also noted that the law favors disposing of cases on their merits, and cross-complainants filed the amended pleading less than a week after the deadline, which is considered excusable. Therefore, cross-defendant's motion to strike the first amended cross-complaint is denied.
