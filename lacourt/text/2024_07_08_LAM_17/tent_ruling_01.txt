HYUN SOON LEE 
 
        
  vs.
 
FOUAD ASHOUR
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV11632  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: July 17, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion for an OSC re: contempt is GRANTED. 
 
On 5/23/2023,
Plaintiff Hyun Soon Lee (Plaintiff) filed suit against Fouad Ashour and Ashour
Victory Property, LLC, alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) negligence; (4) unjust enrichment;
and (5) fraud and misrepresentation.
 
            Now,
Defendant Ashour Victory Property, LLC (Defendant) moves for order directing
Plaintiff to show cause re: contempt. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
On 3/20/2024,
the Court ordered Lee to pay $1,000.00 in sanctions. Despite four written
requests that she do so, Lee has, as of the date of this filing, not paid those
sanctions. Accordingly, Defendant seeks an OSC re: contempt for Lee’s ongoing
failures to comply with this Court’s order.
 
Plaintiff did
not oppose this motion, and thus is considered to have conceded to the merits
of the motion.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion for an OSC re: contempt is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
