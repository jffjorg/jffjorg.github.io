And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling discusses the scope of expert testimony in a preliminary hearing. The court notes that there are 11 spices at issue, including four types of ground cinnamon, ground cumin, and ground turmeric. The defendants argue that the notice of violation refers to the lots only as exemplars. The court also discusses the use of the geometric mean versus the arithmetic mean in calculating the "maximum" question. The court will need to hear further from both parties on this issue.
