Here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding four petitions to approve compromises for Elonna Bryan, Elijah Bryan, Elizabeth Cordero-Tayton, and Jesse Louis Contreras. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The petitions for the three minor children are granted, as all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied and the settlements are fair and reasonable. The court sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for proof of deposit of funds in blocked accounts for a future date. The petition for Jesse Louis Contreras is continued pending submission of a new proposed order and written consent from the proposed trustee, Michelle Ruiz. The judge requires a bond of $266,000 to be submitted by the trustee and sets a deadline for filing of a notice of commencement of proceedings for a court-supervised trust. The hearing is continued to allow the petitioner to submit the necessary documents.
