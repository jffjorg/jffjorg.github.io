And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff, James Matters, filed a complaint against Bertha Villalobos, Steven Villalobos Cabral, and Does 1 through 50 for motor vehicle negligence. The case was dismissed on January 30, 2023, when no one appeared on the day of trial. The Plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on April 5, 2023, citing his counsel's poor health due to complications from heart surgery and catching Covid-19, which prevented counsel from attending the hearings and resulting in the dismissal.

The Judge finds that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and therefore grants the motion. The Judge sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re dismissal for failure to file proof of service of summons, or, in the alternative, a Trial Setting Conference, for approximately 60 days.
