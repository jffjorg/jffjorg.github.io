Background
On
January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Lester Jimenez (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in
this action against Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved, and
Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability. Plaintiff alleges that he was seriously injured when he fell down a
flight of stairs on a fire escape attached to a building on South Hobart
Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, that is owned, operated, managed, or
controlled by defendants. 
On
March 25, 2022, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved filed an
Answer to the Complaint. On the same day, they filed a Cross-Complaint for
indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief against Roes 1 through 25. 
On
April 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to named Fred Leeds Properties,
an unknown entity, as Doe 1, and Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP as Doe 2.

On
May 3, 2023, Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP, filed an Answer to the
Complaint, on its own behalf and as an entity erroneously named as Fred Leeds
Properties. 
On
July 18, 2023, Plaintiff named Olga Avalos as Doe 3. Defendant Avalos filed an
Answer on August 30. 
On
August 14, 2023, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved amended
their Cross-Complaint to name Sharol Batres as Roe 1. On September 1, they
filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (the “FACC”). The FACC includes, as the
Fourth Cause of Action, a claim against Batres and Roes 2 through 10 for breach
of lease agreement/contract.  Batres
filed an Answer on December 15, 2023.
Currently before
the Court, and set for hearing on March 4, are two motions to compel non-party
witnesses to comply with subpoenas and appear for deposition.  
On November 17,
2023, Defendants 25 Art, LP and Frederick Leeds (collectively “Defendants”)
filed motions to compel nonparties Maria Espinoza (“Espinoza”), Keilani Todd (“Todd”),
and Javier Perez (“Perez”) to comply with subpoenas to provide testimony and
produce documents.  Defendants also seek
sanctions.
No opposition has been filed to any of these
motions.
Legal Standard
“Any party may
obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  The
process by which a party may obtain discovery from a
person who is not a party to the action is through a deposition subpoena.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.010, subd. (b).)  Personal service of the deposition subpoena
on the non-party is required.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (b).)
A motion to compel compliance with a
deposition subpoena must be made within 60 days after completion of the
deposition record, the date objections are served, or the date specified for
production, and be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ.
Proc., §2025.480, subd., (b); Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct.
(Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011, 1032-1033.)¿ 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless
it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Id., § 2025.480, subd. (j).)  
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
A deponent who disobeys a deposition
subpoena may also be punished for contempt without the necessity of a prior
order of the court directing compliance by the witness.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2020.240.)¿
A motion to compel a non-party to answer
questions or produce documents “must be personally served on the nonparty
deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail or
electronic service.”  (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.1346.) 
Discussion
Nonparty Maria Espinoza
On October 15, 2023, Espinoza was personally
served with a deposition subpoena issued by Defendants.  (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  The deposition was noticed for November 6, 2023.  (Ibid.)  Espinoza did not appear; in a conversation
with a paralegal in the office of Defendants’ counsel, she confirmed that she
had been served and that her name was on the subpoena but she denied that she
was the person that Defendants were seeking to depose.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exh. B; Santana Decl., ¶ 4.)
No opposition has been filed.
According to the proof of service filed with
the Court on January 24, 2024, Espinoza was personally served with the motion
to compel and supporting papers on November 22, 2023.
Defendants’ motion to compel as to nonparty Espinoza
is granted.  Defendants have satisfied
all procedural and substantive requirements and have shown good cause for the
production of documents.
Nonparty Keilani Todd
On October 29, 2023, Todd was personally
served with a deposition subpoena issued by Defendants.  (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  The deposition was noticed for November 13,
2023.  (Ibid.)  Todd spoke with Defendants’ counsel and initially
refused to appear for deposition; after discussion with counsel, she relented,
and Todd and counsel selected a mutually agreeable date and time for the
deposition.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-8 &
Exhs. B-C.)  At no time did Todd Defendants
in advance that she would not appear, but she did not appear for her deposition
as scheduled.  (Id., ¶¶ 10-11
& Exh. D.)  
No opposition has been filed.
According to the proof of service filed with
the Court on January 22, 2024, Todd was personally served with the motion to
compel and supporting papers on December 4, 2023.
Defendants’ motion to compel as to nonparty Todd
is granted.  Defendants have satisfied
all procedural and substantive requirements and have shown good cause for the
production of documents.
Nonparty Javier Perez
On September 13, 2023, Perez was personally
served with a deposition subpoena issued by Defendants.  (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  The deposition was noticed for September 22, 2023.  (Ibid.)  Following a discussion between Perez and Defendants’
counsel, both sides agreed to reschedule the deposition for October 13, 2023,
at an agreed upon time and place. (Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.)  Without providing any advance notice, Perez
did not appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-7
& Exh. C.)  Following a further discussion
between Perez and Defendants’ counsel, Perez agreed to appear for his deposition
on November 10, 2023, at an agreed upon time and place. (Id., ¶¶ 8-9 &
Exh. D.)  Again, without providing any
advance notice, Perez did not appear.  (Id.,
¶¶ 10-11 & Exh. E.)  
No opposition has been filed.
According to the proof of service filed with
the Court on January 24, 2024, Perez was personally served with the motion to
compel and supporting papers on December 13, 2023.
Defendants’ motion to compel as to nonparty Perez
is granted.  Defendants have satisfied
all procedural and substantive requirements and have shown good cause for the
production of documents.
Sanctions
Defendants also request an award of monetary sanctions,
citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 1991.1; 1992; 2020.010, subd. (a)(1)
and (b); 2020.240; 2023.010, subd. (d); 2023.020, subd. (a); 2025.440, subd.
(b); and 2025.480, subd. (j).)  
Sections 1991.1; 2020.240; and 2025.440, subdivision
(b) all relate to contempt.  Contempt
proceedings are criminal or quasi-criminal in nature and require substantially
more process than has been provided to the nonparties here.  (This includes issuance of a charging
document that advises the citee of the potential penalties, arraignment, representation
by the public defender’s office if the citee is not able to afford their own
counsel, and a trial at which the charge(s) must be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.)  As the procedures for a determination
of contempt have not been satisfied, the Court cannot and does not hold the
nonparties in contempt.
Section 1992 provides for a separate civil
action to recover a forfeiture and damages. 
Section 2020.010 does not mention sanctions.
Section 2023.010 defines “misuses of the
discovery process” but does not mention sanctions.
Section 2023.020, subdivision (a) does not
exist.  If Defendants intended to refer
to section 2023.030, subdivision (a), that statute does not provide an independent
basis to award sanctions; the sanctions award must be “authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  The Court
of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice Moor, made this very point in City of
Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504 (“sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose
monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery … without regard to any other
provision of the Discovery Act”).  (The
Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City
of Los Angeles case.  The order
granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the
appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor
to be persuasive.)
Finally, section 2025.480, subdivision (j)
does contain an independent authorization for sanctions against any person or
attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel an answer or production.”  Nonparties
have not opposed this motion, and so this sanctions provision does not apply
here.
Accordingly, the requests for sanctions are
denied.
