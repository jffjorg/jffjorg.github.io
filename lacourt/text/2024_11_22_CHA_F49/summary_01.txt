Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies the motion by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon Ginez Monico to deem Plaintiff Aaron Denigris' Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted as moot, since Plaintiff Denigris served verified responses on July 31, 2024, after the motion was filed. The Court grants in part the request for monetary sanctions, ordering Plaintiff Aaron Denigris and his attorney to pay $480.00 to Defendant/Cross-Complainant Monico's counsel within 20 days. The motion was filed on June 11, 2024, seeking to deem the requests admitted and impose monetary sanctions due to Plaintiff Denigris' failure to serve timely responses to the requests.
