BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from alleged injuries sustained by
Plaintiffs in a May 22, 2021, automobile collision. 
 
On May 18, 2023, Plaintiffs Bryan Elias Sanchez (“Sanchez”),
Aaron Denigris (“Denigris”), Darryl Benedict Cassell (“Cassell”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon Ginez
Monico (“Monico”) and Does 1 to 25, alleging: (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and
(2) General Negligence. On June 4, 2024, Plaintiffs substituted Defendant Simon
Ginez-Perez (“Ginez-Perez”) for Doe 1. Subsequently, on February 27, 2024,
Monico filed his Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On the same day, February 27,
2024, Monico filed his Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Sanchez and Roes 1 through 25 for Indemnity, Contribution, and Declaratory
Relief. Sanchez subsequently filed his Answer to the Cross-Complaint on March
29, 2024.
 
On June 11, 2024, Monico filed
the instant Motion to Deem the Requests for Admission, Set One, for Plaintiff
Denigris, Admitted (the “Motion”). Subsequently, on November 6, 2024, Plaintiff
Denigris filed his Opposition to the Motion, and Monico replied on November 14,
2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of
specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission,
the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿
 
If a party to whom requests for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including one based on privilege or
the work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made
serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Monico’s counsel, Robert G. McKeon (“McKeon”), attests that on March 14, 2024, Plaintiff
Denigris was served with the first set of Requests for Admission by email.
(McKeon Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “A.”) The service established that responses were due on
April 17, 2024, including a two-court-day extension provided under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B), which applies to electronic
service. On April 5, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested a three-week extension
to respond to the Requests for Admission, Set One. Monico granted the request,
setting a new due deadline to respond as April 26, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.) Subsequently,
Monico granted two additional extensions to respond, on May 1 and May 23, 2024,
respectively. (Id. ¶¶ 7-9.) The final extension required Denigris to
provide verified responses, without objection, by June 3, 2024. (Id. ¶
9.)  However, as of the date the Motion
was filed, Denigris had not served any responses despite Monico’s multiple extensions
and efforts to meet and confer. (Id. ¶¶ 11-16.) 
 
In the Opposition, Denigris
asserts that verified substantive responses were subsequently served on Monico
on July 31, 2024, rendering the Motion moot. (Opp’n. at p. 3.) In the Reply, Monico
does not dispute that these responses were in substantial compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. 
 
Accordingly, the Court
determines that Denigris has served the untimely responses to the Requests for
Admission, Set One, before the hearing of the Motion.  
 
Denigris further argues that
the Motion must be denied on procedural grounds due to the lack of a separate
statement. (Opp’n. at pp. 4-5.) The Court rejects this argument, noting that Denigris
appears to conflate a motion to deem admitted (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280) with
a motion to compel further responses (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290). These are
distinct motions, and the requirement for a separate statement applies only to
the latter. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1).) Accordingly, the
Court finds Denigris’s argument on this ground to be without merit. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court DENIES the Motion as Moot, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (c).
 
The sole remaining issue pertains
to Monico’s request for monetary sanctions. 
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case, as Plaintiff Denigris failed to serve a timely response
before the Motion was filed. The Court determines that the total and reasonable
amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in
connection with the Motion is $480.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly
rate of $210.00 for 2 hours reasonably performed, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Monico’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon Ginez Monico’s Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, for Plaintiff Aaron Denigris, Admitted
is DENIED AS MOOT.
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon
Ginez Monico’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff Aaron Denigris and his attorney of record are
ordered to jointly and severally pay $480.00 to Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon Ginez Monico’s counsel within 20 days.
