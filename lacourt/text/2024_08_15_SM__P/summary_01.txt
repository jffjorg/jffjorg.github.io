And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to enforce a settlement that resolved an unlawful detainer (UD) case. The settlement required a large payment in January 2024, followed by additional payments each month starting in July 2024. Although it is unclear if the original payment was made, the court assumes it was, based on a previous motion to enforce that was withdrawn in April 2024. The court finds that there is no urgency demonstrated to justify a hearing on less than three weeks' notice, and warns the defendant that if the motion is granted, eviction may follow immediately.
