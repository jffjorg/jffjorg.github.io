  Case Number:  23SMCV05520    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  P The application is DENIED. 
This is a motion to enforce a settlement that resolved a UD case.  The settlement required a large payment in
January 2024, and then additional payments each month starting in July until
the total judgment is paid.  The court
assumes the original payment was made, although it is unclear.  The court gleans this because there was a
motion to enforce brought in April of this year that was withdrawn.  The most likely explanation is that the
potential non-payment was cured.
 
Right now, the motion to compel would be heard on less than
3 weeks’ notice.  While the court is
sensitive to the priority given to UD cases, it seems that the urgency is not
demonstrated.  The court warns defendant,
though, that if the motion is granted, it could well be that eviction follows
immediately (or as soon as the Sheriff enforces the writ of possession).
