Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction in part, enjoining the HOA from foreclosing on Perlman's property to collect special assessments during the pendency of the consolidated actions. The judge finds that Perlman has demonstrated a likelihood of suffering irreparable harm if the injunction is denied, including the loss of her home to foreclosure. The judge also finds that Perlman has a reasonable probability of establishing that the HOA violated the CC&Rs by issuing the second special assessment allocated according to an unrecorded and therefore invalid amendment. The judge concludes that the HOA has forfeited its right to an undertaking because it failed to specify what damages it would incur by reason of the injunction's delay. The judge orders Perlman to prepare and lodge a proposed order in conformance with the ruling on or before July 30, 2024.
