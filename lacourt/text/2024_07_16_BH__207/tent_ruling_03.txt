MOTION
 
            On December 29, 2023, Defendant Sam
Ostayan (“Defendant”) filed a Notice of Omnibus Motion to Quah Deposition
Subpoenas for Production of Business Records to Attorney Lender Services, Inc.;
Total Lender Solutions, Inc.; S.B.S. Lien Services; Mortgage Lender Services;
Integrated Lender Services, Inc.; First American Title Insurance Co.; and Clear
Recon Corp.  
 
            On February 14, 2024, Defendant
filed an Amended Notice of Omnibus Motion, and on March 20, 2024, Defendant
filed a Second Amended Notice of Omnibus Motion.  Although the notices all purport to be based
on the memorandum of points and authorities, declaration of Katherine K.
Meleski, no such memorandum of points and authorities or declaration appears in
the Court’s record.  The motion is
unopposed.
 
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 
            Foremost, Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005 requires that “[a]ll moving and supporting papers shall be filed
and served at least 16 court days before the hearing.  The moving and supporting papers served shall
be a copy of the papers filed or to be filed with the court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b); see also
Code Civ. Proc., § 1010; Cal;. Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a) [“the papers
filed in support of a motion must consist of at least the following:  . . . 
A memorandum in support of the motion or demurrer”].)  Here, Defendant failed to file and serve a
memorandum of points and authorities.  As
such, the Court finds that the motion is not meritorious.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a) [“A
party filing a motion, except for a motion listed in rule 3.1114, must serve
and file a supporting memorandum. The court may construe the absence of a
memorandum as an admission that the motion or special demurrer is not
meritorious and cause for its denial and, in the case of a demurrer, as a
waiver of all grounds not supported”].)  
 
            Further, because Defendant failed to
file supporting papers including a declaration, Defendant’s motion does not
satisfy the requisite procedural requirements to demonstrate that the parties
met and conferred.  Further, because
there is no separate statement outlining the requested discovery, the Court
cannot make a determination as to whether Defendant’s motion to quash is
righteous and should be granted.  (See
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 [requiring separate statement for
discovery motions].)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion
is denied on procedural grounds for failure to file and serve supporting
papers, including a memorandum of points and authorities, a declaration, and a
separate statement.
 
Defendant shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
