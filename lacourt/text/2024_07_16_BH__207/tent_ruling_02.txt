to Vacate Judgment

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
OPPOSING PARTY   none
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 7, 2021, Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint for damages against Defendant Inna Kostina (“Defendant”).  Default was entered against Defendant on
August 31, 2021, and default judgment was entered against Defendant on December
11, 2021.  
 
Plaintiff now moves to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case
without prejudice because Defendant has submitted a fraud claim under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 473 and 128.  The
motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD – SECTION 473 RELIEF
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
Code of Civil procedure section 473 “includes a discretionary
provision, which applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies
as of right.” (Minick v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25
(hereafter Minick).)  “Section 473
is a remedial statute to be “applied liberally” in favor of relief if the
opposing party will not suffer prejudice. 
Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any
doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief from default.  Unless inexcusable
neglect is clear, the policy favoring trial on the merits prevails.”  (Minick, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 24
[cleaned up].)  
 
The mandatory provision of section 473, subd. (b) requires “an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect[.]”  Otherwise, relief
under section 473 is discretionary.  
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than
six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v.
The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Ca.App.4th 712, 721 [motion
for relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no
case exceeding six months”]).  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
“However, in the case of a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding determining the ownership or
right to possession of real or personal property, without extending the
six-month period, when a notice in writing is personally served within the State
of California both upon the party against whom the judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding has been taken, and upon his or her attorney of record, if
any, notifying that party and his or her attorney of record, if any, that the
order, judgment, dismissal, or other proceeding was taken against him or her
and that any rights the party has to apply for relief under the provisions of
Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall expire 90 days after service
of the notice”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
With regard to timing, judgment was entered on December 11, 2021, yet
Plaintiff did not move to vacate the judgment until May 30, 2024, long after
the requisite six months in which Plaintiff may bring the motion.  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
Further, the motion is not supported by any declaration or affidavit
of fault.  Therefore, the Court cannot
grant Plaintiff the requested relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.  
 
Moreover, the Court does not find Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8) to provide a legal basis to vacate the Judgment which was
entered on the request of Plaintiff, especially when Plaintiff has not
submitted any evidence in support of the motion.    
 
Conclusion
 
            Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the judgment entered against Defendant on December
11, 2021.   The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of
the Court’ ruling.
