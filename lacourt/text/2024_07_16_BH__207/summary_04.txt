And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Fidelity National Home Warranty, Inc. dba FNHW's motion to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Ian Herzog for declaratory relief. The cross-complaint seeks to limit FNHW's liability to Plaintiff to a maximum of $1500. Plaintiff had opposed the motion, arguing that declaratory relief is not available where the cause of action for breach of contract has already matured. However, the judge has ruled that the legislative mandate to liberally construe requests for leave to avoid forfeiture of causes of action requires granting the motion. The judge has ordered FNHW to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint on or before July 30, 2024, and to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with proof of service forthwith.
