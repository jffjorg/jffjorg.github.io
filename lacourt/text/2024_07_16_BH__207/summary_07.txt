And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to quash service of summons filed by defendants Lajos Gerbino and Edith Molnar in an unlawful detainer action brought by Silver Block Holding Company, LLC. The defendants argue that the service of summons was incomplete because only the first page of the complaint was left with one person. The plaintiff had previously applied for an order to serve the summons by posting, which was granted on June 13, 2024. The defendants filed their motion on June 14, 2024, but have not yet filed an opposition. The court finds that the defendants' proof of service is faulty and continues the hearing on the motion to September 23, 2024. The defendants must provide notice of the motion and continued hearing by July 26, 2024, and file a proof of service with the court by August 9, 2024.
