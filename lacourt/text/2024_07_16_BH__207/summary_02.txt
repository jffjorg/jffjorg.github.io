And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment entered against the defendant on December 11, 2021. The plaintiff, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., filed a complaint against the defendant, Inna Kostina, and default judgment was entered against Kostina. The plaintiff now moves to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case without prejudice, claiming that Kostina has submitted a fraud claim under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 128. However, the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the judgment was entered, and the plaintiff did not provide a declaration or affidavit of fault to support the motion. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not submitted any evidence in support of the motion and that the judgment was entered on the request of the plaintiff.
