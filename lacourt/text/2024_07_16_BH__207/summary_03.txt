And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash third-party subpoenas. The motion was filed on December 29, 2023, and amended on February 14, 2024, and March 20, 2024. The defendant failed to file supporting papers, including a memorandum of points and authorities, a declaration, and a separate statement outlining the requested discovery. As a result, the court finds that the motion is not meritorious and does not satisfy the procedural requirements to demonstrate that the parties met and conferred. The court cannot make a determination as to whether the defendant's motion to quash is righteous and should be granted. The defendant is ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
