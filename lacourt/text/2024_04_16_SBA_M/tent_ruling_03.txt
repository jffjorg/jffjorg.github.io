23TRCV02039
1.     
Jade Johnson’s Motion
to Compel Defendant First Christian Church of Inglewood’s Responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set Two
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Jade Johnson’s Motion to Compel Defendant First
Christian Church of Inglewood’s Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two is granted. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on June 23, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. On or about 1999-2000, Plaintiff was
sexually assaulted by an employee of Defendant.
 
Motion to
Compel
 
CCP § 2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(b)).
 
Plaintiff served upon Defendant Request for Production
of Documents, Set Two, on December 19, 2023. (Decl., Susan Ulrich, ¶¶ 3-4.)  Plaintiff contends that no responses were
served to the requests.  (Id.)  Defendant filed a written opposition.  Interestingly, while set forth as an
opposition, Defendant admits that no responses have been served.  (Decl., Michelle A. Hancock.)
 
Therefore, the motion to compel responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set Two, is granted.  Defendant is ordered to serve verified
responses, without objections, within 10 days of this date. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
