And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that PNC Bank, N.A.'s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is sustained. The court finds that there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action, and therefore, the action must be stayed pending the disposition of the earlier action. The court grants defendant's motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint, as it is deemed moot upon the sustaining of the demurrer. The court orders the parties to show cause why the stay should not be lifted.
