TENTATIVE RULING
 
PNC Bank, N.A.’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
is sustained.
 
The grounds for sustaining the demurrer support a
complete stay of the action for reasons noted below. 
 
PNC Bank, N.A.’s Motion to Strike Portions of First
Amended Complaint is moot. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on March 17, 2023.
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint was filed on April 20, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff Zula Tucker Living Trust Dated September
15, 2006, Fred Tucker, Trustee (“Tucker”) purchased the subject property in
1988.  Plaintiff contends that he was overcharged
interest by Defendants.  Plaintiff
believes that rather than being in default on the loan, he is owed nearly
$45,000.00.  In the Complaint, Plaintiff
alleged a sole cause of action for “Breach of Contract by Wrongful
Foreclosure.” The First Amended Complaint alleged: 1. Wrongful Foreclosure; 2.
Fraudulent Concealment; 3. Accounting; 4. Financial Elder Abuse; 5. Breach of
the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) and (h). 
 
Meet and Confer
             
Defendant filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Decl., Libby Wong.) 
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to the entire FAC and each cause of
action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(c) and (e). CCP § 430.10(c) states: “There is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.”  CCP § 430.10(e) states: “The pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”
 
Upon the face of the matters alleged in the First
Amended Complaint and upon matters to which this Court may properly take
judicial notice, there are sufficient grounds for sustaining the demurrer
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(c). The Court determines
that “[t]here is another action pending between the same parties on the same
cause of action.”  CCP § 430.10(c). 
 
“Although the rule of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction is similar in effect to the statutory plea in abatement, it has
been interpreted and applied more expansively, and therefore may apply where
the narrow grounds required for a statutory plea [in] abatement do not exist.
[Citation.] Unlike the statutory plea [in] abatement, the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction does not require absolute identity of parties, causes
of action or remedies sought in the initial and subsequent actions.
[Citations.] If the court exercising original jurisdiction has the power to
bring before it all the necessary parties, the fact that the parties in the
second action are not identical does not preclude application of the rule.
Moreover, the remedies sought in the separate actions need not be precisely the
same so long as the court exercising original jurisdiction has the power to
litigate all the issues and grant all the relief to which any of the parties
might be entitled under the pleadings. [¶] An order of abatement issues as a
matter of right [i.e., mandatory] not as a matter of discretion [i.e.,
discretionary] where the conditions for its issuance exist. This is the case
whether a right to abatement exists under the statutory plea in abatement [. .
.] or the judicial rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction. Where abatement
is required, the second action should be stayed, not dismissed.”  People ex rel. Garamendi v. American
Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770–771 (internal citations and
quotations omitted).
 
Here, Defendant has established that there is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause(s) of action.  The Court takes judicial notice of Case Number
YC070538 - Zula Tucker Living Trust Dated September 15, 2006 v. PNC Mortgage,
filed by Plaintiff on April 17, 2015. The statutory requirements of section
430.10(c) have been established. The parties are the same in that action and
the instant action. The causes of action alleged in the instant action arise
out of the same transactions as Case Number YC070538. The operative Fifth
Amended Complaint in Case Number YC070538 contains a sole cause of action for Breach
of Contract by Wrongful Foreclosure. This cause of action virtually is
identical to the first cause of action of the instant action. Case Number
YC070538 is currently subject to an appeal. 
 
Thus, since there is a prior pending action between
the parties involving the same cause of action and arising out of the same
transaction and/or occurrences, this action must be stayed pending disposition
of the earlier action. “The rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction may
constitute a ground for abatement of the subsequent action. An order of
abatement issues as a matter of right not as a matter of discretion where the
conditions for its issuance exist. [. . .] Where a demurrer is sustained on the
ground of another action pending, the proper order is not a dismissal, but
abatement of further proceedings pending termination of the first action.” Plant
Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787-88
(internal citations and quotations omitted). 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s demurrer is sustained pursuant
to CCP § 430.10(c).
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is deemed moot upon the
sustaining of the demurrer. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is
sustained. 
 
The Court hereby stays the action in its entirety.
 
An Order to Show Cause Re: Status of Stay is set for
______________.
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
