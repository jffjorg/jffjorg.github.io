And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled, and the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint is denied. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and concealment were sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also rejected the defendant's argument that the economic loss rule barred the plaintiff's cause of action for fraudulent inducement by concealment. The court noted that the California Supreme Court has accepted a petition for review in a related case, Dhital v. Nissan North America, and has deferred further action until the case is resolved. The court ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer within 10 days of the ruling.
