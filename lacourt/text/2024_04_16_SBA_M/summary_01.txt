And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling denying Plaintiff Nicolle Arroyo's motion for reconsideration of the September 5, 2023 order granting Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The Judge finds that Plaintiff fails to provide new facts, circumstances, or law to warrant reconsideration of the prior order. The Court notes that Plaintiff's purported new law, Murrey v. Superior Court (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1223, was not new law at the time of the hearing and that Plaintiff's counsel simply neglected to make additional arguments in its opposition and oral argument. The Court also finds that Plaintiff fails to provide a valid explanation for not presenting new information earlier. The Court further notes that Plaintiff's motion does not address the procedural unconscionability component that must exist to invalidate an arbitration agreement.
