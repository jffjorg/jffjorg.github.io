And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is related to a lawsuit filed by Sokolow against Rexford Flats, LLC and others, alleging that Mehrdad, a real estate agent or property manager, entered her apartment without permission, causing her dog to escape and be struck by a car. The defendants, Power Brokers, Beverly Hills Fine Homes, and Arbid, demurred to the complaint, arguing that they owed Sokolow no duty of care. The court overruled their demurrer as to Power Brokers and Arbid, but sustained it as to Beverly Hills Fine Homes.

Rexford Flats and Rexford 52 also demurred to the complaint, arguing that Sokolow did not adequately allege negligence or vicarious liability. The court overruled their demurrer, finding that Sokolow had pleaded sufficient facts to support a cause of action.

The court also ruled on several motions to strike, including Rexford's motion to strike special and punitive damages. The court granted the motion to strike emotional distress damages, finding that Sokolow did not adequately allege intentional injury to the dog. However, the court denied the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that Sokolow had adequately alleged gross negligence on Mehrdad's part.

The court gave Sokolow ten days to amend her complaint as to Beverly Hills Fine Homes and as to the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention cause of action.
