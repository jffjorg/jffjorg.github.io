  Case Number:  23CHCV03420    Hearing Date:   August 5, 2024    Dept:  F51  AUGUST 2,  2024    DEMURRER  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV03420    Demurrer filed: 1/22/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Duane Roberts; and Steve  Garnock (collectively, “Defendants”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff  Electronic Health Plans, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: Defendants  demur to Plaintiff’s entire complaint.   TENTATIVE RULING: The demurrer is overruled.  Defendants to file their answers to Plaintiff’s complaint within 20 days.   BACKGROUND    This action  involves Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendants, two former executive officers  of the corporate Plaintiff, embezzled “from the company for their own benefit  and for the benefit of Garnock’s family member.” (Compl. ¶ 1.)   On 11/6/23,  Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendants, alleging the following causes  of action: (1) Conversion (Embezzlement); (2) Unjust Enrichment; (3) Receipt of  Stolen Funds (California Penal Code Section 496(a)); (4) Monies Had and  Received; (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against Roberts); and (6) Breach of  Fiduciary Duty (against Garnock).   On 1/22/24,  Defendants filed the instant demurrer. On 7/24/24, Plaintiff filed its  opposition thereto. On 7/29/24, Defendants filed their reply.   ANALYSIS   As a general matter, a party may respond to a pleading  against it by demurrer on the basis of any single or combination of eight  enumerated grounds, including that “the pleading does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the  pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.  (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)   “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence  or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153  Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the  complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The  only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,  states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,  747.)   Here, Defendants  demur to the entire complaint on the basis that it is barred by the applicable  statutes of limitation, and that Plaintiff fails¿to allege facts sufficient to  state its first, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action.   A.    Meet-and-Confer   Before filing its demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet  and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that  is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can  be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a).) The demurring party must file and  serve a meet and confer declaration stating either: “(A) The means by which the  demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject  to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the  objections raised in the demurrer;” or “(B) That the party who filed the  pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request  of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.” (Id.  at subd. (a)(3).)   Here, Defendants’ counsel declares that on 1/10/24, he sent  Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter discussing the issues raised in  the instant demurrer. (Decl. of Craig A. Hansen, ¶ 4.) On 1/15/24, counsel for  the parties met and conferred telephonically, but were unable to resolve the  issues set forth below. (Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court finds that  counsel has satisfied the meet and confer requirements set forth in Code of  Civil Procedure section 430.41.   B.      Statute of Limitations   Here, Defendants  argue that Plaintiff’s entire complaint is time-barred by the applicable  statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for an action for theft is  three years. (Code Civ. Proc. § 338, subd. (c)(1).) “Generally speaking, a  cause of action accrues at the time when the cause of action is complete with  all of its elements. … An important exception to the general rule of accrual is  the ‘discovery rule,’ which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the  plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.” (Fox  v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806–807 [quotations  and citations omitted].) “In order to rely on the discovery rule for delayed  accrual of a cause of action, ‘[a] plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face  that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must  specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2)  the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.’”  (Id. at 808.)   Plaintiff’s  complaint alleges that between 2018 and 2021, Defendants wrongfully raised  their own salaries, and that of Garnock’s relative (who was also Plaintiff’s  employee), without Plaintiff’s knowledge or authorization. (Compl. ¶¶ 29–50.)  Plaintiff further alleges that in 2023, Defendants wrongfully obtained  additional corporate funds. (Id. at ¶¶ 57–72.) “In June 2023, the Board  first learned about the payments by Garnock and Roberts to themselves and to  the Relative in 2023. Thereafter, the Board engaged in a more thorough review  of financial records and discovered the full extent of the increases in  compensation by Garnock and Roberts for themselves and for the Relative between  2018 and 2021.” (Id. at ¶¶ 73–74.)   Here,  Defendants argue that “the Complaint conspicuously fails to plead facts  necessary to invoke the discovery rule.” (Dem. 7:20–21, citing Compl. ¶¶ 81,  82, 89, 90, 94, 95, 101, 102, 109, and 114.) Specifically, Defendants contend  that “the Complaint says nothing about any diligence, or the ‘inability to have  made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.’” (Id. at 9:18–19.)  Defendants further argue that “the facts related to what reviews were  undertaken, when, and by whom are not pled anywhere in the Complaint, beyond  the bare, conclusory assertions in paragraphs 74-76. In addition, facts related  to who, what, where, when and how the Board discovered any extent of the  alleged increases in compensation and unauthorized payments are not set out  anywhere in Complaint, let alone ‘specifically.’” (Id. at 9:20–24.)   Plaintiff  argues in opposition that “the Demurrer completely ignores the breadth of EHP’s  specific allegations and instead attempts to impose a more stringent pleading  requirement that finds no support in law, suggesting, for example, that EHP was  required to actually mention the words ‘reasonable diligence’ in the Complaint  and to plead seemingly every possible fact related to its allegations,  including even a specific accounting of what financial records were or were not  exclusively in Garnock’s control.” (Pl.’s Opp. 11:6–10.) “As to EHP’s inability  to have made earlier discovery of Roberts and Garnock’s 2018 through 2020  compensation increases, despite reasonable diligence, the Complaint alleges  that Roberts and Garnock failed to inform and seek the requisite approval of  EHP’s Board for these increases as was required under Section 10 of EHP’s  bylaws, and that EHP had no knowledge of the unauthorized compensation  increases. … Furthermore, the Complaint also alleges that Roberts and Garnock  used their positions of power as CEO and CFO of EHP to shield EHP’s discovery  of all their embezzlement, and that Garnock controlled EHP’s bank accounts and  records, payroll records, financial statements, and other confidential  financial information.” (Id. at 10:20–27, citing Compl. ¶¶ 2, 25–26, 39–41.)   Defendants  maintain in reply that “specific facts as to EHP’s ‘reasonable diligence’ and  ‘inability to have made earlier discovery’ are not pled at all in the  Complaint, and certainly not with the required specificity. (Defs.’ Reply  3:25–27.) “EHP says nothing about its alleged inability to have made earlier  discovery before November 2021, or that it acted with reasonable diligence in  that time.” (Id. at 4:4–5.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that  Defendants’ otherwise time-barred conduct did not accrue until June 2023, when Plaintiff  first learned about the unauthorized payments made by Defendants. (Compl. ¶¶ 73–76.)  The Court finds it sufficient that Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants had  superior and/or exclusive knowledge of the company’s financial information  until Plaintiff’s discovery of the alleged misconduct in June 2023. (Id. at  ¶¶ 25, 77–79.) As Plaintiff filed this action on 11/6/23, within three years of  June 2023, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s complaint is not time-barred by the  applicable statute of limitations. Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled on  this ground.   C.     First, Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action   Plaintiff’s  first cause of action alleges Conversion against Defendants, and its fifth and  sixth causes of action allege Breach of Fiduciary Duty against each defendant.  Here, Defendants argue that each of these causes of action are subject to the  heightened pleading standard for fraud causes of action. Fairness requires that  allegations of fraud be pled “with particularity” so that the court can weed  out nonmeritorious actions before a defendant is required to answer. (Small  v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) The particularity  requirement necessitates pleading facts that “show how, when, where, to whom,  and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior  Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)   “Conversion  is generally described as the wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal  property of another.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp.  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “The elements of a conversion claim are: (1)  the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the  defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and  (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) It is not  necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary  to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the  alleged converter has applied the property to his or her own use. (Oakdale  Village Group v. Fong (1996) 43 Cal. App. 4th 539, 544.) “The elements of a  cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary  relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.” (Oasis West Realty,  LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.)   Here,  Defendants argue the causes of action are subject to demurrer because they are  not pled with the adequate particularity required for fraud. (Dem. 12:2–3.)  Specifically, Defendants argue that “the alleged ‘shield[ing]’ and ‘concealing,’  when and how that happened, and how Defendants allegedly ‘used their positions  of power’ and ‘position of trust’ are not pled at all in the Complaint, let  alone with the required specificity required to allege fraudulent conduct.” (Id.  at 13:3–5, citing Compl. ¶¶ 2, 87.)   Plaintiff  argues in opposition that the heightened particularity standard for alleging fraud  causes of action is inapplicable here, as “Defendants have cited no case law by  which the Court should impose an element of scienter or other attributes of a  fraud cause of action to the straightforward causes of action of conversion or  breach of fiduciary duty alleged in the Complaint. Thus, the heightened  pleading standard that applies to causes of action for fraud does not apply to  these causes of action, and Defendants’ attempts to argue otherwise lack  merit.” (Pl.’s Opp. 12:2–6.)   In reply,  Defendants highlight Plaintiff’s use of the word “fraudulent” in paragraphs 87,  111, 116 as it relates to Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. (Defs.’  Reply 6:9–25.) The Court agrees with Plaintiff, and declines Defendants’  invitation to accept this interpretation of Plaintiff’s first, fifth, and sixth  causes of action for Conversion and Breach of Fiduciary Duty. Based on the  foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s first,  fifth, and sixth causes of action are subject to the heightened pleading  standard for fraud causes of action is without merit. Accordingly, the demurrer  against Plaintiff’s first, fifth, and sixth causes of action is overruled.   D.     Third Cause of Action   Plaintiff’s  third cause of action alleges Receipt of Stolen Funds against Defendants, in  violation of Penal Code section 496. Under the statute, any person who has been  injured by the defendant’s receiving or buying property “that has been obtained  in any manner constituting theft” “may bring an action for three times the  amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit,  and reasonable attorney's fees.” (Pen. Code § 496, subds. (a), (c).)   Here,  Defendants argue that “although the Complaint asserts in generic terms that  ‘[t]his action arises out of the intentional actions of Roberts and Garnock to  abuse their executive positions of trust at EHP to embezzle from the company  for their own benefit and for the benefit of Garnock’s family member’ … the  specific allegations do not allege a criminal intent, as required for a  violation of Penal Code section 496.” (Dem. 13:22–26.) Specifically, Defendants  argue that “nowhere in the Complaint is there an allegation that Defendants  intended to steal or commit theft, such that the monies actually consist of  stolen property, as required for liability under Penal Code 496(a).” (Id.  at 14:17–20, citing Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13  Cal.5th 333, 361–362; Finton Construction, Inc. v. Bidna & Keys, APLC  (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 200, 213.)   “To prove  theft, a plaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant  beyond ‘mere proof of nonperformance or actual falsity.’” (Siry, 13  Cal.5th at 361–362.) The Siry court elaborated that “if  misrepresentations or unfulfilled promises are made innocently or  inadvertently, they can no more form the basis for a prosecution for obtaining  property by false pretenses than can an innocent breach of contract. … In this  case, the record appears consistent with a conclusion that defendants acted not  innocently or inadvertently, but with careful planning and deliberation  reflecting the requisite criminal intent.” (Id. at 362 [internal  quotations and citations omitted].)   The Court  notes that the Siry case did not involve the sufficiency of the factual  allegations of the pleadings, but the recovery of treble damages and attorney  fees upon judgment in the plaintiff’s favor. (Id. at 339–342.) Here, as  Plaintiff argues, “the only knowledge element EHP was required to allege—and  did indeed allege—was that Roberts and Garnock knew that the funds they  received, concealed or withheld were stolen.” (Pl.’s Opp 12:22–23, citing  Compl. ¶¶ 96–98, Finton Construction, 238 Cal.App.4th at 213.)   The Court  agrees, and further finds that Plaintiff’s factual allegations, taken as a  whole, state that Defendants wrongfully diverted corporate funds to themselves  and another employee without the Board’s knowledge or authorization, which the  Court cannot infer as innocent or inadvertent. (Compl. ¶¶ 29–72; Siry,  13 Cal.5th at 361–362.) Moreover, Defendants’ requisite “criminal intent” is a  question of fact that the Court declines to reach at the pleading stage. (Beckwith  v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1061.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496.  Accordingly, the demurrer against Plaintiff’s third cause of action is  overruled.   CONCLUSION    The demurrer is overruled. Defendants to file their answers  to Plaintiff’s complaint within 20 days.
