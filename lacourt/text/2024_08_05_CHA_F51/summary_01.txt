Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants is overruled. The defendants are required to file their answers to the plaintiff's complaint within 20 days. The plaintiff, Electronic Health Plans, Inc., alleges that the defendants, Duane Roberts and Steve Garnock, embezzled funds from the company. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint is time-barred by the statute of limitations, but the judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the defendants' conduct did not accrue until June 2023, when the plaintiff first learned about the alleged misconduct. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's factual allegations state that the defendants wrongfully diverted corporate funds to themselves and another employee without the Board's knowledge or authorization, which constitutes a cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496.
