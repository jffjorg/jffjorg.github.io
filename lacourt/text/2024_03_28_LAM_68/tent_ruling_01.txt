On
November 4, 2005, Plaintiffs Alvin and Judith Williams filed a complaint for
Breach of Express Warranty/Statutory Duty, and Breach of Implied Warranty,
against Bentley Motors, Inc and Rusnak Pasadena. On August 15, 2007, the court
issued a statement of decision following a bench trial finding in favor of
Defendants on the second cause of action for Breach of Implied Warranty. On
September 2, 2008, the court entered judgment in favor of Rusnak/Pasadena dba
Bentley Pasadena (Rusnak).
 
On
April 27, 2009, Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiffs and against Bentley
Motors, Inc., whereby Plaintiffs were ordered to either return the vehicle for
a reimbursement from Bentley Motors, Inc., or pay $244,143 if Plaintiffs
elected to retain the vehicle. The court denied the motion for new trial on
June 26, 2009. On December 24, 2009, the court denied the motion to tax costs,
thereby allowing Rusnak to recover $2,327.24.
 
Plaintiffs
appealed the judgment. The judgment was affirmed in full on February 3, 2012
(remittitur filed on April 6, 2012).
 
On
October 1, 2013, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration.
Plaintiffs subsequently filed 170.6 challenges against Judge Mooney on February
25, 2015, which were rejected on March 3, 2015. On October 1, 2015, Plaintiffs
filed 1170.6 challenges against Judge Borenstein, which were accepted on
October 2, 2015, thereby leading to assignment in to Judge Wintkow. On October
15, 2015, Judge Mooney rejected new 170.6 challenges. 
 
On
December 31, 2014, Plaintiffs in pro per filed a 200-paragraph complaint, with
an additional 117 pages of exhibits (PC056141) for Fraud upon the Court arising
from the judgment in the instant action. On May 5, 2015 and again on September
4, 2015, the court declared Plaintiffs vexatious litigants, thereby barring
them from filing any new actions in the superior court without obtaining
pre-filing leave of court. Also on May 5, 2015, the court issued prefiling
orders for Plaintiffs to proceed with the action. The action was later
dismissed.
 
Meanwhile,
back on the original action, Department 1 denied Plaintiffs motion for nunc pro
tunc entry of judgment on November 5, 2015. On March 10, 2016, the court denied
Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, entry of sister state judgment, and
prefiling leave to file a new complaint. On Aril 14, 2016, the court again
denied Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, and set an OSC re: Sanctions. On
May 19, 2016, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motions to vacate judgment and
reconsideration. The court also sanctioned Plaintiffs $3,000 ($1,500 per
party). On June 14, 2016, the court denied the motion to quash the sanctions
order. On August 4, 2016, the court denied the motion to vacate sanctions, and
set another sanctions hearing. On September 16, 2016, the ocurt imposed an
additional $2,000 in sanctions ($1,000 each). 
 
On
October 4, 2017, November 2, 2017, and December 14, 2017, the court again
denied Plaintiffs’ motions for leave to file an amended complaint in PC056141,
to enter judgment, motion to vacate sanctions, and motion to enter a nunc pro
tunc judgment. On January 18, 2018, Plaintiffs were again sanctioned $3,000. On
January 28, 3019, the court denied Plantiffs’ motion to vacate the vexatious
litigant designation, provide leave for a pre-filing order, and grant leave to
file an amended judgment. On November 4, 2020, and May 27, 2022, the court
denied Plaintiffs’ motions to vacate the judgment and file new litigation. On
June 21, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a third 170.6 challenge against Judge Mooney,
which was denied. On September 1, 2023, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion to
amend judgment. On September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed 170.6 challenges to
Judge Stern, which was also denied. 
 
Plaintiffs
bring another set of motions for removal from the vexatious litigant list. The
court considers both applications in this order. The court reviews the rules
applicable to vexatious litigants. 

(a) A vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order under Section 391.7
may file an application to vacate the prefiling order and remove his or her
name from the Judicial Council’s list of vexatious litigants subject to
prefiling orders. The application shall be filed in the court that entered the
prefiling order, either in the action in which the prefiling order was entered
or in conjunction with a request to the presiding justice or presiding judge to
file new litigation under Section 391.7. The application shall be made before
the justice or judge who entered the order, if that justice or judge is
available. If that justice or judge who entered the order is not available, the
application shall be made before the presiding justice or presiding judge, or
his or her designee.
(b) A vexatious litigant whose application under
subdivision (a) was denied shall not be permitted to file another application
on or before 12 months has elapsed after the date of the denial of the previous
application.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 391.8, subds. (a-b).)
 
“The
clerk may not file any litigation presented by a vexatious litigant subject to
a prefiling order unless the vexatious litigant first obtains an order from the
… presiding judge permitting the filing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.7, subd. (c).)
For purposes of this section, ‘litigation’
includes any petition, application, or motion…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
391.7, subd. (d).) 
 
The
last motion heard by the court was on a motion to amend the judgment on
September 1, 2023. The motion was denied the motion on the merits. Since the
prior court declined to address the vexatious litigant rules, the court
declines to find the subject motion itself constituted an earlier motion to
seek relief, and therefore a violation of the rule regarding a renewed
application less than 12 months from the prior rejection. Any prior motion for
removal from the vexatious litigant designation list was more than 12 months
prior to the subject hearing.
 
As
for the subject motion, Plaintiffs continue to challenge the prior cases,
including claims of collusion by the former judicial officer among others.
Plaintiffs also maintain the vexatious litigant classification constitutes a
defamatory designation.
 
Bentley
Motors, Inc. and Rusnak/Pasadena filed oppositions to the motions reiterates
the extensive history and repeated efforts to relitigate the action following
the 2009 judgment. Defendants next maintain the motion is both jurisdictionally
barred and premature. Defendants also acknowledge the November 4, 2020,
excusive Defendants from responding to said motions, but filed a response in
“an abundance of caution.” 
 
Alvin
and Judith Williams in reply reiterate the corrupt practices and racketeering
allegations against defendants.
 
The
court finds no basis for Plaintiffs to vacate the underlying judgment, bring a
new action, or justify removal from the vexatious litigant list. Plaintiffs
admit to challenging the judgment and action for past 20 years in various trial
courts and with the Second Appellate District. The court therefore orders that
Plaintiffs remain barred from any new filing with the court on any case or
claim. Plaintiffs will also remain on the vexatious litigant list. Plaintiffs
may file a renewed application for removal from the vexatious litigant list one
year from the date of this order. 
 
If Plaintiffs violate this order
in filing ANY new motions within one year from the date of this order, a new
hearing for sanctions will be set for each and every violation. Continuous and systematic challenge to the prior judgment and
violation of the order barring more than one application for removal from the
vexatious litigant list constitutes a basis for the imposition of sanctions.
Sanctions may be imposed even after judgment has been entered in a case. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5; See e.g. Day v. Collingwood (2006)
144 Cal. App. 4th 1116, 1125-26.) 
 
Accordingly, the court sets an OSC re: Sanctions for the March 19,
2024 filed and April 15, 2024, scheduled Hearing on Writ of Execution for Final
Judgment. Mr. Alvin E. Williams and Mrs. Judith M. Brown-Williams are hereby
ordered to appear at a hearing in Department 68 on July 15, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
to show cause why they should not be sanctioned pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7(b), (c)(2) and 177.5 in an amount up to $1,500
each for their repeated filing of frivolous motions, applications, and
arguments in this department. Plaintiffs may appear at the hearing via
LACourtConnect by telephonic or video conference.
 
The court continues the hearing on the Writ of Execution to the
same date of July 15, 2024. Plaintiffs have a 21-day plus window from the date
of service of the subject order to withdraw the March 19, 2024, filed Writ. If
Plaintiffs withdraw the Writ no later than June 24, 2024, and notify the clerk
of the said withdrawal, the court will discharge the OSC and take July 15, 2024,
hearing off-calendar. If the applications are not withdrawn by Friday June 24,
2024, the court will conduct the hearing whether Plaintiffs appear or not, and
may impose sanctions.
The court may also still strike the Writ upon the conclusion of the sanctions
hearing. 
 
Clerk
to provide notice.
