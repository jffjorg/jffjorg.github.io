  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel compliance with
  deposition subpoena and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A.   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling nonparty Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers (“CLMB”) to
comply with Defendant’s Deposition Subpoena for Business Records by producing,
without objections, all documents responsive to the document requests set forth
therein, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against
CLMB in the amount of $4,539.
As a threshold matter, the court finds that Defendant properly served
CLMB with notice of the new hearing date on this motion by serving CLMB’s
counsel, by personal service, with its “Notice of Continuance of Hearing on
Motion to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena for Business Records to
Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers.” 
(Jan. 30, 2024 Notice of Continuance, pp. 6-7 [proof of service]; Nov.
8, 2023 Stipulation, ¶ 8 [“Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants’ counsel
that Plaintiff’s counsel also represented Non-Parties John R. Lukes and
Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers”]; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1346.) 
The court finds that Defendant has shown that CLMB failed to fully
comply with the Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records and
therefore grants Defendant’s motion to compel CLMB’s compliance with the
deposition subpoena.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.480, subd. (a).)  
Although CLMB produced some responsive documents to Defendant,
Defendant has presented evidence showing that the documents (1) appeared to be
incomplete (e.g., because some of the emails stated “Quoted text hidden”), and
(2) were not produced in the format specified by the subpoena.  (Lowe Decl., ¶¶ 7-8; Lowe Decl., Ex. A,
Deposition Subpoena, Attachment 3 [instructions requiring ESI to be produced in
its native format].)  The court also
notes that CLMB did not file an opposition with the court objecting to the
document requests.  Thus, the court finds
that CLMB failed to produce documents, electronically stored information, or
tangible things under CLMB’s control that are responsive to the document
demands specified in the Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business
Records.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (a).)  
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions against CLMB.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (j).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion to compel compliance with deposition subpoena
for business records and for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders Cervenka &
Lukes Mortgage Brokers to produce to defendant Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (1) all
documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things under
Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers’ control that are responsive to the
requests for production described in section 3 of the Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records issued to Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers
by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on August 18, 2022, and (2) an affidavit of its
custodian of records or other qualified person in compliance with Evidence Code
section 1561, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.430, within
30 days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders that any electronically stored information shall be
produced in the format specified by the Deposition Subpoena for Production of
Business Records issued to Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers by Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. on August 18, 2022.
The court denies defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s request for
monetary sanctions. 
The court orders defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
