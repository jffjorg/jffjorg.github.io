And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of Kia America, Inc.'s motion to compel Matthew A. Solomon's attendance at a deposition. The deposition was originally set for January 4, 2024, but was postponed and ultimately cancelled due to Plaintiff's failure to appear. Kia subsequently served an amended notice of deposition, which was set for May 16, 2024. However, Plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition, citing a doctor's appointment. The judge finds that Plaintiff's refusal to appear and failure to participate in meet and confer efforts led to the bringing of this motion. The judge orders the deposition to occur no later than October 16, 2024, and sanctions Plaintiff with an unknown amount. Kia is ordered to file a supplemental declaration regarding sanctions within 10 days, and Plaintiff may file an opposition to the sanctions within 2 court days thereafter.
