And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The motion was filed by Defendants Prime Sports Nutrition & Prime Sports Nutrition 1, and Plaintiff Alex Soblavarro opposes the motion.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. Specifically, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that Defendants had prior knowledge of the dangerous nature of the pre-workout product at issue. The Court suggests that Plaintiff may be able to remedy the deficiencies in the pleadings with additional facts.

Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to strike Plaintiff's requests for punitive damages. The Court orders that Plaintiff's requests for punitive damages be stricken from the Complaint without prejudice. If Plaintiff becomes aware of additional facts after discovery that would support his claim for punitive damages, he may seek leave to amend the Complaint at a later time.
