ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Anita
Aslanyan (Anita), individually and as successor in interest to Razmik Aslanyan
(Decedent) (collectively Plaintiffs) bring this action against Providence St.
Joseph Health Center (Providence) and THC
Orange County, LLC dba Kindred Hospital Los Angeles (THC). Plaintiffs allege
that Providence and THC failed to properly care for Decedent, resulting in his
death. Plaintiffs state a singular cause of action for professional negligence.

 
Before
the Court is a motion to compel Plaintiff Anita’s further discovery responses
to THC’s Special Interrogatories (SPROG) Set Two. Plaintiffs have filed no
opposition.  
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories 
 
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that the
responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an
unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce
documents in lieu of a substantive response, or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (C.C.P.
§¿2030.300(a).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections thereto. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Decedent Special Interrogatories No. 15-18 
 
The
SPROG to which THC moves to compel further responses are produced below along
with Plaintiff Anita’s initial response. 

 
·        
Please state with particularity the substance of all
conversations you had with all medical professionals regarding Decedent’s
admission to Kindred Los Angeles (SPROG No. 15.) 
 
o  
Objection. Plaintiff objects on the grounds that this
interrogatory is overly broad as to time and scope as to be an unwarranted
annoyance, embarrassment, and is oppressive. To comply with this request would
be an undue burden and expense on the Plaintiff. The request is calculated to
annoy and harass Plaintiff…. Without waiving said objection, Responding Party
responses: Responding Party recalls having conversations demanding a radiograph
of Decedent’s head to be performed following the fall, Responding Party recalls
discussions regarding the call light not working properly.
 
·        
Please state with particularity all expenses you incurred
as a result of injuries which you attribute to Kindred Los Angeles. (SPROG No.
16.) 
 
o  
Objection. Plaintiff objects on the grounds that this
interrogatory is overly broad as to time and scope as to be an unwarranted
annoyance, embarrassment, and is oppressive. To comply with this request would
be an undue burden and expense on the Plaintiff. The request is calculated to
annoy and harass Plaintiff.
 
·        
Please state with
particularity all expenses you incurred as a result of decedent’s alleged
injuries which you attribute to Kindred Los Angeles. (SPROG No. 17.)
 
o  
Objection.
Plaintiff objects on the grounds that this interrogatory is overly broad as to
time and scope as to be an unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, and is
oppressive. To comply with this request would be an undue burden and expense on
the Plaintiff. The request is calculated to annoy and harass Plaintiff. Without
waiving said objections, Responding Party responds: Medical expenses incurred
at UCLA.
 
·        
Please identify
the KINDRED LOS ANGELES staff member you allege did not raise the rails on
decedent’s bed when the incident occurred. (SPROG No. 18.) 
 
o  
Responding Party
does not know the name.
 
 
 
As a
preliminary matter the Court notes that Plaintiff Anita has rendered no
opposition to this motion. By virtue of her failure to oppose this motion, Plaintiff
Anita has inherently failed her burden to justify the objections present in her
responses. (See C.R.C. Rule 8.54 ["A failure to oppose a motion may be
deemed a consent to the granting of the motion."].) 
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff Anita’s response to SPROG Nos. 15 is incomplete. As
concerns SPROG No. 15, Plaintiff Anita clearly identifies two conversations
that she had with THC staff. Despite this, the response to SPROG No. 15 is
without any of the particulars of those conversations. If Plaintiff Anita does
not recall the substance of those conversations, she must so state. 
 
The
Court also finds that the response to SPROG No. 16 is insufficient. This
response contains only a number of boilerplate objections and is unresponsive
to the question posed. 
 
As concerns
the response to SPROG No. 17, it too is incomplete. Plaintiff Anita’s answer of
“Medical expenses incurred at UCLA” is so vague as to be unresponsive to THC’s
request for particular expenses. Plaintiff Anita’s response fails to identify
what these medical expenses are or to direct THC to any specific documentation
in which they are detailed. 
 
Lastly,
the Court finds Plaintiff Anita’s response to SPROG No. 18 to be sufficient. This
SPROG asks Plaintiff Anita to identify the member of THC which allegedly failed
to raise the rails on Decedent’s hospital bed. Plaintiff Anita’s response that
she is unaware of the identity of the THC employee responsible is a complete
answer to the SPROG. This answer is neither evasive nor incomplete. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to compel further responses is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
The motion is GRANTED as to SPROG Nos. 15, 16, and 17. The motion is DENIED at
to SPROG No. 18.
 
Sanctions 
 
As concerns motions to
compel, the law only requires sanctions in the event that a party
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response. (C.C.P. §
2033.290(d), C.C.P. §¿2030.300(d).) As such, any monetary sanctions granted are
within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P. § 2030.290.
Additionally, it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a
motion to compel, and the other party fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C. Rule
3.1348(a).)  
 
Here,
THC has submitted a motion to compel further responses while Plaintiffs have
provided no opposition. As such, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $490.
This amount reflects two hours of attorney work at a rate of $215 per hour,
plus the $60 filing fee for the motion. (Janssen Decl. ¶ 8.) Given the
motion was unopposed, the Court finds this amount is reasonable to compensate
THC for bringing this motion.
