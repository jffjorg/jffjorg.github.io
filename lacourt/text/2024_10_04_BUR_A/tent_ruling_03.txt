Lance Zavela & Ryde
  Enterprises, LLC (Defendant)



 
Complete
Gym Solutions, LLC (Plaintiff) brings this action against Lance Zavela (Zavela)
and Ryde Enterprises, LLC (Ryde) (collectively Defendants). Plaintiff alleges Zavela,
its former National Sales Manager, misappropriated trade secrets. Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges Zavela utilized Plaintiff’s confidential customer database to
convince Plaintiff’s customers to rent equipment from Zavela’s new employer,
Ryde. 
 
Before
the Court is a motion brought by Plaintiff for seeking Evidentiary and Issue
Sanctions. 
 
On September 6,
2024, this motion came on for hearing. The Court heard from both parties and
requested that Plaintiff submit a Separate Statement, as required by C.R.C. Rule 3.1345(a)(7), to assist the Court in
understanding the merits of Plaintiff’s motion. On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff
timely filed their Separate Statement. 
 
On September
30, 2024 Defendants filed their response to Plaintiff’s Separate Statement. The
Court’s order clearly indicated that Defendants’ response to the separate
statement was due no later than September 26, 2024. The Defendants did not
request leave of the Court to file a late opposition nor provide an explanation
setting forth good cause to be excused for the late response.  As such, Defendants’ response is untimely and
without good cause justification, it will not be considered. The Court also
notes that Defendants filed supplemental declarations alongside their response which
were not requested by the Court. These too will not be considered. 
 
Having
received the supplemental materials it requested, the Court elects to take the
matter under submission. No oral argument is requested on the matter at this
time. The Court will issue is ruling on Plaintiff’s motion shortly after
careful consideration of the submissions of the parties. 
 
The Status
Conference re: Summary Judgment Setting is continued to October 15, 2024 at
9:00 A.M. or such other date thereafter stipulated to by the parties.
