And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Varouj Shekerdemian's motions to compel further responses from Desai Holdings USA, LLC dba R Bar and Rakesh David Desai. The motions were filed in response to the defendants' failure to provide complete and timely responses to discovery requests.

The judge ruled that the requests for admission (RFAs) are proper and must be answered, and that the defendants shall provide further responses to RFAs Nos. 1-33 and 35. The judge also ordered the defendants to provide responses to the subject form interrogatories (FROGs).

The judge found that the defendants' objections to the RFAs were without merit and that they failed to meet and confer with Shekerdemian regarding the discovery requests. The judge also ordered the defendants to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,290, representing 3 hours at $350 per hour, plus $240 in filing fees.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any opposition or further argument received from the parties.
