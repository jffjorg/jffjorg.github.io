```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendants' special motion to strike Plaintiff's claims as a SLAPP. The court finds that the disclosure of the settlement agreement during a trial is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute, and Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims. The court concludes that the litigation privilege applies to the breach of contract claim, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated a breach of the confidentiality provision. Additionally, the court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated damages. As a result, the court grants the special motion to strike and dismisses Plaintiff's claims.
