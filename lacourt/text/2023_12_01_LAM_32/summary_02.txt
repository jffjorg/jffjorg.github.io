This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel General Motors to produce a person most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and produce specified documents. The plaintiff, Jonathan David Chaplin, purchased a 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV and commenced a lawsuit against General Motors alleging violations of the Song Beverly statute. The plaintiff served a deposition notice with 20 categories of examination, but General Motors interposed numerous objections. The judge finds that some of General Motors' objections are valid, but others are not. The judge orders General Motors to produce a PMK for deposition and answer questions regarding the specified topics, and to produce the specified documents. The judge also denies sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
