And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has written a tentative ruling on Defendant Hiscox Insurance Company's demurrer and motion to strike the complaint filed by Plaintiffs CoverageSync Restaurants Insurance Services, LLC and Christopher Schaible. The case involves a dispute over whether Defendant breached its insurance policy with Plaintiffs by refusing to settle a covered claim.

The judge has overruled Defendant's demurrer, meaning that the complaint will proceed. The judge has also denied Defendant's motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint.

The judge has found that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a breach of contract and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge has also found that Defendant's alleged refusal to settle the claim was done in bad faith and constitutes a willful and conscious disregard of Plaintiffs' rights.

The judge has concluded that the case will proceed, but has tentatively stayed the case until the underlying action is resolved. The judge has also indicated that punitive damages may be available to Plaintiffs if they can prove by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant victory for Plaintiffs, as it allows their case to move forward and potentially recover damages for the harm caused by Defendant's alleged bad faith conduct.
