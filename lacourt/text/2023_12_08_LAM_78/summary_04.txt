And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendants, Maniben Corp, Girish Patel, and Lila Patel. The defendants argue that the service was defective, but the court finds that the service was proper. The plaintiff's process server, Robert Hall, served the defendants via substituted service at their premises on September 20 and 22, 2023. The defendants' employees, Rohit and Nita Patel, testified that on September 19 and 22, 2023, a man approached the check-in window and left papers, but the court finds that the process server informed the employees of the contents of the papers. The court also finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed after the defendants' deadline to answer or file a responsive pleading. The judge orders that the motion is denied as untimely.
