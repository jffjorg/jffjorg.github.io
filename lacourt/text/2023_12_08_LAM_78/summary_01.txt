Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's further responses to requests for production in part and denied it in part. The defendant's consultant is ordered to complete the work in the same manner as proposed by the plaintiff's consultant, and the plaintiff's consultant is allowed to be present and observe all the work performed by the defendant's consultant. The files must be produced in native format with metadata, and the defendant must produce a privilege log if any documents are being withheld due to an asserted privilege. The defendant must also follow the plaintiff's search term protocol for Slack message discovery. If the quantity of Slack messages retrieved requires additional time to review and produce responsive messages, the defendant may file an ex parte application requesting additional time. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $5,310 against the defendant and its counsel, payable within 20 days after the date of this order.
