And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel Maple Counseling Center (MCC) to comply with the deposition subpoena for Plaintiff's medical records. The Defendant served a deposition subpoena on MCC requesting the records, but MCC objected to the subpoena citing the need for signed authorization from the Plaintiff. The Court cannot compel the Plaintiff to sign the authorization, as it is not a permitted method of discovery. However, the Court has authority to compel a non-party's compliance with a proper deposition subpoena for records, and therefore grants the motion to compel MCC to produce the Plaintiff's medical records.
