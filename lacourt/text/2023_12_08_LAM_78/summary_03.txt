And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the cause of action for retaliatory eviction, but overruled as to the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff must file and serve a first amended complaint within 20 days of the date of this order if they wish to allege facts sufficient to support the cause of action for retaliatory eviction.

The judge found that the plaintiff's Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action for retaliatory eviction because it does not allege that the defendant caused the plaintiff to involuntarily quit the premises, raised rent, or decreased services within 180 days of the plaintiff's complaint about the leaking sink.

On the other hand, the judge found that the plaintiff's Complaint does state facts sufficient to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant's conduct, which included screaming at the plaintiff, making harassing phone calls, threatening him with eviction or cutting off utilities, entering his home, and refusing to leave, was found to be extreme and outrageous and rose to the level of despicable conduct sufficient to support a demand for punitive damages.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the demand for punitive damages from the plaintiff's Complaint.
