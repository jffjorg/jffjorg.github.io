And here is the English-text summary:

The case is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Edwin Martinez, was injured while working at a construction site owned by the City of Santa Clarita. The City moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of negligence and premises liability. The court ruled that the City is entitled to summary judgment on both claims because the Privette doctrine applies, which means the City does not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff.

The City also moved for summary adjudication on its cross-complaint against D&M Painting, Inc., alleging that D&M failed to defend and indemnify the City. The court denied the motion for summary adjudication because it is a question of fact whether D&M breached its contractual duty.
