 Case Number:  23PSCV01371    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieve as Counsel is GRANTED, effective
upon [see below]. 
 
Background2
 
This case arises from a motor
vehicle accident that happened on 2/14/23 wherein the driver was allegedly
under the influence of alcohol. 
 
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiff
Shayla Cid-Maya filed suit against Defendants Salustio Reza (driver) and Lucia
Arroyo (possible owner of vehicle) for (1) motor vehicle and (2) general
negligence.
 
On September 29, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a FAC. 
 
On December 28, 2023,
Defendants filed their answer. 
 
On May 27, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed the instant motion. 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because of a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. 
 
Here, as the case is relatively new, no substantive motions
are on calendar, and all parties, including Plaintiff, have been served with
notice of the motion, the court finds good cause to grant the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted effective upon
service of the court’s order upon all Plaintiffs, Defendants, and all other
parties who have appeared.
