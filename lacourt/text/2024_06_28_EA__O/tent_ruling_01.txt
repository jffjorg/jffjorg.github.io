  Case Number:  22PSCV00872    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
COSTS is GRANTED, but fees are reduced to $10,318
(26.8 hours x $385; no multiplier awarded).  
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case. 
 
On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit. 
 
On September 19, 2022, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.
 
On May 30, 2024, Defendant filed its opposition.
 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Plaintiff brings forth the
motion pursuant to Civil Code section 1794 subdivision (d). 
 
In turn, the statute
provides the following:
 
If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been REASONABLY incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action. (Civ. Code
§1794(d) (emphasis added).) 
 
As for
determining the “reasonableness” of attorney costs incurred in fee shifting
cases, the inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method
which embraces a two-step method. (See also Motion p. 7.)
 
The first
step requires a trial court to multiply the time reasonably spent by Plaintiff
counsel on the case by a reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. 
 
The second step allows a trial court
to adjust or enhance the lodestar by applying a multiplier to consider the
contingent nature and risk associated with the action, as well as other
factors, such as degree of skill required, ultimate success achieved, and
“extraordinary legal skill.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1130, 1132, 1137; see also Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 (Serrano III) [identifies seven factors that a
trial court properly considers in its decision to augment the lodestar
calculation].) The factors considered in
determining the modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill
required and employed to handle the case, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774, emphasis
added and underline added).) A
negative modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) The amount
of the multiplier lies within the court’s sound discretion. (Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138, emphasis added [“To the extent a trial court is concerned that a
particular award is excessive, it has broad discretion to adjust the fee
downward or deny an unreasonable fee altogether.”], see also Motion p.
8:11-12.)
 
After the
trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether
the total award so calculated under all
of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if
so, shall reduce the award so that it is a reasonable figure.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice (RJN)
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is denied. 
 
Per Evidence Code section 453 subdivision (b), the requesting
party must “[f]urnish[] the court with sufficient information to enable it to
take judicial notice of the matter. 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks judicial notice of thirteen (13)
court orders (from various counties (e.g, trial courts of Riverside, San Diego)
and federal district courts). However, “a
written trial court ruling has no precedential value” (Bolanos v. Superior
Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 744, 761; Drummond
v. Desmarais (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 439, 448, fn. 4
[“(I)n the absence of some additional showing—such as the conditions for claim
or issue preclusion—the actions of other judges are simply irrelevant”].
 
Therefore, absent a showing of the relevance of the trial
court orders, notably when a motion for attorney fees turns on the sound
discretion of the trial court making the order, Plaintiff has not met its
burden.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on 34 hours spent for a total of
$42,571.25 in fees ($15,028.50 in fees and $5,000 in “anticipated” fees,” along
with a $22,542.75 multiplier.)
Defendant argues the hours reflect inefficient and duplicative efforts such
that no more than $8,661.00 in fees against GM should be
awarded. While a verified fee bill
is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were
reasonable (Motion p. 9, citing Hadley v. Krepel, 167 Cal. App. 3d 677,
682 (1985), fees must also be actually and reasonably incurred. (Opp. p.
6, citing Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of Cal., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818.) 
 
Here, for reasons to be discussed
below, the court determines that 34 hours expended on a seemingly generic case
is unreasonable as is the hourly rate.[1]

 
The
court turns to the billing entries that Defendant disputes. (Fennel Decl., Ex.
15, pp. 134-149 of 149 of PDF.) 
 
1.    
Paralegal
Time
 
Defendant
argues that the 3.6 hours ($723.00) billed by paralegal Elaine Astorga (at the
rate of $200-210 per hour) is for clerical work is not recoverable as attorney
fees. (See Missouri v. Jenkins by Agyei (1989) 491 U.S. 274, 288 fn. 10 [“Purely
clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at a paralegal rate,
regardless of who performs them.”].)[2]

 
Plaintiff
argues that “[a] review of the billing records shows that
Mrs. Astorga performed litigation tasks.” (Reply p. 5:15-16.) 
 
But a review of the billing supports
Defendant’s characterization of the paralegal’s work. While not all of Astorga’s
billing was clerical, most was
clerical. Her billings are most dedicated to confirming LACC for
hearings; filing docs with the court; or prepping for service. To the extent
she may have partaken in some legal work, as observed by
Defendant, block billing makes it difficult for GM and the court to assess the
tasks performed or the reasonableness of the time incurred. 
 
Accordingly, GM’s requests that this
time be stricken in its entirety, for a reduction of 3.6 hours ($723.00)
is GRANTED.
 
2.    
Clerical
& Administrative Task
 
Defendant
Counsel Fennell regularly billed for clerical or administrative tasks such as “calculated
due date,” “sent [] hearing results to paralegal,” “review [] Defendant’s
Notice of Change of Address,” “review… request for contact information,” and
“send[ing] out” (i.e., emailing) various documents to GM or the mediator. 
(See generally Fennell Decl., Ex. 15.) 
Purely
clerical tasks, such as those performed by Mr. Fennell, are not recoverable as
attorney fees. (See Missouri, supra.) 
 
The
opposition doesn’t squarely address the argument(s) but instead conclusively
argues that he “disagrees with this contention.” (Reply p. 6.) It is unclear
how Counsel communicating with a paralegal to calendar and set reminders or
sending emails are not clerical in nature.
 
Therefore, the court GRANTS the 2.6
reduction.
 
3.    
Repair
Order Review & Prepare Summary—August 17 & 22, 2022
 
Given
that Plaintiff’s initial document production contained only four repair orders,
it could not have reasonably taken half a day to perform these tasks. GM
requests Counsel’s time be reduced. 
 
However,
in reply, Plaintiff explains that there were 7 (seven) different repair
orders that were summarized by Plaintiff’s counsel. After initially drafting
the summary, Defendant and Plaintiff produced additional repair orders, which
led to Plaintiff’s counsel updating the repair order summary. (Reply p. 7.)
 
Therefore, the court DENIES reducing
the hours by 3.7 hours. 
 
4.    
Reviewing
GM’s Answer—September 19, 2022
 
Defendant
argues that Counsel “billed” 0.5 hours ($460.00) for “review and analysis” of
the 8-page answer filed by GM, which is virtually identical to the answer GM
has filed in almost every other matter involving Counsel. (Fennell Decl. Ex.
15, p. 1; Kay Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
Here,
the court declines to strike this as it more of a subjective opinion of how much time should have reasonably
been spent and the extra half an hour is not necessarily unreasonable. (See
also Motion p. 8, Reply p. 8, citing Horsford v.
Board of Trustees of Ca. State Univ. (2005), 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [if submitted, such records “are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.].) Even if it is the exact same answer,
Plaintiff’s Counsel is required to review the answer in detail and Defendant provides
no evidence regarding how much time it spent drafting its Opposition to
Plaintiff’s fee motion. 
 
Therefore, the court DENIES reducing
the hours by .2 hours. 
 
5.    
Templated
Discovery Responses–December 1, 2022
 
Defendant
argues for a 3-hour reduction because “It should not have taken Mr. Fennell more
than an hour to review GM’s requests and draft Plaintiff’s recycled responses,
which were almost exclusively templated objections Counsel always deploys
against GM.” (Opp. p. 7.)
 
Here, for
one, there were 119 written discovery requests, which may be more than other
cases handled between the two firms. Moreover, for similar reasons stated
above, billing 4 hours instead of Defendant’s suggested 3 hours does not render
the entries patently unreasonable.
 
Therefore, the court DENIES reducing
the hours by 3 hours. 
 
6.    
Templated
Fee Motion—April 1 & 2, 2024, and “Anticipated”
 
Finally,
Defendant argues that Counsel should not get full credit for the 4
hours ($1,900.00) that Counsel claims it spent on the fee demand, or the
additional $5,000 in “anticipated” fees—roughly 10.5 hours at Mr. Fennell’s
claimed rate of $475 per hour—to review GM’s opposition, prepare a reply brief,
and attend the hearing.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff explains that
counsel spent a total of 3.9 hours reviewing Defendant’s Opposition and
drafting this Reply. (Supp. Fennell Decl. ¶ 3.) Further, Plaintiff predicts at
least another 1.5 hours of time will be expended preparing for and appearing at
the Motion hearing. Therefore, Plaintiff adjusts her requested “anticipated”
time from $5,000.00 to $2,565.00. (Reply p. 8.) 
 
For reasons similar to above, the court
denies the request to cap the demand to 2.5 hours, but the court GRANTS reduction of 1 hour as
1.5 hours preparing for the hearing and attending the hearing is unsupported. 
 
Thus, in total, 34 hours is reduced by 7.2
hours (3.6+2.6+1 hour) for a TOTAL of 26.8 hours expended on the case. 
 
Hourly
Rate
 
The
court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff failed to establish the
reasonableness of its hourly rate. (See Opp. p. 6, citing Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 155 [explaining the
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work].) 
“The relevant ‘community’ is that where the
court is located.” (Altavion, Inc. v. Konica Minolta Sys. Lab., Inc.
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 26, 71.) 
 
As explained in the RJN above, what, for
example, the hourly rate of what a court in San Diego allows is irrelevant to
Los Angeles. Counsel did not satisfy its burden to show that Mr. Fennell’s
declared rate ($460 in 2023 and $475 in 2024) is reasonable for Los Angeles
County. 
 
Though
this court generally finds $300-$350 reasonable for work that is not complex,
Defendant proposes an hourly rate of $385. (Opp. p. 6). 
 
Multiplier

 
There
are three elements to support any enhancement under California law: (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill displayed in
presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys; and (3) the contingent nature of
the fee award, based on the uncertainty of prevailing on the merits and of
establishing eligibility for the award.  (Opp. p. 4, citing Robertson,
supra, at 819.)
 
Here,
the case fails to satisfy the first element such court need not address the
remaining two. While the court does not dispute that Counsel tenaciously
litigated this case, ultimately, there were no expert reports, no dispositive
motions, no trial preparation, nor, most importantly, any filing that did not
rely upon filings from other cases. As this case is similar to nearly all the
other actions filed by the firm, a multiplier is unwarranted.
 
Conclusion
 
In sum, the court awards
an hourly rate of $385 yielding a total recovery of $10,318.
