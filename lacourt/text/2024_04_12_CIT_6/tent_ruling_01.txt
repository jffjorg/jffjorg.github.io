  Case Number:  21PSCV00907    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Rebecca Castillo’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Lemonshark, LLC  TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. If Plaintiff  chooses to amend the Complaint, the amended complaint must be properly served  on the Defendant and the Defendant will have an opportunity to respond.            BACKGROUND             This  is an ADA/Unruh case. On November 5, 2021, plaintiff Rebecca Castillo  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Lemonshark, LLC (Defendant) and  Does 1 to 10, alleging one cause of action for violations of the Unruh Civil  Rights Act. On January 11, 2024, the Court struck Defendant’s answer to the  complaint and entered its default. On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request  for entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $9,074.00,  including $8,000.00 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $570.00 in attorney fees,  and $504.00 in costs. Because  Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to state a claim for relief under the Unruh Civil  Rights Act (UCRA), Plaintiff’s application is DENIED without prejudice.  “If  the complaint does not state a cause of action or the allegations do not  support a claim for relief, a default judgment is erroneous and ‘cannot  stand.’” (Grappo v. McMills (2017)  11 Cal.App.5th 996, 1015.) Thus, while all properly pled facts are deemed  admitted by the defendant, allegations are not and “plaintiff must prove each  essential element of the complaint entitling the plaintiff to a recovery  against the defendant.” (Id., at p. 1013.)  Pursuant  to the UCRA, “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of this state . . . no  matter what their . . . disability . . . are entitled to the full and equal  accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business  establishments of every kind whatsoever.” (Civil Code, § 51, subd. (b).) “A  plaintiff can recover under the [UCRA] on two alternate theories: (1) a  violation of the ADA [Civil Code section 51, subd. (f)]; or (2) denial of  access to a business establishment based on intentional discrimination.” (Martinez  v. San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1059 (SDCCU).)  ADA Violations  To  establish a violation of the ADA, “a plaintiff must show: (1) a covered  disability; (2) ‘the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or  operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public  accommodations by the defendant because of [the] disability.’” (SDCCU,  supra, at p. 1060, quoting Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc. (9th Cir.  2007) 481 F.3d 724, 730.) Websites alone are not considered places of public  accommodation under the ADA. (Martinez v. Cot’n  Wash, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th  1026, 1043-1044, 1052-1053 (Cot’n Wash).)  However, under the nexus test, courts will “consider whether the alleged  website deficiencies impinge on the plaintiff's ability to have equal access  to, and enjoyment of, the products and services offered at the physical  location.” (SDCCU, supra, 50 Cal.App.5th at p. 1067.)  For  example, the Ninth Circuit found such a nexus between Domino’s website and  physical locations where customers could locate nearby restaurants and place  orders over the website for home delivery or in-store pickup. (Robles v.  Domino’s Pizza, LLC (9th Cir. 2019) 913 F.3d 898, 905.) In another case,  the Court of Appeal found a nexus where a restaurant’s website included a menu  and reservation system that were inaccessible to visually impaired customers. (Thurston  v. Midvale Corp. (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 634, 638, 646.) A nexus also exists  if the website provides a list of locations and services that the customer  could use to determine where to go. (SDCCU, supra, 50 Cal.App.5th  at p. 1069.)  Here,  Plaintiff alleges the Defendant’s website “provides consumers with access to an  array of goods, services, and information related to Defendant’s  brick-and-mortar locations which include, but are not limited  to, the following: menu item list, online ordering, contact options, franchise  options, pricing details, newsletter subscriptions sign-up, loyalty account  sign-up, location information, and many other benefits.” (Complaint, ¶ 31.) Plaintiff “was unable to fully and  independently access the Website” and vaguely claims to have “encountered  multiple unlabeled or mislabeled buttons and links,” “multiple pages containing  insufficient navigational headings,” and the inability “to browse the menu” and  “to make a purchase because of an inaccessible checkout system.” (Complaint, ¶  36.)  Even  if there are accessibility issues, “a plaintiff who fails to allege any  connection between the website barriers and a physical location does not have  an ADA claim.” (Gomez v. Trinitas Cellars, LLC (N.D.  Cal. March 9, 2022) 3:21-cv-09006-WHO [2022 WL 704857, at *3], quoting Langer  v. Pep Boys Manny Moe & Jack of California (N.D. Cal. Jan. 15, 2021)  20-cv-06015-DMR [2021 WL 148237, at *5].) Here, Plaintiff does not allege the  website was entirely inaccessible. While Plaintiff claims “multiple” barriers, Plaintiff  does not specify how those barriers have a connection to Defendant’s physical  store locations. The only specifics Plaintiff provides is that Plaintiff was  unable to browse the menu and make a purchase. Plaintiff does not show how  these products and checkout systems are connected to Defendant’s physical  location or a separate online store, an important distinction given purely  online retail sites are not covered under the ADA. (Cot’n  Wash, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp.  1043-1044, 1052-1053.) Plaintiff does not even allege what kind of goods or  services Defendant provides and the Complaint fails to adequately plead how the  specific barriers deprived Plaintiff of full and fair enjoyment of or denied her  equal access to Defendant’s unidentified business.  Ultimately,  Plaintiff only alleges the barriers “deterred Plaintiff from visiting”  Defendant’s brick-and-mortar locations. (Complaint, ¶¶ 38-39.) While Plaintiff  lists the benefits provided by the website to consumers, Plaintiff does not  describe how the accessibility issues denied these benefits and the benefits  mentioned (menu and checkout system) are not pled as connected to Defendant’s  physical locations. Thus, Plaintiff has not adequately pled that Defendant’s  website is inaccessible to the extent prohibited by the ADA.  UCRA Violations  Pursuant  to the UCRA, if a claim is not an ADA violation, the plaintiff must prove the  discrimination was intentional or willful and affirmative misconduct. (Cot’n  Wash, supra, 81 CalApp.5th at p. 1036.) “A claimant may not ‘rel[y] on the effects of  a facially neutral policy on a particular group . . . to infer solely from  such effects a discriminatory intent.’” (Ibid, quoting Koebke v.  Bernardo Heights Country Club (2005) 36 Cal.4th 824, 854.)  Here,  Plaintiff has not alleged any facts establishing Defendant’s website was  intended to discriminate against the visually impaired. While Plaintiff claims  Defendant’s actions were intentional discrimination, these allegations are  conclusory without any facts pled as support. (Complaint, ¶ 49.) Thus,  Plaintiff cannot establish a violation of the UCRA.  Other Defects The Court further finds Plaintiff  has not submitted sufficient evidence to support Plaintiff’s claim for  $8,000.00 in damages. Plaintiff cites the case of Johnson v. Guedoir (E.D. Cal.  2016) 218 F.Supp.3d 1096 as the basis for requesting $4,000.00 in deterrence  damages plus $4,000.00 for encountering the barriers. (Compl., Prayer for  Relief, ¶¶ 5-6; Summary of the Case, 2:3-10.) Johnson does not support  this outcome. The court in Johnson found $8,000.00 in statutory damages  was warranted based on two incidents wherein the plaintiff was deterred on one  date and then personally encountered the barriers on a different date. (Johnson,  supra, 218 F.Supp.3d at p. 1100.) Here, Plaintiff only provides evidence  of one visit on October 19, 2021. (Castillo Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff does not  provide any evidence of having been deterred from visiting or personally  encountering a violation on a later date. Plaintiff does not provide evidence  that indicates she alerted Defendant to the barriers she encountered or that she  waited a reasonable period of time and then intended to visit the website again  but was deterred because she had knowledge that the alleged accessibility  barriers still existed. The  Court also notes that Plaintiff did not complete items 4, 5, or 6 of Judicial  Council Form CIV-100. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 585.5, 587; Bus. & Prof. Code, §  6400 et seq.)  CONCLUSION                 Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. If Plaintiff chooses to amend the Complaint, the amended complaint must be properly served on the Defendant and the Defendant will have an opportunity to respond.
