 Case Number:  23PSCV01391    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Ruby Cortez Serrato’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Xiangdan Cui  TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND             This  is a personal injury action. On May 8, 2023, plaintiff Ruby Cortez Serrato  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Xiangdan Cui (Defendant) and  Does 1 to 50, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general  negligence. On October 12, 2023, default was entered against Defendant. On March  4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment.[1]            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure  section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits  as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by  the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks  default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $350,539.67,  including $48,602.13 in special damages, $286,000 in general damages, $13,462.12  in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and $2,475.42 in costs. The Court finds  multiple defects in this default judgment package. First, Plaintiff served the  Statement of Damages on October 12, 2023, which is the same day Plaintiff  served the request for entry of default. (Request for Entry of Default  (10/12/23); Statement of Damages (10/12/23).) This was too soon, and default  should not have been entered. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 425.11; Plotitsa v.  Superior Court (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 755, 761 [default cannot be entered  until 30 days after service of Statement of Damages]; Twine v. Compton  Supermarket (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 514, 517 [following Plotitsa, the  Court stated: “the plaintiff must personally serve a defendant, who has not  appeared, with the statement of damages and defer entry of default until 30  days from such service so that defendant can file a responsive pleading.”]. It is also unclear if Plaintiff’s  service of the Statement of Damages by mail was sufficient to satisfy the  requirement that it be served in the same manner as a summons. (See Statement  of Damages (10/12/23); Code Civ. Proc., § 415.11, subd. (d)(1); California  Novelties, Inc. v. Sokoloff (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 936, 942 [finding 17 days’  service by mail of statement of damages was sufficient]; but see Schwab v.  Southern California Gas Co. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1322 fn. 11, disapproved  on other grounds by Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861 [noting that California  Novelties was decided before Code Civ. Proc., § 415.11, subd. (d)(1), was  amended in 1993 to require formal notice].)  Second, the proof of service attached to the Statement of Damages  did not attach the signed return receipt or provide other evidence of actual  delivery. (See Statement of Damages (10/12/23); Code Civ. Proc., § 415.40.) More  importantly, service by certified mail return receipt requested applies to  service on persons outside of the state, not to persons inside the state like  Defendant. (See Statement of Damages (10/12/23); Code Civ. Proc., § 415.40.)  Such service is also incomplete until 10 days after mailing, which is  problematic because Plaintiff filed the request for entry of default the same  day Plaintiff served the Statement of Damages by certified mail return receipt  requested. (See Statement of Damages (10/12/23); Code Civ. Proc., § 415.40.)  Third, Plaintiff did not complete the  declaration of nonmilitary status for the request for entry of default  judgment. (Form CIV-100, ¶ 8; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(5).) Fourth,  Plaintiff requests prejudgment interest but such was not sought in the  Complaint or Statement of Damages. Thus, such prejudgment interest cannot be awarded  in a default judgment. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580(a) [The relief granted to  the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the  complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11….”].) “The courts have  consistently held section 580 is an unqualified limit on the jurisdiction of  courts entering default judgments. As a general rule, a default judgment is  limited to the damages of which the defendant had notice. Further, the courts  have reaffirmed the language of section 580 is mandatory. Therefore, ‘in all  default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.’” (Finney v. Gomez  (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534 [3 Cal. Rptr. 3d 604], fns. omitted, quoting  Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824 [231 Cal. Rptr. 220, 726 P.2d  1295].) Further, Plaintiff fails to city any authority supporting prejudgment  interest for unpaid medical bills in a personal injury action. Fifth, Plaintiff  requests conflicting amounts for costs. Paragraph 2, subdivision (c), of Form  CIV-100 indicates $2,474.52 in costs, whereas paragraph 7, subdivision (e),  indicates costs in the amount of $717.44. Sixth, the proposed judgment is  submitted on the wrong form. Plaintiff’s proposed judgment is submitted on Form  JUD-110, which is for judgments in unlawful detainer cases. (See Form JUD-110.)  Finally, Plaintiff’s damage calculations  are problematic. Plaintiff claims a number of charges incurred in connection  with the underlying accident, such as $26.13 from Lambert Radiology Medical  Group and $13,995.00 from Radiance Surgery Center, but it is unclear where the  supporting documentation is for those amounts. (See Serrato Decl., ¶ 26.) Even  assuming Plaintiff’s special damages calculations are correct, Plaintiff’s  general damage calculations are almost six times the amount of Plaintiff’s  purported special damages, which the Court finds to be excessive.  CONCLUSION               Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
