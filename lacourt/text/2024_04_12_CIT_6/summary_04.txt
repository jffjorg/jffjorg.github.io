Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The plaintiff, Ruby Cortez Serrato, has requested entry of default judgment against the defendant, Xiangdan Cui, in the amount of $350,539.67. However, the court finds multiple defects in the default judgment package. The court finds that the Statement of Damages was served too soon, and that the proof of service attached to the Statement of Damages did not attach the signed return receipt or provide other evidence of actual delivery. The court also finds that service by certified mail return receipt requested does not apply to service on persons inside the state. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff did not complete the declaration of non-military status for the request for entry of default judgment and that the plaintiff's damage calculations are problematic. Therefore, the court's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice."
