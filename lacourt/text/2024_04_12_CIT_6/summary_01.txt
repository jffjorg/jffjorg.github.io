Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's website is inaccessible to visually impaired individuals and seeks damages, attorney fees, and costs. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for relief under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and that the plaintiff has not adequately pled how the specific barriers deprived the plaintiff of full and fair enjoyment of or denied her equal access to the defendant's unidentified business. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim for damages. The court grants the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint and serve it on the defendant.
