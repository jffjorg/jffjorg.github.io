(Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) A party who is satisfied with an arbitration award should move to confirm the award. A petition to confirm an arbitration award must include the substance of the agreement to arbitrate, the names of the arbitrators, and the opinion of the arbitrator. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4. The general rule is that a court will not review “the merits of the controversy, the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning, or the sufficiency of the evidence.” (Jordan v. DMV (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 43; see also Dept. of Personnel Admin. v. Cal. Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1200 [“an arbitrator’s decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law, whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.”].) Confirmation of the award is mandatory unless a response or petition to correct or vacate the award has been timely filed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818) Discussion             Here, Petitioner’s submitted petition includes the name of the arbitrator, a copy of the award, and the written opinion of the arbitrator. (CCP § 1285.4.)             Confirmation of the award is mandatory unless a response or petition to correct or vacate the award has been timely filed. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1286.4, 1286.8; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818)              Based on the foregoing, Petitioner’s motion to confirm the arbitration award is granted. It is so ordered. Dated:  May    , 2024                                                                                                                                                             Hon.
