The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to amend the complaint. The Plaintiffs, Kamran Sadeghian and Shima Nikfarjam, seek to amend their complaint to clarify their allegations regarding the validity of the promissory note and deed of trust. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiffs do not seek to add new causes of action or assert new legal obligations, and that the Defendant has been on notice of the Plaintiffs' contention that the promissory note is invalid. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs would be severely prejudiced if denied the opportunity to amend their complaint. The ruling is based on the strong policy favoring leave to amend, and the Judge finds that the Defendant has not shown meaningful prejudice.
