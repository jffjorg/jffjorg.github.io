  - "A stay in this context is not a matter of right, however, the court has discretion to consider whether a stay will avoid 'unseemly conflicts with the courts of other jurisdictions' and 'whether the rights of the parties can best be determined by the court of the other jurisdiction because of the nature of the subject matter, the availability of witnesses, or the stage to which the proceedings in the other court have already advanced.'" (Farmland Irr. Co. v. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208, 215.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of related appeals. The plaintiff alleges six causes of action based on childhood sexual abuse by a teacher's aide, while the defendant argues that the revival of the claims is an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The judge has taken judicial notice of two pending writs that will determine the constitutionality of the legislation that revived the plaintiff's claims. The judge grants the stay to avoid conflicts with other jurisdictions and to allow the parties to address the progress of the cases on appeal. The case management conference is reset for October 10, 2024.
