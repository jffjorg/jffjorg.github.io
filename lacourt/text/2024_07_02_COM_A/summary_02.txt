And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the City of Compton's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Makila Moorer. The City had argued that the Plaintiff's complaint was frivolous and that the Plaintiff did not conduct an objectively reasonable inquiry before filing the complaint. The Plaintiff argued that the City's evidence did not sufficiently establish that it did not own, operate, control, or maintain the utility box where the Plaintiff fell. The judge found that the City's evidence did not meet its burden of showing that the complaint was frivolous and that the City had not met its burden of showing that the Plaintiff's counsel violated Section 128.7 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for imposition of sanctions against the City for filing a frivolous motion.
