And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Compton is suing Mehdi Javadiaghdam and others to shut down an illegal narcotics business at a property allegedly owned by FS International, Inc. The court previously appointed a receiver to take control of the property and terminate the illegal activity. The receiver has incurred expenses of over $64,000 to secure and maintain the property, and is seeking approval of a proposed rehabilitation plan and authorization to engage a broker to market the property for sale. However, the receiver's second report is incomplete and lacks essential documents, including a list of improvements needed to bring the property up to code standards and an estimated budget for the rehabilitation. The court has therefore continued the hearing to July 30, 2024, and ordered the receiver to provide a complete rehabilitation plan within 10 days prior to the hearing.
