And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with five days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Veronica Childs, brought an unlawful detainer action against defendants Erica Ortiz and Mario Acosta, alleging that they failed to pay rent required by their written agreement. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to attach proof that the three-day notice to pay rent or quit was properly served, and that the notice itself is defective for not providing a valid method for curing the breach. The Judge agrees that the complaint is defective because it fails to include the written lease agreement, and that the plaintiff is required to attach the notice or notices of termination served on the tenants. The Judge sustains the demurrer and grants the plaintiff five days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
