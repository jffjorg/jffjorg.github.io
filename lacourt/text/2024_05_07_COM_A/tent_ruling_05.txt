[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
 COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF 
 
Malek H.
 Shraibati and BDJ&J, as counsel for Plaintiff,
requests an order to be relieved because of a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. Counsel served the motion on the client by mail,
 return receipt requested, at the client’s last known address, which
counsel has not been able to confirm. Counsel does not indicate whether the
client’s telephone number is in service, or whether counsel could confirm
delivery of the motion at the client’s last known address.
Counsel has not shown diligence in attempting
to confirm the client’s contact information by contacting a person familiar
with the client, or conducting a search, or by other means. If counsel is
unable to confirm current contact information after diligent efforts, any
attempt at service may be made by delivering the notice or papers to the clerk
of the court, for that party. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1011
(d).) 
Accordingly, the hearing is continued to June 20,
 2024,  at 8:30 a.m. in
Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Counsel is ordered to file a
supplemental declaration either confirming the client’s address, demonstrating
diligence in confirming the address, or if unsuccessful, complying with Code
Civ. Proc., § 1011(d) and deliver the motion to the clerk of the court.
