And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied a petition to change the name of a 15-year-old minor, Kamron Jeffery Santana, to Kamron Devon Marshall. The petition was filed through a legal guardian, Concepcion Jones, but the guardian was unable to prove service of the petition to the father. Additionally, the court found that the petitioner failed to comply with the requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. As a result, the petition is denied due to non-compliance with the statute.
