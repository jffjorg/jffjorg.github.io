[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S TWO [2] MOTIONS TO COMPEL PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORY 16.7 AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES SET ONE; REQUEST FOR IMPOSITION
OF SANCTIONS
 
       Where
a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the
court has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290(b),
§2031.300(b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290(a), § 2031.300(a).)
As to form interrogatory 16.7, there
is no dispute that Defendant served code complaint responses on April 23, 2024.
(See Bridges Decl. ¶ 21).  Therefore, an order compelling their response
is no longer necessary.  
Nonetheless, Plaintiff is entitled
to the imposition of sanctions against Defendant and their counsel for the
failure to justify the lengthy delay in serving responses. The Court finds $350
per hour is a reasonable rate. The Court finds that three hours to prepare the motion
and reply brief is reasonable, for a total of $1,050 in sanctions against each
Defendant. 
As to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories
Set One,     Defendant served second
supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos.
17, 19, 20, 23, 26, and 28, on February 23, 2024.  (See Marks Decl. ¶ 7.)  They were non-responsive and evasive. On April
23, 2024, Defendant served third supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories
Set One. (See Bridges Decl. ¶ 21).  
       Contrary
to Defendant’s assertion, service of the third supplemental responses does not render
the motion moot. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 390, 408.)  Indeed, Defendant’s responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 17, 20, 23,
26, and 28 remain evasive and deficient. 
Accordingly, Defendants are ordered to provide
code complaint responses within 10 days. 

       Imposition
of sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel is warranted as Defendant
has not shown substantial justification for failing to comply with discovery
obligations. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.310, 2031.310.)  The Court finds that defense counsel’s $350
per hour rate is reasonable. The Court permits five hours to prepare the Motion
to Compel responses to special interrogatories. 
Accordingly, the court imposes total sanctions of $1750.00 ($350 x 5) against
Defendant, payable to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days.
