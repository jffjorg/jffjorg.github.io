[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PETITION TO CHANGE NAME 
 
      Petitioner, Kamron
 Jeffery Santana, is 15 years old and files this petition through a
legal guardian (grandmother) Concepcion Jones.  Petitioner proposes a name change to
Kamron Devon Marshall to add the father’s surname.  
      The Court
previously continued the hearing on this petition twice from January 10, 2024, and
February 23, 2024, to permit the guardian to “provide notice of the hearing to
any living parent of the minor by personal service at least 30 days before the
hearing.” The Guardian was able to locate the father, but there is no proof
that the Guardian delivered this petition to the father. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1277.) 
      The
Court also continued the hearing to permit Petitioner to comply with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1277.) The Court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner complied.
      Accordingly,
the Court DENIES the Petition for failure to comply with the requirements of the
statute.
