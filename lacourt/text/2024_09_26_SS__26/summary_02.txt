And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Elizabeth Gibson-Gardner, filed the lawsuit against Air Clean Environmental, Inc. and American Contractors Indemnity Company on June 30, 2023. The defendant filed an answer on August 28, 2023. The plaintiff filed the motion on May 31, 2024, seeking to compel the defendant's further responses to interrogatories and requesting sanctions. The motion was initially set for hearing on July 1, 2024, but was continued multiple times to the current hearing date of September 26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.

The judge found that the motion was timely filed and that the parties had agreed to extend the plaintiff's time to bring the motion through the end of May 2024. The judge also found that the meet and confer requirement was satisfied. However, the judge denied the motion because the interrogatories with subparts are not permitted in cases assigned to the limited jurisdiction court, as set forth in CCP § 94. The judge concluded that asking the court to compel further responses to discovery that is not permitted by statute is not in line with the legislative purpose set forth above.
