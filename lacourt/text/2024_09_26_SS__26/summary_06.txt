And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendant is required to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 20 days of this order. The judge's analysis is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state causes of action for breach of contract, open book account and account stated, goods and services rendered, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation. The judge found that the demurrer was based on an incorrect assumption that the damages sought by the plaintiff were premised solely on an unenforceable liquidated damages provision, but the complaint actually seeks damages based on unpaid rent, late fees, and accelerated remedies. The judge also found that the demurrer was insufficient to overcome an entire cause of action and that the remaining causes of action were sufficiently alleged.
