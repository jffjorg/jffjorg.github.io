Gibson-Gardener
v. Air Clean Environmental, Inc., et al.MOTIONS TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSES
TO FORM INTERROGATORIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP § 2030.300)
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Plaintiff Elizabeth Gibson-Gardner’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Sanctions is
DENIED.
    
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Elizabeth Gibson-Gardner
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract,
negligence, and recovery on contractor’s license bond against Defendants Air
Clean Environmental, Inc. aba Ace Environmental Demolition (“Defendant ACE”)
and American Contractors Indemnity Company (“Defendant ACIC”) on June 30, 2023.
Defendant ACE filed its answer on August 28, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One; Request for Sanctions on May 31, 2024. The Motion was initially set
for hearing on July 1, 2024, then continued multiple times to the current
hearing date of September 26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Notice of the
motion to compel further must be given “within 45 days of service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later
date to which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in
writing,” otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The parties agreed to
extend Plaintiff’s time to bring the instant Motion through the end of May
2024. (Motion, Cade Decl., Exh. 3.) The Motion was timely filed on May 31,
2024.
 
Also, the Motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) The supporting declarations demonstrate
an effort by Plaintiff to obtain further responses from Defendant after service
of the original responses. (Motion, Cade Decl., ¶¶5-6 and Exh. 3.) The meet and
confer requirement is satisfied. 
 
Finally, Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).) The
Motion is accompanied by a separate statement. (Separate Statement, filed
05/31/24.) 
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s further responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 304.1, 324.1, and 326.1. Each of these
interrogatories includes subparts. (Motion, Cade Decl., Exh. 1.) However,
interrogatories with subparts are not permitted in cases assigned to the
limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a)(1).) The purpose
of the limitations set forth in section 94 is to “simplify and thereby reduce
the cost of pursuing and defending these actions.” (Meza v. Portfolio Recovery
Associates, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 844, 854.) Asking the Court to compel
further responses to discovery that is not permitted by statute is not in line
with the legislative purpose set forth above.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Elizabeth Gibson-Gardner’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Sanctions is
DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
