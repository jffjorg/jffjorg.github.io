Discussion
 
Allegations
in the Complaint
 
The
parties entered into a binding written agreement for two water fountains and an
associated service contract on October 4, 2023. (Compl., ¶5.) The contract
provides for a rental term of 60 months at $300.00 per month. (Id. at
¶7.) Following execution of the contract, Defendant accepted delivery and
installation of the equipment. (Id. at ¶11.) Per the agreement,
Defendant made payments for the months of November 2023, December 2023, January
2024 and February 2024. (Id. at 14.) Plaintiff sent Defendant an invoice
for March 2024 on February 15, 2024. (Id. at ¶15.) No payment has been
made for March 2024. (Ibid.) Section 7 of the Agreement provides that if
a payment is not made before the due date, “a late charge equal to 15% of the
late payment or $20, whichever is greater, will be charged for each late
payment.” (Id. at ¶18.) Section 12 of the Agreement provides for
acceleration of remedies as follows: “If Customer does not pay any amount when
due, or breaches any other term of this Rental Agreement…WSS…may deem the
Customer in default and…may thereafter exercise any and all legal remedies
available by law including but not limited to… termination of maintenance
agreements, reimbursement of reasonable attorney fees associated with any
action…and acceleration of the balance due under this Rental Agreement….” (Id.
at ¶20.) “Defendant currently owes a total of $16,290.00, plus the applicable
invoiced amounts for March 2024 and April 2024 and late-fees for those two
invoices totaling $661.52 and $132.30, respectively. The total due is
currently, $17,083.82.” (Id. at ¶19.) On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff sent
Defendant an invoice pursuant to section 12, notifying Defendant of Plaintiff’s
acceleration of the payment schedule in full. (Id. at ¶23.) Around May
1, 2024, Plaintiff retrieved the equipment that was installed on Defendant’s
property. (Id. at ¶26.)
 
Demurrer
to the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) Breach
of Contract; (2) Open Book Account and Account Stated; (3) Goods and Services
Rendered; (4) Quantum Meruit; (5) Unjust Enrichment and; (6) Negligent
Misrepresentation. The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Demurrer, Young Decl., ¶2.) Defendant demurs on
the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action. 
 
The demurrer is first brought as
to the entire Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff’s damages are premised on
an unenforceable liquidated damages provision. This is not correct, however. As
set forth above, the damages sought by Plaintiff are based on (1) the unpaid
rent from March and April 2024; (2) late fees; and (3) the accelerated
remedy. (Compl., ¶¶18-20.) None of the causes of action in the Complaint are
premised solely on the accelerated damages provision. The breach of contract
cause of action alleges, “As a result of UTC’s failure to make payments due
under the contract, WSS was harmed in an amount to be determined at trial.”
(Compl., ¶31.) The fifth cause of action for unjust enrichment also alleges
damages according to proof. (Id. at ¶53.) The remaining causes of action
rely on the damages set forth in paragraph 19, which includes the late fees and
unpaid rent from March and April 2024. (Id. at ¶¶37, 44, 49, 59.) To the
extent the demurrer is based on only one portion of the damages sought, it does
not overcome an entire cause of action and cannot be sustained on that basis. (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119 [“[a]
demurrer must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained”].)
 
Nor has Defendant otherwise shown
that any of the causes of action are insufficiently alleged based on improper
damages. None of the cases to which the demurrer cites involve the damages allegation
at the pleading stage except Ochs v. PacifiCare of California (2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 782. Ochs, however, does not analyze what must be alleged
for damages when seeking quantum meruit recovery. (Ochs v. PacifiCare of
California (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 782, 794.) Therefore, the Complaint
states facts sufficient to allege each of the causes of action.

Ultra Tokyo Connections, LLC’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
