And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by defendant Jerome Gardner, individually, and dba Jerome's Socal Home Improvement, to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff Joy Unaeze-Nze. The demurrer was brought on the grounds that the complaint does not set forth what duty was owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, the breach of which caused the plaintiff's damages. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first cause of action for negligence, finding that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to support the element of duty.

However, the judge has sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, finding that there is no independent cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and that the damages alleged are limited to cases where a preexisting relationship between the parties creates a duty of care or where the damage arises out of an intentional tort. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint to correct the defects with respect to the second cause of action.
