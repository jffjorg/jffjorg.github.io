And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a petition from Westlake Direct, LLC to confirm an arbitration award. The petition was filed on April 29, 2024, but no proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing has been filed. The arbitration agreement does not specify the manner of service, so the petition must be served in the manner of service for a summons. The judge finds that the petition does not conform to the statutory requirements and therefore denies the petition without prejudice to filing and serving an amended petition that conforms to the requirements. The judge orders the petitioner to give notice.
