  Hearing Date:  January 26, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Motion for relief from dismissal
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Amy Derry (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that she rents the property at 802 N. Glenoaks Blvd. in Burbank from Defendants
Khanh Mai and Nhat Bui (“Defendants”). 
Plaintiff alleges that she and Defendant entered into a rental agreement
on April 17, 2020, which dictated that she pays $1,900 in monthly rent and the
lease term would be for 6 months from April 20, 2020 to October 20, 2020 for
the middle unit of a tri-plex.  (Compl.,
¶¶8-9.)  Plaintiff alleges that she paid
6 months up front, plus a security deposit for a total amount of $13,300 to be
paid in 2 installments of $6,650 on April 17 and April 20, 2020.  (Id., ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges that the unit was not ready
for occupancy on April 20, 2021, but was instead ready on April 24, 2021
(Plaintiff alleges 2021 dates).  (Id.,
¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges that though the
unit was listed at $1,800 per month, Defendants insisted on $1,900 per month
because Plaintiff’s cats may cause damage to the floor; however, Plaintiff
alleges that the floors were already damaged before her move.  (Id., ¶12.)  Plaintiff also alleges that since moving into
the property, she has experienced unhabitable conditions, such as a non-working
stove, need for roof repairs (though her roof did not leak), fear of a brick
wall crumbling, several windows not closing properly, having to provide her own
smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, unsafe heating unit, bugs dropping from
walls, rotting wood on the patio, a clogged toilet, low water pressure, a
harassing neighbor/tenant, and a cumbersome entertainment center left in the
unit.  (Id., ¶¶13-28.)  Plaintiff alleges that despite Defendants’
knowledge of the above, they failed to take any actions to remedy the
issues.  (Id., ¶29.)  
            The complaint, filed October 27,
2021, alleges causes of action for: (1) nuisance; (2) violation of Civil Code,
§ 1940.2; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment; (5) negligence; (6) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (7)
breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (8) intentional
misrepresentation; (9) fraudulent concealment; and (10) negligent
misrepresentation.  
B.    
Relevant Background and Motion on Calendar 
On April 18, 2023, the parties attended
the Mandatory Settlement Conference with the Court where the case settled.  The Court agreed to retain jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.  
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed this
action with prejudice.  
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
ex parte application for motion for relief from dismissal and a separate motion
for relief from dismissal. 
            On December 12, 2023, the Court set
the motion on calendar.  The Court stated
that the ex parte papers shall serve as the moving papers.  Plaintiff was ordered to give notice.  
DISCUSSION
            Based on the Court’s review of the
ex parte application papers, the motion paper, and the documents filed in this
action, no proof of service of the documents has been filed.  At this time, the Court will continue the
hearing on this motion so that Plaintiff can file a proof of service showing
that the motion papers were served on Defendants.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff Amy Derry’s motion for relief from dismissal
is continued to February 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve the ex parte
application papers, the motion papers, the December 12, 2023 minute order of
the Court on Defendants, and notice of this order.  Proof of service of the documents must be filed
by the end of the business day on January 31, 2024.  Defendants may file an opposition and
Plaintiff may file a reply brief pursuant to code.    

Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
