And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, Haykgohi Zargarian, alleged that she was injured in a slip and fall accident at a Walmart Supercenter in Burbank and sought a trial preference based on her age (82 years old) and current medical condition. The plaintiff provided declarations from her counsel and a physician, Dr. Glenna Tolbert, stating that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. However, the court found that the evidence supporting the third factor regarding the plaintiff's health was sparse and did not show that her health was such that a preference was necessary. The court also noted that the plaintiff's counsel had not shown that a medical diagnosis or prognosis of the plaintiff was such that a preference was necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. As a result, the motion for trial preference was denied without prejudice. The case will be transferred to Department V of the Alhambra Courthouse on February 5, 2024, and the plaintiff may re-file the motion in the Alhambra Courthouse when they develop more compelling evidence to support their motion.
