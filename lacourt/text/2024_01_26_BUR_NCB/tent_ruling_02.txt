 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to be relieved as counsel 
  



 
Defense counsel, Jennifer B. Gardner
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Aneaka English,
WSRE South Carolina, LLC, WSRE Georgia, LLC, Selling N. Richmond, LLC, and WSRE
Florida, LLC (“Defendants”).  
Counsel filed the 5 motions to be relieved
as counsel on December 29, 2023.  Counsel
has filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declarations of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there are absolute and
irreparably breakdown in the attorney-client relationship stemming from
Defendants’ failure to communicate and cooperate in the representation.  Counsel states that the deterioration of the
relationship makes it unreasonably difficult for her to effectively represent
Defendants and creates a conflict of interest. 
(MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons,
Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing Defendants in this action.  
Counsel properly served Defendants and
their last known mailing and email addresses, which was confirmed by email
within the past 30 days of filing the motion.  The other parties to this action were also served
with the motion by mail and/or email.
As for future hearing dates, there are 2
motions to be relieved as counsel set for February 2, 2024, 7 motions to be
relieved as counsel set for February 9, 2024, 1 demurrer set for February 16,
2024 (and 1 reserved for that date), a motion to compel further discovery
responses set for March 1, 2024, and a Case Management Conference set for March
26, 2024.  No trial date has been
set.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Defendants
to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the 5 motions to be relieved
as counsel are granted.  The orders
electronically lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The orders will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on each of the
Defendants Aneaka English, WSRE South Carolina, LLC, WSRE Georgia, LLC, Selling
N. Richmond, LLC, and WSRE Florida, LLC. 

In addition, as Defendants WSRE South
Carolina, LLC, WSRE Georgia, LLC, Selling N. Richmond, LLC, and WSRE Florida,
LLC are corporate entities, they cannot represent themselves in propria persona.  (See Rogers v. Municipal Court (1988)
197 Cal.App.3d 1314, 1318.)  Thus, the
Court will set an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of Defendants
WSRE South Carolina, LLC, WSRE Georgia, LLC, Selling N. Richmond, LLC, and WSRE
Florida, LLC for March 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
