And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash subpoenas for records filed by the plaintiff, David Marcus King. The motion was filed in response to subpoenas served on various medical providers, including LA City Fire Department/EMS Records Unit, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center/Medical Records, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center/Billing, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center/Radiology Department, and Synergistic Systems, LLC. The subpoenas seek a wide range of documents, including medical records, billing information, and radiology reports, dating back 10 years prior to the present.

The judge has found that the subpoenas are unreasonably broad in scope and will modify them to limit their scope and time. The modified subpoenas will be limited to Plaintiff's musculoskeletal and neurological systems, excluding his internal medicine records, and will be limited to a period of 5 years from the date of the incident. The judge has also ordered that the defendants will re-serve the subpoenas with the modified specifications.

The judge's decision is based on the principle that a plaintiff may not withhold information that relates to any physical or mental condition that they have put in issue by bringing the lawsuit. The judge has also considered the fact that a plaintiff suing for personal injuries waives the physician-patient privilege to some extent, but this does not make discoverable all of a plaintiff's lifetime medical history. The judge has determined that the documents sought regarding the accident and plaintiff's purported injuries are relevant to the case and necessary for the defendants to evaluate the extent of the plaintiff's injuries and their liability.
