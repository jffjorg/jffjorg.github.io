And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the 5 motions to be relieved as counsel filed by Jennifer B. Gardner, counsel for the defendants. The motions were filed due to an absolute and irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, stemming from the defendants' failure to communicate and cooperate in the representation. The judge notes that Counsel has properly served the defendants and other parties to the action with the motion. The orders will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on each of the defendants. Additionally, the judge has set an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of the corporate defendants for March 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., as they cannot represent themselves in propria persona.
