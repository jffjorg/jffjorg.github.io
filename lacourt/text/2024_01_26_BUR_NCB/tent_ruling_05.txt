[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel



 
Plaintiff’s counsel, William E. Jemmott
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Robert Clark
(“Plaintiff”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on December 7, 2023.  Counsel has filed the requisite MC-051 form
pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362, but has not filed the MC-052 declaration and
MC-053 proposed order forms. 
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because Plaintiff and Counsel have a
difference in opinion concerning this matter that has resulted in a conflict
such that Counsel can no longer represented Plaintiff.  Counsel states that trial is on May 13, 2024
and both Plaintiff and Defendant have been deposed, the parties have a
discovery dispute that has resolved pending receipt of medical records.  (MC-031 Form.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw
from representing Plaintiff in this action. 

Counsel served Plaintiff and defense
counsel by email and mail.  However, the
Court cannot ascertain whether Plaintiff’s email was verified within the past
30 days of filing this motion.  (See
e.g., MC-052 Form.)  
As for future hearing dates, the Informal
Discovery Conference is set for February 14, 2024, the Final Status Conference
is set for May 2, 2024 and the Non-Jury Trial is set for May 13, 2024.  Trial is approaching for this personal injury
(motor vehicle accident) case.  As such,
Plaintiff should make efforts to retain counsel.  If new counsel diligently and promptly
undertakes representation, the court will consider one reasonable continuance. 
The motion to be relieved as counsel is continued
to February 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  By the
end of the business day on January 29, 2024, Counsel is ordered to file with
the Court and serve on the parties the MC-052 and MC-053 forms to accompany the
motion to be relieved as counsel.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
