And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses from the defendant. The plaintiff filed the motion after the defendant failed to respond to discovery requests served on November 1, 2023. The defendant eventually responded on January 18, 2024, arguing that he had provided responses without objection and that the motion was moot. The judge agrees that the motion is moot in light of the defendant's responses, but notes that the defendant's responses were untimely. The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $60 to the plaintiff, which covers the filing fee costs for the motion. The judge also orders the defendant to comply with his discovery obligations in the future and warns that failure to do so may result in increased sanctions.
