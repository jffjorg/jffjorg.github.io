And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Christopher Goodroe, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gerardo Hernandez, Jr. The motion was filed on December 15, 2023, and states that there has been a breakdown in communication between counsel and Plaintiff, making it impossible for counsel to actively and in good faith continue to represent Plaintiff. The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel properly served Plaintiff at his last known mailing address and that Defendant has not yet been served with the summons and complaint. The judge concludes that there is sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel and grants the motion. The order will be signed at the hearing on January 26, 2024, and will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff. Notice of the order will be provided by Plaintiff's counsel.
