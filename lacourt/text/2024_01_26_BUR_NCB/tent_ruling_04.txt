[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to compel responses



 
On December 18,
2023, Plaintiff Ariella Lousky (“Plaintiff”) filed a motion to compel initial
responses from Defendant Douglas Peter Richter (“Defendant”) for Special
Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one.  
On November 1,
2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests, such that responses
were due by December 6, 2023.  As of the
filing of the motions, Plaintiff states that she has not received responses
from Defendant.  
On January 18,
2024, Defendant (in pro per) filed an untimely opposition brief.  First, he argues that he has provided
responses without objection as of January 18, 2024.  (Opp. at Ex. 1.)  As such, the motion is moot as to its
substantive merits.  Second, he argues
that he acted within substantial justification such that sanctions are not
warranted because Plaintiff did not meet and confer, and he believed he had
more time to respond to discovery in light of the amount of SROGs propounded on
him.  For a motion to compel initial
responses, Plaintiff was not obligated to engage in meet and confer discussions—in
contrast to the meet and confer requirement for motions to compel further
responses.  In addition, Defendant does
not appear to have timely objected or moved for a protective order regarding
the number of SROGs propounded on him. 
Plaintiff propounded 164 SROGs on Defendant.  In the opposition brief, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff did not file a declaration to support the excessive numbers of
SROGs propounded.  However, the last page
of the SROG exhibit (Mot., Ex. A) includes the Declaration re: Additional
Discovery.  While the objection was not
timely raised, the Court will consider the objection in ascertaining whether
sanctions are proper as the number of SROGs is unreasonably high in this action
for breach of the lease agreement.    
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses to the SROG is moot in light of the Defendant’s responses to the
SROGs. 
Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $2,760 for this motion.  The Court will award sanctions in the amount
of $60 only, which accounts for the filing fee costs for this motion.  In the future, Defendant is ordered to comply
with his discovery obligations, timely object, and/or move for a protective
order; otherwise, the Court will be inclined to increase the sanctions imposed
against Defendant for failure to timely comply with his discovery
obligations.  Defendant is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $60 to Plaintiff,
by and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
