Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the parties' briefing and evidence on the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Court finds that the arbitration provision is moderately procedurally unconscionable due to the unequal bargaining power of the parties and the lack of notice of the arbitration provision. The Court also notes that the arbitration provision is buried in the License Agreement, which may not have been adequately disclosed to the Plaintiff. The Court invites oral argument on the substantive unconscionability of the arbitration provision, including the impact of the assumption of risk defense and the shortening of the statute of limitations. The Court also requests argument on whether the Defendant has waived its right to arbitrate by engaging in litigation inconsistent with its intent to arbitrate.
