**Significant Statements**
```
* The Complaint does not meet the requisite level of specificity because it fails to allege how General Motors obtained its knowledge of the defect and how such knowledge of a defect was not equally available to the Plaintiff.
* The Complaint fails to identify that Martin Chevrolet is an authorized dealership of General Motors.
* The Court notes that a transactional relationship test can be met indirectly, i.e., by virtue of an allegation that the Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle from an authorized General Motors dealer.
* The Demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.
* The Motion to Strike is MOOTED.
