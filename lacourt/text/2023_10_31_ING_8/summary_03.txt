```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's Motion to Strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state facts sufficient to plead punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to amend its FAC within 20 days. The Plaintiff's allegations are vague and lack specificity, failing to provide sufficient facts to support its claim for punitive damages. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to provide more specific allegations regarding which security guard made a statement about the dangerous condition, whether Apex Security Group was in charge of ensuring the premises was safe, and whether the statement was authorized or ratified by management.
