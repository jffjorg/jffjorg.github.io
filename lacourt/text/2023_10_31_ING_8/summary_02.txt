And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiff's attorneys, Jason M. Stone and Blake S. Slater, to be relieved as counsel. The attorneys filed a motion to withdraw due to irreconcilable differences with the Plaintiff, which have caused a breakdown in their attorney-client relationship. The judge found that the attorneys complied with all procedural requirements and that the withdrawal would not cause an injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The judge will discuss the trial setting at the hearing. The order granting the motion will be signed at the hearing and will not be effective until proof of service on the Plaintiff and Defendant has been filed with the court.
