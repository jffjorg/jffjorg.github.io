English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the declaratory relief cause of action, finding that the complaint does not state a proper subject for declaratory relief and that the cause of action is duplicative of another cause of action. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the common count cause of action, finding that the complaint does not plead a sum certain owed to the plaintiff. The judge allows the plaintiff 5 days to amend the complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer to the appropriation of name and likeness causes of action, finding that the language of the contract does not permit the use of the plaintiff's name and likeness. The judge orders oral argument on the contractual interpretation issue and whether it should be resolved on demurrer or with a later motion.
