  Case Number:  21VECV00692    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  T 21VECV00692 AKHOUNDZADEH V KHATIBI[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Cross-Defendant Shabnam Akhoundzadeh’s Motion for Summary Judgment and the alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication against the Third Amended Cross-Complaint are DENIED.Cross-Defendant Shabnam Akhoundzadeh’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED but not as to any hearsay or facts in dispute.Cross-Complainants Richard Khatibi, Faezeh Afchehe, and Melica Khatibi’s request for a continuance is DENIED.IntroductionOn March 24, 2023, Cross-Defendant Shabnam Akhoundzadeh (Shabnam or Cross-Defendant) moved for summary judgment (MSJ) or alternatively for summary adjudication (MSA) against Cross-Complainants Richard Khatibi (Richard), Faezeh Afchehe (Faezeh), and Melica Khatibi’s (Melica) (collectively, Cross-Complainants) Third Amended Cross-Complaint (TAXC).  The MSJ/MSA specifically moved against the fifteenth cause of action (COA) for malicious prosecution, which is the only remaining COA alleged against Cross-Defendant. The MSJ/MSA was originally heard on December 6, 2023, and reviewed as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.  As a result of the December 6, 2023, Order, Cross-Complainants filed an Amendment to the TAXC on January 3, 2024.  The March 24, 2023, MSJ/MSA was re-set to be heard on this date.  Cross-Defendant filed their Amended Opposition briefs on January 9, 2024. ProcedureCross-Complainants argued that the MSJ/MSA is procedurally defective because Cross-Defendant failed to tie the factual references in the memorandum to the separate statement and/or to exhibits and declarations.  Providing citation to either separate statement and/or the exhibits/declarations would have made review of the MSJ/MSA much easier, Cross-Complainants argument does not legal authority requiring a denial of the MSJ/MSA based upon Cross-Defendant’s memorandum’s failure to cite to the separate statement or evidence.  Cross-Complainants’ citation to Fleet v. CBS, Inc. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1911, 1916, fn. 3 and Collins v. Hertz Corp., (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 64 are unavailing because those cases involved a failure to submit an adequate separate statement.  Cross-Defendant has submitted an adequate separate statement with the MSJ/MSA.  Cross-Complainants’ procedural argument is unpersuasive.Discussion Shabnam argued that there is no triable issue of fact as to the element of lack of probable cause in filing or prosecuting the underlying complaint.  Shabnam provided that the Karen Property was titled in the name of Karen Dr. LLC on December 13, 2011, through a short sale.  (Cross-Defendant Amended Separate Statement of Facts (XDASSF 4-5.)  Shabnam provided that she is the 100% owner of Karen Dr. LLC up through the administrative dissolution of the LLC on October 1, 2012.  (XDASSF 3, 6, 23, and 26.)  With the administrative dissolution, Shabnam provided that she became the owner of the Karen Property as opined by three attorneys.  Shabnam provided that three attorneys opined the same.  (XDASSF 13-15, 33-35, and 40.)  Shabnam further asserted that she had probable cause to file the underlying complaint because Melica recorded a fraudulent grant deed on the Karen Property purporting to transfer title to Faezeh.  The fraudulent grant deed was recorded on April 18, 2019.  Based upon Faezeh and Melica’s fraudulent conduct and evidence of ownership of the Karen Property and the fact that the underlying complaint was filed by counsel, Shabnam sufficiently showed that there is evidence to support that she had probable cause to file the complaint on May 24, 2021 that alleged quiet title, fraud and deceit, conversion, unjust enrichment, rescission, cancellation of deed, ejectment, civil conspiracy, and declaratory relief related to the Karen Property.  Shabnam met her initial burden of proof as to the lack of probable cause element.Cross-Complainants disputed that Shabnam had title ownership of the Karen Property.  Cross-Complainants provided evidence to show that Shabnam executed a quitclaim deed transferring the Karen Property in 2014 to Ebrahim Khatibi (Ebrahim).  (Cross-Complainants’ Amended Separate Statement of Facts in Dispute (XCASSFD) 12, 14, 15, 31, 34, 35, and 40:  See Decl. of Fahim Farivar, Exh. 3: pg. 37: 21-22, pg. 38: 19-25, pg. 39: 1-16.)  With the additional fact showing that Shabnam quitclaimed her interest in the Karen Property to Ebrahim in 2014, there is a triable issue of fact as to Shabnam’s ownership interest in the Karen Property in 2021 when the Complaint was filed and thus there is a triable issue of fact as to lack of probable cause.The MSJ/MSA based upon the element of lack of probable cause is DENIED.Shabnam then argued that there is no triable issue of material fact as to a termination in favor of Cross-Complainants.  Shabnam provided that she voluntarily dismissed the complaint not on the lack of merit but for other reasons.   (XDASSF 17, 37, 35A, and 43A.)  A voluntary dismissal is presumed to be a termination favorable to the dismissed party, unless otherwise proved to the jury.  (Sycamore Ridge Apts. LLC v. Naumann (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1399-1400.)  Shabnam’s own evidence/testimony provided evidence to show that the dismissal may have been on the merits because Shabnam admitted to signing a quitclaim deed in 2014 transferring the Karen Property to Ebrahim.  (Shabnam Decl. pars. 9, and 25-26.)  The evidence would tend to show that the underlying complaint lacked merit.  Shabnam failed to meet her initial burden of proof on the element of favorable termination and the burden did not shift to Cross-Complainants. The MSJ/MSA on the element of favorable termination is DENIED. Shabnam then argued that there is no triable issue of fact to show that complaint was initiated with malice.  (XDASSF 18, 38.)  The malice element relates to the underlying plaintiff's subjective intent or purpose in initiating the prior action.  (Jenkins v. Brandt-Hawley (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1357, 1383-1384.)  However, the malice required need not amount to actual hostility or ill will toward plaintiff.  Malice also exists when the proceedings are instituted primarily for an improper purpose (subjective test)—i.e., to misuse the legal system for something other than enforcing legitimate rights.  (Albertson v. Raboff (1956) 46 Cal.2d 375, 383.)  Shabnam argued that the facts show lack of malice because of counsel’s opinion in filing the complaint, her own knowledge, and the fraudulent deed between Melica and Faezeh.  However, as provided above, there is a triable issue of fact as to lack of probable cause based upon Shabnam’s 2014 quitclaim deed.  The lack of probable cause in filing/prosecuting the complaint supports an inference that the Shabnam acted with malice.  (Soukop v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 292.)  Cross-Complainants provided facts to show that the underlying complaint was filed/prosecuted for an improper purpose because Cross-Complainants present evidence that Ebrahim was the driving force behind Shabnam and the underlying complaint.  (XCASSF 13-15, 33-35, 40, 35A, and 43A.)  With facts presenting evidence of a misuse of the legal system, there is a triable issue of fact as to the element of malice.The MSJ/MSA on the element of malice is DENIED.Shabnam argued that there is no triable issue of fact as to the affirmative defense of advice of counsel.  Good faith reliance on advice of counsel, after truthful disclosure of all the relevant facts, is a complete defense.  (Bisno v. Douglas Emmett Realty Fund 1988 (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1534, 1544.)  Shabnam’s facts to show a “truthful disclosure of all the relevant facts” is disputed by Cross-Complainants because Cross-Complainants presented evidence that Shabnam executed a quitclaim deed in 2014, which presented evidence that Shabnam did not have title ownership to dispute Cross-Complainants claims to the Karen Property.  In that there is a triable issue of fact as to the affirmative defense, the MSJ/MSA on the defense is unpersuasive.The MSJ/MSA as to the defense of advice of counsel is DENIED.Shabnam then argued the defense of unclean hands.  “[T]he unclean hands doctrine … is an equitable rationale for refusing a plaintiff relief where principles of fairness dictate that the plaintiff should not recover, regardless of the merits of his claim.”  (Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 970, 985.)  Shabnam presented that Cross-Complainants had unclean hands based upon the 2019 forged grant deed.  However, Cross-Complainants provided facts to show that Melica’s signature on the grant deed did not have any intent to defraud/commit forgery and was signed at the instruction of Aliasghar Khatibi – the manager of the Karen Property.  (XCASSF 19 and 39 – without considering Melica’s declaration due to the sustaining of the evidentiary objections against Melica’s declaration.)  Cross-Complainants sufficiently presented facts to show a triable issue on the defense of unclean hands.The MSJ/MSA as to the defense of unclean hands is DENIED. Cross-Complainants request for a continuance is DENIED.IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
