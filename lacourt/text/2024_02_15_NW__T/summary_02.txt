And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by LED Electric Wholesale, Inc. (LED) against Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. (Home Depot) is sustained. This means that the Cross-Complaint, which alleges indemnification, contribution, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief, is insufficient as pled and fails to state a claim. The judge found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint are conclusory and lack facts to support the claims, and that the pleading defects cannot be cured by the opposition. However, the judge grants LED leave to amend the Cross-Complaint within 20 days to cure the pleading defects, but only to the extent of adding facts to support the claims, not to add new causes of action.
