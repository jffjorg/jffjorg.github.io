And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to refund the purchase price without litigation. The judge does not believe this experience will cause her to be biased, but she is disclosing it to avoid any appearance of bias. If either party believes the judge's experience may affect her impartiality, they must file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by January 18, 2024. The hearing on the Case Management Conference is continued to February 26, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service promptly after service.
