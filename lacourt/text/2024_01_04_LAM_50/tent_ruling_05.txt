[1]Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration in support of the further reply “to explain the
tardiness of [the] brief.” (Galletta Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel states
that her “brother unexpectedly had a seizure while driving and was hospitalized
in intensive care for several days as a result thereof,” and that this “kept
[her] out of town longer than [she] had originally planned and interfered with
[her] ability to finalize the brief before [her] return to the office and by
the stated deadline.” (Galletta Decl., ¶ 7.) In light of the foregoing, the
Court will consider the further reply.
