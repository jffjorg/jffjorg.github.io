```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to permit a continuance of the hearing on Ringlogix's motion to quash service of summons for lack of jurisdiction to allow the plaintiff to conduct discovery on jurisdictional issues. The plaintiff may conduct discovery on jurisdictional issues only and may file a supplemental opposition to the instant motion and Ringlogix may file a supplemental reply. The judge notes that the plaintiff's request for a further continuance should be denied for the sole reason that Ringlogix agreed to provide the specific revenue and customer count figures the plaintiff requested subject to a protective order with an attorneys-eyes only designation.

The judge also vacates the January 18, 2024 hearing on Ringlogix's previous August 11, 2023 motion, which had sought to quash service of summons for lack of jurisdiction, as the plaintiff has filed an amended complaint that supersedes the original complaint.
