 
BACKGROUND
            
            On June 6,
2022, Plaintiff Phillip A Newman (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Custom Creation (an unknown entity), Levi Smith, and Does 1 to 50,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of written contract, (2) negligence,
(3) violation of Business and Professions Code section 7150, et seq., (4)
conversion, and (5) fraud.
 
            The
Complaint alleges the following. In or about June 2021, Plaintiff and the defendants
entered into a written contract for kitchen cabinetry manufacturing,
installation, and design. (Compl., ¶ 6.) At all times relevant to the
Complaint, Defendant Levi Smith represented that he was duly licensed to do the
work, but that representation was false. (Compl., ¶ 7.) In addition, the
project was supposed to take 8 to 10 weeks (i.e., end by September or October
2021). (Compl., ¶ 8.) Instead, no work was performed even though Plaintiff had
paid a deposit of $16,000. (Compl., ¶¶ 6, 9.) Moreover, the defendants stopped
communicating with Plaintiff and refused to return the money paid. (Compl., ¶ 10.)
 
            On
September 6, 2022, default was entered against Defendants Levi Smith and Custom
Creation. 
 
            On December
4, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s application for default judgment because
the amount Plaintiff requested exceeded the Court’s jurisdiction.
 
            On February
21, 2024, the Court held a hearing on an Order to Show Cause Re: Plaintiff’s
Request for Entry of Default Judgment. At the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
advised the Court that Plaintiff would file a noticed motion to reclassify this
action from the limited to unlimited jurisdiction court. 
 
            On March
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to reclassify. 
 
            As of April
30, 2024, no opposition to the motion has been filed.
 
MOVING PARTY’S
POSITION
 
This case should be reclassified
from a limited to unlimited civil case because the amount in controversy
exceeds $35,000. Specifically, Plaintiff suffered $16,000 due to conversion,
$10,000 due to delays in completion of the contract, and $9,639 replacement
costs for the installation of the kitchen cabinets. Those damages exceed
$35,000. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            None.
 
REPLY
 
            None. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          MOTION TO RECLASSIFY CASE TO UNLIMITED
CIVIL CASE
 
A.        Legal
Standard 
“The designation of a case as either a limited or an unlimited action has
significant implications because the available relief and applicable procedures
differ as to each. Most significantly, if a case is designated as a limited civil
case, the court has no authority (i.e., jurisdiction) to award a judgment in
excess of $25,000 [now $35,000 due to change in law].”  Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 266, 274–275 (“Ytuarte”). 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 85, “a proceeding may not be
treated as a limited civil action unless all of the following conditions are
satisfied: (a) the amount in controversy does not exceed [$35,000]; (b) the
relief sought is a type that may be granted in a limited civil case; and (c)
the relief sought is exclusively of a type described in the statutes, including
section 86, that classify an action as a limited civil case or that provide the
action is within the jurisdiction of a court presiding over limited civil
cases.” Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 275; Code
Civ. Proc., § 85, subd. (a).
 
“Whether an action qualifies as a limited or unlimited civil action is
determined initially from the prayer or demand for relief in the plaintiff's
complaint.” Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 274. “If,
however, a matter has been designated as an unlimited action, and yet the
amount of controversy is [$35,000] or less, the statutory scheme authorizes ‘reclassification’
of the case as a ‘limited’ action and transfer of the matter to a superior
court presiding over such actions.  ([Code
Civ. Proc.,] § 403.040, subd. (a).).” Ibid.
 
According to the California Supreme Court, “a matter may be reclassified
as a limited civil action ‘when (i) the absence of jurisdiction is apparent
before trial from the complaint, petition, or related documents, or (ii) during
the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will
‘necessarily’ result in a verdict below the superior court’s jurisdictional
amount ….’” Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 276, citing Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 279.)  In other words, a superior court cannot
reclassify a case “as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil
court) unless it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff’s damages will
necessarily be less than [$35,000].” Id. at p. 277. That “standard of ‘legal
certainty’ is not met when it appears a verdict within the unlimited court’s
jurisdiction is ‘possible.’” Ibid.
 
B.        Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel attests to the following facts in support of the instant motion to
reclassify. “Plaintiff entered into a contract with the Defendant for the
timely
completion and installation of kitchen cabinetry. Pursuant
to the contract, Plaintiff made deposit for 50% of the listed contract price.
Plaintiff continued to perform their covenants as specified in the contract.
However, Defendant failed to perform ant of their covenants under contract. As
a result, the Plaintiff suffered $16,000 due to conversion, $10,000 due to
delays in completion of the contract, and $9,639 replacement costs for the
installation of the kitchen cabinets. This total exceeds $35,000.” Motion,
Declaration of Joseph W. Kellener, ¶
3.
 
Based on Plaintiff’s unopposed motion, the Court finds that
Plaintiff’s damages may exceed this Court’s jurisdictional amount of $35,000. 
 
Accordingly, the request to reclassify this case as
unlimited is granted. 
 
 
II.        CONCLUSION 
            
            Plaintiff Phillip A
Newman’s Motion for Reclassification of Action from Limited to Unlimited is
GRANTED.
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 403.010 through
403.090, the entire action is ordered reclassified as a civil unlimited
jurisdiction case.
 
Counsel
for Plaintiff is ordered to pay the reclassification fees within 20-days from
this Court’s Ruling.
