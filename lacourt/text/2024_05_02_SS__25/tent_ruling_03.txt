    BACKGROUND                          On December  14, 2020, Plaintiff Pensco Trust Company LLC fbo Caesar Berger IRA50% and  Plaintiff Pensco Trust Company LLC fbo Inna Berger IRA50% (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Felix Bobritsky, Yelena  Bobritsky, Cooper Dietz Daniala Bobritsky, Shoshanah Bobritsky, and Does 1 to  5, for disobedience of subpoenas and court orders.                The  Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiffs are the Judgment Creditors of an  unsatisfied December 11, 2013 Judgment of $23,492.96 against Felix Bobritsky  and $11,440.50 against Yelena Bobritsky (the “Judgment”) in Los Angeles  Superior Court Case number #13R02212. (Compl., ¶ 1.) “Felix and Yelena  Bobritsky have two daughters, Daniala Bobritsky who is married to Cooper Dietz,  and Shoshanah Bobritsky.” (Compl., ¶ 2.) The defendants conspired to violate the  subpoenas and court orders to prevent Plaintiffs’ recovery of the Judgment.  (Compl., ¶ 5.) “Defendants’ willful disobedience of and failure to appear  pursuant to the subpoenas and court orders damaged Plaintiffs by preventing  recovery on the Judgment and costs and attorney fees caused by their  disobedience.” (Compl., ¶ 15.)               On January  24, 2023, the case was reclassified to limited jurisdiction.                 On March  22, 2023, the Court entered default judgment of $7,412 against the defendants.                On March  28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel response to their interrogatories.                 As of April  29, 2024, no opposition to the motion has been filed.    MOVING PARTY’S  POSITION   This Court entered judgment against  Felix and Yelena Bobritsky for $7,412, which remains unsatisfied. Therefore,  Plaintiffs served “Interrogatories to Enforce Judgment” on those defendants,  but both have refused to respond to the discovery.    OPPOSITION               None.   REPLY               None.    ANALYSIS   I.          MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO  INTERROGATORIES TO ENFORCE JUDGMENT   A.        Legal  Standard  A. Interrogatories by Judgment  Creditors    “The judgment creditor may propound  written interrogatories to the judgment debtor, in the manner provided in  Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 2030.010) of Title 4 of Part 4, requesting  information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment. The judgment debtor  shall answer the interrogatories in the manner and within the time provided by  Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 2030.010) of Title 4 of Part 4.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 708.020, subd. (a).)   “The judgment creditor may not  serve interrogatories pursuant to this section within 120 days after the  judgment debtor has responded to interrogatories previously served pursuant to  this section or within 120 days after the judgment debtor has been examined  pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 708.110), and the judgment  debtor is not required to respond to any interrogatories so served.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 708.020, subd. (b).)   “Interrogatories served pursuant to  this section may be enforced, to the extent practicable, in the same manner as  interrogatories in a civil action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.020, subd. (c).)               “The  limitation provided by Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 2030.010) of Title 4  of Part 4 on the number of interrogatories that may be propounded applies to  each set of interrogatories propounded from time to time pursuant to this  section, but does not apply cumulatively to interrogatories propounded by the  judgment creditor to the judgment debtor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.020, subd.  (d).)               B.  Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories    “Any party may obtain discovery  within the scope delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 2017.010), and  subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section  2019.010), by propounding to any other party to the action written interrogatories  to be answered under oath.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010, subd. (a).) “Except  as provided in Section 2030.070 [regarding interrogatories], no party shall, as  a matter of right, propound to any other party more than 35 specially prepared  interrogatories. If the initial set of interrogatories does not exhaust this  limit, the balance may be propounded in subsequent sets.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.030, subd. (b).)   “Within 30 days after service” of  interrogatories, the responding party shall serve responses to the discovery  “unless on motion” of the propounding party, the court has shortened the time  for response, or “on motion” of the responding party, the court has extended  the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).)   “If a party to whom interrogatories  are directed fails to serve a timely response…[t]he party to whom the  interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce  writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or the protection for work product[.]” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)   B.        Discussion                Plaintiffs’  counsel attests to the following facts in support of the motion. On December  11, 2013, the court in Pensco Trust Company FBO Caesar Berge IRA50%, et al.  v. Felix Bobritsky; et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number  #13R02212, entered judgment against Felix Bobritsky for $23,492.96 and spouse  Yelena Bobritsky for $11,440.50 (Motion, Declaration of Robert Gentino (“Gentino  Decl.”), ¶ 1.) The defendants disobeyed orders to appear for examination in the  Santa Monica Action, resulting in bench warrants being issued against them.  (Gentino Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) On December 14, 2020, Plaintiff filed this action for  statutory damages resulting from the defendants’ disobedience of subpoenas and  court orders. (Gentino Decl., ¶ 5.) On March 22, 2023, this Court entered  judgment against the defendants for $7,412, which remains unsatisfied. (Gentino  Decl., ¶ 6.) On May 15, 2023, counsel propounded a set of Plaintiffs’ “Interrogatories  to Enforce Judgment” on each defendant, asking them to answer 35 interrogatories,  but the defendants did not respond. (Gentino Decl., ¶ 7.)               In light of  counsel’s declaration and the defendants’ failure to oppose the motion, the  Court finds it proper to grant the request to compel the defendants’ initial  responses to Plaintiffs’ interrogatories.    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order  compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including  the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,  subd. (c).)   The Court finds it proper to impose  sanctions.    Plaintiffs seek sanctions of  $2,018.91, consisting of 2.5 hours counsel spent on the moving papers, 0.50  hours counsel anticipated spending reviewing the opposition, drafting the  reply, and appearing at the hearing, a total of 3 hours at counsel’s billing  rate of $650 per hour (equals $1,950), plus a $68.91 filing fee. (Gentino  Decl., ¶ 8.)               However,  since the defendants did not oppose the motion and a reply was not filed, the  Court will deduct $195 (representing 0.30 hours at counsel’s billing rate of  $650 per hour) from the requested sanctions and, therefore, impose sanctions of  only $1,823.91.    II.        CONCLUSION                           Plaintiffs Pensco Trust  Company LLC FBO Caesar Berger IRA50% and Pensco Trust Company LLC FBO Inna  Berger IRA50%’s Motion to Compel Response to Interrogatories to Enforce  Judgment is GRANTED.    Defendants Felix Bobritsky and  Yelena Bobritsky are ordered to serve initial responses, without objections, to  the Interrogatories to Enforce Judgment within 30 days of this Court’s ruling.    The defendants, jointly and severally,  are further ordered  to pay sanctions of $1,823.91 to the plaintiff, within 30-days of this Court’s  order.               Moving  party to give notice.
