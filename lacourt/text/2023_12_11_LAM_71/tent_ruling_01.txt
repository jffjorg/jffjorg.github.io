  vs.
 
CARL SHAFF, II, et al.


 Case
  No.:  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 11, 2023



 
Defendant
Benson Williams II’s motion for an order staying all judicial proceedings in
this matter as it pertains to him is denied. 

 
Defendant Benson Williams II (“Williams”)
(“Defendant”) moves for an order staying all judicial proceedings in this matter
as it pertains to Williams pending the resolution of pro per Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins’ (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) pending appeal in the Second
Appellate District (Case No. B331035). 
(Notice Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §916.)
 
Procedural Background
On March 23, 2023, this Court sustained in
part and overruled in part Defendants Williams’, US Storage Centers, Inc.’s, Westport
Properties, Inc.’s, and Hawthorne Mini Venture, LLC’s (collectively the “Storage
Defendants”) Demurrers to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  The demurrers had the effect of dismissing US
Storage Centers, Inc., Westport Properties, Inc., and Hawthorne Mini Venture,
LLC from the instant case.
On April 21, 2023, Judgment was entered for
US Storage Centers, Inc., Westport Properties, Inc., and Hawthorne Mini
Venture, LLC and against Plaintiff.
The ruling on the demurrers allows
Plaintiff to continue to proceed against Williams upon certain causes of action
of the SAC.  Williams filed his Answer to
the SAC on April 7, 2023. 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff appealed from this
Judgment as to US Storage Centers, Inc., Westport Properties, Inc., and
Hawthorne Mini Venture, LLC. This appeal is pending in the Second Appellate
District (Case No. B331035).  Plaintiff’s
appeal is also from Judgment entered on April 21, 2023, for Defendants Lionel
Pereira and Southern California Coin and Stamps (collectively “Pereira
Defendants”).
Williams filed the instant motion on
October 27, 2023.  Plaintiff filed his
opposition on November 27, 2023. 
Williams filed his reply on December 4, 2023.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §916(a) provides: “Except as
provided in Sections 917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the
perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment
or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected
thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court
may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by
the judgment or order.”  (C.C.P.
§916(a), emphasis added.) 
“Trial courts generally have the inherent
power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.”  (Freiberg v. City of
Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489; Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 266.)
Whether a particular matter is “embraced
in” or “affected by” an appealed judgment or order so as to be subject to the
stay depends on whether the purpose of the stay would be frustrated by further
trial court proceedings on the matter. (Marriage of Varner (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
932, 936; Elsea v. Saberi (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 625, 629.)  Essentially, if trial court proceedings on
the particular matter would have any impact on the “effectiveness” of the
appeal, the proceedings are stayed; otherwise, the proceedings are permitted.  (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189; Franklin & Franklin v. 7-Eleven Owners for
Fair Franchising (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1173.)
 
Discussion
The Court denies Williams’ request for a
stay of proceedings.  Williams’ argument
pertaining to the outcome of the appeal is insufficient to warrant a stay.  The determination of which judgment is
subject to appeal is a purely clerical issue that must be resolved with the
Court of Appeal; the Court regards such confusion over the identity of the
Defendants subject to the appeal as rendering the instant motion premature. 
 
Conclusion
Defendant Williams’ motion for an order
staying all judicial proceedings in this matter as it pertains to him is
denied.  
Moving Party to give notice.
