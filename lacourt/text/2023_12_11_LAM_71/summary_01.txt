And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of defendant Benson Williams II for an order staying all judicial proceedings in this matter as it pertains to him. The defendant argued that the outcome of the appeal is uncertain and that the stay is necessary to avoid confusing the court of appeal about which judgment is subject to appeal. However, the judge found that the determination of which judgment is subject to appeal is a purely clerical issue that must be resolved with the court of appeal, and that the instant motion is premature. The judge also relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a), which provides that the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from, unless the trial court has discretion to proceed with other matters in the action. The judge concluded that the trial court has the discretion to proceed with the matter and denied the motion for stay.
