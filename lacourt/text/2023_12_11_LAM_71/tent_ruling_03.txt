Background
Plaintiff filed his operative Complaint on June 26, 2023, against Defendant,
alleging a single cause of action for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act
(Civ. Code §§51 et seq.).
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s several attempts to use and
navigate Defendant’s website, and his denial of the full use and enjoyment of
the facilities and services of the website as a result of accessibility
barriers on the website, and therefore deterred Plaintiff from visiting
Defendant’s California wine bar location.  (Complaint ¶7.)  Plaintiff
alleges he is permanently blind and uses screen readers to access the internet
and read website content.  (Complaint ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges that he genuinely wants to
avail himself of Defendant’s goods and services as offered on Defendant’s
website, but he also has the dual motivation as a “tester,” and has filed
multiple lawsuits against various operators of commercial websites under the Unruh
Civil Rights Act as part of Plaintiff’s advocacy work on behalf of the civil
rights of people with visual impairments. 
(Complaint ¶8.)
Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Defendant is a Defendant
owns and operates Rosenthal – The Malibu Estate Wine Bar and Patio located at
18741 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, California, and this location constitutes
a place of public accommodation.  (Complaint
¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s
location provides to the public important goods and/or services.  (Complaint ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s location is a public
accommodation within the definition of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.
§12181(7), and likewise is a “business establishment” within the meaning of the
Unruh Act, Civil Code §51(b).  (Complaint
¶9.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant also provides to the public its
website, https://rosenthalestatewines.com/ (the “Website”).  (Complaint ¶¶4, 10.)  Plaintiff alleges the Website provides access
to Defendant’s wine bar, including information concerning Defendant’s location,
descriptions of its menus, amenities and services, hours, calendar of events,
wine club, online store and many other benefits related to its facility and
services.  (Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges the Website is a public
accommodation within the definition of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.
§12181(7).  (Complaint ¶10.)  
Plaintiff alleges The Website’s barriers are pervasive and
include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) missing alternative text
which presents a problem because an image without alternative text results in
an empty link; (2) image map area missing alternative text, which presents a problem
because alternative text is not present for an image map area (hot spot); (3) empty
or missing form labels which presents a problem because, if a form control does
not have a properly associated text label, the function or purpose of that form
control may not be presented to screen reader users; (4) multiple form labels,
which presents a problem because a form control has more than one label
associated with it; (5) empty links, which present a problem because a link
contains no text; (6) broken slip link, which presents a problem because the
target for the link does not exist or the link is not keyboard accessible; (7) broken
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (“ARIA”) references, which presents a problem
because an ARIA-labelled by or ARIA-described by reference exists, but the
target for the reference does not exist; and (8) broken ARIA menu, which
presents a problem because an ARIA menu does not contain required menu items.  (Complaint ¶22.)
On September 5, 2023, Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
accompanying motion to strike.  On November
28, 2023, Plaintiff filed its oppositions. 
On December 4, 2023, Defendant filed its replies.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Defendant demurs on the basis that Plaintiff’s cause of action for
violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action against it and is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible.  (Demurrer, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a).)  A declaration must be filed with a demurrer
regarding the results of the meet and confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration states he spoke to Plaintiffs’
counsel on August 10, 2023, addressing his client’s basis for demurring to the
Complaint, and the parties were unable to come to an agreement concerning the
issues he raised.  (Decl. of Arnold ¶2.)  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
          Violations of
the Unruh Civil Rights Act (1st COA)
“The Unruh Act provides: ‘All persons within the jurisdiction of
this state . . . no matter what their . . . disability . . . are entitled to
the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or
services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.’ (Civ. Code,
§ 51, subd. (b).) ‘A plaintiff can recover under the [Unruh Act] on two
alternate theories: (1) a violation of the ADA (Civ. Code, § 51, subd. (f)); or
(2) denial of access to a business establishment based on intentional
discrimination.’” (Martinez v. Cot’n Wash, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
1026, 1035, review denied (Nov. 9, 2022), quoting Martinez v. San
Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1059.)
“Civil Code section 51, subdivision (f) states: ‘A violation of
the right of any individual under the federal [ADA] shall also constitute a
violation of this section.’ The ADA provides in pertinent part: ‘No individual
shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal
enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or
accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who …
operates a place of public accommodation.’ The ADA defines discrimination as ‘a
failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures,
when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services,
facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with
disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications
would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities,
privileges, advantages, or accommodations.’”  (Baughman v. Walt Disney World Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1438, 1446.)
“When a plaintiff has visited a business’s website with intent to
use its services and alleges that the business’s terms and conditions exclude
him or her from full and equal access to its services, the plaintiff need not
enter into an agreement with the business to establish standing under the Unruh
Civil Rights Act. In general, a person suffers discrimination under the Act
when the person presents himself or herself to a business with an intent to use
its services but encounters an exclusionary policy or practice that prevents
him or her from using those services. We conclude that this rule applies to
online businesses and that visiting a website with intent to use its services
is, for purposes of standing, equivalent to presenting oneself for services at
a brick-and-mortar store.”  (White v.
Square, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1019, 1023; CACI 3060.)
          Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges he attempted to navigate Defendant’s Website on several
occasions and has been denied the full use and enjoyment of the facilities and
services of the Website as a result of the accessibility barriers of the
website, which is sufficient to allege standing under the Unruh Act.  (Complaint ¶7; White, 7 Cal.5th at pg.
1023.)  An individual plaintiff has
standing under the Unruh Act if he or she has been the victim of
the defendant’s discriminatory act.  (Angelucci
v. Century Supper Club (2007) 41 Cal.4th 160, 175.)  Angelucci held that “Plaintiffs
adequately alleged they had suffered an ‘invasion of legally protected
interests’ sufficient to afford them an interest in pursuing their action
vigorously.”  (Id. at 175.)  Here, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that
he is a victim of Defendant’s discriminatory act by being denied the full use
of the Website “despite several attempts to use and navigate the Website,”
which resulted in a dignitary injury.  (Complaint ¶7; Nicholls v. Holiday Panay
Marina, L.P. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 966, 970 [“A broad interpretation of
the [ADA] statute allows
the ADA to enhance self-autonomy and human dignity in day to day
living.”]; Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc. (9th Cir. 2011) 631
F.3d 939, 944 [“We now clarify that when an ADA plaintiff has suffered
an injury-in-fact by encountering a barrier that deprives him of full and equal
enjoyment of the facility due to his particular disability, he has standing
to sue for injunctive relief as to that barrier and other barriers
related to his disability, even if he is not deterred from returning to the public
accommodation at issue. First, we hold that an ADA plaintiff can establish
standing to sue for injunctive relief either by demonstrating
deterrence, or by demonstrating injury-in-fact coupled with an intent to return
to a noncompliant facility.”].)
          Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges a nexus between Defendant’s website and a brick-and-mortar
store, Rosenthal – The Malibu Estate Wine Bar and Patio located at 18741
Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, California, which is sufficient to meet California’s
requirement for a place of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA, and
a “business establishment” under the Unruh Act. 
(Complaint ¶¶9-10 [“The Website provides access to Defendant’s wine bar,
including information concerning Defendant’s location, descriptions of its menus,
amenities and services, hours, calendar of events, wine club, online store and
many other benefits related to its facility and services.”]; Robles v.
Domino’s Pizza, LLC (9th Cir. 2019) 913 F.3d 898, 905, cert. denied,
140 S. Ct. 122 (2019) [“Domino’s website and app facilitate access to
the goods and services of a place of public accommodation—Domino’s physical
restaurants.”]; see Nicholls, 173 Cal.App.4th at pg. 970; PGA Tour,
Inc. v. Martin (2001) 532 U.S. 661, 676-677 & n.25 [“The phrase
‘public accommodation’ is defined in terms of 12 extensive categories, which
the legislative history indicates ‘should be construed liberally’ to afford
people with disabilities ‘equal access’ to the wide variety of establishments
available to the nondisabled.”]; Thurston v. Midvale Corp. (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 634, 642-643 [“The ADA is a remedial statute and as such should be
construed broadly to implement its fundamental purpose of eliminating
discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”].)
          Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action for violations of the Unruh Civil
Rights Act is overruled.
 
Uncertainty
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not
ground for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the
lack of labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to
understand the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)
Plaintiff’s cause of action is not so uncertain that Defendant
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against it.
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer on the basis of uncertainty is
overruled.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is overruled.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
Summary of Motion
Defendant moves to strike the following portions from Plaintiff’s
Complaint: (1) ¶31: “Plaintiff is also entitled to a preliminary and permanent
injunction enjoining Defendant from violating the Unruh Act, Cal Civil Code §
51 et seq., and requiring Defendant to take the steps necessary to make the
Website readily accessible to and usable by visually-impaired individuals”; (2)
Prayer For Relief ¶2: “A preliminary and permanent injunction requiring
Defendant to take the steps necessary to make the Website, https://rosenthalestatewines.com/
readily accessible to and usable by visually-impaired individuals, but hereby
expressly limits the injunctive relief to require that Defendant expend no more
$20,000 as the cost of injunctive relief”; and (3) ¶8: “Plaintiff is also a
“tester,” which one federal court has defined to be “individuals with
disabilities who visit places of public accommodation to determine their
compliance with Title III [of the ADA].” Harty v. Burlington Coat Factory of
Penn., L.L.C., Civil Action No. 11-01923, 2011 WL 2415169, at *1 n.5 (E.D. Pa.
June 16, 2011). Indeed, it is widely accepted that “testers” such as Plaintiff advance
important public interests and should be “praised rather than vilified.” Murray
v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 954 (7th Cir. 2006). Plaintiff has filed
multiple lawsuits against various operators of commercial websites under the Unruh
Civil Rights Act as part of Plaintiff’s advocacy work on behalf of the civil
rights of visually-impaired persons. Plaintiff intends to continue to engage in
such advocacy work into the foreseeable future to ensure that Defendant’s
commercial Website and others are fully and equally enjoyable to and usable by
visually-impaired persons, including himself.”
 
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading[; or] (b) Strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”  (C.C.P. §436.)
 
Irrelevant, False, or Improper Matter
1.    
Preventive Relief
Civil Code §52(c) provides:
(c) Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that any person
or group of persons is engaged in conduct of resistance to the full enjoyment
of any of the rights described in this section, and that conduct is of that
nature and is intended to deny the full exercise of those rights, the Attorney
General, any district attorney or city attorney, or any person aggrieved by the
conduct may bring a civil action in the appropriate court by filing with it a
complaint. The complaint shall contain the following:
 
(1)   The signature of
the officer, or, in the officer’s absence, the individual acting on behalf of
the officer, or the signature of the person aggrieved.
 
(2)   The facts pertaining
to the conduct.
 
(3)  
A request for preventive relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary
injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person or persons
responsible for the conduct, as the complainant deems necessary to ensure the
full enjoyment of the rights described in this section.
 
(Civ. Code §52(c), emphasis added.)
          Civil Code §3368
defines preventive relief as relief “given by prohibiting a party from doing
that which ought not to be done.”  (Civ.
Code §3368.)  Civil Code §3368 is
preceded by Civil Code §3366 which provides: “Specific or preventive relief may
be given as provided by the laws of this state.”  (Civ. Code §3366.)
Civil Code §3367, entitled “Specific relief” provides,
Specific
relief is given: 
 
1.     By taking
possession of a thing, and delivering it to a claimant; 
 
2.     By compelling a
party himself to do that which ought to be done; or,
 
3.     By declaring and
determining the rights of parties, otherwise than by an award of damages.  
 
(Civ. Code §3367.)
          Plaintiff’s
Complaint states at ¶31: “Plaintiff is also entitled to a preliminary and
permanent injunction enjoining Defendant from violating the Unruh Act, Cal
Civil Code § 51 et seq., and requiring Defendant to take the steps necessary to
make the Website readily accessible to and usable by visually-impaired
individuals”; and at Prayer For Relief ¶2: “A preliminary and permanent
injunction requiring Defendant to take the steps necessary to make the Website,
https://rosenthalestatewines.com/ readily accessible to and usable by
visually-impaired individuals, but hereby expressly limits the injunctive
relief to require that Defendant expend no more $20,000 as the cost of
injunctive relief.”
          California Courts
have characterized the Unruh Act as affording plaintiffs with injunctive relief
without differentiating between preventive relief versus
specific (or mandatory) relief.  (Thurston v. Omni Hotels Management Corp.
(2021) 69 Cal. App. 5th 299, 306 n.11 [“the complainant may seek injunctive
relief”], citing Civ. Code §52(c)(3); Skaff v. Rio Nido Roadhouse (2020)
55 Cal.App.5th 522, 535 [“In 1992, the Legislature amended the Unruh Civil
Rights Act to specify that ‘[a] violation of the right of any individual under
the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–336) shall also
constitute a violation of this section.’ The amendment was intended to allow
persons injured by a violation of the ADA to seek the full range of remedies
provided under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, including injunctive relief,
actual damages (in some cases treble damages), and a minimum statutory award of
$4,000 per violation.”], emphasis added and internal citations omitted); Thurston
v. Midvale Corp. (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 634, 655  [“[W]e find the trial court’s injunction
mandating compliance with WCAG 2.0 efficient and well within the
court’s competence to administer. The injunction is neither overbroad,
uncertain, nor unconstitutional.”], emphasis added; Flowers v. Prasad (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 930, 938 [“Civil Code section 52, which provides remedies for
violations of section 51, authorizes a damages award of no less than $4,000 and
injunctive relief.”], emphasis added.) 
Further, the California Supreme Court has expressly recognized that the
Unruh Act was historically interpreted as allowing injunctive relief even when
there was no express provision in the statutory language.  (Koire v. Metro Car Wash (1985) 40
Cal.3d 24, 27 n.5 [“[a]lthough the Unruh Act makes no express provision for
injunctive relief, that remedy as well as damages may be available to an
aggrieved person.”].)   
Here, Plaintiff seeks an injunction requiring defendant to
affirmatively alter, or remediate, the Website to conform to Plaintiff’s
demands including changing various aspects of the Website including text,
links, and labels.  (Complaint ¶22.) Plaintiff
therefore seeks mandatory injunctive relief. Given that Defendant’s narrow
interpretation of the injunctive relief available to address Unruh Act
violations committed against Plaintiff would defeat the general purpose of the
Unruh Act to eradicate California business establishments’
discriminatory business practices and to provide Plaintiff with a remedy to
“ensure the full enjoyment of the rights described in this section,” (Civ. Code
§ 52(c)(3)), the only tenable interpretation of subdivision (c)(3) of section 52
is a broad interpretation of the injunctive relief remedy.  (White, 7 Cal. 5th at pg. 1025 [“courts
must consider [the Unruh Act’s] broad remedial purpose and overarching goal of
deterring discriminatory practices by businesses”].)
          Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike ¶31 and Prayer ¶2 is denied.
 
2.    
Tester Standing
Plaintiff’s tester status supports and strengthens his likelihood
of returning to the Website to ensure Defendant’s compliance with Title III of
the ADA and the Unruh Act.  The Eleventh
Circuit’s decision in Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc. is
instructive.  On the issue regarding the
threat of future injury, Houston relied on: (1) the plaintiff’s ADA testing
as a factor weighing in favor of the likelihood of his return to the location
of the ADA violation for another test, (2) the plaintiff’s exposure to illegal
conduct in the past; (3) the lack of remediation of the barriers, and (4) the
fact that the plaintiff’s likelihood of suffering future injury was not
contingent upon speculative events or events that were beyond the plaintiff’s
control.  (Houston v. Marod
Supermarkets, Inc. (11th Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d 1323, 1336-1337, 1340.)  Here, the Complaint sufficiently pleads a
threat of a future dignitary injury that is “real and immediate,” based on Plaintiff’s
several attempts to access the website.  (Houston, 733 F.3d at 1337.)  Given the threat of future injury, this
supports the Complaint’s prayer for injunctive relief.  Further, the Complaint alleges Plaintiff’s
dual motivation for visiting the Website, which is not irrelevant to this
action.  (Complaint ¶8.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to strike ¶8 is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.
Moving party to give notice.
