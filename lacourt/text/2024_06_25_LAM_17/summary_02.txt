The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion to compel initial responses from the defendant to their Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Identification and Production of Documents. The defendant, Michael Johnson, has failed to respond to these requests despite being served on December 29, 2023. As a result, the judge has sanctioned the defendant and his counsel jointly and severally in the amount of $700.00. The judge has also ordered that the defendant provide the requested responses.
