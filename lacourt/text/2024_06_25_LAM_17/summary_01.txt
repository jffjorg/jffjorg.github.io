And here is a summary of the case in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Whitney Rolland Reed II v. County of Los Angeles, et al. The case involves a lawsuit brought by Reed against the County of Los Angeles and its entities, alleging breach of mandatory duties, failure to summon medical care, and negligence. Reed claimed that he suffered physical altercations while in custody at the Men's Central Jail, and that custody personnel failed to take reasonable action to summon medical care and failed to perform timely safety checks.

The judge ruled that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Title 15 safety checks, meaning that the evidence does not support a finding that the defendant failed to perform timely safety checks. The judge also ruled that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to the breach of mandatory duties and failure to summon medical care, meaning that the case will proceed to trial on these issues.

The judge found that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show a triable issue as to whether or not safety checks were properly conducted, and that the individual Deputy Defendants are entitled to a judgment in their favor on the negligence cause of action.

The judge cited several California court decisions in support of her ruling, including Hart v. Orange County, Castaneda v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., Nelson v. State of California, Haggis v. City of Los Angeles, and Nunn v. State of California.
