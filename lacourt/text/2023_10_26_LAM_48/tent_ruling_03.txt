[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO VACATE
  CONDITIONAL DISMISSAL AND FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 26, 2023



 
On August 16, 2022, Plaintiff American Express National
Bank and Defendants Jacob Chait and I.M. Chait Gallery/Auctioneers Inc. filed a
stipulation to dismiss this action pursuant to a settlement, with the Court retaining
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 for enforcement of the
settlement.
On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and for entry of judgment.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
Plaintiff
and Defendants entered into a settlement agreement on August 12, 2022.  (Dyle Decl. ¶ 3.)  The parties agreed that Defendants were indebted
to Plaintiff jointly and severally in the amount of $120,039.00.  (Dyle Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 4.)  If Defendants failed to comply with the settlement
terms, Defendants agreed to the entry of judgment after receiving credit for any
payments made.  (Dyle Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 5.)  In the event of Defendants’ default, Plaintiff
must mail written notice, and Defendants’ have fourteen days to cure the default.  (Dyle Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 12.)  If Defendants fail to timely cure the default,
Plaintiff may move for entry of judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  (Dyle Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 13.)
Defendants
failed to make all payments consistent with the settlement agreement.  (Dyle Decl. ¶ 7.)  On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff sent a cure letter
to Defendants, but Defendants did not cure their default.  (Dyle Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)  Plaintiff filed this motion on August 30, 2023.
Defendants
have made payments totaling $76,539.00 since the start of the agreement, so Plaintiff
seeks a judgment for the outstanding balance of $43,500.00, plus $563.00 for this
motion’s costs, resulting in a total judgment of $44,063.00.  (Dyle Decl. ¶ 10.)
The
unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.  The Court will sign the Proposed Judgment, filed
on August 30, 2023, after correcting a typo in the total judgment amount.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
