  CASE NO.: 23STCP01460
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 26, 2023



 
Ramy
Galal and the firm Lubin Pham + Caplin LLP, counsel of record for Defendants Bryan
Taylor, 2522 The Strand LLC, and Stuart Sackley, seek to be relieved as counsel.
Counsel’s
declarations state only that “[t]he specific facts which give rise to this motion
are confidential and are required to be kept confidential under Business and Professions
Code section 6068, subdivision (e); Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.6; and
by the attorney-client privilege (Evid. Code, §§ 950 et seq.),” and counsel requests
an in camera hearing “[i]n the event that the Court desires further information
to ascertain the good faith basis for this motion and for withdrawal.”  That is not sufficient.  Counsel can state in very general terms the reasons
without divulging attorney-client privileged information.  Typical reasons include lack of communication,
breakdown in the relationship, failure to pay counsel as required by a retention
agreement, etc.
Counsel
also did not file complete Form MC-053 proposed orders.  Counsel must fill in the orders to provide the
Court with Defendants’ current or last known mailing addresses and telephone numbers.
Accordingly,
the motions to be relieved are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
