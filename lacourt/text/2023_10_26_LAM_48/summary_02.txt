Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling sustains the demurrers to the complaint filed by plaintiffs Si Tian and Dahong Huang against defendants Tres Knights, Yulin Feng, Yanjie Du, and Lin Qian Huang. The demurrers were filed by the defendants, arguing that the plaintiffs unreasonably delayed filing a Doe amendment naming Speedship Logistics Inc., Wenjie Chen, Xinge Li, and Hongmei Zhao as defendants. The court finds that the delay was not unreasonable and grants the plaintiffs leave to amend their claims. The court also sustains the demurrers with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs must file an amended complaint within 30 days. The final status conference and jury trial dates are vacated and a new case management conference is scheduled for February 6, 2024.
