And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted in part the Defendants' motion for attorney fees. The Court has awarded $15,970.00 in attorney fees and $514.20 in costs of appeal to the Defendants. The Court has also determined that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable and will be payable by the Plaintiffs, secured by the Deed of Trust. The Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion, and therefore, the Court will not award additional time for the Defendants' counsel to analyze the Plaintiffs' opposition, draft a reply, and prepare for and attend the hearing. The Court has considered the factors outlined in California law, including the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill displayed in presenting them, and the contingent nature of the fee award.
