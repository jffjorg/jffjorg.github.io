[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRERS TO
  COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 26, 2023



 
On May 25, 2021, Plaintiffs Si
Tian and Dahong Huang filed this action against Defendants Tres Knights, Yulin Feng
aka Jessie Feng, Yanjie Du aka David Du, and Lin Qian Huang aka Tina Huang.
On
November 14, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an amendment naming Does 1-4 as Speedship Logistics
Inc., Wenjie Chen, Xinge Li, and Hongmei Zhao (collectively, “Defendants”).
On
March 6, 2023, Defendants each filed a demurrer.
A.        Plaintiffs May Name Defendants Under Section
474.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 474 permits a plaintiff who is ignorant of the name of
a defendant to name a Doe in a complaint, and “when his true name is discovered,
the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 474.)  To do so, the plaintiff must have actually been
ignorant of the defendant’s identity when he or she filed the complaint.  (Optical Surplus, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1991) 228 Cal. App. 3d 776, 783-782.)  “Ignorance
of the true name of the defendant should not be feigned.”  (Scherer v. Mark (1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d
834, 840.)  “[S]ection 474 includes an implicit
requirement that a plaintiff may not ‘unreasonably delay’ his or her filing of a
Doe amendment after learning a defendant’s identity.”  (A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066-1067 (A.N.).) 
“[T]he trial court is vested with broad discretion when presented with a
motion for leave to file an amended pleading and may consider such factors as whether
the proffered pleading states facts which could have been pleaded earlier, and whether
a party has established a reasonable excuse for the delay.”  (Id. at p. 1067.)   Unreasonable delay “includes a prejudice element,
which requires a showing by defendant that he or she would suffer prejudice from
plaintiff’s delay in filing the Doe amendment.” 
(Ibid.)  Courts should liberally
grant leave to amend where no prejudice is shown.  (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
739, 761.)
Defendants
argue that Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed filing the Doe amendment.  They also contend that, due to the delay, “Doe
Defendants SPEEDSHIP, CHEN, LI and ZHAO are thus prejudiced from being added as
Doe Defendant at this late juncture of litigation with limited amount of time for
discovery.”
Plaintiffs’
counsel explains that during the December 21, 2022 deposition of Defendant Jessie
Feng, Feng identified Speedship as Plaintiffs’ actual employer.  (Quan Decl. ¶ 4.)  During a break, Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted
a search on California Secretary of State’s business search website and discovered
that Chen, Li, and Zhao were listed as officers of Speedship.  (Quan Decl. ¶ 6.)  Counsel then immediately added them as Doe Defendants.  (Quan Decl. ¶ 7.)
Counsel’s
timeline is inaccurate.  Counsel could not
have “immediately” file the Doe amendment after the December 21, 2022 deposition
because the amendment was actually already filed on November 14, 2022.
Nevertheless,
Defendants do not show any actual prejudice from the delay.  Because the only prejudice is the upcoming December
11, 2023 trial date, the Court will continue the future dates.
The
demurrers are overruled on this ground.
B.        Plaintiffs Are Granted Leave to Amend
Their Claims.
Defendants
also argue that the Complaint does not allege any facts showing their liability.
Plaintiffs
are agreeable to amending the Complaint, but the other defendants who have already
answered would not stipulate to amendment. 
(Quan Decl. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiffs state
that they have newly discovered facts that can support all ten causes of action
against the newly added Defendants.  (Opposition
at pp. 3-4.)
The
demurrers for failure to state sufficient facts are sustained with leave to amend.
C.        Conclusion
The
demurrers are SUSTAINED with 30 days’ leave to amend.
The
Final Status Conference scheduled for 11/27/2023 at 9:00 AM and Jury Trial (5 day
estimate) scheduled for 12/11/2023 at 9:00 AM are advanced to this date and VACATED.
A
Case Management Conference is scheduled for 02/06/2024 at 8:30 AM (February 6, 2024).
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
