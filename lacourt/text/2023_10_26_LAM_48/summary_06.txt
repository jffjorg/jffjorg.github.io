And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendants' motion to strike allegations relating to punitive damages from the complaint. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's allegations of intentional tort and oppression or malice are insufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages. The judge agreed, finding that the complaint contains only conclusions, no facts, about the defendants' ratification of the alleged wrongful conduct. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's allegations of uninhabitable living conditions due to the defendants' failure to maintain the property are sufficient to support a claim for compensatory damages, but not punitive damages. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to correct these issues.
