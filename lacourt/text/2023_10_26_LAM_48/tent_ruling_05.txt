On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff Messina & Hankin LLP filed this action against
Defendants Dan Wolfe (individually and as Trustee of the Wolfe Family Trust of
1992), Wolfe Air Aviation Ltd., and Hawthorne Hangar Operations L.P.
On
October 2, 2023, Dan Wolfe filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
First Set of Requests for Production.
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Wolfe
served discovery on Plaintiff on May 9, 2023. 
Plaintiff’s counsel contended that the June 13, 2023 Notice of Stay of
Proceedings “necessitate the bankruptcy trustee’s permission/agreement in
allowing this action to proceed.”  (Jamison
Decl. ¶ 8.)  “Generally, however, the
automatic stay of judicial proceedings against a debtor in bankruptcy does not
apply to non-debtor codefendants.”  (Cross
v. Cooper (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 357, 365, fn. 2.)  The debtor for the bankruptcy case is
Hawthorne Hangar Operations L.P., not Plaintiff or moving Defendant Wolfe.
Plaintiff
did not serve responses to Defendant’s discovery and filed no opposition to
this motion.  
Accordingly,
the motion to compel is GRANTED.
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Wolfe’s First Set
of Requests for Production within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,810.00 to Wolfe
within 30 days ($1,750 attorney fees plus $60 filing fee).
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
