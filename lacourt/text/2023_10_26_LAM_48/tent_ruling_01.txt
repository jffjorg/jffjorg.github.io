[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 26, 2023



 
On July 2, 2021, the Court sustained demurrers
filed by Litton Loan Servicing LP; Ocwen Financial Services, Inc.; PHH Mortgage
Corporation, individually and as successor by merger to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC
(erroneously sued as PHH Mortgage Services and Ocwen Loan Services, LLC); and Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for Ameriquest Mortgage Securities, Inc.,
Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-FR1 (erroneously sued as Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for
Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-FR1) (collectively, “Defendants”).
On
August 2, 2021, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs
Niki Alexander Shetty and Adina Zaharescu.
On
August 31, 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion for attorney fees.
Plaintiffs
appealed.  On January 26, 2023, the Court
of Appeal affirmed the judgment and awarded Defendants their costs on appeal.  Remittitur issued on April 4, 2023.
On
April 10, 2023, Defendants filed a timely memorandum of costs on appeal.  (See California Rules of Court, rule 8.278(c)(1).)  Defendants also filed a motion for attorney fees.  Plaintiffs did not file a motion to tax costs
or an opposition to the motion for attorney fees.
California
courts apply the “lodestar” approach to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This
inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” 
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Defendants
seek $15,970.00 in attorney fees for 56.1 hours billed on appeal, plus an additional
$1,200.00 for 4.0 hours more anticipated with this motion.  (Cooper Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  Based on the number of hours worked and the total
fees, Defendants’ counsel billed at a blended rate of $284.67.  (Cooper Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendants provide copies of the billing invoices.
 (Cooper Decl., Ex. 2.)  The amount of fees is reasonable for the appeal.  However, because Plaintiffs did not oppose the
motion, the Court will not award additional time for “analyzing Plaintiffs’ opposition,
drafting the reply, preparing for and attending the hearing, and preparing an order
and judgment.”  (Cooper Decl. ¶ 6.)  Defendants are therefore entitled to $15,970.00
in attorney fees.
Defendants’
verified memorandum of costs of appeal seeks $514.20 for filing fees and service
of documents.  This amount is reasonable and
allowable.
As
the Court noted in its August 31, 2021 order, Section 9 of the Deed of Trust specifically
states that any attorney fees or costs incurred “shall become additional debt of
Borrower secured by this Security Instrument,” and they “shall be payable, with
such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.”
The
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. 
The award of $15,970.00 in attorney fees and $514.20 in costs is the additional
debt of Plaintiffs secured by the Deed of Trust.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
