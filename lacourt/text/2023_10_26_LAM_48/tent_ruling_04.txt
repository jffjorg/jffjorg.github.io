[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR TERMINATING
  SANCTIONS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 26, 2023



 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff Bahram
Rasizadeh filed this action against Defendant Schuster Land Corporation.
On
August 30, 2022, Plaintiff served Request for Production, Set One on Defendant.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 2.)  After receiving several extensions of time, on
April 14, 2023, Defendant served responses. 
(Naudi Decl. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff unsuccessfully
attempted to meet and confer with Defendant, so Plaintiff filed a motion to compel
on May 30, 2023.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 4.)  Defendant did not oppose the motion and did not
appear at the August 31, 2023 hearing.  The
Court ordered Plaintiff to serve supplemental responses and documents, without objection,
to the  Request for Production within 30 days.  The Court also ordered the payment of monetary
sanctions.  As of October 4, 2023, Defendant
failed to provide any supplemental responses, but it did pay the monetary sanctions.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 5.) 
On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for terminating sanctions.  Defendant did not file an opposition.
A
court may impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in conduct that
is a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)  Misuse
of the discovery process includes failing to respond to discovery, unjustifiably
making unmeritorious objections to discovery, and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)  “The trial court may order a terminating sanction
for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’  [Citation.]  Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly.  But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules,
the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)
Plaintiff
has already received a remedy for Defendant’s failure to fully respond to interrogatories.  (See Naudi Decl. ¶¶ 6-12.)  On October 17, 2023, the Court ordered that Defendant
be precluded from introducing witnesses regarding the condition of the property,
the cause of the conditions of the property, the citations, or any attempts to abate
the conditions at the property.
The
only remaining basis for this motion is Defendant’s failure to serve supplemental
responses pursuant to the Court’s August 31, 2023 order.  (See Motion at pp. 2, 6; Naudi Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)  But according to Plaintiff, the outstanding document
production is “Building Permits and Contractor Documents” and/or “insurance policy”
documents in response to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3-7, 10-75, 77-79.  (See August 31, 2023 Order.)  The Court’s August 31 order stated, “The Plaintiff
unnecessarily attaches the Defendant’s entire document production.  [Citation.] 
The Court will not sift through nearly 150 pages of documents to determine
whether the Defendant indeed failed to produce ‘Building Permits and Contractor
Documents’ and/or ‘insurance policy’ documents.”  Plaintiff’s motion again includes a copy of Defendant’s
April 14, 2023 document production.  (Naudi
Decl., Ex. B.)  The Court did review these
documents as part of its consideration of this motion.  Notably, the labeled electronic bookmarks include
“Building Permits and Contractor Documents.” 
(Naudi Decl., Ex. B at PDF pp. 63-74.) 
Defendant also provided insurance information in response to Form Interrogatory
No. 4.1. (Naudi Decl., Ex. G at pp. 2-3.)
Under
the totality of the circumstances, Plaintiff has not shown a history of willful
discovery abuse by Defendant such that less severe sanctions would be ineffective.
The
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
