Significant Statements:

  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Bahram Rasizadeh, against the defendant, Schuster Real Estate Co., Ltd. The motion was filed due to the defendant's failure to provide supplemental responses to the plaintiff's Request for Production, Set One. The court found that the plaintiff had already received a remedy for the defendant's failure to fully respond to interrogatories and that the outstanding document production was not a willful misuse of the discovery process. The court also reviewed the defendant's April 14, 2023 document production and found that it included labeled electronic bookmarks for "Building Permits and Contractor Documents" and provided insurance information in response to Form Interrogatory No. 4.1. The court concluded that the motion for terminating sanctions was denied and that the defendant's failure to provide supplemental responses was not a willful discovery abuse.
