And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants Bryan Taylor, 2522 The Strand LLC, and Stuart Sackley. The motions were filed by Ramy Galal and the firm Lubin Pham + Caplin LLP, who sought to be relieved due to "confidential" reasons. However, the Judge found that the declarations provided insufficient reasons and that the firm failed to file complete proposed orders. The Judge orders the motions to be denied without prejudice and requires the moving party to give notice. The Judge also reminds parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling to send an email to the Court.
