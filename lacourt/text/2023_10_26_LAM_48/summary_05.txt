And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Dan Wolfe's motion to compel discovery from plaintiff Messina & Hankin, LLP. The motion was filed on October 2, 2023, after defendant served discovery requests on May 9, 2023, and plaintiff failed to serve timely responses. The court found that plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests waived any objections to the requests, including those based on privilege or attorney work product. The court also granted the request for sanctions and ordered plaintiff's counsel to pay $1,810.00 to defendant within 30 days. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to defendant's discovery requests within 30 days. The motion to compel discovery is granted, and the request for sanctions is granted in part.
