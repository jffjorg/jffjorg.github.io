Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff tripped and fell on a sticky substance on the floor of a Costco store, and the defendant argued that the condition was open and obvious. However, the court found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the condition was open and obvious, and that the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to the existence of the alleged condition. The court also found that whether the defendant exercised reasonable care and had constructive notice of the alleged condition is a question for the jury to decide.
