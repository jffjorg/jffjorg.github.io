Legal Standard
 
A defendant may
make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without
leave of court at any time. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (a).) The demand for production of documents is not
limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting requirements
in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially
prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending
action and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are
relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
Discussion
On January 4, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present Complaint against Defendant Southern California
Edison. On August 25, 2023, Edison served its supplemental discovery requests
on Plaintiff, including a Supplemental Request for Interrogatories and
Supplemental Requests for Production of Documents. Plaintiff failed to provide
any supplemental response by the statutory deadline and failed to respond to
Defendant’s meet and confer attempts. Defendant now moves the Court to compel
supplemental responses to interrogatories and requests for production. 
Plaintiff did not
provide the discovery responses at issue by the statutory deadline. Plaintiff did
not file an opposition or any other document indicating that the responses were
served prior to the hearing. Thus, Defendant’s motions to compel initial
responses are granted. Plaintiff is ordered to provide complete responses to
Defendant’s supplemental request for interrogatory and supplemental request for
production without objection within 20 days of today.
Plaintiff’s
non-response forced Defendant to file the present motions and incur attorneys’
fees. Defendant requests attorney fees in the amount of $540 per motion, which
the Court finds reasonable. Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff in the
amount of $1,080. Plaintiff and his counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally,
to pay sanctions of $1,080 to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
