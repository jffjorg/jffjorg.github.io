MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS COMPLAINT 
Hearing Date: 5/17/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV30442 MEGAN NICHOLE
WIGGINS vs PENNY BRENNER 
Moving Party: Defendants Penny and Mark
Brenner
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS
COMPLAINT IS GRANTED
 
As judicial policy generally supports the
resolution of all disputed matters between parties, leave to amend or leave to
cross-complain is typically granted liberally. (See Kolani v. Gluska
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 412.) The Court may, however, deny such leave if
there is demonstrated prejudice to the opposing party, such as trial delays,
loss of critical evidence, or increased preparation costs. (Id.) 
On December 13, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this motor accident claim arising from a six-vehicle collision.
Defendants Penny Brenner and Mark Brenner move the Court for leave to file a
cross-complaint against Defendant Ryan Kessler, alleging he was the primary
cause of the accident. No opposition was filed.
Defendants' request
comes shortly after the complaint was filed, so there would be minimal trial
delay, loss of evidence, or increased preparation costs. The cross-complaint
arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the original complaint, and
no opposition alleging prejudice was filed. Defendants also attached a copy of
the cross-complaint to the motion. All statutory requirement has been met and
therefore, Defendants' motion for leave is granted. Defendants are granted leave
to file their cross-complaint within the next 10 days.
