```

**Summary**: The tentative ruling grants summary judgment/summary adjudication of the claims against Samantha Wagner, finding that she is not the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, was not driving the vehicle at the time of the incident, and was not involved in the accident in any capacity. The ruling denies summary judgment/summary adjudication of the claims against Jason Wagner, finding that triable issues of fact exist regarding whether his loss of consciousness was unforeseeable and whether he had reason to anticipate feeling lightheaded or fainting.
