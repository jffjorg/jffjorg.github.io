And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial without prejudice. The defendant sought to bifurcate the trial, but the judge has found it more appropriate for the trial judge to make this determination. The motion was properly made in advance of the trial date and in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has ordered that the briefing on bifurcation be included in the trial binders along with any motions in limine filed in the case. The parties are ordered to give notice of the ruling, and may submit to the tentative ruling by email. If no submission is made, the parties are encouraged to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
