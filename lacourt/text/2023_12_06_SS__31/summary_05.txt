And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the defendants in a wrongful death action. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants are liable for the death of Decedent, who was injured on a construction site in Los Angeles. The defendants argue that the FAC is a sham pleading and that the Workers' Compensation Act bars the plaintiffs' action.

The court finds that the FAC omits material allegations from the original complaint, including allegations that Decedent was working on the construction site at the direction of the defendants. The court concludes that the FAC is a sham pleading and that the defendants' demurrer should be sustained with leave to amend.

The court grants the plaintiffs 20 days to amend the FAC and orders the defendants to give notice. The court notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
