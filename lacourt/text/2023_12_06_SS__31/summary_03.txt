And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion filed by Hollywood Honeywagon Production Vehicles (Hollywood Honeywagon) to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted and impose sanctions on Moises Vidaurri (Moises). The RFAs were propounded on August 15, 2023, and responses were due on or before September 20, 2023, but Moises has not served responses. Hollywood Honeywagon seeks to deem the RFAs admitted and impose sanctions due to Moises' failure to respond. The Judge finds that Hollywood Honeywagon has not provided sufficient evidence that Moises was properly served with the RFAs, and therefore denies the motion. The Judge also denies the request for sanctions.
