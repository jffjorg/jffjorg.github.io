And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss the Plaintiff's action. The Plaintiff failed to pay monetary sanctions ordered by the Court in a previous ruling. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's failure to pay is a misuse of the discovery process and requests terminating sanctions. The Judge notes that terminating sanctions are a drastic measure that should be employed with caution and are intended to remedy discovery abuse, not to punish the offending party. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did serve the requested discovery responses, and to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice for failure to pay a monetary sanction would be grossly disproportionate to the type of misconduct. The Judge denies the motion for terminating sanctions and orders the Defendant to give notice to the Plaintiff.
