And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the defendant's motion to enforce a settlement agreement until [undetermined date]. The settlement is contingent upon the plaintiffs filing a minor's compromise, which has not been done yet. The plaintiffs' counsel has acknowledged that they are preparing the minor's compromise, but has not filed a petition for an order for a minor's compromise. The judge has set an order to show cause for the status of the minor's compromise and why the plaintiffs' counsel should not be sanctioned $1000 for failure to file the minor's compromise and failure to proceed with reasonable diligence. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email.
