English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a petition filed by the minor's guardian ad litem, Edward Rodgers, to approve a compromise of the minor's claim against the defendant, Jay In, for $19,940.68. The minor, Elana Rodgers, was injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by the defendant's negligence. The petition was filed on July 31, 2023, and the court has continued the hearing on the petition to February 7, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.

The court notes that the petitioner corrected all outstanding deficiencies with the petition as noted by the court in its prior order. However, the court finds that the petitioner failed to supply evidence indicating that a copy of the amended petition, including the proposed order to deposit funds in a blocked account, was served on the defendant.

The court is continuing the hearing on the petition to allow the petitioner to file supplemental papers indicating whether the defendant has been served with the petition at least 16 court days before the scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the hearing being placed off calendar or denied. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the continued hearing.
