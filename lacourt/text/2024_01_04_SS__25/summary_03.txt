Significant Statements:
  - "The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง473(b))
  - "Extrinsic fraud occurs when a party is deprived of the opportunity to present his claim or defense to the court; where he was kept ignorant or, other than from his own negligence, fraudulently prevented from fully participating in the proceeding." (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294)
  - "To set aside a judgment based upon extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three elements. First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Last[ly], the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once ... discovered." (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975)
```
