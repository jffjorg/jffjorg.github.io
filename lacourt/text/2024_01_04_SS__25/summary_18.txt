And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration, which was filed on August 22, 2023. The motion seeks to compel arbitration of the controversy between the parties, which arises from the sale of a used 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. The judge finds that the parties have a written agreement to arbitrate, and the right to compel arbitration has not been waived. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence of service on all defendants, including Defendant Sahara Auto Mart, Inc., which was previously unable to be served. As a result, the judge grants the motion and stays the entire action pending the results of arbitration. A post-arbitration status conference is set for September 5, 2024, at which time the parties are expected to report on the status of the arbitration.
