  - The doctrine of collateral estoppel bars action in this suit because Defendant is named in both lawsuits and that the second lawsuit raises issues identical to those in the first lawsuit.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by the defendants, Moss Management Services, Inc., Dionna Naranjo, and LA Apartment Biz. The plaintiff, Monique Johnson, filed four causes of action against the defendants, alleging that Defendant Naranjo had stored trash on a balcony unit, causing damage to her vehicle. The defendants demurred, arguing that the plaintiff's causes of action are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.

The judge found that the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the demurrer, and that the defendants had met and conferred with the plaintiff as required by law. The judge also found that the primary right claimed in both lawsuits is the same, and that the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits.

The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that there is no reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action that would not be barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel. The defendants are ordered to file a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 court days.
