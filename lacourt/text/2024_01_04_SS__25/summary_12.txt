And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) against Nolan Curl (Defendant) in an automobile subrogation action. The Plaintiff seeks judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Defendant does not provide any defenses in his answer to the complaint. The Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the Court should deny the motion because it would prejudice him from being able to file his cross-complaint against his employer and that the case is not yet fully at issue.

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion, finding that the Plaintiff has not carried its burden under CCP § 438(c)(1)(A). The Judge notes that the Defendant has affirmatively defended against the element of proximate cause by alleging that a superseding act has caused the Plaintiff's damages, and that the Defendant's answer does not state sufficient facts to constitute a defense to the complaint.

The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's reliance on admissions deemed admitted is improper, as the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the documents are disputable. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, and that the case will proceed to further proceedings.
