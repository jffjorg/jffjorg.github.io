BACKGROUND
 
On July 31, 2023,
Plaintiff Elana Rodgers (“Minor Plaintiff” or “Claimant”), a minor by and
through her Guardian Ad Litem Edward Rodgers, filed this action against
Defendant Jay In (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 5, inclusive, asserting one cause
of action for motor vehicle negligence. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On April 26, 2022, on Torrance Boulevard and Donora
Avenue in Torrance, California 90503, the defendants so negligently and
carelessly owned, operated, entrusted, and maintained their vehicle, causing it
to collide with the vehicle in which Plaintiff Elana Rodgers was a passenger,
proximately causing the plaintiff’s injuries. 
 
On September 7,
2023, Guardian Ad Litem Edward Rodgers (“Petitioner”) filed his petition to
approve the compromise of Minor Plaintiff Elana Rodgers (“Claimant”). On
November 16, 2023, the Court continued the matter to January 04, 2024, at
Petitioner’s request and ordered Petitioner to file and serve a supplemental
declaration addressing the deficiencies identified by the Court. 
 
On December 15,
2023, Petitioner filed his instant amended petition to approve minor’s
compromise. No opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY POSITION
 
Claimant, who is 13
years old, has agreed to settle her claim against the Defendant and his
Allstate Insurance policy for $19,940.68. As a result of the accident that
happened on April 26, 2022, Claimant suffered neck and back injuries and damage
to a tooth, requiring a root canal. Claimant was seen in an emergency room at
Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center. Claimant also received
physical therapy and orthodontal treatment. Claimant has fully recovered from
her injuries. Out of the settlement proceeds of $19,940.68, medical expenses of
$3,489.04, attorney’s fees of $4,985.17 (25 percent of the settlement), and
costs of $370 will be deducted, leaving Claimant with $11,096.47. The
$11,096.47 will be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial
institutions in California, subject to withdrawal only upon the authorization
of the Court.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§
3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the
proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. 
[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is
endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by
a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by
the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof,
in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner
may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise
the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code § 3500.  
 
Regarding
the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a
minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified
petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that
has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes
v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) (Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code §
3505, if a petition is unopposed, the Court must issue a decision on the
petition at the conclusion of the hearing. 
   
II.        Discussion   
In its prior decision the Court noted the following deficiencies with the
petition: 
(1)  
Petitioner checked box 13b(4)(a) of the Petition but did not attach a
copy of the notice given to the State Director of Health Care Services under
Welfare and Institutions Code section 14124.73; 
 
(2)  
 Item 14a of the Petition requires
the Petitioner to attach a declaration from counsel explaining the basis for
the requested attorney’s fees and discussing the applicable factors listed in
rule 7.955(b) of the California Rules of Court. Here, the Court finds the
requested attorney’s fees of 25 percent reasonable, but counsel’s declaration
(Attachment 14a) is not signed or dated; 
 
(3)  
Third, Attachment 18e does not explain counsel’s relationship with the
individuals listed in that attachment as required by Item 18e of the Petition;
and 
 
(4)  
Petitioner has not included a proposed order to deposit funds in the
blocked account on Judicial Council Form MC-355.
 
(11/16/23 Minute
Order.) 
The Court notes that Petitioner corrects all outstanding deficiencies
with the Petition as noted by the Court in its prior order. However, the Court finds that Petitioner does not supply the Court with evidence indicating that a copy of the amended
petition, including the proposed order to deposit funds in a blocked account,
was served on the Defendant. 
For that
reason the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the Petition for Minor’s Compromise
submitted on behalf of Minor Claimant Elana Rogers. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            The hearing on the Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise on behalf
of minor Claimant Elana Rogers is CONTINUED to FEBRUARY 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in
Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
Petitioner is ordered to file supplemental papers indicating whether Defendant
has been served with the Petition at least 16 court days before the scheduled
hearing. Failure to do so may result in the hearing being placed off calendar
or denied.
 
Moving party(ies) ordered to give notice.
