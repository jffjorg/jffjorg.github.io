The caption of Plaintiff’s Motion states that the Motion is a “Motion to Compel
Arbitration, and for Court to Pick Arbitration Forum, and Request for Stay.”
The notice of motion, however, does not request that the Court pick an
arbitration forum. The notice of motion only requests that the Court order
Defendants Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. and Sierra Credit Corporation to arbitrate
this controversy and to stay this action pending the results of arbitration.
(Notice of Motion at 2:1-5.)
