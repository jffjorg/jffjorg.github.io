And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion to Continue Trial Date and Re-Open Discovery. The Plaintiffs, Joevanny Ruiz, Kassandra Garza, and Jordan Cabanilla, seek to continue the trial to complete expert discovery and attend mediation due to the unavailability of essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence. The Judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial, citing the lack of response from the Defendants, John Doe, Stephen Kennedy, and Nelva Stevenson, and the need for Plaintiffs to investigate the claim before trial. The Judge grants the motion in part, continuing the trial date to August 14, 2024, and ordering the moving party to give notice of the Court's ruling and to file proof of service of such notice with the Court within two days of notice of this Court's Order.
