BACKGROUND
 
On July 14, 2023,
Plaintiffs Dante Segundo and Jessica Navarro (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Sahara Auto Mart, Inc., Sierra Credit Corporation, Hudson
Insurance Company, and Does 1 to 40, alleging causes of action for: (1)
violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”) pursuant to California
Civil Code section 1750 et seq.; (2) violation of California Business and
Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; (3) violation of California Civil Code
section 1632; and (4) claim against surety. The complaint arises from the sale
of an allegedly defective used 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (the “Subject
Vehicle”). 
 
On August 22, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a motion for an order compelling Defendants Sahara Auto Mart,
Inc. and Sierra Credit Corporation to arbitrate the controversy pursuant to the
grievance and arbitration provisions of the Retail Installment Sale Contract
(“RISC”) between the parties and for an order to stay this action pending the
results of arbitration (the “Motion”).[1]
The Motion does not seek to compel arbitration of any claims against Defendant
Hudson Insurance Company. 
 
On September 12,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service of Summons indicating that Defendant
Hudson Insurance Company was served with the summons, complaint, and the Motion
on August 23, 2023, via personal service. 
 
Plaintiffs filed a
Proof of Service of Summons indicating that Defendant Sierra Credit Corporation
was served with the summons, complaint, and the Motion on August 24, 2023, via
substituted service. As to Defendant Sahara Auto Mart, Inc., Plaintiffs filed a
Non-Service Report on September 12, 2023, indicating that Plaintiffs were
unable to effectuate service of the summons, complaint, and the Motion on
Defendant Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. Plaintiffs attempted to serve Defendant Sahara
Auto Mart, Inc. on August 24, 2023, at 11461 San Fernando Road, Unit A, San
Fernando, CA 91340; however, a neighboring business confirmed that Defendant
Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. is no longer occupying such address. The Non-Service
Report is signed by a registered California process server.
 
On October 18, 2023,
Defendant Sierra Credit Corporation filed and served an opposition to the
Motion. 
 
On November 07,
2023, the Court continued the hearing citing lack of service on Defendant
Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. 
 
On November 17,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service by Substituted Service indicating
that Defendant Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. was served with the summons, complaint,
and the Motion on October 31, 2023, via substituted service.
 
No reply brief has
been filed. 
 
 
MOVING PARTY POSITION
 
Plaintiffs contend
that the controversy is covered by the arbitration provision in the RISC, and
the right to compel arbitration has not been waived. Plaintiffs assert that the
parties do not agree on the forum of arbitration. Plaintiffs indicate that they
elect the AAA or, in the alternative, JAMS as the arbitration forum.
 
OPPOSITION
 
            In opposition to the Motion,
Defendant Sierra Credit Corporation indicates that it agrees to arbitrate this
matter through the AAA and is in the process of facilitating AAA. Defendant
Sierra Credit Corporation asserts that it objects to JAMS arbitrating this
action.
 
REPLY
 
            No reply has been filed. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“A party who claims
that there is a written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior court
for an order to compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2. Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998)
62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356. “California law, like federal law, favors enforcement
of valid arbitration agreements.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97.) “On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate
that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” Banner Entertainment, Inc.
v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356. 
 
“[T]he writing
memorializing an arbitration agreement need not be signed by both parties in
order to be upheld as a binding arbitration agreement.” Serafin v. Balco
Properties Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 176. “[I]t is not the presence
or absence of a signature which is dispositive; it is the presence or absence
of evidence of an agreement to arbitrate which matters.” (Banner
Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 361.) 
 
Where a motion to
compel arbitration is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had
in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.) 
   
II.        Discussion 
            In
its prior order, the Court noted while on merits the motion complied with CCP §
1281.2 that it could not grant the motion because Plaintiff had not supplied
the court with evidence that the motion had been served on Defendant Sahara
Auto Mart, Inc. (11/07/23 Minute Order.) Here, Plaintiff provides the Court
with a proof of substituted service indicating that the motion along with the
summons, complaint, the motion’s proposed order, and accompanying declaration
in support of the motion were served on Defendant Sahara Auto Mart, Inc. on
October 31, 2023. (11/17/23 Proof of Service by Substituted Service.)
            The Court therefore GRANTS the
motion.  
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED. This entire action is stayed pending the
results of arbitration.  
 
All future hearing
dates are vacated. (i.e.:  the 01/10/2025
Trial)
 
The Court sets a
Post Arbitration Status Conference for SEPTEMBER 5, 2024 at 9:30am in
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, with a JOINT status report to be
filed 5 days before the scheduled hearing.    
Both Counsel are ordered to appear this date.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
