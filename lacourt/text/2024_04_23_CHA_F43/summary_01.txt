And here is the summary in English text:

Based on the information presented, the Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for an order to show cause re: contempt without prejudice. The motion was filed by the Plaintiffs, Christopher Mack and others, against Defendant Julio Torres, alleging that Torres has failed to return a vehicle in accordance with a court order. The Judge notes several issues with the motion, including the absence of a declaration from Gannon McPhillips, incomplete proof of service, and lack of points and authorities. Additionally, the motion appears to have been filed in pro per, despite the trustee, Wayne R. Tanaka, claiming to have required attorney services. Due to these issues, the Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the Plaintiffs to re-file the motion with the required documentation.
