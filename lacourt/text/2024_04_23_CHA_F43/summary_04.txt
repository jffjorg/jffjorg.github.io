**Case Number:** 24CHCV00004

**Case:** Sarasota CCM, Inc. vs. Got A Hand LLC, et al.

**Hearing Date:** April 23, 2024

**Judge's Ruling:** The demurrer to the complaint is overruled.

**Background:** The plaintiff, Sarasota CCM, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendants, Oswald Alfredo Flores and Eileen Yanil Hernandez, as well as Got A Hand LLC, alleging five causes of action related to the failure of the defendants to make payments on an Equipment Finance Agreement.

**Defendants' Demurrer:** The defendants filed a demurrer, in pro per, to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the plaintiff lacks standing, failed to state a cause of action, and requesting a repayment plan or refinancing.

**Judge's Analysis:** The judge analyzed the demurrer and found that the defendants did not specifically address the facts alleged in the plaintiff's complaint. Therefore, the judge could not evaluate the defendants' demurrer. The judge overruled the demurrer and ordered the moving party to give notice to all parties.
