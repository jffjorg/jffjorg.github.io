SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Robert
Pope (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Adam Clint (Defendant) on
July 3, 2023. Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that Defendant was
personally served on November 2, 2023. However, Defendant filed this motion
because Defendant has video evidence showing that the process server just left
the papers on Defendant’s porch. Therefore, Defendant argues that he was not
personally served on November 2. Defendant filed this motion on November 29,
2023.
 
A second
attempt at service occurred on December 8, 2023. Another motion to quash
service of summons related to that attempt was filed on December 19, 2023, and
is set for a hearing on May 13, 2024.
 
On April 9, Plaintiff
filed a notice and acknowledgment of receipt of the summons signed by
Defendant’s attorney, Steven H. Haney. Based on the filing of this notice, it
appears that Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is now moot.
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is denied as moot. Defendant’s responsive
pleading is due relative to the date the notice and acknowledgment of receipt
was filed, which was April 9, 2024.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
