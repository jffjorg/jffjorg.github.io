```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's Motion to Quash Service of Summons, which was filed on November 29, 2023. The Defendant claims that the process server left the papers on their porch, rather than personally serving them, on November 2, 2023. The Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the Defendant was personally served. The Court finds that the Defendant's motion is now moot due to the filing of a notice and acknowledgment of receipt of the summons by the Defendant's attorney on April 9, 2024. The Defendant's responsive pleading is due relative to the date the notice and acknowledgment was filed. The motion is denied as moot.
