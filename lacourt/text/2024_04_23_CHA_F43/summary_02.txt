And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to compel further responses to requests for production in a case involving a defective 2021 Chevrolet Silverado. The plaintiff, Araceli and Anthony Miceli, claimed that the defendant, General Motors, LLC, failed to timely serve responses to requests for production and refused to provide meaningful, substantive responses. The defendant objected to the requests on grounds of vagueness, ambiguity, and relevance. The court held that the defendant's responses were incomplete but not entirely inadequate, and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the defendant waived all objections to the requests. The court also held that the plaintiff's requests were not relevant and likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
