SUMMARY OF ACTION 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff Sarasota CCM, Inc.
(Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants Oswald Alfredo Flores and
Eileen Yanil Hernandez (Defendants), as well as Got A Hand LLC. Plaintiff has
alleged five causes of action against Defendants for (1) breach of contract;
(2) money lent; (3) account stated; (4) breach of guaranty; and (5) money due.
These causes of action are all related to the failure of Defendants to make
payments on an Equipment Finance Agreement.
 
Defendants filed their demurer, in pro per, to Plaintiff’s
complaint on March 11, 2024. Plaintiff opposes Defendants’ demurrer.
 
ANALYSIS
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Defendants have demurred on the basis that Plaintiff lacks
standing and that Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. Defendants also
appear to have demurred on the basis that Defendant has requested a repayment
plan or refinancing.
 
Defendants’ demurrer contains no reference to specific facts
alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint. It appears that Defendants may have used a
form for their demurrer. Their demurrer does not challenge the sufficiency of
Plaintiff’s pleading in any specific way. Because Defendants have not addressed
the facts from Plaintiff’s complaint, there is no way for the Court to evaluate
their demurrer.
 
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is overruled.
