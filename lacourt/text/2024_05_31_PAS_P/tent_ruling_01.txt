  Case Number:  23AHCV01038    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER TO THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND; TAKING MOTION TO STRIKE OFF-CALENDAR AS MOOT I.        INTRODUCTION
           In this medical malpractice action, Plaintiff Laurie Moore
alleges that on May 6, 2022, Defendants Luisana Gomez, Ramachandran Srinivasan,
Howard Sofen and Complete Care Community Health Center undertook to provide her
medical care. She alleges that the medical care she received was deficient. 
           The first amended complaint contains two causes of action:
(1) Medical Malpractice and (2) Statutory Violations. Defendant Sofen has since
been dismissed by Plaintiff.
           Defendants Luisana Gomez, Ramachandran Srinivasan and
Complete Care Community Health Center filed this demurrer and motion to strike
on January 3, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 16, 2024. Defendants
filed a reply on May 23, 2024.
Before
the Court are Defendants’ challenges to the first amended complaint. Defendants
allege that both causes of action fail to state sufficient facts and/or are
uncertain. Defendants also move to strike punitive damages and attorney fees. 
The
demurrer is sustained and the motion to strike is taken off-calendar as moot. 
II.       DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is
uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
           B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
           The Declaration of Jacob S. Rosenberg is offered in
support of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41. Rosenberg
declares that he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel on December 19, 2023,
and December 20, 2023. (Rosenberg Decl. ¶ 5.) 
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
           C. Demurrer
           Defendants urge that the demurrer to the entire complaint
should be sustained, as the first amended complaint is uncertain. (See Demurrer
p. 6: 12-14.) The Court agrees. The First Amended Complaint alleges that
Defendants undertook to provide Plaintiff medical care (FAC ¶ 9), Defendants
did not exercise due care in doing so (FAC ¶ 10) and Plaintiff suffered various
injuries. (FAC ¶ 10.)
           However, the First Amended Complaint makes no mention of
what medical services were provided nor which of the specific defendants
provided the medical services. Though demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored,
the Court agrees with Defendants that this pleading is ambiguous to the point
of being incomprehensible. (See A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc.
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.) Indeed, to properly state a medical
malpractice cause of action, Plaintiff must allege the “acts or omissions which
are said to have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare
statement that the defendant’s negligence has caused him injury.” (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527, internal citations omitted.) The
FAC does not allege the acts or omissions Defendants performed that Plaintiff
finds negligent.
In
her opposition, Plaintiff clarifies for the first time that the doctors
prescribed her Plaquenil for her psoriatic arthritis and that this prescription
caused the injuries she is now seeking redress for. (See Opposition p. 5: 9-28,
Reply p. 2: 5-27.) However, the FAC does not contain this information, only
stating that “[o]n or about May 6, 2022, Plaintiff employed Defendants for
medical needs and/or necessities.” (FAC ¶ 9.) This incomprehensibility can be
solved by amendment. 
           The second cause of action is likewise uncertain, as the
First Amended Complaint does not plead what Defendant Ramachandran Srinivasan did.
           Additionally, the second cause of action is uncertain for
failure to name the specific code sections allegedly violated. (See Demurrer p.
7.) ¶ 16 of the FAC names large acts and regulations that contain numerous code
sections and potential violations. Without specific notation of the statutes at
issue, the Court concludes that this cause of action is also uncertain. 
           In her opposition, Plaintiff clarifies that the second
cause of action is negligence per se. (Opposition p. 8: 14-15.) The Court notes
that negligence per se requires alleging a specific statutory violation.
           The
demurrer is sustained in its entirety with leave to amend.
III.     MOTION
TO STRIKE
            A.
Legal Standard
           Code Civ. Proc. §436 provides: “The court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” 
Civ.
Code § 3294(a) provides that where it is proven by clear and convincing
evidence that a defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the
plaintiff may recover punitive damages. 
Attorney
fees are only available if provided for by statute or contract. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 1021, 1035(a)(10).)
B.
Motion to Strike is Taken Off-Calendar as Moot
As
the demurrer is being sustained, there will be no operative pleading from which
to strike any matter. The motion to strike is therefore taken off calendar as
moot. 
  IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with leave
to amend. The motion to strike is taken off-calendar as moot. 
Plaintiff
Laurie Moore is given 30 days to amend her First Amended Complaint for Medical
Negligence and Statutory Violations. 
           Counsel for Defendants to give notice of this order.
