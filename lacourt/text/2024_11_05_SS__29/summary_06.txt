And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Mindy Susan Bish of Bish & Cutting, APC, on behalf of the Plaintiff, Maurice Lee. The motion was filed on October 7, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The Judge found that there is good cause to relieve Counsel as attorney of record due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The Plaintiff refused to confirm his address, and Counsel took steps to confirm it, including mailing motion papers to the Plaintiff's last known addresses and conducting a public record search. The Judge notes that the upcoming hearing dates on the Declaration and Orders are no longer correct and directs the Judicial Assistant to correct the dates in the proposed order. The order will be effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
