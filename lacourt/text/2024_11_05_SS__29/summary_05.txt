And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions filed by counsel, Daniel Moossai, Esq., to be relieved as attorney of record for both plaintiffs, Crystal Calderon and Maria Esther Gonsalez. The motion was filed on October 11, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The court finds that there is good cause to relieve counsel due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel was unable to confirm the plaintiffs' addresses, but took steps to locate a more current address. The court notes that the upcoming hearing dates on the declaration and orders are no longer correct and directs the Judicial Assistant to correct the dates on the proposed orders. The orders will be effective upon filing with the court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
