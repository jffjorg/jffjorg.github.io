Background
The Plaintiffs in this action are Wenro
Tupas, Sr., both individually and as successors in interest to Felicidita
Tandug Tupas; Felros Tupas Lim, both individually and as successor in interest
to Felicidita Tandug Tupas; Wenefredo Villacorta Lim; Mary Jane Tupas Gonzales,
as successor in interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas; Rowne Tandug Tupas, as
successor in interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas; and Wenro Tandug Tupas, Jr.
as successor in interest to Felicidita Tandug Tupas (collectively
“Plaintiffs”).
On July 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Toyota Motor Corporation; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.;
Toyota Motor North America, Inc.; Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing
North America, Inc.; Seidner-Miller, Inc dba Toyota of Glendora; Liang Liu; and
Does 1 through 100.  In the complaint, Plaintiffs assert causes of
action for strict liability and negligence arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on July 22, 2018.
On July 13, 2023, Defendant Liang Liu (“Liu”)
filed an answer.
On May 10, 2024, the Court, at the request of
Plaintiffs, dismissed all causes of action against all of the other named
defendants with prejudice.
On June 21, 2024, counsel for Liu was
relieved as attorney of record.  Since that time, Liu has been
self-represented as a pro per litigant.
On October 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed these
three discovery motions: a motion to compel Liu to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One); a motion to compel Liu to respond to Requests for
Production (Set One); and a motion for an order deeming Liu to have admitted
the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide
a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents
are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move
for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
A party must respond to requests for
admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an order that …
the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a
motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The court “shall” make the order that the
truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the
court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
