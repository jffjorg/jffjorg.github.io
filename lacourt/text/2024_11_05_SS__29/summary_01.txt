The tentative ruling grants three discovery motions filed by the Plaintiffs against Defendant Liang Liu. The motions are to compel Defendant Liu to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One). The Defendant failed to respond to these discovery requests despite requests and extensions. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs need show nothing more to grant the motions. As a result, the Court orders Defendant Liu to provide written, verified, and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice. Additionally, the Court deems Defendant Liu to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (Set One).
