Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, separating the issue of punitive damages from the issue of liability. This means that the defendants' liability must be established before the issue of punitive damages can be tried. The judge finds that this is reasonable given the high value of the punitive damages claim and the need to avoid wasting court time. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs have not opposed the motion, which implies that they agree with the defendants' arguments. The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
