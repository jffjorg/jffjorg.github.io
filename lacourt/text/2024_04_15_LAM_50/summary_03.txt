And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she purchased a pickup truck with her husband approximately 24 years ago. The truck had electrical problems and was eventually taken back and refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. The judge does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, if anyone believes that the judge's experience will affect her ability to impartially decide the case, they have until April 25, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The hearing on the Case Management Conference will be continued to June 11, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
