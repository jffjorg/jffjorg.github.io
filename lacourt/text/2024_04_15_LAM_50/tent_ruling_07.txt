[1]In the Patel
Family Trust’s FAC in the instant action, they allege, inter alia, that
“with the intent to induce Patel Family Trust’s purchase of the Subject
Property, Defendants 8300 S. Vermont, Western Holdings, Sasson, and FOS, LLC
intentionally and actively concealed Sasson’s interest in the FOS entities.”
(FAC, ¶ 70.) Patel Family Trust further alleges that “8300 S. Vermont, Western
Holdings, Sasson, and FOS, LLC also intentionally failed to disclose facts
materially altering the value and/or desirability of the Subject Property,
including but not limited to: a. FOS, LLC was not a good faith tenant, and only
entered into the FOS Lease Agreement with 8300 S. Vermont, executed the First
Amendment to the FOS Lease Agreement, and executed the Estoppel Certificate, to
fictitiously increase the total rental income for the Subject Property to
facilitate the marketing of the Subject Property for sale…” (FAC, ¶ 70(a).)
