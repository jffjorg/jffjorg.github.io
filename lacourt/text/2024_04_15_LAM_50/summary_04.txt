And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses her personal experience with a pickup truck purchased by her husband 24 years ago. The truck had electrical problems and was eventually refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. The judge does not believe this experience will cause her to be biased in this case. However, she notes that if someone believes her experience could affect her impartiality, they have until April 15, 2024, to file a statement of disqualification. The judge continues the case management conference to June 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to notify any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service.
