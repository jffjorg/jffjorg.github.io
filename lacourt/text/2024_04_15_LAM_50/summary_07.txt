And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

"In the Patel Family Trust's lawsuit against 8300 S. Vermont, Western Holdings, Sasson, and FOS, LLC, the Trust claims that the defendants intentionally concealed information about Sasson's interest in the FOS entities and failed to disclose material facts about the Subject Property's value and desirability. The defendants, including Sasson, allegedly used fake rental income to increase the property's value and facilitate its sale. The Trust further alleges that Sasson's companies, including FOS, LLC, were not good faith tenants and used deceitful tactics to increase the rental income. The court will review these allegations and determine whether the defendants' actions were indeed fraudulent and whether the Trust has a valid claim."
