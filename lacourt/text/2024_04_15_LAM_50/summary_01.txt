And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Tobi Sackeim's motion to set aside the default entered against her on January 23, 2024. The court finds that Sackeim has demonstrated good cause under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) for the court to set aside the default. Sackeim had alleged that she did not receive notice of the lawsuit and had not received a copy of the pleadings until mid-February 2024. The court notes that the proof of service indicated that the Summons and Complaint were personally served on Sackeim on November 11, 2023 at her Venice, California vacation home. The court concludes that Sackeim's mistake in not receiving the pleadings timely was inadvertent and excusable. The court orders the default entered against Sackeim to be set aside and orders her to file her proposed answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the date of the order.
