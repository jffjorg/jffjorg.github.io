[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO SET
  ASIDE DEFAULT AND LEAVE TO DEFEND THE ACTION



 
Background
Plaintiff Ryan
Blekier (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on November 21, 2022 against Defendant
Craig Sackheim. 
On February 10, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes
of action for (1) failure to pay overtime wages, (2) failure to pay terminated
or quitting employee, (3) unfair business practices, (4) failure to pay expense
reimbursement. 
On October 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint substituting Tobi Sackheim for “Doe
1.” 
On January 23, 2024, default
was entered against Tobi Sackheim. 
Tobi Sackheim now moves for an order to set aside the default entered
against her on January 23, 2024, and for leave to file an answer. No opposition
to the motion was filed. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
provides in pertinent part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
 “[B]ecause the law strongly favors trial and
disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section
473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233 [negative
treatment on other grounds].) Where the party in default moves
promptly to seek relief, and no prejudice to
the opposing party will result from setting aside the default, “very slight evidence will be
required to justify a court in setting aside the default.” (Ibid.)
In her declaration in
support of the motion, Tobi Sackheim states that “I moved to Douglas
County, Nevada in September 2022, where I have lived continuously from
September 2022 to the present.” (Sackheim Decl., ¶ 10.) She states that
“[a]lthough I maintain an apartment in Venice, California, it is not my
residence and is solely used for occasional visits to Southern California
amounting to approximately one month per year.” (Sackheim Decl., ¶ 11.) In
addition, she states that “I did not receive any pleadings in this matter until
I picked up mail that had not been forwarded to my Nevada address, in
mid-February 2024 from the Venice, California apartment. In that mail was a
copy of a Complaint and Amendment, and the ‘Request for Entry of Default’.” (Sackheim
Decl., ¶ 12.)
The Court notes that on November 15, 2023, a proof of service was
filed in this action indicating that the Summons and Complaint were personally
served on Tobi Sackheim on November 11, 2023 at “236 San Juan Ave., Apt. 3
Venice, CA 90291-5756.” In her supporting declaration, Tobi Sackheim states
that “I do not know who, if anyone, received a copy of the Summons and
Complaint on November 11, 2023 at my Venice, California vacation home. That
location is used by me as a vacation home and no one else was residing in that
Venice location in November 2023.” (Sackheim Decl., ¶ 14.) Tobi Sackheim
further states that “[i]mmediately after receiving the pleadings I began
looking for an attorney, which was difficult due to my home being in Northern
Nevada. I was finally able to I make an appointment with the Law Office of
Karen L. Winters, who I retained when we met on March 5, 2024.” (Sackheim
Decl., ¶ 15.) 
Tobi Sackheim asserts that she “may have made a mistake in not
receiving an actual copy of the pleadings timely, but it was inadvertent. She
was surprised that she was an added defendant, therefore it was excusable
neglect, which can be remedied by allowing her to move forward with her Answer
and defenses.” (Mot. at p. 5:7-10.)
Tobi Sackheim’s proposed Answer to the FAC is attached to the instant
motion. In addition, the motion
was filed on March 19, 2024, less than six months after default was entered
against Tobi Sackheim on
January 23, 2024. 
Based on the foregoing, and in light of the lack of any opposition, the
Court finds that Tobi Sackheim
has demonstrated good cause under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
for the Court to set aside the January 23, 2024 default.  
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, Tobi Sackheim’s motion is granted. The default entered against Tobi
Sackheim on January 23, 2024 is ordered set
aside. 
Tobi Sackheim is ordered to file her proposed answer to the FAC within 10
days of the date of this Order.¿ 
Tobi Sackheim is ordered
to give notice of this Order.
