And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Beverly J. Anderson and Pauline Buchanan against 720 S. Normandie Ave., LLC, Jamison Services Inc., 720 Normandie LP, 720 Normandie Partners, and Statewide Enterprises, Inc. The case involves a landlord-tenant dispute over allegations of flooding at the rental property and the defendants' failure to repair the damages.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to plead specific facts supporting an award of punitive damages. The judge also grants the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to plead facts supporting an award of punitive damages against the moving defendants.

The judge orders the defendants to file an answer to the complaint within 21 days, and orders the moving parties to give notice, unless waived. The judge notes that the court will not grant leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to support the claims.

The judge's decision is based on a review of the pleadings and the law, including cases such as Hahn v. Mirda, Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power, and Hughes v. Pair. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to plead facts meeting the required elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that the defendants have failed to plead facts supporting an award of punitive damages.
