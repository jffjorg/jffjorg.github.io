And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer of the defendant, Phoenix Distribution Solutions, LLC. However, the judge has set an order to show cause regarding the defendant's legal representation for October 28, 2024. The defendant's answer was filed without proper legal representation, as it was filed by an individual (Johnny Stange) rather than a licensed attorney. The judge has ruled that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, and therefore the defendant must appear through an attorney going forward.
