And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions to quash service of the Summons and Complaint filed by Abraham Kevorkian and Nancy Odesho Kevorkian, defendants in this case. The defendants were served with papers on March 30, 2024, but they claim that the service was improper because the papers were left on their porch and destroyed due to rain, and because they do not have a daughter matching the description given in the proof of service. The judge finds that the defendants have overcome the presumption of truth in the proof of service and placed the burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate that service occurred as stated. Since no opposition has been filed, the judge grants the motions and quashes the service of the Summons and Complaint.
