ANALYSIS:
 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff Mark
Tunne (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Brandon Blake and Blake & Wang, P.A.
(“Defendants”). Defendants filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration on July 26, 2024. No opposition has
been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281, et seq., which provides in relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(b).) Defendants demonstrate
the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties in their
agreement. (Motion, Blake Decl., Exh. 1, ¶5.) The arbitration provision states:
“In the event of a dispute or controversy between the parties hereto with
reference to this contract, the fees, or the services provided for herein, the
parties agree to submit such dispute to binding arbitration under the Commercia
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, before a single
arbitrator with knowledge of the entertainment industry, in the City of Beverly
Hills, California.” (Ibid.) The Complaint alleges a cause of action
based on Defendants purportedly overcharging fees in connection with the
parties’ agreement. (Compl., ¶8.) The Court finds, therefore, that the claims
alleged against Defendants in the Complaint are subject to arbitration and
there are no grounds to deny the instant Motion. In light of the Motion to
Compel Arbitration being granted, a stay of the action is appropriate under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Brandon Blake and Blake & Wang, P.A.’s Motion
to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED. THE ACTION IS STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION. 
 
AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING STATUS OF ARBITRATION IS
SET FOR APRIL 7, 2025 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE.
