Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by Defendant Francis Vinuya. The demurrer is brought against the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Covina Hills MHC, alleging causes of action for Declaration of Mobile Home Abandoned, Open Book Account, Breach of Implied in Fact Contract, Common Counts, Declaratory Relief, Breach of Written Contract, and Intentional Misrepresentation.

The Court has overruled the demurrer as to the first, fifth, and sixth causes of action, but sustained it without leave to amend as to the second, third, fourth, and seventh causes of action. The Court has also set an order to show cause regarding bifurcation and subsequent transfer of the fifth cause of action to the unlimited jurisdiction court.

The Court's ruling is based on the relief sought in the Complaint, which includes a declaration that the mobilehome is abandoned, and the Court's jurisdiction over the fifth cause of action for declaratory relief. The Court has not ruled on the merits of the demurrer, but has instead focused on the procedural issues raised by the demurrer.
