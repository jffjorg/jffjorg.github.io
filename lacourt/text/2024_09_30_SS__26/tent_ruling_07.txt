AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING THE STATUS OF PHOENIX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS, LLC’s LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR OCTOBER

ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Addison Culley (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendants Phoenix
Distribution Solutions, LLC (“Defendant PDS) and Johnny Stange (“Defendant
Stange”) on March 25, 2024. Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on
May 23, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Strike Answer on July
26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to Strike the Answer as to Defendant PDS is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436 on the grounds that
Defendant PDS, despite being a corporation, was not represented by an attorney
at the time its Answer was filed. Instead, the Answer was made by Defendant
Stange. (Answer, filed 05/23/24, p. 1.)
 
Motions to strike in courts of limited jurisdiction may only
challenge pleadings on the basis that “the damages or relief sought are not
supported by the allegations of the complaint.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 92,
subd. (d).) The instant Motion to Strike Defendant PDS’ Answer does not pertain
to whether the damages or relief sought are supported by the allegations, and
therefore, cannot be raised in this Court. 
 
That being said, it is black letter law that a corporation cannot represent
itself in court. (Clean Air Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit
Dist. (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco Constr. Engineers,
Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).) This rule applies
to all entities regarded as separate from their owners, including partnerships
and unincorporated associations. (See Clean Air Transport Systems,
supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 578.) Defendant PDS’ Answer was filed by its representative
instead of a licensed attorney. Therefore, Defendant PDS filed the Answer
without proper legal representation and must appear through an attorney
going forward. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Addison Culley’s Motion
to Strike Answer of Defendant Phoenix
Distribution Solutions, LLC is DENIED. 
 
ON ITS OWN MOTION, THE COURT SETS
AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING THE STATUS OF PHOENIX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS, LLC’s LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR OCTOBER
28, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
