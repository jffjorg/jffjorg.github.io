Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges the
following facts: Cross-Complainant is the owner and occupier of the property
located at 1720 E 2nd Street, #5, Long Beach, California. (Compl., ¶3.) On April
8, 2022, Cross-Complainant entered into a written contract with Cross-Defendant,
pursuant to which Cross-Defendant “agreed to and did provide fire emergency
services, including setting up negative air pressure, removing affected
materials, HEPA vacuum affected areas, encapsulate areas, apply smoke and soot
degreaser, relating to damage at the Property.” (Id. at ¶7.) Under the
contract, Cross-Complaint was obligated to pay for services rendered and the
cost of materials supplied. (Ibid.) The sum of $29,984.59 was initially
owed for the services and supplies provided by Cross-Defendant. (Id. at
¶8.) Cross-Complainant made partial payments totaling $13,494.00 but the sum of
$16,490.59 remains due and owing since approximately September 2, 2022. (Ibid.)
Cross-Complainant has acknowledged that $16,490.59 remains due and owing but
has not paid the balance owing. (Ibid.) Cross-Defendant has performed
all obligations required under the contract, except those it has been prevented
or excused from performing. (Id. at ¶9.) 
 
Allegations in the
Cross-Complaint
 
On April 8, 2022, Cross-Complainant
entered into a written contract with Cross-Defendant, pursuant to which
Cross-Defendant “agreed to and did provide fire emergency services, including
setting up negative air pressure, removing affected materials, HEPA vacuum
affected areas, encapsulate areas, apply smoke and soot degreaser, relating to
damage at the Property.” (Cross-Compl., ¶3.) Cross-Defendant never provided an
estimate for the work to be completed to Cross-Complainant, nor was an amount
of payment for the services stated in the contract. (Id. at ¶5.)
Cross-Defendant agreed to provide the services to Plaintiff for payment in the
amount of $13,494.00. (Id. at ¶6.) After Cross-Defendant did the agreed
upon work, it also knocked down walls and restructured them, painted the walls
and did additional cleanup and hauling work without Cross-Complainant’s consent.
(Id. at ¶7.) Cross-Complainant made the promised payment of $13,494.00,
which has been acknowledged by Cross-Defendant. (Id. at ¶8.) 
 
 
Demurrer to the
Cross-Complaint
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Declaration of Demurring Party, filed 08/26/24.) Cross-Defendant demurs on the grounds that the
Cross-Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and
is uncertain. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e), (f).) Special
demurrers, however, are not permitted in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Therefore, the Court will not consider the
demurrer for uncertainty. 
 
Cross-Defendant demurs to the
entire Cross-Complaint on the grounds that it is premised on the filing of this
action and on the filing of a mechanic’s lien on the Property, both of which
are protected by the litigation privilege set forth at Civil Code section 47. The
demurrer, however, does not cite any specific allegation in the Cross-Complaint
that refers to the the filing of this action or the mechanic’s lien as the
basis of Cross-Complainant’s damages, except in the fifth cause of action for
unfair business practices. (See Cross-Compl., ¶45.) Accordingly, the litigation
privilege does not provide a basis to demur to the entire Cross-Complaint.
Instead, the Court will consider the demurrer as to each cause of action in the
Cross-Complaint. 
 
1st Cause of
Action for Breach of Contract
 
A cause of action for breach of
contract must allege “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.) The
Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant breached the parties’ agreement
“[b]y attempting to charge Vivian more than was required under the contract.”
(Cross-Compl., ¶12.) The contract states that Cross-Complainant agrees to pay
Cross-Defendant pursuant to its price list, a copy of which is attached and
incorporated into the contract. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶2.) No price list is
attached to the copy of the agreement attached to the Cross-Complaint, however.
(Id. at Exh. 1.) Cross-Complainant alleges that the parties agreed to a
price of $13,494.00. (Id. at ¶8.) 
 
Overcharging or overbilling may
constitute a breach in the sense that it violates a term of the parties’
agreement, namely the price, but Cross-Defendant is correct to point out that
there is no allegation showing recoverable damages as a result of this attempt
to overcharge. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Complainant suffered “economic
damages, as well as mental and emotional distress.” (Id. at ¶13.)
Emotional distress damages are not available for breach of contract. (See McMahon
v. Craig (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1513.) Nor are any facts alleged to
show what economic damages Cross-Complainant incurred as a result of the
attempted overcharging. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Complainant only
paid $13,494.00. The opposition argues that Cross-Complainant can recover the attorney’s
fees she incurred in this action as damages but fails to provide clear citation
to authority for this rule. Instead, Cross-Complainant cites broadly to Monster,
LLC v. Superior Court (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1214, without page citation or
any further analysis. (Opp., p. 9:9-12.) In any event, attorney’s fees are not
alleged as damages in the breach of contract cause of action. Therefore, the
demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract is sustained. 
 
            2nd
Cause of Action for Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
The implied covenant prevents one side
from unfairly frustrating the other's right to receive the benefits of the
agreement actually made. (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317,
349–350, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (2022)
Contracts, § 822.) The covenant does not impose substantive terms beyond those
of the contract. (Guz, at pp. 349–350, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089.) A
plaintiff claiming breach must allege the defendant's wrongful conduct was
contrary to the contract's purpose and the parties’ legitimate expectations.
(Avidity Partners, LLC v. State of California (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1180,
1204, 165 Cal.Rptr.3d 299.)
 
(Cordoba Corp. v. City of
Industry (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 145, 156.) The demurrer is brought on the
grounds that the second cause of action is merely an improper restatement of
the cause of action for breach of contract. (Citing Careau & Co. v. Sec.
Pac. Bus. Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 1371, 1394.) The
Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant represented that it would accept
$13,494.00 for the services provided, then “took advantage of the ambiguity in
the contract regarding what was to be done under the contract, the amount
required for its services, as well as Vivian’s age, economic status, the
exigent nature of the situation creating her lack of bargaining power, and
provided unnecessary services and/or charged Vivian excessive amounts for the
services rendered.” (Cross-Compl., ¶¶17-18.) 
 
The opposition to the demurrer argues
this is separate from a simple breach of contract because it alleges that Cross-Defendant
was invested with discretionary power in determining the services to be
provided and took advantage by providing services that were not needed. (Citing
Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 372 [“The covenant of good faith finds particular
application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary
power affecting the rights of another. Such power must be exercised in good
faith.”].) This is sufficient to state a duty owed separate from those owed
expressly under the contract. Cross-Defendant’s reply does not address this
case law and instead makes arguments outside of the pleadings regarding the
reasonableness of its conduct. (Reply, pp. 2:29-3:2.) This is not proper on
demurrer. 
 
However, as with the first cause
of action for breach of contract, the Cross-Complaint does not allege what
damages Cross-Complainant sustained from the breach of the implied covenant.
The allegations that Cross-Complainant suffered economic damages is at odds
with the earlier allegation that she paid the price to which she had agreed. Therefore,
the demurrer to the second cause of action is also sustained.
 
            3rd
Cause of Action for Intentional Misrepresentation; 4th Cause of Action for
False Promise
 
“Fraud actions... are subject to
strict requirements of particularity in pleading. The idea seems to be that
allegations of fraud involve a serious attack on character, and fairness to the
defendant demands that he should receive the fullest possible details of the
charge in order to prepare his defense.” (Committee on Children's Television
v. Gen. Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d
197, 211.) “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which “show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.” ’ ” (Lazar, supra, 12
Cal.4th at p. 645, 49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981.)” (Tenet Healthsystem
Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 837.) 
 
The Cross-Complaint does not
allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representation regarding the contract price was tendered. It simply alleges
that Cross-Defendant falsely represented it would accept $13,494.00 as payment
for the services rendered. (Cross-Compl., ¶¶22-23, 30-31.) This is not
sufficient for fraud causes of action. Cross-Complainant makes the argument
that fraud may be based on conduct that is designed to mislead, not just on
verbal or written statements, but this is irrelevant to the lack of specificity
here. The Cross-Complaint is so vague that it cannot be determined how
Cross-Defendant made the allegedly false representations and promises. Finally,
as discussed above, the Cross-Complaint does not allege what economic damages
Cross-Complainant sustained as a result of the allegedly false representations
and/or promises. (Id. at ¶¶27, 35.) 
 
            5th
Cause of Action for Unlawful Business Practices
 
Business and Professions Code section
17200 authorizes a civil action for any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice. In order to allege an unlawful business practice, the
plaintiff must specify the law that was purportedly violated. (Khoury v.
Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) The Cross-Complaint
does not allege that any law was violated by Cross-Defendant’s conduct. 
 
The demurrer does not explain
what Cross-Complainant must allege in order to state a cause of action based on
unfair business practices. It simply contends that it “cannot be based upon
general common law principles.” (Citing Textron Financial Corp. v. National
Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1061,1072.)
Plaintiff’s opposition contends that she is only required to allege that
“members of the public are likely to be deceived.” (Citing Bank of the West
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1266-1267.) The allegations that
Cross-Defendant took advantage of the ambiguity in the contract to represent
that it would accept a certain contract price and then later sought more than
that price are sufficient does not meet this standard because it is specific to
Cross-Complainant’s experience with Cross-Defendant. The Cross-Complaint does
not allege that this was practice used by Cross-Defendant in its dealings with
anyone else. Also, the question of alleging damages as a result of this
purportedly unfair business practice, as with all the other causes of action,
remains. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) Cross-Complainant has cited case law
that suggests it is possible to allege attorney’s fees as damages. Leave to
amend is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendant
PRC Restoration, Inc.’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED WITH 20
DAYS’ LEAVE TO AMEND.
