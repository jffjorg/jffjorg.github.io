ANALYSIS:
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff Arbat, A Law Corporation
(“Plaintiff”) served Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant
Ernest Darryl Wilkerson (“Defendant”). (Motion, Kazachki
Decl., Exhs. 1-2.) To date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
discovery. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions
(“the Motion”) on August 21, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond also constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the sanctions sought are
excessive for straightforward and unopposed motions to compel initial
responses. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are granted against
Defendant in the amount of $410.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at
$350.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Kazachki Decl., ¶5.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Arbat, A Law Corporation’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT ERNEST DARYL WILKERSON IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS,
SET ONE, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT
ERNEST DARYL WILKERSON IS ALSO ORDERED
TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $410.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF
THIS ORDER.
