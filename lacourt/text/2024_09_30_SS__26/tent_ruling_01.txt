TO QUASH SERVICE

ANALYSIS: 
 

On September 27, 2022, Plaintiff Consolidated
Electrical Distributors, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action
against Defendants Abraham Kevorkian (“Defendant Kevorkian”) and Nancy
OdeshoKevorkian (“Defendant OdeshoKevorkian”). Plaintiff filed proofs of
substitute service on June 10, 2024. 
 
Defendants, appearing specially,
filed the instant Motions to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint on
August 21, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants move to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff did not serve
them in accordance with any statutory method. The Motion is brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, which states: “A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or
her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1), emphasis added.) 
 
Where service is challenged, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective
service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However,
a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
The proofs of substitute service
are attested to by a registered process server, thereby placing the burden on
Defendants to overcome the presumption of truth in the return of service.
(Proofs of Service, filed 06/10/24, ¶7.) The proof of service states that
Defendants were sub-served by leaving the papers at 728 Colman St,
Altadena, California on March 30, 2024 with “ ‘Jane Doe’
(20's/F/Cauc/130/5'6/Black H/Brown E), Possibly Daughter.” (Id. at ¶5.) With
their Motions, however, Defendants submit declarations
stating that service did not take place as stated because they do not have a
daughter matching that description, and in any event, their daughter was not at
home that day. (Motion, Kevorkian Decl., ¶7; Motion, OdeshoKevorkian Decl.,
¶7.) Furthermore, the papers were simply left on their porch on March 30, 2024
and were destroyed because it rained that day. (Id. at ¶¶2.) Upon
retrieving the papers, Defendants came to the Pasadena Courthouse to look at
the case file and discovered this action. (Ibid.)
 
These declarations are sufficient
to overcome the presumption of truth in the proof of service and place the
burden on Plaintiff to demonstrate that service occurred as stated. However, no
opposition has been filed. Therefore, Defendants have demonstrated grounds to
quash service of the Summons and Complaint.
 
Conclusion
 
Specially Appearing Defendants
Abraham Kevorkian and Nancy Odesho Kevorkian’s Motions to Quash Service of the
Summons and Complaint are GRANTED.
