And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Ava, Inc. v. Spencer, et al., a petition to confirm an arbitration award. The petition was filed on May 24, 2024, but no proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing has been filed. The arbitration agreement does not specify the manner of service, so the petition must be served in the manner provided by law for service of a summons. The Judge finds that the statutory requirements have not been satisfied and continues the petition to January 27, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By December 30, 2024, the petitioner must file and serve proof of service of the petition and notice of new hearing date. Failure to do so may result in the petition being dismissed.
