And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at deposition. The plaintiff must appear for deposition within 45 days of the order, at a date and time to be determined by the defense counsel. The judge based this decision on the defendants' demonstration that they had satisfied the meet and confer requirement and that the plaintiff had failed to cooperate in the taking of their deposition. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's failure to communicate regarding discovery was not justified and that the defendants were entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff's appearance.
