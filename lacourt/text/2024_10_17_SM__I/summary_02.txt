And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is trying to determine whether Vida Longevity Fund (VLF) owns one insurance policy or two. VLF is claiming that it owns a policy issued in California, while Olga Mellican, the defendant, is contesting this claim. The judge is reviewing the pleadings and finding that there is only one policy at issue, which was sold to Silverpoint Settlements Trust, a Delaware trust. The judge is denying Mellican's motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) because there is a dispute over the policy proceeds. The judge is also denying Mellican's Special Motion to Strike (SMS) as untimely, as it was filed more than 60 days after service of process. The judge believes that the parties should work out their differences and is not granting a summary judgment in this case.
