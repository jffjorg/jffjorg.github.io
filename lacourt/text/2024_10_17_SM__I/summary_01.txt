And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to sever the two cases alleging sexual assault by the defendant. The defendant, Way, is seeking to withdraw from a stipulation to consolidate the cases for trial, citing concerns about jury confusion and undue prejudice to his defense. The plaintiffs, Doe 1 and Doe 2, argue that Way should be held to the stipulation and that the cases should proceed to trial together.

The judge is concerned about the potential for jury confusion and prejudice to the defense if the cases are consolidated, but is also mindful of the potential unfairness to Way if he is forced to proceed with the consolidated trial. The judge is considering allowing Way to withdraw from the stipulation, but only if all parties agree to do so. The judge is concerned about the potential impact on the plaintiffs if the trial date is delayed or cancelled, and is considering allowing the trial to proceed as scheduled while the motion to vacate the default is decided.

The judge will discuss the matter further with the parties and may issue a revised ruling at a later date.
