And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production, and to deem requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff. The defendant had served discovery upon the plaintiff on January 26, 2024, with responses due by March 1, 2024. The plaintiff failed to provide timely responses, despite receiving extensions. The defendant's motions were filed on May 24, 2024, and the plaintiff provided responses on July 24, 2024. The judge finds that the motions are moot and are therefore denied.

The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $900.00. The plaintiff is not entitled to sanctions because she failed to provide a reasonable explanation for her failure to provide timely responses. The judge reduces the sanctions from $3,120.00 to $900.00 after deducting duplicative charges. The judge also denies the plaintiff's counsel's request for $2,711.76 in sanctions.
