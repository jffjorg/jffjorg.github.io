Juan Pulido (“Plaintiff”) sued defendants the County of Los Angeles (“the
County”); Ngozi Chukwuemek, NP; Trini Bui, NP; Monika Villazon, NP; Taylor
Docter, PGY3; Mina Masri, D.O.; Keith Carrillo, NP; Beverly Welch; Tchuisse
Hermione, NP; Manuel O. Natividad, M.D.; Veronica Hernandez-Lara, NP; Rea
Whitman, PA; Chase Luther, M.D.; Robert Paquette, M.D.; Ziba Dayani, PA;
Ekaterina Korol, NP; Dina Villapudua, PA; Olivia Gomez, MD; Brittany Slaughter,
PA; Alexis M. Peters, M.D.; Aung Lin, D.O.; Christina R. Ghaly, M.D.; Timothy
Belavich, Ph.D.; and Sean Henderson, M.D. (together “Defendants”) on March 20,
2024.
 
            The
operative pleading alleges that Plaintiff was arrested in West Covina in
September 2022. He was bitten by a police dog during the arrest. Plaintiff was
transferred to County custody shortly afterward. The dog bite became infected.
While incarcerated over the course of the following several months, the various
individual Defendants provided Plaintiff medical care. But, Plaintiff avers,
they ignored his pleas for more intensive treatment, the condition of the wound
worsened, and he did not receive satisfactory treatment for his infection
before his discharge on July 11, 2023. Plaintiff also asserts he began
requesting his medical records from the County beginning in March 2023, and the
County has violated its own policies by refusing to provide complete records. 
 
            The
First Amended Complaint, filed on May 23, 2024, asserts causes of action for
(1) medical negligence, (2) negligence, (3) Government Code § 845.6, (4) Bane
Act Violations, (5) Health & Safety Code § 123110, and (6) Evidence Code §
1168.
 
            Following
a demurrer and motion to strike the First Amended Complaint filed by
Defendants, the Court overruled the demurrer the first and third causes of
action, and sustained with leave to amend the demurrer
to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.
 
            Plaintiff
filed his operative second amended complaint (“SAC”) on September 10, 2024. The
SAC asserts causes of action for (1) medical negligence, (2) negligence, (3)
Government Code § 845.6, (4) Bane Act Violations, (5) Health & Safety Code
§ 123110, and (6) Evidence Code § 1168.
 
            On October
28, 2024, Defendants demurred to the second,
fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action. Defendants also filed a
motion to strike portions of the SAC. Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and motion
to strike. 
 
            The demurrer is sustained. The motion
to strike is granted. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a);
see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of
a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions
of law. (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280,
286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining
its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to
substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In
applying these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton v.
Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Analysis
 
Second Cause of Action for Negligent
Hiring, Supervision, and Retention[1] 
 
Plaintiff asserts his second cause
of action only against Defendants Ghaly, Belavich, and Henderson. 
 
An employer may be liable in
negligence “if it ‘knew or should have known that hiring [a tortfeasor]
employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm
materializes.’ ” (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th
1133, 1139.) Alternatively, “[t]o establish negligent supervision, a plaintiff
must show that a person in a supervisorial position over the actor had prior
knowledge of the actor’s propensity to do the bad act.” (Z.V. v. County of
Riverside (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 889, 902.)
 
Here, the SAC alleges – on
information and belief – that Defendants Ghaly, Belavich, and Henderson were “provided
reports outlining the lack of care provided to Plaintiff” by NP Villazon (SAC ¶¶
29, 42), NP Carrillo (SAC ¶ 34), Dr. Natividad (SAC ¶ 37), and PA Dayani (SAC ¶
45, 49, 51). The SAC alleges that no corrective action was taken in the
supervision of these Individual Defendants. (SAC ¶¶ 29, 34, 37, 42, 45, 49,
51.)
 
These allegations are inadequate to
state a claim. 
 
First, Plaintiff
improperly relies on allegations based on information and belief. A complaint
must contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1); see Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531, 537 [reciting “settled law that a
pleading must allege facts and not conclusions, and that material facts must be
alleged directly and not by way of recital”].) The complaint ordinarily may
allege ultimate rather than evidentiary facts, and it may allege “ ‘on
information and belief any matters that are not within [the plaintiff's]
personal knowledge if he has information leading him to believe that the
allegations are true.’ ” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550 [quoting Pridonoff v. Balokovich (1951) 36 Cal.2d 788].) But “a
pleading made on information and belief is insufficient if it ‘merely assert[s]
the facts so alleged without alleging such information that “lead[s] [the
plaintiff] to believe that the allegations are true.” ’ ” (Gomes v.
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1158–1159
[quoting Doe v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 551, fn.
5].) Here, the SAC does not allege the factual basis leading Plaintiff to
believe the allegations based on information and belief were true. 
 
Moreover, in the absence of any
allegations as to when these alleged reports were provided to Defendants Ghaly,
Belavich, and Henderson, Plaintiff cannot show causation between Defendants’
duty to supervise and the injury that occurred. 
 
The demurrer to the second cause of
action is sustained.[2]

 
Fourth Cause of Action for Violation of the Bane Act
 
The elements of a Bane Act claim
are: (1) defendant interfered with or attempted to interfere with plaintiffs’
constitutional or statutory right by threatening or committing violent acts; (2)
plaintiff reasonably believed that if he or she exercised his or her
constitutinal right, defendant would commit violence against plaintiff or
plaintiff’s property; (3) defendant injured plaintiffs or their property to
prevent them from exercising their constitutional right or retaliated against
plaintiffs for having exercised their constitutional right; (4) plaintiffs were
harmed; and (5) defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing
plaintiffs' harm. (Austin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 860, 882 (Austin B.).) “The essence of a Bane Act claim is
that the defendant, by the specified improper means (i.e.,‘threat[ ],
intimidation or coercion’), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing
something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff
to do something that he or she was not required to do under the law.” (King
v. State of Cal. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 265, 294; Austin B., supra,
149 Cal.App.4th at p. 883.)
 
To prevail
on a Bane Act claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant has
“interfere[d]” with the “exercise or enjoyment” of her constitutional rights,
(2) “by threat, intimidation, or coercion,” and (3) with the “specific intent
to violate” her civil rights. (Civ. Code, § 52.1; Schmid v. City &
County of San Francisco (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 470, 483; Shoyoye v.
County of Los Angeles (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 947, 956-957.)
 
As this Court previously noted, no
acts of violence or threats are required to state a claim under Civil Code
section 52.1. However, the allegations must show either (1) that Defendants
threatened to commit, or did commit, violent acts against Plaintiff; (2) that
Plaintiff refrained from exercising a constitutional right for fear of
violence; or (3) that Defendants were motivated by a desire to prevent
Plaintiff from exercising his rights.
 
Here, Plaintiff relies on the second
cause of action as the predicate act for the interference of Plaintiff’s legal
rights under Government Code section 845.6. However, this alone cannot state a
claim for a violation of the Bane Act. (Shoyoye v. County of Los
Angeles, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 956-957 [reasoning that the
“threats, intimidation, or coercion” requirement was intended to prevent the
Bane Act from extending to ordinary tort claims]) 


All the second cause of action does
is show an interference with a legal right but there are no allegations of intimidation,
threats or coercion. Rather, the SAC demonstrates numerous acts by Defendants
to provide Plaintiff with medical care. (SAC ¶¶ 28-64.) In
contrast, coercion is terms of art under the Act, reserved for “egregious
interferences with constitutional rights, [and] not just any tort” such as
assault. (See Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th
360, 395 [; Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 960-961
[detention of plaintiff insufficient].) The SAC alleges facts showing only that the medical care provided
was below the standard of care. This is insufficient to allege a Bane Act violation.

 
The demurrer to the fourth cause of
action is sustained. 
 
Fifth Cause of Action for Violation of the Health and Safety
Code § 123110 and Sixth Cause of Action for Violation of Evidence Code § 1168
 
Plaintiff asserts his fifth and
sixth causes of action against the County only, under two statutes related to disclosure
of medical records: “[A]ny adult patient of a health care provider, any minor
patient authorized by law to consent to medical treatment, and any patient's
personal representative shall be entitled to inspect patient records upon
presenting to the health care provider a request for those records and upon
payment of reasonable costs[.]” (Health & Saf. Code, § 123110(a).) And
“[a]ny patient or representative aggrieved by a violation of Section 123110
may, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, bring an action against
the health care provider to enforce the obligations prescribed by Section
123110. Any judgment rendered in the action may, in the discretion of the
court, include an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing
party. (Id., § 123120.) “Before the filing of any action or the
appearance of a defendant in an action, if an attorney at law or his or her
representative presents a written authorization therefor signed by an adult
patient, ... to a medical provider, the medical provider shall promptly make
all of the patient's records under the medical provider’s custody or control
available for inspection and copying by the attorney at law or his or her
representative.” (Evid. Code, § 1158(b).) 
 
The County again demurs on the
ground that it is immunized from liability by Government Code section 844.6. 
 
Section 844.6 states that “a public
entity is not liable for ... [a]n injury to a prisoner”, with limited
exceptions. (Gov. Code, § 844.6(a)(2).) “[T]he plain language of section 844.6
is clear and unambiguous”, and it provides a “broad grant of immunity”. (Bitner
v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th
1048, 1064.) The immunity precludes statutory liability as well as common-law
liability. (Id., at p. 1063 [“Because a public entity’s liability is
itself a creature of statute, interpreting section 844.6 to exempt liability
created by statute would ... render[] section 844.6 all but meaningless”].) 
 
Plaintiff argues -- without legal
authority -- that Section 844.6 does not apply to the statutory right to access
of medical records.
 
This argument is not well taken.
Where the legislature intended to exempt immunity, it does so clearly. One such
relevant example is the legislature’s decision to provide a statutory
exception to section 844.6’s broad immunity for public entities is the failure
to summon medical care in accordance with Government Code section 845.6. (Gov.
Code, § 845.6.) Specifically, Section 845.6 provides that public entities
remain vicariously liable for public employees acting within the scope of their
employment if the employee “knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in
need of immediate medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to summon
such medical care.” (Id.) The legislature’s inaction to create such an
exception to the
statutory right to access of medical records is dispositive on this immunity
issue. 


The demurrer to these causes of action
is sustained. 
 
Legal Standard for
Motions to Strike
 
            “The court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant”
matters include allegations not essential to the claim, allegations neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3).)
 
            Here,
Defendants seek to strike numerous allegations in the SAC that it contends are
false, opinion, or improper legal conclusions. The motion to strike is not well
taken. 
 
These allegations
provide context to Plaintiff’s claims and the veracity of these allegations
cannot be determined by the court on a motion to strike. Moreover, Defendants’
use of the motion to strike to strike numerous non-material allegations in the
SAC is improper. (See PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1680, 1683 [“[T]he motion to strike should be cautious and sparing.
We have no intention of creating a procedural “line item veto” for the civil
defendant.”].) 
 
            Thus, the
motion to strike portions of the SAC is denied.     
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer is sustained
in its entirety. Plaintiff has
failed to make a specific showing of a reasonable possibility of amending. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians' Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43 [“The
plaintiff bears the burden of proving there is a reasonable possibility of
amendment.”].)  Accordingly, the demurrer
to the second, fourth, fifth and sixth causes of action of the Second Amended
Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. Those causes of action are
dismissed with prejudice as to Defendant County.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.
