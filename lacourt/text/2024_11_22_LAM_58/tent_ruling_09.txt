[1] Plaintiff
again assigns this cause of action the heading “negligence”, though the body of
the SAC clarifies he is relying on a negligent hiring theory. (See SAC, ¶ 91
[“negligent and reckless with regarding to the hiring, training, supervision
...”].)


[2] The
remaining allegations regarding “court orders” (SAC ¶¶ 43, 59) only concern
Defendants’ duty to provide care or comply with a court order and are not a
basis for the Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention claim.
