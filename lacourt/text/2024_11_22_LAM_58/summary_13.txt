And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to serve process on the Defendants by delivery to the California Secretary of State. The Plaintiff, Caitlin Morris, is seeking to serve process on the Defendants, Echo Park Properties, LLC and Vesa Commercial, Inc., due to alleged unhabitable living conditions in her apartment. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's affidavit is insufficient to demonstrate that process cannot be served with reasonable diligence, as it does not show any attempts to locate officers of the corporation or to serve process on any other agents. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's attempts to serve process on the designated agent and the registered agent were unsuccessful.
