Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company and Norm Reeves Ford Superstore against Vanessa Tellez. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action (negligent repair) without leave to amend, but has overruled the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action (fraudulent concealment).

The judge has found that the plaintiff's claim for negligent repair lacks the essential element of damages, as the alleged repairs were covered under warranty and the plaintiff did not incur any out-of-pocket expenses. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment alleges that the defendant knew about a defective transmission and concealed that fact, which is sufficient to state a claim.

The judge has disagreed with the defendant's argument that the economic loss rule bars both claims, finding that the plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment is not solely based on a failure to perform, but rather on the defendant's affirmative misrepresentations.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
