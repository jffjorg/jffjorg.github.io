The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action to the complaint, including allegations of medical malpractice, violations of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), and failure to provide emergency services and care. The Defendant opposes the addition of new causes of action, arguing that it will cause prejudice and delay the trial.

The Court granted the motion, allowing the Plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint.
