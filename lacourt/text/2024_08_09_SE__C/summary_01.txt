And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' ex parte application to advance the hearing on their motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The defendants argue that they need to depose the plaintiff to assess the plaintiff's injuries, complaints, and treatment in order to determine if independent medical examinations are necessary. The judge has advanced the hearing from April 9, 2025 to November 6, 2024, and has continued the hearing to that date. The judge has also deemed the defendants' ex parte application to be the moving papers, and has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve opposition and reply briefs in compliance with the new hearing date.
