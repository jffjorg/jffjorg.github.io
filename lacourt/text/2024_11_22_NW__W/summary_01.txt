And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's discovery verifications. The plaintiff has been trying to secure verifications from the defendant since August 2024, but the defendant has failed to provide any discovery verifications. The plaintiff's motion is granted because the defendant has failed to provide complete, signed verifications to the plaintiff's discovery requests, as required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.250 and 2031.250.

Additionally, the judge grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant and the defendant's counsel in the reduced amount of $1,460.00. The plaintiff's counsel spent 6 hours preparing the motion and attending the hearing, and the plaintiff seeks reimbursement for these expenses.
