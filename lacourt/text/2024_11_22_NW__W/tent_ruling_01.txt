BACKGROUND
 
On June 28,
2023, Plaintiffs Jose Mera and Mirna Mera filed a complaint against Defendant
Maureen Amirkhanyn (erroneously sued as “Marine Amirkhanyan”) for motor vehicle
negligence. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant’s Discovery Verifications is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff
Jose Mera moves the court for an order compelling Defendant Amirkhanyn to
provide complete, verified responses to Plaintiff’s request for Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. Plaintiff
also requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of
record for failing to provide verified discovery responses and failing to
engage in the meet and confer process. 
 
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.250 and 2031.250, the party to whom the
interrogatories and requests for production of documents have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath unless the response contains only
objections. (CCP §§2030.250(a), 2031.250(a).) When the responses consist of
objections and substantive responses, verifications are required as to the
substantive responses, but not as to the objections. (Food 4 Less
Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) 
 
 
Plaintiff
makes this motion on the grounds Defendant Amirkhanyn failed to provide the
required signed verifications to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories and Request
for Production of Documents. Plaintiff contends they have been trying to secure
verifications from Defendant since August 2024; however, it has now been three
months since the filing of the motion and Defendant has failed to provide any
discovery verifications. Plaintiff notes the responses include more than just
objections and therefore, verifications are required to the substantive
responses at least. 
 
Defendant has
failed to oppose this motion. Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Discovery Verifications. Defendant is
to provide verifications to their discovery responses no later than 20.  
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel for a total of
$2,510.00 as Defendant acted without “substantial justification” when failing
to provide complete, signed verifications to Plaintiffs discovery requests for
almost (3) months and failing to respond to any of Plaintiff’s meet and confer
attempts. Plaintiff’s counsel attests they spent 3 hours preparing the motion,
anticipate another 2 hours preparing a reply to the opposition, and another two
hours preparing and attending the hearing on the matter. (Ortega Decl. ¶12.)
Plaintiff’s hourly rate is $350.00. (Ortega Decl. ¶12.) Counsel also seeks the
$60.00 filing fee. (Ortega Decl. ¶12.)
 
Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,460.00 (3
hours preparing the motion, 1 hour attending the hearing and $60 filing fee).
