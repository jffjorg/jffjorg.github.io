     CASE NO.: 20STCV36117
 
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT RODOLFO MARTINEZ’S ATTORNEY’S MOTION
  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
 



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This a
personal injury action arising out of injuries Plaintiff Arsho Haroutanian
(“Plaintiff”) suffered when he was getting out of a passenger van allegedly owned
by Defendants Access Services (“Access”) and San Gabriel Transit, Inc. (“San
Gabriel”), and operated by Rodolfo Martinez (“Martinez”) (collectively, “Defendants”).
(See First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), ¶ 9.)
          Martinez’s
counsel Kenton Moore (“Moore”) now seeks to be
relieved as counsel of record.  
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On September
22, 2020, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) General Negligence; and
(2) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention. 
On March 4,
2021, Plaintiff filed his FAC, alleging (1) General Negligence; (2) Negligent
Hiring, Supervision, and Retention; and (3) Violation of Civil Unruh Civil
Rights Act. 
On August 12,
2021, Access and San Gabriel filed their Answer to the FAC.
On November
17, 2023, Martinez filed his Answer. 
          On July 12, 2024, Moore filed the
instant Motion to be Relieved as Martinez’s Counsel. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 284(1) [1]
allows for a change or substitution of attorney “[u]pon the consent of both
client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes.” If
both parties do not consent to a substitution of attorney, Code of Civil
Procedure § 284(2) allows for a substitution “[u]pon the order of the court,
upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the
other.” 
Under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, an attorney seeking to withdraw by motion rather than by consent of the
client is required to make that motion using approved Judicial Council forms. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a-e).) The motion requires a declaration stating
“in general terms, and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(1).” (Id. at (c).) A proposed order prepared on form MC-053
must also be lodged with the court with the moving papers. (Id. at (e).)
The motion, notice of motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and all other
parties who have appeared in the case. (Id. at (d).) If the notice is served
by mail or e-mail, the notice must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts that show that either the service address is current or that “[t]he
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved.” (Id.)  
IV.     ANALYSIS
A.            
Moore’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is Granted.
          Moore moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Martinez because “[t]here has
been a breakdown in communication.” (See Declaration of Kenton Moore filed July 12, 2024 (“Moore
Decl.”), ¶ 2.) 
          Moore has submitted evidence suggesting he is entitled to an order relieving him
as Martinez’s counsel. Moore submitted a declaration attesting to the
complete breakdown in communication, served the notice by mail and stated the
mailing address is the last known address of Martinez, and filed a proposed
order on form MC-053. (See Moore Decl.) Martinez hasn’t filed a written opposition.
 
V.       CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court
GRANTS Moore’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 2, 2024



Hon. Michael R. Amerian
Judge,
  Superior Court
