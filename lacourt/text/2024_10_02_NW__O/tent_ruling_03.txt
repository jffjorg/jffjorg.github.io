LLC (“Defendant”).  
Plaintiff
seeks to compel Defendant’s responses to her request for production of documents (“RFPs”), her form
and special interrogatories (“FROGS” and “SROGS”, respectively), and also
requests an order deeming the truth of the matters admitted in her requests for
admissions (“RFAs”).

1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3) Violation
of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Requests for Production
 A party upon whom a demand for the production
of documents has been made has 30 days after service of the demand to respond.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)[1] The
propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for response. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.270(a).) When a party fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a motion to compel
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) A responding party that
does not provide responses waives the right to object to the demand, including
objections based on privilege or work product. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).) 
B.            
Interrogatories 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to
compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)    
C.            
Requests for Admission
“Any party may obtain discovery . . .
by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared…” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made
serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)    
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Four motions
are presently before the Court. The ruling will address Plaintiff’s Motion
RFPs, then its Motion FROGS, then its Motion SROGS, and, finally, its Motion
RFAs. 
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs is Granted.
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff served her RFPs, FROGS, SROGS, and RFAs on Defendant
on May 6, 2024, and that “Defendant has not served any responses or documents
as of July 12, 2024.” (Motion RFPs Declaration of Ahmed Yousef filed July 12,
2024, ¶¶ 5-6.)
Defendant did
not file an opposition. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs and orders Defendant to serve Plaintiff
with code compliant responses without objection on or before October 25, 2024.
B.            
Plaintiff’s Motion FROGS is Granted.
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff served her RFPs, FROGS, SROGS, and RFAs on Defendant
on May 6, 2024, and that “Defendant has not served any responses or documents
as of July 12, 2024.” (Motion FROGS Declaration of Ahmed Yousef filed July 12,
2024, ¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Defendant states “[i]t is factual that FCA US was belated in
serving its responses but contends that Plaintiff has suffered no prejudice.
The oversight was due to FCA US counsel’s mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect and FCA US is entitled to relief.” (Opposition to Motion FROGS, pg. 2.)
  
While the
Court acknowledges Defendant provided responses after Plaintiff’s Motion FROGS,
the Court will analyze the Motion FROGS as of the date of its filing on July 12,
2024. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion FROGS and orders Defendant to serve
Plaintiff with code compliant responses without objection on or before October
25, 2024.
C.            
Plaintiff’s Motion SROGS is Granted.
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff served her RFPs, FROGS, SROGS, and RFAs on Defendant
on May 6, 2023, and that “Defendant has not served any responses or documents
as of July 12, 2024.” (Motion SROGS Declaration of Ahmed Yousef filed July 12,
2024, ¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Defendant states “[i]t is factual that FCA US was belated in
serving its responses but contends that Plaintiff has suffered no prejudice.
The oversight was due to FCA US counsel’s mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect and FCA US is entitled to relief.” (Opposition to Motion SROGS, pg. 2.)
  
While the
Court acknowledges Defendant provided responses after Plaintiff’s Motion SROGS,
the Court will analyze the Motion SROGS as of the date of its filing on July
12, 2024. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion SROGS and orders Defendant to serve
Plaintiff with code compliant responses without objection on or before October
25, 2024.
D.           
Plaintiff’s Motion RFAs is Granted.
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff served her RFPs, FROGS, SROGS, and RFAs on Defendant
on May 6, 2023, and that “Defendant has not served any responses or documents
as of July 12, 2024.” (Motion RFAs Declaration of Ahmed Yousef filed July 12,
2024, ¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Defendant states “[i]t is factual that FCA US was belated in
serving its responses but contends that Plaintiff has suffered no prejudice.
The oversight was due to FCA US counsel’s mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect and FCA US is entitled to relief.” (Opposition to Motion RFAs, pg. 2.) 
Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280(b) & (c) provide that where a responding party has failed
to serve a timely response, the Court “shall” order “the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted” “unless it finds [the responding party] has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” Here, other than Defendant’s
conclusory, boilerplate argument quoted above, Defendant has not provided any
evidence from which this Court might conclude its purported untimely responses
are in substantial compliance with section 2033.220. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion RFAs and deems admitted the truth of the
matters specified in her RFAs. 
V.            
SANCTIONS 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel¿. . .” responses to interrogatories or production demands,
absent substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(c).)
The court shall also impose a “monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).) Similarly,¿“[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery
process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d),
(g).) 
For her
Motion RFPs, Motion FROGS, and Motion SROGS, Plaintiff seeks “an order
directing Defendant to pay Plaintiff $500 for each day following the 10-day
compliance period that Defendant does not fully comply with the Court's order.”
(E.g., Motion RFPs, pg. 8.) Plaintiff does not further specify (either
in any other motion, declaration, or in her Replies) what sanctions she would
like awarded or the legal authority for the accrual of sanctions in the manner
she has requested.
The Court
will not order Defendant to prospectively pay sanctions after it issues the
orders contained in this ruling, especially when it appears, if Defendant’s
Oppositions are to be believed – notwithstanding Defendant’s failure to provide
the Court with proof in the form of a supporting declaration and relevant
exhibits – Defendant has served responses (albeit late responses). Without any
other sanctions request, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions. 
VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motions
to Compel Defendant’s Responses to her RFPs, her FROGS, and her SROGS.
The Court also GRANTS Plaintiff’s
Motion for an
Order Deeming the Truth of the Matters Admitted in her RFAs.
Defendant is
ordered to serve Plaintiff with code compliant responses without objections on
or before October 25, 2024.  
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      October 2, 2024
