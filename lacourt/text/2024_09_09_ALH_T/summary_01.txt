And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to release juror information, which was filed after the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants are seeking to contact the jurors to determine whether they considered irrelevant evidence during deliberations, but the judge has found that there is no good cause to support this request. The judge notes that six of the twelve jurors have objected to the disclosure of their contact information, and that the defendants have not established a sufficient showing to support a reasonable belief that jury misconduct occurred. The judge has also determined that the jury's deliberations concerning past and future medical treatment were proper, as this was a recoverable damage. As a result, the judge has denied the defendants' motion to release juror information.
