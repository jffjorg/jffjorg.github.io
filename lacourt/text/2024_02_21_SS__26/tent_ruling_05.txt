ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Andrea
Howard (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract against
Defendant Veros Credit, LLC (“Defendant”) on October 4, 2023. Defendant filed
an answer on November 9, 2023. On January 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Notice of the
motion to compel further must be given “within 45 days of service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later
date to which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in
writing,” otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Following service of Plaintiff’s
discovery responses on December 1, 2023, Defendant timely filed the instant
Motion on January 12, 2024. (Motion, Naples Decl., ¶3 and Exh. 2.) 
 
Also, the Motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b)(2).) The supporting declaration demonstrates an effort by defense
counsel to obtain further responses from Plaintff after service of the original
responses. (Motion, Naples Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 3.) The meet and confer
requirement, therefore, is satisfied. 
 
Finally, Cal. Rules
of Court Rule 3.1345 requires all motions or responses involving further
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b)(2).) The
Motion is accompanied by a separate statement. (Separate Statement, filed 01/12/24.)

 
Defendant moves to compel further
responses pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which states in
relevant part: 
 
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
 
(1)
An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) Defendant moves to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories, Nos. 1-9, which ask Plaintiff to provide information about the
vehicles they have purchased, and damages incurred by Plaintiff. (Separate
Statement, pp. 3-4.) Plaintiff’s responses are not verified and do not answer
the interrogatories, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210,
subdivision (a). Nor do they exercise an option to produce documents or make
objections, which are also permitted responses under the statute. Instead, the
responses confusingly state that Plaintiff accepts an unknown offer to produce
communications between the parties. The Motion,
therefore, demonstrates that Plaintiff’s responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, are incomplete. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant
is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff’s further responses. Sanctions are
appropriate and have been properly noticed. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (d).) However, the amount sought is excessive. Under a lodestar
calculation, Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is granted in the
amount of $700.00 based on two hours of attorney time billed at $320.00, plus $60.00
in costs. (Motion, Naples Decl., ¶7.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Veros Credit, LLC’s Motion for Order Compelling
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanction
is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ANDREA HOWARD IS TO SERVE FURTHER VERIFIED RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
PLAINTIFF IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $700.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
