And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The judge has allowed the plaintiff to substitute ENVITAE, an unincorporated association, as the real party in interest and to dismiss Defendant Adriana Oh. However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request to add a cause of action for promissory fraud, as the plaintiff failed to explain why this cause of action should be permitted. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request to add new facts regarding the fraud cause of action, which was previously denied. The plaintiff must file and serve the third amended complaint within 10 days of this order.
