ANALYSIS: 
 

On November 6, 2023, Plaintiff Brandy
Wilson (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendant
Katherine Huber (“Defendant”). Proof of substitute service was filed on
December 5, 2023. The instant Motion to Quash was filed by Defendant on
December 27, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January 30, 2024 and
Defendant replied on February 2, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff did not properly
sub-serve her as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20. Defendant
contends that service was not made with reasonable diligence to a co-occupant
of her dwelling house or usual place of abode, despite so falsely stating in
the proof of service. 
 
Where service is challenged, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective
service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However,
a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
The proof of substitute service,
attested by a registered process server, states that Defendant was sub-served
by leaving the Summons and Complaint with “Tracy Keyser, tenant,” a
competent member of the household at the dwelling house or usual place of abode
of Defendant. (Motion, Hawkins Decl., Exh. 2, ¶5.) The household is stated to
be located at 8718 St. Ive Drive, Los Angeles, California. (Id. at Exh.
2, ¶4.) The proof of service is admittedly incorrect in its representation of
8718 St. Ive Drive as Defendant’s dwelling house or usual place of abode. Rather,
service was attempted at Defendant’s usual mailing address under Code of Civil
Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (b), which provides: 
 
If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to
the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or
416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and
complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual
place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United
States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a
competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his
or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address
. . . .
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) Defendant does not
deny that 8718 St. Ive Drive is her usual mailing address. Rather, she denies
that 8718 St. Ive Drive is her dwelling house or usual place of abode. (Motion,
Huber Decl., ¶¶6-8.) That the papers were served to this address, therefore,
does not render service defective.
 
Next, Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not make a
reasonably diligent attempt to personally serve the papers because the only
attempts were made at 8718 St. Ive Drive, which was not Defendant’s dwelling
home or usual place of abode. In opposition, Plaintiff points to Hearn v.
Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, in which attempts at personal service
at a private post office box rental store, listed as the defendant’s business
address, constituted reasonable diligence. (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202-1203.) Defendant argues that Howard is
distinguishable because that defendant held the service address out as their
business address, whereas Defendant did not hold 8718 St. Ive Drive out as her
business address. The Court finds that this is an irrelevant difference.
Defendant does not dispute that 8718 St. Ive Drive is her usual mailing
address; she merely argues that there is no evidence it is. The defendant in Howard
was no more likely to be found at the post office box rental store than
Defendant would be expected to be found at 8718 St. Ive Drive. Both locations
were where the defendants picked up their mail; the Howard court did not
find post office box rental store was a location where the defendant spent a
significant amount of time in order to deem it a proper place to attempt
personal service. (Id. at 1202.) 
 
Finally, Defendant’s motion itself points out that
“[s]tatutes governing substitute service shall be ‘liberally construed to
effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been received
by the defendant.... [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Hearn v. Howard (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1201 [citing Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 540, 544].) Defendant does not deny receipt of actual notice of the
action. Like the question of Defendant’s usual mailing address, the Motion
dances around the answer without providing an express denial. Indeed, the
Motion is not supported by a declaration from Defendant herself. The
declaration of Defendant’s mother, Melony Huber, who owns 8718 St. Ive Drive,
simply states that she does not know the address of Defendant’s current
dwelling house or usual place of abode. (Motion, Huber Decl., ¶9.) Yet
Defendant was able to timely file the instant Motion to Quash, demonstrating
actual notice of the action.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff
effectuated service in accordance with the statutory requirements. The Court
does note that the proof of substitute service incorrectly sets forth the
manner of service. Plaintiff is ordered to file an amended proof of service
reflecting that service was effectuated at Defendant’s usual mailing address
under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision
(b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Specially Appearing Defendant
Catherine Huber’s Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is DENIED.
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AN AMENDED PROOF OF SERVICE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS
ORDER. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE A RESPONSIVE PLEADING TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
