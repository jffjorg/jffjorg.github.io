ANALYSIS:
 
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Royal
Personal Training (“Defendant”). (Motion, Hurt Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant has not served responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Id. at ¶¶2-4 and Exh. B-C.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions, on January 26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling them to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for an
unopposed motion to compel initial responses. Pursuant to a lodestar
calculation, sanctions are awarded against Defendant and counsel of record in
the amount of $250.00 based on half-an-hour of attorney time billed at $500.00
per hour. (Motion, Hurt Decl.,
¶7.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ROYAL PERSONAL TRAINING IS
TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AND COUNSEL OF
RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED
TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $250.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF
THIS ORDER.
