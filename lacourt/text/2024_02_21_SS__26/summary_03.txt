And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Respondent Silverlake Autobody & Paint's Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED. The preliminary injunction was issued on March 21, 2023, and was intended to prevent Respondent from selling, auctioning, leasing, or assigning possession of the vehicle. However, Respondent has presented evidence that Wells Fargo is attempting to repossess the vehicle due to Petitioner's default on the loan, and that Respondent is legally obligated to return the vehicle to Wells Fargo. The judge finds that this change in circumstances "voids the underlying reasoning of the preliminary injunction and justice can only be served if the injunction is dissolved." The judge also notes that Petitioner failed to provide any evidence or argument showing that the claims made by Respondent are untrue or that there are insufficient grounds to grant the motion.
