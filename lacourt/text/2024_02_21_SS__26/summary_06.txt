And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by defendant Catherine Huber. The court finds that the plaintiff, Brandy Wilson, effectuated service in accordance with the statutory requirements. The court rejects the defendant's contention that service was not properly made because the proof of substitute service incorrectly states that service was made at the defendant's dwelling house or usual place of abode. The court notes that the defendant does not dispute that 8718 St. Ive Drive is her usual mailing address, which is where service was actually made. The court also rejects the defendant's contention that the plaintiff did not make a reasonably diligent attempt to personally serve the papers, citing a previous case that held that attempts at personal service at a private post office box rental store, listed as the defendant's business address, constituted reasonable diligence. Finally, the court notes that the defendant was able to timely file the instant motion to quash, demonstrating actual notice of the action. The court orders the plaintiff to file an amended proof of service within ten days of this order, and the defendant to file a responsive pleading to the complaint within 20 days of this order.
