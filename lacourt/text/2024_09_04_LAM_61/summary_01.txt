And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Michal Ofek's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $12,240.00. Ofek is seeking fees for 27.2 hours of attorney work, charged at a rate of $700 per hour, for the prosecution of her anti-SLAPP motion. The court has determined that Ofek may seek fees reasonably incurred during this time, but has reduced the award due to the unsupported hourly rate of Ofek's counsel, Albert Hughes. The court has also rejected Plaintiff's argument that Ofek retained counsel solely to drive up fees. The motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $12,240.00.
