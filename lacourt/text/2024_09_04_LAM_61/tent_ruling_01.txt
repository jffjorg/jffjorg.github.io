  Case Number:  23STCV14890    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  61 STEWART LUCAS MURREY vs KELLY GIBBONS, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant Michal Ofek’s Motion for Attorney Fees against Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey is GRANTED in the amount of $12,240.00.Defendant to provide notice.DISCUSSIONDefendant Michal Ofek (Ofek) seeks $19,040.00 in attorney fees based on her successful anti-SLAPP motion striking the claims alleged against her in Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey’s (Plaintiff) First Amended Complaint (FAC). (Motion at p. 1.)Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16, subd. (c)(1) states that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney's fees and costs.” “The party prevailing on a special motion to strike may seek an attorney fee award through three different avenues: simultaneously with litigating the special motion to strike; by a subsequent noticed motion, . . . or as part of a cost memorandum.” (Carpenter v. Jack In The Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461.)“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) In exercising its discretion, the court should consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment. (See id.)In determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar method. The lodestar figure is calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the reasonable hourly rate. “Fundamental to its determination . . . [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . . in the presentation of the case.” (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano III).) A reasonable hourly rate must reflect the skill and experience of the attorney. (Id. at p. 49.) “Prevailing parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues. A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 (Serrano IV).) The Court in Serrano IV also stated that fees associated with preparing the motion to recover attorneys’ fees are recoverable. (See id. at p. 624.)Ofek seeks fees for 27.2 hours of attorney work, charged at a rate of $700 per hour, supported by a declaration of counsel and accompanying time entries. (Hughes Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A.) These fees are associated with the prosecution of Ofek’s anti-SLAPP motion, which was filed in pro per on February 6, 2024. The fees incurred date from April 11, 2024, and Ofek’s counsel bills for work performed in preparing Ofek’s reply to Plaintiff’s opposition, as well as the present motion for attorney fees. ((Hughes Decl. Exh. A.)Plaintiff in opposition notes that Ofek only retained her counsel after this court granted the largely identical anti-SLAPP motion of Defendant Vanessa Valdes on April 8, 2024, and therefore argues that Ofek retained this attorney solely to drive up fees that could then be sought by this motion. (Opposition at pp. 1–2.) Plaintiff argues that the $700 hourly rate of Ofek’s counsel, Albert Hughes, is excessive, given that Hughes was only admitted to the bar in 2021. (Opposition at p. 3.) Plaintiff also argues that Ofek has failed to attach a retainer agreement. (Opposition at p. 2.)Ofek may obtain some of the fees sought here. Although she retained counsel only after this court’s ruling on Valdes’ motion, the motions did not involve identical issues, but rather Plaintiff’s unique (and deficient) factual showings as to both defendants, which Plaintiff made in separate oppositions to each motion. Ofek’s retention of counsel after the Valdes ruling was thus reasonable, and she may seek fees reasonably incurred during this time.Nor is there any need for Defendant to present the retainer agreement to prove that the fees were actually incurred. Prevailing defendants on an anti-SLAPP motion are limited to their “reasonable” fees and costs, and are not constrained to seek fees that they “actually incurred or paid.” (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1058.)Plaintiff is correct, however, that Hughes’ hourly rate is unsupported. Although Hughes charges a rate of $700 per hour, he offers no support for this rate save his opinion that the rate is reasonable in light of the rates charged by attorneys of similar experience and skill for the same subject matter. (Hughes Decl. ¶ 6.) Hughes has been practicing only since 2021, and in reply identifies only one other successful anti-SLAPP defense that he has conducted. (Supp. Hughes Decl. ¶ 4.) A more reasonable rate for the work charged by Hughes is $450 per hour, which would yield a reduction of the lodestar from $19,040.00 to $12,240.00, roughly a 36% reduction.The motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the amount of $12,240.00.
