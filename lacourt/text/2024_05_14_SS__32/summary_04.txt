```

And here is the summary text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs for failure to comply with discovery orders. The court notes that the plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery requests and did not appear at hearings. However, the court cannot determine that the plaintiffs' failure to comply was willful because the defendants did not provide proof that notice of the orders were served on the plaintiffs. The court also notes that the plaintiffs' counsel filed motions to be relieved on April 19, 2024, based on a breakdown in communication. As a result, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
