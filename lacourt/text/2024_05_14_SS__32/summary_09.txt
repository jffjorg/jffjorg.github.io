In English, the judge's tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice due to several deficiencies in the petition. The court requires the petitioner to provide additional information and attachments, including attachment 11b(6), the amount already paid to medical providers, and proof of payment for medical expenses. The court also finds the requested attorney fees of $6,250 to be reasonable.
