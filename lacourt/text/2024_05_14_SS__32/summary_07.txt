And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The Court finds that the motion is untimely and lacks sufficient evidence of excusable neglect. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that he has a meritorious case and that his counsel demonstrated diligence in seeking to set aside the dismissal once discovered. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's declaration does not attest that there was a mistake or neglect, and that the Covid-19 pandemic is not a valid excuse for the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery.
