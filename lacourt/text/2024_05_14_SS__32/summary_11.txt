And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to discovery, as well as the request for monetary sanctions. The motion was deemed procedurally defective due to the lack of an Informal Discovery Conference and the failure to provide a separate statement. The judge also declined to prohibit the withdrawal of the motion. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached.
