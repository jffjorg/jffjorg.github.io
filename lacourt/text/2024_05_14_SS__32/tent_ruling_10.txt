MOTION

ANALYSIS 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),
a court “may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” In addition, a court must vacate a default or dismissal
when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed timely and
accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect “unless the court finds that the
default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   “Section 473(b) provides for both discretionary and mandatory
relief.”  (Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298,
302.)
 
To obtain
relief under CCP §473 based on attorney misconduct, a party “[g]enerally . . . must plead
that the neglect or omission of his [or her] attorney was excusable, because
inexcusable neglect is ordinarily imputed to the client, and his [or her]
redress is an action for malpractice.”  (Aldrich v. San Fernando Valley
Lumber Co. (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d. 725, 738; see Zamora v. Clayborn
Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal. 4th 249, 258, “’[a] party who seeks relief
under section 473 on the basis of mistake or inadvertence of counsel must
demonstrate that such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was excusable
because the negligence of the attorney is imputed to his [or her] client and
may not be offered by the latter as a basis for relief’”; Carroll v. Abbott
Laboratories, Inc. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 892, 898 (“[t]he client’s redress for
inexcusable neglect by counsel is, of course, an action for
malpractice”).)  
Plaintiff moves for relief under CCP section 473(b),
arguing the failure to appear at the hearing on the Petition for Relief from
the Claims Statute was due to the mistake, inadvertence and/or excusable
neglect of Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff’s counsel’s office inadvertently
failed to calendar both the date for the FSC, and the date set for the trial.
Consequently, Plaintiff inadvertently failed to appear for the FSC. At the FSC,
the Court vacated the trial date and set a hearing date on Plaintiff’s Petition
for Relief from Claims Statute for March 6, 2024. Unfortunately, the minute
order providing notice to Plaintiff of the March 6, 2024 hearing date was
mailed Plaintiff’s counsel’s former address, leading to the inadvertent absence
of Plaintiff at the March 6, 2024 hearing on Plaintiff’s Petition for Relief
from Claims Statute.
The Court finds that Plaintiff is not entitled to
relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b).  First, the mandatory provision applies only to
defaults, default judgments, and dismissals. (Spine Care and Orthopedic
Physicians (2020) 44 Cal. App. 5th 167.) As such, the mandatory provision
is not available.
Next, the
Court notes that relief under Section 473 is properly denied where “an
opposition was, though apparently timely and procedurally adequate, inadequate
in substance.”  (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674,
683.)  Similarly, here a pleading on the merits was filed, however, it was
inadequate and the petition was denied as a result. Where a “case [is] not a
default but rather a motion lost on its merits, after an opposition was filed
[then]” the relief in “Section 473 was not meant to apply to [those]
facts.”  (Id.) (See also Zamora
v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258, “’[c]onduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as
failure to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not . . .
excusable,’” and ‘”[t]o hold otherwise would be to . . . effectively eviscerate
the concept of attorney malpractice’”.)  “Section 473 cannot be used to
remedy attorney mistakes, such as failure to provide sufficient evidence in
opposition to a summary judgment motion.  There is nothing in Section 473
to suggest it was intended to be a catch-all remedy for every case of poor
judgment on the part of counsel which results in dismissal.”  (Wiz
Technology Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand LLP (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 1,
17.  See also Cochran v. Linn (1984) 159 Cal. App. 3d 245, 251
(negligence in failing to plead the case properly, or to produce sufficient
evidence to oppose a summary judgment, does not warrant relief under section
473).) As such, CCP section 473 does not afford Plaintiff relief as a pleading
on the merits was filed, but it was inadequate, and section 473 cannot be used
to remedy attorney mistakes such as this one. Relief under Section
473(b) does not provide “an escape hatch for any and all tactical errors and
mistaken judgments.”  (Gotschall v. Daley (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th
479, 484.) 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s Motion for
Relief under CCP section 473(b) from Order Denying Petition for Relief from
Claims Statute.
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this Order and file
proof of service of such.
