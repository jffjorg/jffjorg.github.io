And here is a English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in maintaining a sidewalk and that the plaintiff tripped and fell on an uneven and/or raised and/or broken and/or deteriorating area of the sidewalk. The defendant argues that the complaint does not state a cause of action because the plaintiff was walking on a sidewalk "near" the defendant's property, but not on the defendant's property. The court finds that the complaint does allege that the defendant owned and controlled the area where the plaintiff fell, and therefore the plaintiff has sufficiently stated a cause of action. The court overrules the demurrer and allows the complaint to proceed.
