Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal 




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Angel Avetisyan




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 7, 2022, Plaintiff Angel Avetisyan (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants 99 Cents Only Stores LLC (“Defendant”), and Does 1
to 60, for injuries related to a slip and fall.
 
Plaintiff failed to timely respond to discovery by Defendant and a
motion to compel discovery against Plaintiff was granted on January 24, 2023. Plaintiff
was ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, to discovery
within 30 days of the Court’s orders. (Min. Order, 1/24/23, 1/25/23.) On April
7, 2023, after Plaintiff failed to serve responses, the Court granted a motion
for terminating sanctions and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. (Min.
Order, 4/7/23.) Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion.  
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the
dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). At the February
1, 2024 hearing, Plaintiff did not appear and the motion was placed off
calendar. 
 
On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion, seeking relief
from the April 7, 2023 dismissal under section 473(b). No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
“After six months from default, a
trial court may still vacate a default on equitable ground even if statutory
relief is unavailable.”¿ (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975,
981.)¿ A party may obtain equitable relief from
an entry of dismissal based on an extrinsic mistake when the moving party: (1)
has a meritorious case, (2) articulates a satisfactory excuse for not
presenting a defense to the original action, and (3) demonstrates diligence in
seeking to set aside the dismissal once discovered.¿ (Id. at p. 982.)¿¿ 
¿ 
An extrinsic
mistake is broadly defined “. . . to encompass almost any set of extrinsic
circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing. It does not
seem to matter if the particular circumstances qualify as fraudulent or
mistaken in the strict sense.”¿(In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d
337, 342.) An ‘extrinsic’ mistake means a mistake that deprived a party of the
opportunity to present a claim or defense while an ‘intrinsic’ mistake is one
that goes to the merits of a proceeding.¿ (In re Marriage of Stevenot
(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1064-1065.)¿¿ 
¿ 
A default cannot
be set aside when the complaining party’s negligence contributed to the rise to
the fraud or mistake.¿(See Kulchar v. Kulchar (1969) 1 Cal.3d 467,
473-474 [complaining party’s failure to investigate and assemble evidence at
trial as grounds for denying equitable relief sought].)¿An extrinsic mistake
may result from a disability when the disability renders the party incompetent or
incapacitated such that it deprives the party from asserting a claim or
defense. (See id. at pp. 471-472.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is not timely because it was filed beyond six months after
the case was dismissed. (See Jimenez v. Chavez (2023) 97
Cal.App.5th 50, 58 [the six-month limitations periods of the mandatory and the
discretionary relief provisions of section 473(b) mean the longer of six
calendar months or 182 days].) Here, 182 days from the dismissal on April 7,
2023, was October 6, 2023. The instant motion was filed March 14, 2024.
 
            In the
alternative, Plaintiff appears to seek equitable relief. (Motion, 4.)  
 
The Declaration of Henrik
Sardarbegian states: “I am of the understanding that as the attorney of record,
the errors and mistakes of my staff are ultimately my responsibility. I believe
that Defense has incurred costs and I am willing to pay for those costs in
order to not prejudice Defense in any way due to my errors and mistakes. I
understand that the Covid-19 Pandemic has affected everyone and not just me or
my office.” (Sardarbegian Decl. ¶¶ 4–6.) 
 
 
            Here, the declaration of counsel does
not attest that there was a mistake or neglect. At most, the declaration
asserts that the Covid-19 pandemic “affected everyone” and that counsel is
responsible for mistakes by staff. However, there is no declaration that the
pandemic affected this case, or that staff made mistakes relating to this case.[1] Further,
Plaintiff has not shown he is entitled to equitable relief. Plaintiff does not
show he has a meritorious case and that counsel demonstrated diligence once the
dismissal was discovered. Even though Plaintiff argues the underlying dismissal
motion was sent to his spam folder, he contends he discovered it weeks after
the hearing. (Motion, 5–6.) Plaintiff does not explain why this motion was not brought
earlier. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies the motion to set aside dismissal.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
