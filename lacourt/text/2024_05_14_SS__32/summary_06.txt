And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Sheryl Tan on behalf of Claimant Imogen Tan-Ching, who was exposed to asbestos. The court denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. Firstly, Petitioner's declaration under penalty of perjury confirms that Claimant attended an appointment with Dr. Miriam Chan, where it was advised that no tests or treatment could be completed for the asbestos exposure. Secondly, Petitioner declares that Claimant has had no symptoms of medical conditions attributed to asbestos exposure. The court finds this sufficient evidence of Claimant's current condition.

Additionally, the court notes that Petitioner did not complete item 12b(2)(f), indicating if private insurance is seeking reimbursement, which conflicts with the value in 12b(5)(a)(ii) indicating a lien owed to a medical provider. The court orders Petitioner to address this issue in a future petition.

The court grants Petitioner's request for $1,250 in attorney fees, representing 25% of the gross settlement. The court denies the petition without prejudice and orders Petitioner to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
