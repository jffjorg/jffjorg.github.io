And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied Plaintiff's motion for relief under CCP section 473(b) from the order denying Plaintiff's petition for relief from the Claims Statute. The judge found that Plaintiff was not entitled to relief because the mandatory provision of CCP section 473(b) only applies to defaults, default judgments, and dismissals, and Plaintiff's case was not a default. The judge also found that the relief under Section 473 was not meant to remedy attorney mistakes, such as failure to provide sufficient evidence in opposition to a summary judgment motion. The judge concluded that Plaintiff was not entitled to relief under CCP section 473(b) because a pleading on the merits was filed, but it was inadequate, and section 473 cannot be used to remedy attorney mistakes like this one.
