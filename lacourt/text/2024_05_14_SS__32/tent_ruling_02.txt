Amini      BACKGROUND   On March 25, 2021, Plaintiff  Pantea E. Amini (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Fernando  Gutierrez Jr., Fernando E. Gutierrez, and Does 1 to 100 for negligence  surrounding a motor vehicle accident.    On September 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of the  complaint, summons, and statement of damages on Defendant Fernando Gutierrez  Jr. (“Defendant”) showing he was personally served on August 3, 2021.    On October 18, 2021, default was entered against Defendant.   On November 16, 2022, the Court granted default judgment against  Defendant for $586,161.10 in damages and $574.10 in costs.    Defendant now moves to set aside the default and default judgment  under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 473.5, arguing he was not  properly served the summons and complaint.[1] Plaintiff  opposes and Defendant replies.    LEGAL  STANDARD   “Generally, a party who has not actually been served with  summons has three avenues of relief from a default judgment.” (Trackman v.  Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180.) First, they may move under Code of  Civil Procedure sections 473.5 (applied where service was proper but did not  result in actual notice) or section 473(d) (judgment is valid on its face but  void due to improper service). (Id.) Second, the party may seek  equitable relief showing “that extrinsic fraud or mistake exists, such as a  falsified proof of service, and such a motion may be made at any time, provided  the party acts with diligence upon learning of the relevant facts.” (Id.  at 181.) These first two methods “generally hinge on evidence about the method  of purported service.” (Id.) Lastly, the party may move under section  473(d) that the default judgment is facially void. (Id.)   Turning to the first method, Code of Civil Procedure  section 473(d) states “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, or  its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered,  so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of  either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or  order.”    A motion to vacate a default and set aside a judgment under  section 473(d) is the proper procedure to attack a default supported by  evidence of service of process, but which is challenged for lack of personal  jurisdiction. (Strathvale Holdings v. E.B.H.¿(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1241,  1249.) “[U]nder section 473, subdivision (d), the court may ‘set aside a  default judgment which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due  to improper service.’ [Citation.]” (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71  Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)    “Where a party  moves under section 473, subdivision (d) to set aside ‘a judgment that, though  valid on its face, is void for lack of proper service, the courts have adopted  by analogy the statutory period for relief from a default judgment’ provided by  section 473.5, that is, the two-year outer limit.” (Trackman v. Kenney  (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180.)    “ ‘When a  defendant challenges the court's personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the  initial burden of “demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of  jurisdiction.’ [citation.] When there is conflicting evidence, the trial  court's factual determinations are not disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial  evidence. [citation.]’” (Strathvale Holdings, supra, 126  Cal.App.4th at 1250.) “[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service  of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]”¿(Dill  v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of  a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was  proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such  proofs.”¿(Id. at 1441-42.)    Even when the  showing under section 473 is not strong, when there is doubt about setting  aside a default, such doubt should be resolved in favor of relief. (Rosenthal  v. Garner (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 891, 898.)   EVIDENTIARY  OBJECTIONS   The Court overrules Plaintiff’s objection to Defendant’s declaration,  paragraph 4 and exhibits I to J.    DISCUSSION   As an initial matter, here, the  proof of service of the summons and complaint on Defendant shows he was served  personally on August 3, 2021 at 8355 De Garmo Avenue, Sun Valley, California. (Proof  of Service, filed 9/28/21.) Therefore, there is no indication that the default  is facially void. Also, Defendant does not appear to move for equitable relief.  Instead, the main vehicle for this motion is section 473(d), arguing the  default is void for improper service. Two years after the default judgment was  granted is November 16, 2024. (See Trackman, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at 180.) Since  this motion was filed on March 14, 2024, it is timely. Though Plaintiff argues Defendant did not  act diligently in bringing this motion, the cases she relies upon either  discuss equitable relief or section 473(b) which specifically states the motion  must be made “within a reasonable time.” (See Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b); Stafford  v. Mach (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1174.) Plaintiff fails to show a similar  requirement under section 473(d).    Defendant sets forth the following  evidence in support of this motion. Defendant declares under penalty of perjury  that he was never personally served the summons and complaint in this action.  (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 2.) He declares that he moved away from 8355 De Garmo  Avenue, Sun Valley in October 2018 and has not lived there since. (Id. ¶  3.) He also states he was not present at that address on August 3, 2021 when  the purported service took place. (Id.) As further proof, Defendant  attaches copies of a Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (“LADWP”) bill  for his residence from June 30, 2021 to August 30, 2021. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh.  I.)  He also proffers Spectrum bills for  his residence from June 26, 2021 to September 25, 2021. (Id., Exh. J.) The  bills (which are partially redacted) correspond to an address on Chase Street  in Northridge. The LADWP bill is addressed to “Fernando Gutierrez” and the  Spectrum bill is addressed to “Fernando Gutirrez.”     Defendant also declares that on  September 5, 2023, he received a letter from the California Department of Motor  Vehicles (“DMV”) stating that his driver’s license was suspended due to a  lawsuit filed against him. (Id. ¶ 7.) He declares he was unaware of the  lawsuit and informed his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance  Company, of this information. He also declares: “I have never attempted to  evade service in this matter. Although I have not been properly served in this  action, I will file an answer to the complaint if the default and default  judgment entered against me are set aside in order to defend against  plaintiff’s claims.” (Id. ¶ 8.)    Defendant’s counsel declares that  he was retained by State Farm to represent Defendant in this action and  received the file for this case on February 22, 2024. (Young Decl. ¶ 4.)    In opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel  declares that he was originally retained to represent Plaintiff in an uninsured  claim against her insurer, Geico, for the underlying accident. (Mirabel Decl. ¶  2.) Geico later informed Plaintiff that it identified Defendant as the hit and  run driver and that he was insured by State Farm Insurance. Once State Farm  denied Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff obtained co-Defendant Fernando E. Gutierrez  (purportedly Defendant’s father’s) address from the DMV. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh.  2.) Geico informed Plaintiff that Defendant’s address was the same as Fernando  E. Gutierrez’s. (Id. ¶ 7.)    Later, once default judgment was  granted, and judgment remained unsatisfied, Plaintiff successfully requested  that Defendant’s driver’s license be suspended. (Id. ¶ 12.) On September  4, 2023, Plaintiff received a notice of suspension of Defendant’s driver’s  license which contained a different address for Defendant. Plaintiff then  mailed a letter to Defendant using the Northridge address. (Id. ¶ 13,  Exh. 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel contends that none of the letters sent to the  original address were ever returned as non-deliverable.    Based on this information, the Court finds  Defendant has rebutted the presumption of proper service through his  declaration that he moved from the Sun Valley address in October 2018 and was  not present at that location when service was purportedly executed. However,  Defendant provides no evidence disputing that his father resides at the Sun  Valley address or additional evidence regarding the possibility that he was at  the location on August 3, 2021. On the other hand, Plaintiff does not provide  proof that she discovered Defendant’s address through a DMV search, but rather  relied on representations from Geico. Plaintiff provides no declaration from  Geico attesting to this, or explaining how it discovered Defendant’s address.  Therefore, in light of these gaps, and considering that Defendant informed his  insurer when he purportedly first learned of the default and lawsuit in  September 2023, and resolving all doubts in favor of relief, the motion is  granted.    CONCLUSION AND  ORDER   Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside the  Default and default judgment.    Defendant shall file and serve his proposed  answer within 10 days. Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for June 13, 2024, at 08:30 am in Department 32, Spring Street Courthouse.   Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
