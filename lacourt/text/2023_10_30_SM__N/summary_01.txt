And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint filed by J&C Global Holdings, Inc. (the plaintiff) against NMS Fin Holdings, LLC, NMS Capital Advisors, LLC, NMS Capital Group, LLC, BDMGMT Partners, LLC, and Trevor Saliba (the defendants). The defendants have requested judicial notice of certain documents related to the plaintiff's corporate status. The judge has granted this request.

The defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacks corporate capacity due to its revoked status. The plaintiff has argued that the defendants waived their claims of lack of capacity and that Nevada law applies to the case, but the judge has found that California law applies and that the plaintiff has not provided evidence of winding up its affairs.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in part, giving the plaintiff the opportunity to cure its revoked corporate status and render the corporation as existing in good standing. The plaintiff must file evidence of its good standing within 30 days of the order, or the complaint will be dismissed and the plaintiff's default will be entered.

The judge has also noted that the purpose of the statutory prohibition on prosecuting or defending an action while a corporation is suspended is to induce the payment of taxes.
