v. Weems, Case No. 24NWCV00420
 
Plaintiff
Ryan Brewer sues Defendant Julia Weems for defamation, false light, abuse of
process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendant applies ex
parte and states, “This matter should be decided on
immediately because the calendaring is unavailable until March/April of 2025.”
In her declaration, Defendant states her demurrer should be sustained without
leave to amend, and Plaintiff should be declared a vexatious litigant.  However, Defendant does not state grounds or
legal authority for either request. 
Further, Defendant has not provided notice of the ex parte
application to Plaintiff or served Plaintiff.  Accordingly, Defendant’s ex
parte application is DENIED.
