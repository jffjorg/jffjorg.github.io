And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Victor Fuentes v. H.P. Palomino, Inc., et al. The defendants' demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the lawsuit will be dismissed. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims were settled in a prior unlawful detainer action (Shah v. Fuentes) and that the settlement agreement included a Section 1542 waiver, which is enforceable and acts as a complete bar to all claims, whether known or unknown at the time of release. The plaintiff argues that he did not waive or settle the claims at issue in this lawsuit, but the judge found that the additional language in the second amended complaint was insufficient to state a cause of action. The judge granted judicial notice of the settlement agreement and Section 1542 waiver, and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
