TENTATIVE RULING 
 
 
 
Defendant The Salvation Army
moves for a court order compelling Plaintiff to appear for further deposition
to answer questions relating to his use of alcohol and the amount of settlement
payments he has received.  Because
the Court was unable to access documents in its case management system between
July 19 and July 23, the Court, on its own motion, continues the hearing on the
motion to Wednesday, September 18, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
