TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc. and Rafiq Shah’s demurrer is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Background
 
Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc., and Rafiq Shah demur to the
Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. 
 
On December 6, 2022, Plaintiff Victor Fuentes brought the
instant lawsuit for wage-an-hour violations against his former employers, Defendants
H.P. Palomino, Inc., and Rafiq Shah. 
Plaintiff alleges he was employed by Defendants as a maintenance manager
from 1999 until September 2021.   
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request judicial notice of the following: 
 
(1) settlement agreement in the prior action; and  
(2) Articles of Incorporation of H.P. Palomino, Inc. 
 
Courts properly take judicial notice of facts in legal, operative
documents, where the complainant alleges no facts inferring a contrary
conclusion, or where the existence and effect is not the subject of a
reasonable dispute.  (Intengan v. Bac
Home Loans Servicing LP (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1054.)  Thus, the Court grants judicial notice of the
first request.  
 
The Court will not adjudicate the second request because it is not
relevant to this matter. (Mangini v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1057, 1063.)
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are
apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court
may take judicial notice.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is
to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law. . .”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).)  
 
The burden is on the complainant to show the court that a pleading can
be amended successfully, to obtain an order allowing leave to amend.  (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.  (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78.) “Leave to
amend should be denied where
the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no
liability exists under substantive law.” (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claims were settled in
the unlawful detainer action entitled Shah v. Fuentes, Case No. 22NWUD01483.  Defendants rely upon the Unlawful Detainer
Stipulated Judgment entered on September 13, 2022. (Orloff Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.) Page Two of the
Stipulated Judgment contains the following handwritten language:
 
“Concurrent with the execution of this
settlement agreement, Plaintiff [Rafiq Shah] shall pay to Defendants [Victor
Fuentes and Guillermina Figueroa], jointly, the sum of $2500.00.  The said sum is intended to be relocation
expenses and in exchange for a waiver of all claims known and unknown.  Defendants waive protections under Civil Code
section 1542, which provides that ‘A general release does not extend to claims
that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his
or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or
her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
released party.’  Additionally,
Defendants release any claims for habitability of the leased premises.” 
 
The Stipulated Judgment was entered 84 days before Fuentes
filed this lawsuit.  
 
A general release that explicitly covers known and unknown
claims and specifically waives the provisions of Civil Code Section 1542 is
enforceable and acts as a complete bar to all claims, whether known or unknown
at the time of release. (San Diego Hospice v. Cnty. of San Diego (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 1048, 1053-1054.) 
 
In Opposition, Fuentes argues that he did not waive or
settle the claims at issue in this lawsuit. 
Fuentes points to language in the SAC which alleges that Shah’s attorney
specifically told Fuentes that the eviction settlement only applied to matters
involving the eviction and no other matters. (SAC ¶ 34).  The SAC further
alleges that Fuentes did not review the revised version of the settlement
agreement and Fuentes believes the Section 1542 waiver was added without his
knowledge. (SAC ¶ 35.)  
 
This language was added after the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint on September 5, 2023.  In its ruling, the Court noted that the FAC
lacked any allegation that Fuentes did not review the written portion of the
agreement.  Fuentes attempts to remedy
this deficiency in the SAC.  However,
after further review, the Court determines that the additional language in the
SAC is still insufficient to state a cause of action.  That is because the Section 1542 waiver is
enforceable as part of the judgment entered by the unlawful detainer
court.  Page Three of the Stipulated
Judgment was signed by Commissioner Bruguera and the Court entered the
following order: “The Court hereby orders the above-named parties to comply
with the terms of the stipulation, and the clerk is directed to enter this
stipulation as judgment.” (Orloff Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.) Thus, absent a court order vacating that portion of
the judgment, the Section 1542 waiver is dispositive of this lawsuit.  
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
