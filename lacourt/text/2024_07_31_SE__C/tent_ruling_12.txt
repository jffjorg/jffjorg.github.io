TENTATIVE RULING 
 
 
 
Defendants Abel Orozco and Athala Orozco move to set aside default
judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(d).  Because
the Court was unable to access documents in its case management system between
July 19 and July 23, the Court, on its own motion, continues the hearing on the
motion to Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
