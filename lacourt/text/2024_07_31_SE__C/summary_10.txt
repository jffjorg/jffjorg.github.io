Judge [Name] has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ryan Brewer v. Julia Weems, case number 24NWCV00420. The case involves claims of defamation, false light, abuse of process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress by the defendant against the plaintiff.

However, the defendant failed to provide notice to the plaintiff or state grounds or legal authority for her requests. As a result, the judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application. The case is set for hearing on July 31, 2024, and the judge will consider the plaintiff's claims and the defendant's arguments at that time.
