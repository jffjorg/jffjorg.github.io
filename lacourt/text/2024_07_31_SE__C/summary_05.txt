Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion for summary judgment filed by Zev Brooks and the Law Offices of Zev Brooks. The motion is deemed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and it is granted with 30 days' leave to amend. The ruling is based on the lack of standing by the plaintiff, Jane Hodges, to pursue the litigation. The plaintiff sues in her capacity as trustee of her family's trust and as special administrator of her mother's estate, but the complaint is unclear about whom the defendants undertook to represent. Until this aspect of the attorney-client relationship is clarified, no determination can be made regarding standing.
