TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Defendant Zev Brooks’ and the
Law Offices of Zev Brooks’ motion for summary judgment is deemed to be a motion
for judgment on the pleadings.  The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Jane Hodges (“Plaintiff”) sues Defendants Zev Brooks and the Law
Offices of Zev Brooks for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.  She does not sue in her individual
capacity.  Instead, she sues in her
capacity as trustee of her family’s trust and as special administrator of her
mother’s estate.  
 
The Complaint alleges that in 2019, Defendants represented Plaintiff’s
mother, Rose Mary Ollison (deceased), for the purpose of drafting an amendment
to the family trust and other documents. 
The documents removed Plaintiff from all fiduciary positions and named
Plaintiff’s sister, Marian Cecilia Contreras, as the primary fiduciary.  Plaintiff alleges that all of this was
accomplished under Marian’s direction.  After
Plaintiff discovered what had happened, Plaintiff and Marian filed competing
petitions in the Orange County Superior Court regarding the validity of the
2019 documents.  The Court found the
documents were void due to Marian’s undue influence, and the Court restored
Plaintiff’s position as trustee in charge of the trust.  In this lawsuit, Plaintiff seeks damages
which include the cost of Plaintiff’s attorney fees and Marian’s attorney fees,
both of which were (or will likely be) paid out of the trust.  
 
Defendants move for summary judgment and, in the
alternative, summary adjudication on the grounds that Defendants did not owe a
duty to Plaintiff and Plaintiff lacks standing. 
Defendants also assert that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute
of limitations.

The court takes judicial notice of the existence of the
documents identified above. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) But it does not
take judicial notice of any factual findings. Factual findings in prior
judicial orders, opinions, or decisions are not a proper subject of judicial
notice. (Kilroy v. State of Calif. (2004) 119 Cal. App. 4th 140, 148.) 
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant’s motion for summary judgment ‘necessarily
includes a test of the sufficiency of the complaint.  Motions for summary judgment in such
situations have otherwise been allowed as being in legal effect motions for
judgment on the pleadings. Thus, if the reviewing court finds the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as a matter of
law, it need not reach the question whether plaintiff's opposition to the
summary judgment motion raises a triable issue of fact. (Hansra v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 630, 638.)
 
Standing 
 
In the Complaint,
Plaintiff sues in her capacity as trustee on behalf of the Ollison Family Trust
and as special administrator on behalf of the Estate of Rose Mary Ollison,
Deceased.  Defendants argue that they
only represented Rose Mary Ollison, not the trust or a trustee.  Plaintiff concedes this in her opposition
brief. (Opp., p. 7:23-24.) However, the Complaint is inconsistent in this
regard.  For example, the Complaint alleges,
“Defendant had a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as members of
the legal profession commonly possess and exercise, in providing legal
services to Plaintiffs (Complaint, ¶ 37, italics added).  The
following paragraph alleges, “Defendant represented Rose Mary Ollison (who
is now deceased) and also the Ollison Family Trust in his
preparation of and facilitating the execution of the March 2019 Documents
described above.” (Id., ¶
38, italics added.) Thus, it is unclear from the Complaint precisely whom the Defendants
undertook to represent.  Until this
aspect of the attorney client relationship is clarified, no determination can
be made regarding standing.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court determines that the Complaint does not sufficiently allege Plaintiff’s
standing to pursue this litigation.  The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED with 30 days leave to
amend.  Because lack of standing is
dispositive of the motion, the Court does not address Defendants’ statute of
limitations argument.
