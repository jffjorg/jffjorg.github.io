And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a quiet title action filed by Pacific Southwest District of Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (PSD) seeking to determine the ownership of a church property. PSD moves for leave to file the first amended complaint and for service by publication. The court grants PSD's motion for leave to file the first amended complaint, finding that PSD should be afforded the opportunity to make the proposed amendments. However, the court denies PSD's motion for service by publication without prejudice, finding that PSD's showing is not sufficient. The court also denies PSD's ex parte application to continue the hearing for its motion for summary adjudication, instead advancing the motion to December 12, 2024.
