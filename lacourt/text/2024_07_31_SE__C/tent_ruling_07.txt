TENTATIVE RULING
 
Cross-Complainant City of Huntington Park’s
motion for preliminary injunction is GRANTED. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Background
 
Cross-Complainant City
of Huntington Park (“The City”) moves for a preliminary injunction to enjoin
Cross-Defendants Jamshid Barman Saeideh Aryaee from continually violating
Huntington Park municipal code. According to the Cross-Complainant, Cross-Defendants
have not sought the required building permits and approvals to zone the
property located at 2551 Clarendon Avenue, Huntington Park, California
(“Subject Property”). The City maintains that the Subject Property should be
strictly used commercial purposes, but Cross-Defendants have used it for
commercial and residential purposes.  The
City also alleges that Cross-Defendants have violated property maintenance and
building permit requirements. 
 
The Subject Property is
in the City’s District C, and residential uses are permitted in District C at
the discretion of the City, or when conditionally permitted. (See Downtown
Huntington Park Specific Plan, § 4-6 [Allowable Land Uses By District], figure
4.58 [Land Use Table].) The City’s investigation revealed that the Subject
Property contains extensive building alterations completed without the required
building permits. (See, e.g., Zapien Decl., ¶ 20, Ex. V [September 2022
Post-Inspection Diagram].) These unpermitted alterations include the following:
(1) metal carport/cover patio located at the northwest end of the building; (2)
laundry connections under the metal cover patio of the first floor; (3) shower
in the permitted half bath on the first floor; (4) kitchen cabinets and sink in
the first floor between the two businesses; (5) partition wall to the rear of
one of the businesses on the first floor; (6) a partition wall to the rear of
the second business on the first floor next to the half bath; (7) a full bath
inside unit #1 on the second floor; (8) a shower in the half batch on the
second floor; (9) partition wall inside unit #3 on the second floor; (10)
partition wall inside unit #5 on the second floor; (11) metal bars in the east
balcony area on the second floor, and (12) the first floor tenants spaces have
been unlawfully connected by the unpermitted removal of the wall next to the
full bath area. (Zapien Decl., ¶¶ 16–20, 27(b); Bollier Decl., ¶¶ 12.)
 
Cross-Complainant
argues that these violations are a nuisance, while Cross-Defendants oppose on
the grounds of state preemption of municipal law. 
 
Requests for Judicial
Notice
 
Cross-Complainant
requests judicial notice of the following: (1) grant deed dated March 10, 2005
as instrument number 050572725; (2) quitclaim deed dated December 16, 2019 as
instrument number 202110607595; (3) Huntington Park Downtown Specific Plan,
adopted by City of Huntington Park on August 4, 2008; and (4) Huntington Park
Municipal Code sections 1-2.01, 1-2.02, 5-35.01, 5-35.02, 5-35.03, 5-35.04,
5-35.17, 5-35.17, 8-1.02, 8-1.05, 9-1.106, 9-2.2406, 9- 2.2407, 9-3.602,
9-3.603, 9-3.604, 9-3.611, 9-3.612, 9-3.613, and 9-3.614.
 
Courts properly take
judicial notice of facts in legal, operative documents, where the complainant
alleges no facts inferring a contrary conclusion, or where the existence and
effect is not the subject of a reasonable dispute.  (Intengan v. Bac Home Loans Servicing LP
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1054.)  Thus,
the Court grants judicial notice of the first three requests. 
 
Also, judicial notice
may be taken of regulations issued by any public entity in the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (b).)  Thus,
the Court grants judicial notice of the fourth request. 
 
Legal Standard
 
In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial; and (2) a balancing of the “irreparable harm”
that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied compared to
the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a
preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT
Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman (1997) 55
Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283.)
 
The Court’s
determination is guided by a “mix” of the potential-merit and interim-harm
factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less must be shown on
the other to support an injunction.  (Butt v. State of Calif. (1992) 4
Cal.4th 668, 678.)  However, a trial
court may not grant a preliminary injunction, regardless of the balance of
interim harm, unless there is some possibility that the plaintiff would
ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim. (Ibid.)  
 

Likelihood of Success
 
The underlying causes of action for the injunction relief sought
by Cross-Complainant are the nuisance and nuisance per se causes of action. 
 
The concept of a nuisance per se arises when a legislative body
with appropriate jurisdiction, in the exercise of the police power, expressly
declares a particular object or substance, activity, or circumstance, to be a
nuisance. (Beck Dev. Co. v. S. Pac. Transportation Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1160, 1206.) Generally a nuisance is defined as “[a]nything which
is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay,
stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway, ...”
(Civ. Code, § 3479.) This requires consideration and balancing of a variety of
factors. But where the law expressly declares something to be a nuisance, then
no inquiry beyond its existence need be made; thus, its mere existence is said
to be a nuisance per se. (Beck Dev. Co. v. S. Pac.
Transportation Co., supra, 44 Cal.App.4th at pg.1207.)
 
Government
Code sections 38771 and 38773.5 authorize cities to define those conditions
deemed to constitute a public nuisance. Sections 1-2.01, 5-35.04, 8-1.05(c) of
Huntington Park Municipal Code provide that any violation of the Huntington Park
Municipal Code constitutes a public nuisance. (RJN ¶ 4, Ex. D [HPMC Sections].)
Thus, the City only needs to establish that a single violation of the HPMC
exists to prove its public nuisance claim. (Gov. Code, §§ 38771, 38773.5;
Huntington Park Mun. Code, §§ 1-2.01, 5-35.04, 8-1.05(c); City of Costa Mesa
v. Soffer (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 378, 382.)
 
Cross-Complainant
alleges that Cross-Defendants have violated the following: 
 
(a) HPMC
sections 9-1.106(3) and 9-1.106(6), which prohibit any land, building,
structure or premises in the City to be used, designed, moved, altered, added
to, enlarged, or intended to be used for any purpose or in any manner other
than a lawful use as listed in the HPMC; 
(b) HPMC
section 9-2.1003, which require City approval of a Development Permit for
certain scopes of work and certain changes in use for certain types of
structures; 
(c) HPMC
section 9-3.603, which prohibits the use of property for any purposes except
those uses permitted in the applicable zoning district;
(d) HPMC
section 9-3.604, which restricts changes to nonconforming uses and structures; 
(e) HPMC
section 9-3.611, which regulates the maintenance, repair, and alteration of
nonconforming uses and structures; 
(f) HPMC
section 9-3.612, which permits an existing legal nonconforming use to be
minimally expanded or changed subject to the granting of a Minor Conditional
Use Permit and certain finding requirements; 
(g) HPMC
section 9-3.613, which automatically terminates the right to operate a
nonconformity upon occurrence of certain conditions;
(h) HPMC
section 9-3.614, which provides a process for legalization of an illegal
nonconforming structure or use; 
(i)
Huntington Park Building Code sections 1.8.4.1 and 105.1, which require that a
written construction permit shall be obtained from the City before the
erection, construction, reconstruction, installation, moving or alteration of
any building or structure; and 
(j) Other
violations, according to proof. (Cross-Compl., ¶ 33.) 
 
According
to the Cross-Complainant, the Subject Property is used for residential purposes
without required zoning approvals. (See generally Martinez Decl.; see also
generally Bollier Decl.) No development or conditional use permit has been
granted by the City for the residential use of the Subject Property, which is
required under the DTSP regulations. (Martinez Decl., ¶ 27.) The Subject
Property also contains extensive building alterations completed without the
required building permits. (See, e.g., Zapien Decl., ¶ 20, Ex. V [September
2022 Post-Inspection Diagram].) These unpermitted alterations include the
following: (1) metal carport/cover patio located at the northwest end of the
building; (2) laundry connections under the metal cover patio of the first
floor; (3) shower in the permitted half bath on the first floor; (4) kitchen
cabinets and sink in the first floor between the two businesses; (5) partition
wall to the rear of one of the businesses on the first floor; (6) a partition
wall to the rear of the second business on the first floor next to the half
bath; (7) a full bath inside unit #1 on the second floor; (8) a shower in the
half batch on the second floor; (9) partition wall inside unit #3 on the second
floor; (10) partition wall inside unit #5 on the second floor; (11) metal bars
in the east balcony area on the second floor, and (12) the first floor tenants
spaces have been unlawfully connected by the unpermitted removal of the wall
next to the full bath area. (Zapien Decl., ¶¶ 27(b); Bollier Decl., ¶¶ 12.) 
 
          Preemption
 
In
opposition, Cross-Defendants argue that the State Housing Element Law preempts
the requirement to apply for a conditional use permit. Cross-Defendants also
argue that the State of California regulates building construction and
development and thus preempts the City of Huntington Park’s ordinances. 
 
State law may occupy a field
either expressly or by implication. (Candid Enters., Inc. v. Grossmont
Union High Sch. Dist. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 878, 886.)  When the state
law contains provisions that expressly declare the legislature’s intent to
preempt local regulation, a local law will be invalidated unless it is found to
regulate a different “field” of regulation. (Ibid.) In
determining whether the legislature has impliedly occupied or preempted a field
to the exclusion of local regulation, the court must look at “the whole purpose
and scope of the legislative scheme.” (Candid Enters., Inc. v.
Grossmont Union High Sch. Dist., supra, 39 Cal.3d at pg. 886.) An intent to
occupy the field will be found in any one of the following circumstances:
 
(1)
the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by
general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of
state concern; 
(2)
the subject matter has been partially covered by general law
couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern
will not tolerate further or additional local action; or 
(3)
the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and
the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on
the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.
 
(In re
Hubbard (1964) 62 Cal.2d 119, 128.)
 
Preemption
will not be implied when the legislative scheme either permits or
recognizes local regulation (People ex rel Deukmejian v. County  of Mendicino (1990) 36 Cal.3d 476,
485); also when there is a significant local interest that may differ from one
locality to another (Fisher v. City of Berkeley (1984) 37
Cal.3d 644, 707; Gluck v County of L.A. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
121, 133); or
When there is a long
tradition of local regulation and a legislatively imposed duty to preserve and
protect the public health (People ex rel Deukmejian v. County of Mendicino,
supra, 36 Cal.3d at 484).
 
Because a
local law can be invalidated as preempted only when it regulates the same
“field” in which the legislature has evinced its intent to occupy, either
expressly or by implication, the way in which the relevant field is described
is often crucial to the result: a narrow definition of the field limits the
preemptive effect of state law, and a broad definition increases its preemptive
reach. (Candid Enters., Inc. v Grossmont Union High Sch. Dist. (1985)
39 Cal.3d 878, 886 n4; Cal. Water & Tel. Co. v County of L. A. (1967)
253 Cal.App.2d 16, 27–28.) A local law may be found to regulate a separate
field, and thus not be preempted by state law when it has a separate and
independent purpose from the allegedly preemptive state law. (Santa
Monica Pines, Ltd. v Rent Control Bd. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 858, 869. 
 
In defining a “field” for
purposes of preemption, a court or a local legislative body can apply a
patterned approach, i.e., a field should not be defined merely
by uniting a series of statutes containing a common noun such as “rent”
(see Fisher v. City of Berkeley (1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 707); rather,
an area of state legislation that is logically related and reflects a patterned
approach to the subject constitutes a potentially preempted field. (Galvan
v Super. Ct. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 851, 862.)
 
Recognizing that the availability of housing is vitally important
to the state, the California legislature passed the housing element law to do
the following: (a) assure that
counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
attainment of the state housing goal; (b) assure that counties and cities will
prepare and implement housing elements which, along with federal and state
programs, will move toward attainment of the state housing goal; (c) recognize
that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by
it to contribute to the attainment of the state housing goal, provided such a
determination is compatible with the state housing goal and regional housing
needs; (d) ensure that each local government cooperates with other local
governments in order to address regional housing needs. (Gov. Code., § 65580, 65581.)

 
Cross-Defendants’
preemption argument is faulty because the housing element law’s legislative
scheme both permits and recognizes local regulation. There is no explicit
preemption or implied preemption. 
 
Cross-Defendants also argue that requiring
conditional use violates the state housing element law, citing Government Code
section 65583.2, subdivision (i). This law states that the local government's review of the
owner-occupied or multifamily residential use may not require a conditional use
permit. However, the law does not apply to the present circumstances because it
is designed to address the development of a local government’s comprehensive,
long-term general plan. (Martinez v. City of Clovis (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th
193.) 
 
Cross-Defendants further argue that
Cross-Complainant violated the state’s certificate of occupancy requirements.
But this is not relevant to the nuisance per se issue. 
 
Thus, the
City has made a sufficient showing of prevailing on the merits of the
negligence per se cause of action. 
 
Balancing of the Harm
 
When a governmental entity is suing to enjoin violation
of a statute or ordinance that specifically
authorizes injunctive relief and the government shows a
“reasonable probability” of prevailing on the merits, a rebuttable presumption arises
that the potential harm to the public outweighs the
potential harm to the defendant. (IT Corp. v.
County of Imperial (1983)
35 Cal.3d 63, 69.) 
 
Here, HPMC sections 5-35.18, 8-1.05, and 9-2.2407
together authorize the City to enforce any violation of the HPMC by seeking a
court injunction. Thus, the rebuttable presumption arises. 
 
The burden then shifts to the cross-defendants to prove that they
would suffer “grave or irreparable harm” from issuance of the preliminary
injunction. (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial, supra, 35 Cal.3d 63 at pg. 69.) Only
if such harm can be shown will the court proceed to examine the relative actual
harms to the parties. (Ibid.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
conclusorily state that the seven tenants would experience irreparable harm. (Opp.,
pg. 12.) They have not established that they would suffer grave or irreparable
harm. 
 
Other
 
Cross-Defendants argue laches and res
judicata. A long wait before filing suit or applying for
injunctive relief may convince the trial court that there is no irreparable harm. (See Youngblood v. Wilcox (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1368, 1376.) But Cross-Defendants do not
argue how the City delayed in filing the cross-complaint or applying for
injunctive relief. A judge in a civil case is not "'obligated to seek out
theories [a party] might have advanced, or to articulate … that which … [a
party] has left unspoken.'"  (Mesecher v.
County of San Diego (1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 1677, 1686.)
 
There is
no support for adjudicating a res judicata argument in a preliminary
injunction, and Cross-Defendants cite no support for it. 
 
Bond
 
Because Cross-Complainant is a public entity, it does not need to
provide an undertaking. (Code Civ. Proc., § 529, subd. (b)(3).) 
 
Based on all the
above, the motion for preliminary junction is GRANTED.
