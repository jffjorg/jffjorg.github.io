And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to appoint a referee to sell real property at 8203 Zitola Terrace in Los Angeles, California. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff is responsible for the delay in selling the property. However, the court finds it appropriate to appoint a referee to sell the property regardless of who is responsible for the delay. The plaintiff must file and serve a written proposal of three candidates to serve as referee within 15 days, and the defendant must notify the court and plaintiff in writing of his selection of one of the three candidates within seven days. The court has set an order to show cause re: appointment of referee for January 23, 2024, and the parties may raise any concerns they have about the specific terms and conditions of the tentative order at the hearing.
