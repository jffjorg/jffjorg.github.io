  Case Number:  20STCV18798    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Lauren Drablier’s Motion for Appointment of Referee
            Plaintiff Lauren Drablier moves to appoint
a referee to sell real property at 8203 Zitola Terrace, Los Angeles, California
90012.  Code of Civil Procedure section
873.010(a) provides that in a partition action, “[t]he court shall appoint a
referee to divide or sell the property as ordered by the court.”  For partition by sale, the referee “shall sell
the property in the manner and following the procedures provided in this
chapter.”  (CCP § 873.510.)
Defendant
John Thomas McGuire opposes this motion by arguing plaintiff is responsible for
the delay in selling the property.  Regardless
of whether either party bears more responsibility for the delay, the court
finds it appropriate to appoint a referee to sell the property.  
Disposition
Plaintiff Lauren Drablier’s motion for appointment
of referee is granted.  Within 15
days, plaintiff shall file and serve a written proposal of three candidates to
serve as referee.  For each candidate, the
proposal shall state (1) the name, address, telephone number, and email address
of the candidate; (2) the candidate’s hourly rates for services rendered in
this case, and (3) a brief description of the candidate’s credentials.  Within seven days of plaintiff’s proposal, defendant
shall notify the court and plaintiff in writing of his selection of one of the
three candidates.  
The court hereby sets an order to show cause re: appointment
of referee for January 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
The court has prepared a tentative order appointing
the referee that it has provided to the parties.    At the January 23, 2024, hearing, the
parties may raise any concern they have about the specific terms and conditions
of the tentative order.  Plaintiff
