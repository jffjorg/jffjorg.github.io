Ruling: MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS GRANTED
 
Background
 
From June 2021 to October 2021, Plaintiff,
through Michael Milburn (“Millburn”), a claims negotiator for Plaintiff’s
attorney, Joan M. Lauricella (“Lauricella”), and Bruce Anderson (“Anderson”),
Defendant's insurance adjuster, engaged in communications relating to the
settlement of the present case. The parties exchanged several communications,
and on October 17, 2021, Milburn and Anderson held a phone conversation during
which they allegedly settled the case for $125,000. The following day, Milburn
sent an email confirming the settlement. However, Plaintiff allegedly disagreed
with the net amount of the settlement and refused to sign the release. 
 
On
October 27, 2020, Plaintiff filed the present case, and Defendant filed an
answer alleging a defense that the suit is barred because the case had been
settled. Defendant now moves for summary judgment to enforce the settlement
allegedly reached on October 17, 2021.
 
Legal
Standard 
Summary judgment is an available remedy for enforcing
settlement agreements and establishing a bar to claims. (See
Kilpatrick v. Beebe (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1527.) Stewart
v. Preston Pipeline Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1565, 1570 [A motion for
summary judgment based on the affirmative defense that a settlement agreement
was entered into is one method to enforce a settlement agreement other than a
motion to enforce settlement agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6]
Defendant’s answer filed on August 24, 2022, included a
twenty-first affirmative defense stating, "That Plaintiff’s lawsuit
against this responding party is barred because Plaintiff completely and
unequivocally resolved, compromised, or otherwise settled all such claims set
forth in the Complaint in their entirety against this answering
Defendant." Given that Defendant has raised the affirmative defense of a
settlement having been entered into, moving for summary judgment is
appropriate.
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.)
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.” CCP § 437c(p)(2). “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2). "When the motion for summary
judgment is supported by affidavits sufficient to sustain the motion,…the
burden of showing that triable issues exist shifts to the party opposing the
motion. [Citation.] A party cannot avoid summary judgment based on mere
speculation and conjecture…but instead must produce admissible evidence raising
a triable issue of fact. (Crouse v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1509, 1524.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467.) 
As for summary judgment to enforce a
settlement agreement,
defendants had the burden of showing that a cause of action had no merit by
demonstrating that there was a complete defense to that cause of action…. A
settlement agreement is a contract, and the legal principles that apply to
contracts generally apply to settlement contracts….Its validity is thus judged
by the same legal principles applicable to contracts generally….Defendants
therefore had the burden of establishing each contractual element—[1] parties
who are capable of entering into contract, [2] their mutual consent, [3] a
lawful object, and [4] sufficient cause or consideration. (Stewart
v. Preston Pipeline Inc.,
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1565, 1586.)
 
Analysis
 
1. 
Defendant’s Initial
Burden
 
Defendant has met its initial burden of demonstrating that a
settlement agreement was reached between the parties. Milburn, negotiator for Lauricella, who
was and currently is Plaintiff’s attorney, engaged in negotiation talks with Anderson,
claims adjuster for Defendant’s insured, to settle the present case for
Plaintiff. On August 31, 2021, Milburn communicated that Plaintiff had granted
new settlement authority of $150,000.00 in exchange for a duly executed Release
of any and all medical and liability claims against Defendant. On October 1,
2021, Milburn responded to Defendant’s offer of $120,000, stating, “We will get
back to you as soon as we hear back from our client.” (Ex. H to Anderson Decl.[1]).
On October 8, 2021, Milburn indicated that the client was not satisfied with
your offer of $120,000, continuing with, “we do know he will accept $135,000,
that we do know!” (Ex. I). On October 27, 2021, Anderson and Milburn spoke on
the phone, during which conversation the parties agreed to settle the claim for
$125,000, as detailed in Anderson’s declaration (Anderson Dec., Paragraph 23).
On October 28, 2021, at 11:30 a.m., Milburn sent an email to Anderson
confirming the settlement by stating, “I'm delighted to confirm by way of this
email that we have reached an agreement to settle Mr. Lara's personal injury
claim for a total sum of $125,000.00” (Ex. J).
 
Through the course of these negotiations and the email
confirming the settlement at $125,000, Defendant has met its initial burden that a settlement
agreement, involving a payment of $125,000 in total gross settlement in
exchange for a full release, was entered into between the parties.
 
2. 
Actual
and Apparent Authority
 
The crux of Plaintiff’s argument is that
Milburn did not have apparent or actual authority to settle the case on his
behalf. “[T]he law is well settled that an
attorney must be specifically authorized to settle and compromise a claim, that
merely on the basis of his employment he has no implied or ostensible authority
to bind his client to a compromise settlement of pending litigation.” (Blanton
v. Womancare, Inc., supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 404, quoting Whittier Union
High Sch. Dist. v. Superior Court (1977) 66 Cal. App. 3d 504, 508.)  “The
client as principal is bound by the acts of the attorney-agent within the scope
of his actual authority (express or implied) or his apparent or ostensible
authority; or by unauthorized acts ratified by the client.” (Blanton v.
Womancare, Inc. (1985) 38
Cal. 3d 396, 403.)
 
Actual authority stems from the conduct of the principal which causes
the agent reasonably to believe that the principal has consented to the agents
act. Ostensible authority stems from the conduct of the principal which leads
the third party reasonably to believe that the agent is authorized to bind the
principal. (Civ.Code, 2300, 2315, 2316, 2317; Tomerlin v. Canadian Indem. Co.,
61 Cal.2d 638, 643; South Sacramento Drayage Co. v. Campbell Soup Co.,
220 Cal.App.2d 851, 856.)
 
Apparent authority is not applicable in this situation
because Defendant produced no evidence of any
conduct from the principal (Plaintiff) that led the claims adjuster to
reasonably believe that the agent (Milburn) was authorized to bind the
principal. The only conduct or communication indicating potential authority
came from Milburn himself and not from Plaintiff.
 
In Gaine
v. Austin (1943)
58 Cal.App.2d 250, 261, the court found that an agent had apparent authority to
sell a principal’s property because the principal had, on several occasions,
instructed third parties to communicate and negotiate with the agent concerning
the sale. In contrast, in the present case, Anderson, Defendant’s claims
adjuster, did not have any direct communication or contact with the Plaintiff
that could have led him to believe that Milburn had the apparent authority to
settle this case.
 
However, the court finds that Defendant did establish its
initial burden in demonstrating that Milburn had actual authority to settle the
case for $125,000. Actual authority arises from the conduct of the principal which leads the
attorney or agent reasonably to believe that the principal has consented to the
agent's act. First, Plaintiff testified that he authorized his attorneys to
engage in settlement negotiations on his behalf. (Plf's Depo at p.10). Second,
Milburn's communications with Anderson relating to the offer and acceptance of
the settlement was very explicit about the nature and extent of authorization
from Plaintiff. For example, Milburn responded to Defendant's offer of
$120,000, stating “we will get back to you as soon as we hear back from our
client” (Ex. H) but “we do know [Plaintiff] will accept $135,000, that we do
know!” (Ex. I.) Although the settlement of $125,000 was reached over the phone,
the subsequent email confirmation from Milburn did not include any qualifying
language suggesting that the settlement was tentative or subject to the
client’s approval. Instead, the language of the email conveyed a sense of
finality, stating “I'm delighted to confirm by way of this email that we have
reached an agreement to settle Mr. Lara's personal injury claim for a total sum
of $125,000.00 ... It has been a distinct honor working with you on this claim
and bringing about a mutually fair and agreeable outcome,” which typically
indicates that the settlement has been finalized and approved by the client.
Furthermore, a
subsequent email suggests that the reason why Plaintiff wanted to back out of
the settlement is because he was unsatisfied with the net amount he would
receive after deductions for costs and attorney's fees. (Ex. L.) The Court finds that Defendant has met
its initial burden in demonstrating that Milburn had actual authority to enter
into the agreement for $125,000.
 
1.  Triable Issue of Fact
 Defendant failed to raise a triable issue of fact that Milburn did not possess
actual authority to settle this case for $125,000. Plaintiff’s evidence
consists of two declarations, one from Milburn and another from Plaintiff’s
attorney, Lauricella. Notably, no declaration was submitted by Plaintiff
himself. When questioned whether he gave Milburn authority to settle the case
for $125,000, Plaintiff testified that he does not recall. 
 
Milburn declared that he, along with a Spanish-speaking
staff member, had a conversation with Plaintiff where he allegedly received
authority to settle the case for $135,000 (Milburn Decl. ¶ 3). Milburn recalls
instructing the Spanish-speaking staff member to convey the offer of $125,000
to Plaintiff. However, Milburn did not specify what Plaintiff’s response was to the
conveyance of an offer for $125,000. (Milburn Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
Milburn then states that the settlement for $125,000 was
tentative, a statement contradicted by his emails. Milburn’s email prior to October 17,
2021, included language reflecting that any settlement was
tentative (or, more accurately, conditional): "we will get back to you as
soon as we hear back from our client"; and "if we can obtain client’s
approval" (Ex. H). In contrast, Milburn’s confirmation email relating to
the $125,000 settlement states, "I'm delighted to confirm by way of this
email that we have reached an agreement to settle Mr. Lara's personal injury
claim for a total sum of $125,000.00… Lastly, it has been a distinct honor
working with you on this claim and bringing about a mutually fair and agreeable
outcome." Nothing in the email suggests that the settlement was tentative
or conditioned upon Plaintiff’s approval as Milburn had explicitly stated in
his previous emails. Milburn further declared that he discussed the settlement
offer again with Mr. Pena, at which time Mr. Pena did not agree to accept the
$125,000.00. What is missing from Milburn’s declaration is a statement that Plaintiff did not authorize him to enter into the
settlement when he informed Plaintiff of the $125,000 settlement the first
time, prior to October 17, 2021. Further, Plaintiff did not submit a declaration from the
Spanish translator who was present when Milburn initially communicated the
$125,000 settlement to Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff’s other piece of evidence is the declaration of
Lauricella, who states that " Based on review of the file notes, my office only
had authority from Mr. Pena to settle his claim for $135,000; Prior to the emails between Mr. Milburn and
Mr. Anderson, I personally did not communicate a $125,000 settlement offer to
Mr. Pena; and Mr. Pena never gave me authority to settle his claim for $125,000;
Additionally, there are no notes, emails, or documents evidencing that my
employee, Mr. Milburn, had authority to settle Mr. Pena's claim for $125,000,
or that any other staff member had communicated the $125,000 offer to Mr. Pena.”
(Lauricella Decl. ¶4-6.) Lauricella’s declaration essentially states that she
could not find any documentation that Milburn had authority from Plaintiff to
settle the case for $125,000. However, to raise a triable issue of fact,
Plaintiff must provide more than just a statement that there are no documents
supporting Defendant's position. Plaintiff must introduce affirmative evidence.
While the opposing party may attack the moving party's evidence, such as on the
basis of credibility or the sufficiency of the evidence, more is required to
defeat the motion or raise a triable issue of fact. CCP § 437c(e). Moreover,
the lack of documentation is understandable if the offer was conveyed to
Plaintiff during a meeting or through a phone call. Lauricella’s statement that
“Mr. Milburn mistakenly believed he had Mr. Pena’s authority to settle the
action for $125,000” is
speculative unless she
lays a proper foundation.
 
The essential problem with Plaintiff's evidence is
twofold. First, there is no documentation indicating that Milburn did or did
not have actual authority to accept the $125,000 settlement prior to October
17, 2021. Second, knowledge of the communication where the $125,000 settlement
was conveyed to Plaintiff prior to October 17, 2021 is limited to only three
individuals: Plaintiff, Milburn and a Spanish translator. Plaintiff himself
testified that he does not recall if he gave Milner authorization. There is no
declaration or testimony from the Spanish-speaking staff member. And, while
Milburn confirms that he communicated the $125,000 offer to Plaintiff, he did
not specify whether Plaintiff accepted or rejected the offer. As a result,
Plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that raised a triable issue of fact for
the jury to weigh on. 
 
Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED.
