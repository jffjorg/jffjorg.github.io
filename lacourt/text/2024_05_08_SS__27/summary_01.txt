```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has moved for summary judgment to enforce the settlement agreement reached between the parties. The plaintiff disputes that the settlement agreement was valid due to alleged lack of authority by the plaintiff's attorney, Michael Milburn, to settle the case. The court finds that the defendant has met its initial burden in demonstrating that Milburn had actual authority to enter into the agreement for $125,000. The plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that raised a triable issue of fact, and therefore, the court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendant.
