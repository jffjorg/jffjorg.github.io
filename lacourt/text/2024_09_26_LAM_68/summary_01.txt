And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the motion to disqualify counsel, Jay Hong, on behalf of the plaintiffs, Young Shim and Jung Kim. The defendants, Sang Han and In Ran Kim (Lulu Kim), argued that Hong had a conflict of interest because he previously represented them on business matters and therefore could not represent the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The judge found that there was no evidence of an attorney-client relationship or the transmission of confidential information between Hong and the defendants, and that the defendants' claims of confidentiality were based on unexecuted retainer agreements. The judge also found that the defendants' financial information was not material to the lawsuit and that the potential for unfair advantage was minimal. The motion was denied, and the trial remains set for January 27, 2025.
