And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to approve the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action for minors. The petition was filed by Marlene Barboza, the guardian ad litem for Mar Morales, on behalf of 102 plaintiffs, including 35 minor children and 67 adults. The petition seeks to settle the claims against Hwy 111 Hotel Group, LP, the owner of an apartment building where the plaintiffs were tenants. The settlement amount is $1,500,000, and the attorney fees total $41,387.82. The settlement will be distributed to the plaintiffs, with 35 settling minors receiving $5,000 each. Mar Morales, one of the minor plaintiffs, will receive $3,646.53, which will be deposited in a blocked account with JP Morgan Chase. The judge finds that the petition complies with the California Rules of Court and that the settlement is reasonable, and therefore approves the petition.
