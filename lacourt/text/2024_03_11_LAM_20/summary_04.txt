(CCP § 418.10)
  - "A claim need not arise directly from the defendant's forum contacts in order to be sufficiently related to the contact to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction. Rather, as long as the claim bears a substantial connection to the nonresident's forum contacts, the exercise of specific jurisdiction is appropriate." (Vons Cos. v. Seabest Foods, Inc., supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 452)
  - "Evidence Code § 647 provides that a registered process server's declaration of service establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration." (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390)
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion to Quash Service of Summons is denied. The judge finds that the plaintiff has established personal jurisdiction over the defendant based on the defendant's constant, continuous, and substantial ties with California and Oklahoma, as evidenced by the Secretary of State of California documents listing the defendant as an agent of/manager of and/or CEO for multiple businesses. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to overcome the presumption established by the registered process server's signed Proof of Service and the plaintiff's evidence from the California Secretary of State.
