And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Defendant Phillip F. Arrington Jr. ("Defendant") filed a Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and a Request for Sanctions of $3,200.00 against the Plaintiffs Shona Latrece Ware, et al. ("Plaintiffs"). The Defendant propounded the first set of Form Interrogatories on August 3, 2023, and the responses were due on September 7, 2023. The Plaintiffs failed to respond or seek an extension, and the Defendant filed the present Motion on February 15, 2024. The Court granted the Motion to Compel Responses, ordering the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses, without objection, within 30 days. The Court denied the request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiffs did not act without "substantial justification" despite failing to respond to the discovery requests.
