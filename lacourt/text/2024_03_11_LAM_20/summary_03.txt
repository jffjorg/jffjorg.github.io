The Judge, Kevin C. Brazile, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Healthcare Ally Management, LLC v. American International Group. The case involves a claim by Plaintiff Healthcare Ally Management, LLC for $156,800.00 against Defendant American International Group, alleging failure to pay. The Defendant's default was entered on November 16, 2023. However, the Plaintiff has not submitted the necessary moving papers to support their request for default judgment, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a) and Code of Civil Procedure section 585. As a result, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Request for Default Judgment without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can still file the necessary papers and seek default judgment at a later time.
