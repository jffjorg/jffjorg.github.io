And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the Second Amended Complaint and the motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint. The court has overruled the Defendants' demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the third cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court has also denied the Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint.

The court finds that the Second Amended Complaint adequately states a cause of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraudulent concealment. The Defendants' demurrer to the third cause of action for fraudulent concealment is overruled, and the court finds that the complaint adequately alleges the elements of fraudulent concealment.

The court has also considered the motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint. The Defendants move to strike paragraphs 38 and 39, which pertain to punitive damages and attorney's fees, respectively. The court finds that the complaint adequately pleads the elements of punitive damages and that the request for attorney's fees is authorized by the commercial lease agreement.

The court has denied the motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint.
