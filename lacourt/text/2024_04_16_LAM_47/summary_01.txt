And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by both parties. The Judge has deferred ruling on Plaintiff's Motion to Preclude Evidence of Unlicensed Contracting Activities, finding that this issue is central to the case. The Judge has denied Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Parol Evidence, as Plaintiff did not identify specific evidence to be excluded or clarify how it contradicts the terms of the parties' agreements. The Judge has denied Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony, as Plaintiff's initial designation of experts was timely served by email. The Judge has denied Defendant's Motions to Preclude Evidence of Unlicensed Construction Work and Expert Testimony, as these issues are relevant and material to the case. The Judge has also denied Defendant's Statute of Limitations Defense, finding that the defense was waived as it was not properly asserted in the trial court.
