ANALYSIS
 
Demurrer
 
Meet and Confer
 
            The
Declaration of Kristin A. Mathis indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel did not
respond to meet and confer efforts. This satisfies Civ. Proc. Code, §
430.41(a)(3)(B).
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Trader Joe’s Company
demurs to the Complaint as follows:
 
1.         First
Cause of Action (General Negligence) and Second Cause of Action (Premises
Liability).
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff does not even identify the Trader Joe’s store where she
was injured, nor the manner in which she was injured. Defendant argues that the
second cause of action is duplicative of the first cause of action and does not
identify the dangerous condition. 
 
The elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that
duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury. (Citations omitted.) Premises liability “‘is
grounded in the possession of the premises and the attendant right to control
and manage the premises’”; accordingly, “‘mere possession with its attendant
right to control conditions on the premises is a sufficient basis for the
imposition of an affirmative duty to act.’” (Citations omitted.) But the duty arising
from possession and control of property is adherence to the same standard of
care that applies in negligence cases. (Rowland, supra, 69 Cal.2d at p. 119 [“The proper test to be applied to the
liability of the possessor of land … is whether in the management of his
property he has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury
to others … .”]; accord, Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149,
1156 [60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448, 929 P.2d 1239].) In determining whether a
premises owner owes a duty to persons on its property, we apply [* 1159 the Rowland factors. (See, e.g., Thai v. Stang (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1264, 1271 [263 Cal. Rptr. 202] [Rowland analysis applies to premises liability
cases].) Indeed, Rowland itself involved premises
liability. (Rowland, at p. 110.)
 
We have never held that the physical or spatial boundaries of a
property define the scope of a landowner's liability. The Courts of Appeal have
repeatedly concluded that “‘[a] landowner's duty of care to avoid exposing
others to a risk of injury is not limited to injuries that occur on premises
owned or controlled by the landowner.’” (Garcia v. Paramount Citrus Assn., Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1453 [80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 512];
see Barnes
v. Black (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th
1473, 1478 [84 Cal. Rptr. 2d 634] (Barnes); McDaniel v. Sunset Manor Co. (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1, 7–8 [269 Cal. Rptr. 196] (McDaniel).) “Rather, the duty of care encompasses a duty to avoid exposing
persons to risks of injury that occur off site if the landowner's property is
maintained in such a manner as to expose persons to an unreasonable risk of
injury offsite.” (Barnes, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1478; see Davert v. Larson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 407, 410 [209 Cal. Rptr. 445] [“A
landowner or possessor owes a duty of care to persons who come on his property
as well as to persons off the property for injuries due to the landowner's lack
of due care in the management of his property.”].)
 
     (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158-59.)
 
Generally speaking, actual or
constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition—which can be inferred from
control of the property—is required in order to impose premises liability.  (Getchell
v. Rogers Jewelry (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 381, 385-87.)  A
possessor of land owes a duty to maintain land in its possession and control in
a reasonably safe condition. (Alcaraz
v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1155-66.)
 
Here, as pointed out by Defendant, Plaintiff does not even
identify the Trader Joe’s store where the incident occurred, which is the bare
minimum that must be alleged. Further, Plaintiff must allege what the Trader
Joe’s employee did that caused Plaintiff injury and what unsafe floor condition
existed. There is no excuse for Plaintiff’s lawyer to hide the ball in this
manner.
 
The demurrer to the first and second causes of action is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
            Plaintiff
is given 30 days’ leave to amend. 
 
Motion To Strike
 
            Given the
ruling on the demurrer, the motion to strike is MOOT.
