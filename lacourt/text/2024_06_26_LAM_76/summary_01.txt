And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint as to Paragraph 41, Paragraph 47, and Prayer Item No. 5, and grants the motion without leave to amend as to Prayer Item No. 7 and Prayer Item No. 15. The motion was denied because the allegations of fraud and deceit in the Second Amended Complaint were sufficient to plead "fraud" for purposes of recovering punitive damages. The Court notes that Plaintiff's counsel did not respond to meet and confer efforts, and therefore the Court will proceed to rule on the merits. The Court also notes that Plaintiff will be entitled to conduct discovery regarding the identity of persons involved in the execution, recordation and failure to release the properties.
