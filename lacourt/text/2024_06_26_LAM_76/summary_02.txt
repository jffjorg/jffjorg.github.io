And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Complaint filed by Defendant Trader Joe's Company is sustained with leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action. The judge has also given the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the Complaint. The demurrer was sustained because the plaintiff failed to identify the Trader Joe's store where the incident occurred, failed to allege what the Trader Joe's employee did that caused the injury, and failed to allege what unsafe floor condition existed. The judge found that the plaintiff's lawyer failed to respond to meet and confer efforts and hid the ball by not providing sufficient information in the Complaint. The motion to strike portions of the Complaint is moot given the ruling on the demurrer.
