And here is a summary of the tentiative ruling in English text:

The defendant argues that the November Advisor Agreement does not allow for amendment, modification, or waiver except in a signed writing by the parties. However, the court has already denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of the agreement. The court notes that disgorgement is a broader remedy than restitution or restoration, and that there are two types of disgorgement: restitutionary and nonrestitutionary. The court cites several court cases to support this statement, including County of San Bernardino v. Walsh, Feitelberg v. Credit Suisse First Boston, LLC, and American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd.
