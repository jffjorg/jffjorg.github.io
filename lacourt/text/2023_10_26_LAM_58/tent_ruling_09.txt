 
On September 19, 2008, Plaintiff
Banco Popular North America filed a Complaint against Defendants Empire Media
Enterprises, Inc. and Lionel Jenkins (Defendants). A judgment was entered against
Defendants on April 3, 2009 (Judgment). 
 
            On June 23,
2023, Defendant Lionel Jenkins now moves for order Extinguishing the Judgment
Lien pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020. No opposition was
filed. 
 
            The motion
is denied. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendant
Jenkins moves on the grounds that Judgment was not renewed within the 10-year
period as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020.
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure section 683.120, a “judgment creditor
may renew a judgment by filing an application for renewal of the judgment with
the court in which the judgment was entered.” That application can be filed any
time before the expiration of the 10-year period of enforceability provided by
section 683.020. (Code Civ. Proc., § 683.130, subd. (a).) Section 683.140 sets
forth the requirements of the application for renewal, which include, among
other things: the title of the court, the case number, the date of entry of the
judgment and any renewals, the name and address of the judgment creditor and
judgment debtor, and in the case of a money judgment, the information necessary
to compute the amount of the judgment as renewed. “Upon the filing of the
application, the court clerk shall enter the renewal of the judgment in the
court records.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 683.150.) The “entry of the renewal of the
judgment is purely ministerial.” (Jonathan Neil & Associates, Inc. v.
Jones (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1487.) 
 
            “Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020, which defines the period
for enforceability of judgments, provides after the expiration of 10 years
after the date of entry of a money judgment ... the judgment may not be
enforced.”  (Kertesz v. Ostrovsky
(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 369, 372.) Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020 also
provides that after this 10 year period “[a]ny lien created by an enforcement
procedure pursuant to the judgment is extinguished.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
683.020, subd. (c).) 
 
            Here, on April 3, 2009, a judgment was entered in Los Angeles
Superior Court Case No. BC398454 against Defendants Empire Media Enterprises
and Lionel Jenkins. An abstract of judgment was issued on June 25, 2009 and
recorded thereafter in the County of San Bernardino. (Lee Decl., Ex. A.) To
date, the judgment has not been renewed. (Lee Decl., Ex. B.) 
 
            Defendant
Jenkins now seeks an order “declaring the judgment issued in this case is no
longer enforceable and any lien created by an enforcement procedure pursuant to
the judgment is extinguished.” (Proposed Order.) However, this requested relief
is not proper under the statute. (See e.g., Koninklijke Philips Electronics
N.V v. KXD Technology, Inc. (C.D. Cal., July 10, 2020, No. CV 07-6117 AHS)
2020 WL 5092447.) As explained in Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V v. KXD
Technology, Inc.:
 
“Defendant's
reliance on the subsection of California Code of Civil Procedure § 683.020 that
provides where a judgment is no longer enforceable, any judgment lien created
pursuant to that judgment is extinguished, does not alter the analysis because
it does not create a mechanism for a court to find a judgment lien is
extinguished absent an enforcement action. Thus, even if the limitations period
of California Code of Civil Procedure § 683.020 has run, the statute does not
authorize the Court to declare that the judgment lien is extinguished absent an
enforcement action.” (Id. at *3; see also Injazat Technology Fund
B.S.C. v. Najafi (N.D. Cal., Sept. 2, 2022, No. 11-CV-04133-PJH) 2022 WL
4021842, at *2.)
 
This is a peculiar result. The
matter may require legislative attention. 
The Court has found no authority, however, authorizing the relief Defendant
seeks. Defendant appears to be correct that the underlying Judgment is no
longer enforceable, but based on the cases above, the Court cannot grant the
relief sought under Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020.
 
The Motion is denied.
