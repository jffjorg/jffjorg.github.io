argues that the November Advisor Agreement expressly disclaimed any amendment,
modification, or waiver except in a signed writing by the parties. However, in
making this argument, Defendants again rely on their request for judicial notice
of the November Advisor Agreement, which the Court denied. 


[2]           “Disgorgement as a remedy
is broader than restitution or restoration of what the plaintiff lost. (County
of San Bernardino v. Walsh (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 533, 542 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d
848]; Feitelberg v. Credit Suisse First Boston, LLC (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 997, 1013 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 592].) There are two types of
disgorgement: restitutionary
disgorgement, which focuses on the plaintiff's loss,
and nonrestitutionary disgorgement, which focuses on the defendant's unjust enrichment.” (American
Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1482.)
