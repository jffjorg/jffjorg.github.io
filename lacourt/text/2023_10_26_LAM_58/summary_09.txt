And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Defendant Lionel Jenkins is seeking an order to extinguish a judgment lien. The judgment was entered on April 3, 2009, and has not been renewed. Defendant Jenkins relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020, which states that after the expiration of 10 years after the date of entry of a money judgment, the judgment may not be enforced and any lien created by an enforcement procedure is extinguished. However, the Judge finds that the statute does not authorize the Court to declare that the judgment lien is extinguished absent an enforcement action. The Judge denies the motion, citing cases such as Jonathan Neil & Associates, Inc. v. Jones and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V v. KXD Technology, Inc. The Judge notes that the result is peculiar and may require legislative attention.
