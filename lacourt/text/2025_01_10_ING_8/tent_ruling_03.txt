ProceduralOn December 19, 2024, Onni filed its demurrer. On December 27, 2024, Matern Law Group, PC filed an opposition brief. On January 3, 2025 Onni filed a reply brief.II. CONTINUANCE ANALYSIS:Preliminarily, the Court CONTINUES the demurrer on the grounds that Onni has violated California Rule of Court 3.1113 (d). “Except in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.” (CRC 3.1113, subd.(d).) Here, Defendants’ moving papers include a memorandum of points and authorities that is twenty-one (21) pages, clearly exceeding the fifteen (15) page limit. The Court is unaware of any application to file a longer memorandum pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113, subdivision (e). Despite the procedural defect being raised in the Opposition, Onni fails to address this procedural violation in its reply papers.The Court will not rule on a demurrer that is – in violation of the California Rules of Court – six (6) pages or 40% longer than the rules allow for. The Court issues the following briefing schedule if Onni wishes to move forward with this motion: (1) Onni’s 15-page or less Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support of Demurrer is due on or before January 30, 2025; (2) Opposition to Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Demurrer is due on or before by February 13, 2025; (3) Reply to Opposition of Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Demurrer is due on or before February 27, 2025.
