And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint to remove the decedent, Cristobal C. Murillo Valdez, as a plaintiff and add his heirs as plaintiffs. The decedent passed away after the original complaint was filed, and the plaintiffs seek to add a claim for wrongful death. The judge concludes that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that the defendants will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The judge orders the plaintiffs to give notice and will discuss at the hearing whether the parties will stipulate that the existing answers to the complaint shall stand, or whether a new responsive pleading will be filed by the defendants.
