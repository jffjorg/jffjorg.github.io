And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Noemi Cerna v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over a deposition notice served by the defendant, which the plaintiff has failed to attend. The defendant has moved to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has opposed the motion.

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition, but has also denied the request for monetary sanctions. The judge found that the parties failed to meet and confer in good faith prior to the hearing, and that the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide alternative dates for the deposition in a timely manner.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for deposition on one of the two alternative dates offered by the plaintiff's counsel, and has reserved the right to award monetary sanctions if a further hearing is required. The judge has also encouraged the parties to meet and confer in good faith to avoid the need for further hearings.
