And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Manuk Pashanyan (Plaintiff) against Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (Defendant). The Defendant moves to compel the Plaintiff to provide complete responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories, Set Three, and seeks $1,410.00 in sanctions against the Plaintiff and counsel. The Plaintiff has served verified responses to the form interrogatories, which moots the motion to compel. The judge denies the Defendant's request for sanctions because CCP section 2030.290(c) only allows sanctions against a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel. The judge notes that the Plaintiff waived his objections to the form interrogatories when he failed to serve timely responses. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer on the issue of objections to the form interrogatories and suggests that they schedule an IDC prior to filing any motion to compel further responses. The judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions and expects the parties to participate in an IDC before pursuing a motion to compel further responses.
