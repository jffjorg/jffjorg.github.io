And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, stating that the plaintiff's causes of action against the defendant are not for the sexual molestation itself, but rather for the defendant's failures to protect the plaintiff from the sexual molestation carried out by the perpetrator. The court finds that the defendant may be vicariously liable for the actions of the perpetrator, as the perpetrator was an employee of the defendant at the time of the alleged sexual abuse. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims are revived under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, which revived childhood sexual assault claims that were previously barred by the statute of limitations. The court concludes that the defendant's arguments regarding the Gift Clause and the claims presentation requirement are unpersuasive, and that the plaintiff's claims are valid and should be allowed to proceed.
