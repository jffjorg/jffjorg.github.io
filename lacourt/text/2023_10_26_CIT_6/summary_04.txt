And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., is seeking $32,022.82 in damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs from the defendant, T.N Lucky Inc Dba TN Logisticus. However, the plaintiff failed to use the proper form for requesting entry of default judgment, which is required by the California Rules of Court. Specifically, the plaintiff should have used Form CIV-105 instead of Form CIV-100, as the action is subject to the Fair Debt Buying Practices Act. The judge finds that the plaintiff's request does not meet the required form and therefore denies the request without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the request using the proper form.
