And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petitions for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with a disability filed by Miguel Angel Valdez and Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez without prejudice. The petitions were denied due to various defects and discrepancies, including the failure to provide notice of the Court's previous ruling, the lack of legal authority to execute the retainer agreements, and the use of the same petition with changes made after it had been signed. The judge has ordered Miguel and Daniela to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court's order.
