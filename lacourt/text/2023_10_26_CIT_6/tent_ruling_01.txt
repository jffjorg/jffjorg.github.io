Miguel and Daniela are ordered to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.BACKGROUND This is a habitability case. On July 27, 2020, this action was filed. On December 23, 2022, the operative Second Amended Complaint was filed by Plaintiffs Deysi Valdez, Homero Gochez, Jonathan Campos, Miguel Angel Valdez, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Deysi Valdez, Ana Ayard, Jose Ayard, Francisco Lucas, Maria Castrejon, Kerum Lucas, Francisco Lucas Castrejon, Myriam Rodriguez, Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Myriam Rodriguez, Patricia Guzman, Jose Luis Lopez, William Martinez, Christian Castrejon, Daniel F. Hudson, and Miriam Ayard, against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for failure to provide habitable dwelling, breach of covenant and right to quiet enjoyment and possession of the property, nuisance, and negligence. On August 10, 2023, Miguel and Daniela each filed a petition for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with a disability. On October 12, 2023, the Court denied the petitions without prejudice. On October 13, 2023, Miguel and Daniela filed petitions to address the issues identified in the Court’s October 12, 2023 order.DISCUSSION Petition for Minor’s Compromise (Miguel Angel Valdez) Claimant Miguel Angel Valdez, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Deysi Valdez, i.e., the petitioner for Miguel, has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC, in exchange for $10,666.66, $8,000.00 of which will go to Miguel. If approved, $2,666.66 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $8,000.00 for Miguel, to be directly deposited into a special needs trust account with CalABLE belonging to Miguel. Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds it to be fair and reasonable. Further, the Court finds the proposed attorney’s fees, equaling 25% of Miguel’s settlement proceeds, to be fair and reasonable in light of the case having progressed for three years before settling. However, the Court notes that Miguel failed to comply with the Court’s October 12, 2023 ruling, which required Miguel to give notice of that ruling. (Minute Order (10/23/23).) The Court would not deny the petition on this ground alone. The Court also notes that the retainer agreement with Miguel was signed by Miguel himself, rather than through Deysi or another authorized signatory on his behalf. (Attachment 17a, ¶ 10.) Considering that Letters of Conservatorship for a Limited Conservatorship that were issued to Deysi on July 20, 2018, well before the execution of the retainer agreement on November 25, 2019, it is unclear if Miguel had the capacity to enter into the retainer agreement. (Attachment 17a, ¶ 10; Attachment 18a.) However, the Court would not deny the petition on this ground alone. The Court further notes that Miguel’s petition reflects that it was executed on August 7, 2023, i.e., before the Court’s October 12, 2023 ruling noting various defects in the petition. (Miguel’s Petition (10/13/23), ¶ 23.) It appears that the same petition was used, but with changes made to it after it had been signed. The Court finds this to be problematic. Finally, paragraph 3 on Miguel’s proposed order to deposit funds in blocked account is incomplete, as the box indicating Petitioner’s capacity for opening the blocked account was not checked. Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Miguel’s petition without prejudice. Petition for Minor’s Compromise (Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez) Claimant Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Myriam Rodriguez, i.e., the petitioner for Daniela, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC, in exchange for $10,666.66, $8,000.00 of which will go to Daniela. If approved, $2,666.66 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $8,000.00 for Daniela, to be deposited into a blocked account until Daniela reaches the age of majority. Daniela’s petition for compromise is largely identical to Miguel’s petition addressed above, and contains some of the same discrepancies. First, as with Miguel’s petition, Daniela did not give notice of the Court’s October 12, 2023 ruling as directed therein. (Minute Order (10/12/23).) The Court would not deny the petition on this ground alone. Second, the retainer agreement with Daniela is signed by Myriam, not Daniela. (Attachment 17a, ¶ 10.) There is nothing in the file to indicate that Myriam had the legal authority to enter into the retainer agreement on Daniela’s behalf. However, the Court would not deny the petition on this ground alone. Third, Daniela’s petition was also executed on August 7, 2023, before the Court’s October 12, 2023 ruling. (Daniela’s Petition (10/13/23), ¶ 23.) It seems again the same petition was used but with changes made to it after it was executed. The Court finds this problematic. Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Daniela’s petition without prejudice.CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Miguel’s petition without prejudice. The Court DENIES Daniela’s petition without prejudice. Miguel and Daniela are ordered to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
