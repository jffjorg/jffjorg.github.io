  Case Number:  BC665489    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  74 Youd v.  Freeland et al.  Defendant Amusement Outlook LLC’s Motion  to Seal   BACKGROUND               This  action arises from fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion claims.              The  case was dismissed under a settlement between the parties.               Plaintiff  Timothy Youd (Plaintiff) filed his Motion to Enforce Settlement on September  25, 2024.  Defendant filed the Motion to  Seal on October 7, 2024.    LEGAL STANDARD  Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are  presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.  (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and other papers may not be filed  under seal merely by stipulation of the parties; rather, a prior court order is  necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subd. (a).)   The governing rule here is Cal.  Rules of Court, Rule 2.550(d) which states “that the court may order that a  record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that  establish:    There       exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to       the record;    The       overriding interest supports sealing the record;    A       substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be       prejudiced if the record is not sealed;    The       proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and    No less       restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”   If the court fails to make the required findings, the order  is deficient and cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman  Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) Sanctions may be  imposed for overboard requests to seal. (Id. at p. 500.)     DISCUSSION             California law recognizes a constitutional right of access  to court proceedings and court documents because the public has an interest in  observing and assessing the performance of the judicial system.  (In Re Marriage of Tamir (2021) 72  Cal.App.5th 1068, 1078; see also McNair v. NCAA (2015) 234  Cal.App.4th 25, 31.)              The  first step to seal records within a civil case requires the movant to identify  an interest that overcomes the right of public access.  Defendant alleges that it has an overriding  interest in maintaining the negotiated confidentiality of the Parties’  Settlement Agreement. Public disclosure of private settlement terms can  constitute an overriding interest.  (See Universal  City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281-82  (citing NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20  Cal.4th 1178, 1222, fn 46).)  To seal a  settlement agreement pursuant to a confidentiality provision, the moving party  must show “serious injury which would result from public disclosure.”  (Huffy Corp. v. Superior Corp. (2003)  112 Cal.App.4th 97, 106 (citing Universal City Studios, supra,  110 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1281-1282).)             Defendant  alleges that it will suffer severe prejudice from public disclosure of the  settlement agreement because disclosure would (1) expose confidential financial  affairs, (2) prejudice a business interest, and (3) expose Defendant to  lawsuits.  Specifically, Defendant  asserts the disclosure of information about the changes to Defendant’s equity  structure would expose confidential financial affairs.  Additionally, Defendant alleges that  Plaintiff’s comments violate the non-disparagement clause of the settlement  with prejudice Defendant’s business interests.   Finally, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff’s statements regarding  Defendant’s business practices would damage Defendant’s reputation and expose  it to lawsuits based on the statements.               With  respect to the exposure of confidential financial affairs, Defendant has  sufficiently shown prejudice.  Defendant  has a right to seal references to confidential settlement terms due to the  value confidentiality plays in facilitating settlement agreements.  (Monster Energy Co. v. Schechter (2019) 7 Cal.5th 781, 793.)  This right does not apply to all terms in the  settlement agreement, however, but only applies to the settlement agreement’s  unique terms, like the equity structure.   The Court declines to seal the settlement agreement’s references to the  Release of Claims.              With  respect to the non-disparagement clause, Defendant provides no authority  supporting that a non-disparagement clause establishes a privacy right overriding  the right to public access.               With  respect to the business practices, Defendant provides no authority that damage  to Defendant’s reputation or potential exposure to opportunistic lawsuits establishes a privacy right overriding the right to public access.             The  Court finds that the Defendant’s following redactions are narrowly tailored to  protect the confidential settlement terms about the equity structure: ·          Motion  1:17 ·          Motion  3:4 “and… for:” ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.1 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.2 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.3 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 5.3.3   CONCLUSION  The Court grants Defendant’s motion to seal as  to: ·          Motion  1:17 ·          Motion  3:4 “and… for:” ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.1 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.2 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 1.3 ·          Youd  Decl., Ex. 4, section 5.3.3 The Court denies the remaining  requests to seal. Defendant to give notice.
