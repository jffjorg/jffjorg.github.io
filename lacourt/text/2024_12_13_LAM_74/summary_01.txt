And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's motion to seal the settlement agreement. The defendant alleged that it has an overriding interest in maintaining the negotiated confidentiality of the settlement agreement, citing potential prejudice from public disclosure. The judge found that the defendant has sufficiently shown prejudice in the exposure of confidential financial affairs related to the equity structure of the company. The judge also found that the redactions requested by the defendant are narrowly tailored to protect these confidential terms. The judge granted the motion to seal as to these specific redactions, but denied the remaining requests to seal.
