The Judge grants the motion based on the Plaintiff's substantial interest in the case and concerns about her ability to testify and stand trial due to her age (78) and health issues.

The Judge sets the matter for further discussion at the motion hearing, where the parties may stipulate to a January 2025 trial date or the Judge will set a new trial date for October 4, 2024.
