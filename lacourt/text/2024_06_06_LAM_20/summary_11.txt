And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the demurrer filed by the defendants, Los Angeles Community College District, Suleman Ishaque, Earic Dixon-Peters, and Genice Sarcedo-Magruder, and denies the motions to strike filed by Ishaque and Dixon-Peters. The court finds that the plaintiff, Kathleen Sullivan, has adequately alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies and that the demurrer should be overruled. However, the court grants the motion to strike filed by Genice Sarcedo-Magruder, finding that the FAC does not sufficiently allege conduct that would justify punitive damages. The court also denies leave to amend the FAC.
