Plaintiff additionally moved to dismiss Defendant Rosaisela Alvarez  from the matter.                On May 16, 2022, the Court ordered  the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for  Dismissal with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6.                On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff  filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment.                           No opposition has been filed.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside  the dismissal entered on May 16, 2022, and enter judgment against Defendant Eduardo Ramirez, aka Eduardo Chavez,  aka Eduardo Chavezramirez in the sum of $1,160.05 for the following  principal amount of $5,895.19 less $5,245.14 in payments made by both Defendant  and Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus court cost totaling $510.00  consisting of: $370.00 complaint filing fee, $80.00 service of process fee, and  $60.00 motion fee. Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to make any monthly  payments under the stipulation, thus putting her in default. On November 01,  2023, Plaintiff mailed a default letter to Defendant regarding the missed  payments as required by the Agreement. Since notifying Defendant about the  default, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has failed to bring payments current.  Thus, because of the payment default, Plaintiff brings the instant motion.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6  (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For  purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any  of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney  who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis  added].)    “On a motion to enforce, the court  must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.  [Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement  were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly  acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In  re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of  Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.)    The court may  interpret the terms and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord  (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of  a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have  previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60  Cal.App.4th 793, 810).    II.        Discussion    A.  Retention of Jurisdiction              “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special  proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship  of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the  parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of  Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary  nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is  prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement  agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.  Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)   “A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction  under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the  Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement  of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of  the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the  parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally  before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th  429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and  it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,  97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)   Here,  the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the  Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce  the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (05-06-22  Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation  and submitted it to the Court. (Id.  at p. 3.) On May 16, 2022, the Court dismissed the entire case without  prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall  retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (05-16-22 Order for Dismissal.)  Therefore, the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements  under CCP § 664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant  to the parties’ Stipulation in this action.   B.  Entry of Judgment    The Settlement  Agreement, filed on May 06, 2022, provides that the parties agreed to settle  the matter for a principal sum of $5,895.19, with Defendant’s insurance carrier  making an initial payment of $4,595.19 on October 10, 2021. Defendant would  make monthly payments of $50.00 beginning on December 15, 2021, until paid in  full. (Harlan M. Reese, Esq. Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff provides the Court  with the declaration of its counsel who avers that Defendant’s insurance  carrier made a one-time payment of $4,595.14. (Id. ¶  4.) Defendant made monthly payments under the stipulation totaling $650.00,  however Defendant has since defaulted. (Id. ¶  5.) Pursuant to the Agreement, around November 01, 2023, Plaintiff mailed  Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments. (Id. ¶ 6; Exh. C.) Per the Agreement, if  no payment correcting the default was made within fourteen (14) days of issuing  a default letter, Plaintiff was entitled to file a motion vacating the  dismissal and have judgment entered. (Id. ¶  7.) Accordingly, due to Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement  Agreement, Plaintiff requested that a judgment of $1,160.05 be entered against  Defendant. (Id. ¶ 8.) The Court  finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made no payments or cured the  default after Plaintiff sent notice. (Id. ¶¶  5-7.) Therefore, since a valid and signed settlement agreement between the  parties was breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the  motion satisfies the requirements under CCP § 664.6. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and  Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on May 16, 2022, is vacated.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $1,160.05  for the following: principal amount of $5,895.19 less $5,245.14 in payments  made by both Defendant and Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus court cost  totaling $510.00 consisting of: $370.00 complaint filing fee, $80.00 service of  process fee, and $60.00 motion fee.   III.       Conclusion               Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion  to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment against Defendant Eduardo Ramirez, aka  Eduardo Chavez, aka Eduardo Chavezramirez is GRANTED.  The Dismissal entered on 05/16/2022 as to Defendant Eduardo Chavez is set aside and vacated.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant  Eduardo Ramirez, aka Eduardo Chavez, aka Eduardo Chavezramirez in the TOTAL amount  of $1,160.05. Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit a proposed form of Judgment, consistent with today's Court's Ruling, within 10-days. Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
