And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment. The plaintiff had filed a cause of action for breach of written contract against the defendant, and the parties had reached a settlement agreement. However, the defendant failed to make the monthly payments under the agreement, putting him in default. The court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, and it retains jurisdiction to enter judgment. The court grants the plaintiff's motion and enters judgment against the defendant in the amount of $8,290.94, which includes the principal amount of $8,072.94, less $145.00 in payments made by the defendant, plus court costs totaling $363.00.
