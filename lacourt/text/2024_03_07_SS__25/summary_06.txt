And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to deem facts admitted against the defendant. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's requests for admission, which triggered the plaintiff's right to move for an order deeming the facts admitted. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond was a misuse of the discovery process and orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $770.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the facts admitted and orders the defendant to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
