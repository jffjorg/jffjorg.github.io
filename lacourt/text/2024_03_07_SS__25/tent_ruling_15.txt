BACKGROUND
On December 21, 2023, Delbert Cannon (“Plaintiff”) filed a cause of
action against Defendants Westwood/Lindbrook Partners LLC fka
Westwood/Lindbrook Partners, Ltd., LP (“Westwood”), J & J Hospitality Group
LLC (“J & J Hospitality”), and Chirag Shah (“Shah”) (“Special Appearing
Defendant”) (collectively “Defendants”) for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights
Act. 
On January 03, 2024, Defendant Shah made a special appearance to file
the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint. 
Defendant J & J Hospitality filed its Answer to Plaintiff’s
complaint on January 18, 2024.
Plaintiffs’ files in opposition to the instant motion. Special
Appearing Defendant files in reply.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendant Shah prays
for an order from the Court to quash Plaintiffs’ purported service of summons
and complaint under CCP §§ 415.10. Defendant Shah argues that the summons and
complaint were improper as summons was not personally served on Defendant Shah or
in any other lawful manner consistent with CCP 415.10. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied as substituted
service was properly effectuated on Defendant Shah’s business address, which
additionally serves as Shah’s usual address, consistent with CCP § 415.20(b).
Plaintiff asserts that Shah’s argument lacks merit as a matter of law as
nothing in CCP § 415.20(b) requires a person being handed with summons be
authorized to accept service on defendant’s behalf. Plaintiff points out that
the address at which service was effected is the same address reported as
Shah’s usual mailing address and as his usual place of business. Moreover, the
address also is listed as Shah’s address on his website and is registered with
the Secretary of State as both Shah’s usual mailing address and place of
business. 
 
REPLY
 
            In reply, Shah
reasserts that the Court should grant his motion to quash, arguing that
Plaintiff completely ignores that CCP § 415.20 applies only to service required
under CCP §§ 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90. Shah further asserts that
Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of showing that proper service was
made on Shah, re-emphasizing that he never authorized anyone to accept service
on his behalf. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 “‘Service of process, under
longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is fundamental to any
procedural imposition on a named defendant.’ [Citation.]” (AO Alfa-Bank v.
Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.) “To establish personal
jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is
essential.” (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)
Defendant’s knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory
requirements for service of summons. (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) 
 
“A defendant, on
or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time
that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash service of summons
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her” that
results from lack of proper service. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1). A
defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to file a responsive
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) 
 
“When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service
of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of
jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective
service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) 
 
“Evidence Code
section 647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of service
establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the
facts stated in the declaration. [Citation.]” (American Express Centurion
Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code § 647.)
 
II.        Discussion 
 
            Defendant Shah argues that
Plaintiff’s service of summons and complaint is defective in so far as it has
not provided him with actual notice of the instant action against him. 
 
            Defendant states in his sworn
declaration that he learned around December 29, 2023, that the secretary of Haney
& Shah, LLP, Rehevelow Shiao, received the Complaint. Defendant avers that
Ms. Shiao was not authorized to accept service on his behalf nor has he
authorized anyone employed at Haney & Shah, LLP to accept service on his
behalf. (Chirag Shah Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.) Defendant further declares that at no point
was he served, personally or otherwise. (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant
additionally provides the declaration of managing partner for Haney & Shah,
LLP, who additionally swears that Ms. Shiao is not authorized to accept service
on behalf of any individuals. (Steven H. Haney Decl. ¶ 2.) Finally, Defendant
provides the declaration of Ms. Shiao who also swears that she was not
authorized to receive service. (Rehevelow Shiao Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied as substituted
service was properly effectuated on Defendant Shah’s business address, which
additionally serves as Shah’s usual address, consistent with CCP § 415.20(b).
Plaintiff asserts that Shah’s argument lacks merit as a matter of law as
nothing in CCP § 415.20(b) requires a person being handed with summons be
authorized to accept service on defendant’s behalf. Plaintiff points out that
the address at which service was effected is the same address reported as
Shah’s usual mailing address and as his usual place of business. Moreover, the
address also is listed as Shah’s address on his website and is registered with
the Secretary of State as both Shah’s usual mailing address and place of
business.
 
            CCP §
415.10 provides that “A summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of
the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served. Service of a
summons in this manner is deemed complete at the time of such delivery.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 415.10.) 
 
            Further CCP
§ 415.20(b) provides,
 
If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or
416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and
complaint at the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place
of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household
or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the
contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the
complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at
the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. Service of a
summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20(b) (emphasis added).)
 
            Finally,
CCP § 416.90 provides
that, “A summons may be served on a person not otherwise specified in this
article by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to such person
or to a person authorized by him to receive service of process.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 415.20).
 
            Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has carried his burden that service was properly rendered.  Plaintiff filed a proof of service by
substituted service for Defendant Shah which included a declaration of
diligence stating actions taken first to attempt personal service.  (Proof of Substituted Service 1/4/2024).  The declaration noted two unsuccessful attempts
to serve Defendant Shah personally at his usual place of business at 1055
West 7th Street, Suite 1950, Los Angeles, CA 90017, on 12/26/2023 and 12/28/2023, prior to the substituted
service.  (Id.)  The substituted service provides that service
was made on “Rev Shiao – Paralegal” who was “a person at least 18 years of age
apparently in charge at the office or usual place of business” of Defendant
Shah, and that she was informed of the general nature of the papers.  (Id.) 
Despite While Defendant provided evidence that Ms. Shiao was not
authorized to receive service on Defendant’s behalf, CCP § 415.20(b) does
not require that substituted service be made on “a person authorized” by
Defendant Shah.  As such, Plaintiff’s substituted service on Defendant
Shah complies with CCP § 415.20(b).  
 
CCP § 415.20(b) further requires
that service be made on a person apparently in charge when leaving a copy of
the summons and complaint at the person’s office or usual place of
business.  Here, Ms. Shiao is identified
as a paralegal. (Proof of
Substituted Service 1/4/2024).  As
such, service on Ms. Shiao was service on a person whose relationship with
Defendant Shah makes it more likely than not that she would deliver process to
him.  (See Ellard v. Conway, 94
Cal. App. 4th 540 (2001)).  Indeed,
Defendant Shah acknowledges that service “was given… in this matter through a
person handing the Complaint to Haney & Shah, LLP's secretary, Rehevolew
Shiao.” (Motion, p. 3; Shah Decl. ¶ 3; Shiao Decl. ¶ 2).  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s substituted
service on Defendant Shah was proper under CCP § 415.20(b).  
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Quash Service of Summons is DENIED.
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Special Appearing Defendant Chirag Shah’s Motion to Quash
Service of Summons is DENIED.
 
 
Defendant Chirag Shah’s answer is
ordered to be filed within  twenty
(20)  days of notice of this Court’s
ruling.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
