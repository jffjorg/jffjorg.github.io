And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendant WC Homes, LLC's demurrer to Plaintiff Jerry Lobo's complaint with 30 days leave to amend. The demurrer was based on the grounds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge found that the complaint does not establish Defendant's ownership or control of the property, making it impossible for Defendant to be liable for Plaintiff's injuries. The Judge also noted that Plaintiff's opposition did not address Defendant's arguments or cite relevant case law. The Judge ordered the parties to meet and confer before filing any subsequent motions to ensure that they have a substantive discussion of the legal merits of the claims.
