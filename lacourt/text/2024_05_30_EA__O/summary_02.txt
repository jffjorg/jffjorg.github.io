And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the case, which primarily concerns a dispute over negligence and premises liability allegations. The plaintiff allegedly trespassed onto the defendant's property, and the defendant owns a semi-truck. The plaintiff's opposition was filed late due to a clerical error, but the court will not strike the opposition. The court grants the request for judgment on the pleadings (RJN) and will provide a consolidated analysis of the negligence and premises liability allegations. The court cites relevant cases, including Pineda v. Ennabe and Kaufman & Broad Bldg. Co. v. City & Suburban Mortg. Co., to inform its analysis. The court notes that the duty to maintain a public street abutting the defendant's property is unclear and may not be instructive in this case.
