Summary in English text:

The Judge denies the Motion to Dismiss filed by Friends of ECR, a Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation. The case involves a vehicle accident that resulted in the death of Hamid Kohan Darvish, and the subsequent lawsuit filed by his estate and wife against Khelika Bell and others. The City of Los Angeles had filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted, and the Plaintiffs failed to amend the complaint within the time allowed. Friends of ECR argues that the complaint should be dismissed because of the Plaintiffs' failure to amend the complaint, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f). However, the Judge finds that this section does not give the court authority to dismiss the complaint and enter judgment in favor of the defendant who did not move for judgment on the pleadings. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs' counsel believed that they did not need to file an amended complaint because the motion for judgment on the pleadings only pertained to the City of Los Angeles and El Camino Real, and that they were negotiating dismissing those defendants. Therefore, the Judge exercises its discretion and denies the Motion to Dismiss.
