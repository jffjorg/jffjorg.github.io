And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge overrules the demurrer filed by Defendant Marc M. Asheghian, individually and as trustee of the Marc M. Asheghian Declaration of Trust dated August 18, 2004, to Plaintiff Daniel Zuckerman's first amended complaint.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff's causes of action are not time-barred by the statute of limitations. Although Defendant argues that Plaintiff should have discovered the deck encroachment earlier, the Judge finds that Plaintiff's belated discovery is supported by the allegations in the complaint and facts properly subject to judicial notice.

The Judge also finds that Plaintiff's pleading is not unclear or ambiguous, and that Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's first amended complaint fails to distinguish between the encroachment caused by the original deck and the expansion of the original deck is meritless.

Finally, the Judge finds that Plaintiff's amended complaint is not a sham pleading, despite Defendant's argument that the inconsistent dates for discovery of the encroachment render the pleading defective. The Judge agrees with Plaintiff's explanation that the inconsistent dates were due to a scrivener's error and that the survey attached to the first amended complaint was created in July 2023, not August 2022.
