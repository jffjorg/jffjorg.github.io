COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
  
Demurrer Without
  Motion to Strike
 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:

 
 
Defendant
Marc. M. Asheghian individually and as trustee of the Marc. M. Asheghian
Declaration of Trust dated August 18, 2004 (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiff
Daniel Zuckerman’s first amended complaint. 
 
This
court overrules the demurrer.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
Plaintiff owns real
property located at 3437 Castlewoods Place, Sherman Oaks, California (the
“Castlewoods Property”). (Complaint ¶ 1.) Defendant owns real property located
at 3430 Alana Dr., Sherman Oaks, California (the “Alana Property”). The two
properties are adjoining. (Complaint ¶ 1.) 

 
Sometime between October
2012 and December 2013, Defendant constructed a deck on the Alana Property.
(Complaint ¶ 3.) Plaintiff acquired the Castlewoods Property in 2016.
(Complaint ¶ 5.) In or around June 2023, Plaintiff removed foliage from the
Castlewoods Property to extend the height of the fence between the properties.
(Complaint ¶ 6.) Plaintiff discovered the encroaching portion of Defendant’s
deck and discovered Defendant was in the process of expanding the deck.
(Complaint ¶ 6.)
 
On February 16, 2024,
Plaintiff, as an individual and as trustee of the Daniel L. Zuckerman Living
Trust Dated April 8, 2013, filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1
through 25, alleging causes of action for quiet title, nuisance, trespass,
declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.
 
On June 20, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. (06/20/24 Minute Order.)
 
On August 13, 2024,
Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint. On October 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an opposition. On November 5, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
 
II.            
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant requests this court take judicial notice of a
grant deed for the Castlewoods Property, recorded with the Office of the Los
Angeles County on September 4, 1963. (Ex. A.)
 
“A recorded deed is an official act of the executive
branch, of which this court may take judicial notice.” (Ragland v. U.S. Bank
National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 194.) 
 
Accordingly, this court grants Defendant’s request and
takes judicial notice of the grant deed.
 
III.          
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 

Timeliness

“A person against
whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after
service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40(a).) When service is made electronically,
“[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any
response” is extended by two court days. (Code Civ. Proc, §
1010.6(a)(3)(B).) 
 
Plaintiff served Defendant with the first
amended complaint electronically on June 6, 2024. (Proof of Service filed
07/30/24.) On July 17, 2024, Defendant filed a declaration of demurring party
in support of automatic extension, which extended Defendant’s deadline to file
the demurrer by thirty days. Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s first amended
complaint on August 13, 2024. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is timely. 

Meet and Confer

California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿430.41, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in
good faith before the filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the
objections raised in the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and
serve with the demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were
unable to resolve the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and
conferred or that the opposing party failed to meet and confer with the
demurring party in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s counsel
submits a declaration stating they met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel
before filing the demurrer, but “Plaintiff’s counsel determined that they would
not be filing an amended pleading.” (Solberg Declaration ¶ 3.)
 
This
court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
 
IV.          
LEGAL
STANDARD¿ 
¿¿¿ 
As a general matter, in
a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the
evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc.
Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the
truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains “[a]¿statement¿of
the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”
(Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a “complaint ordinarily
is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v.
City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)
 
A party may demur to a
complaint because the complaint “does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §
430.10(e).) A party may also demur because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §
430.10(f).) “’[U]ncertain includes ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §
430.10(f).)
 
V.             
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff’s causes of action are time-barred. (Demurrer at p. 8.)
Defendant further argues that if Plaintiff’s causes of action are based on the
alleged 2023 discovery of the expansion, they are unclear. (Demurrer at p. 10.)
Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s “attempt to plead around the statute
of limitations problem has caused him to submit sham pleadings.” (Demurrer at
p. 10.) 
 

Statute of Limitations

 
Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint alleges causes of action for quiet title, nuisance,
trespass, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.
 
“The
legislature has not established a specific statute of limitations for actions
to quiet title.” (Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 467, 476.)
“[C]ourts refer to the underlying theory of relief to determine the applicable
period of limitations” which requires “the court to identify the nature (i.e.,
the ‘gravamen’) of the cause of action.” (Id.) However, “[a]lthough the
applicable limitations period is determined by looking at the gravamen of the
quiet title cause of action, the general principles about when that limitations
period commences do not necessarily apply because quiet title actions have
special rules for when the limitations period begins to run.” (Id. at p.
477.) “[A]s a general rule, the statute of limitations [for a quiet title
action] does not run against one in possession of land.” (Id.)
 
Actions
for trespass upon or injury to real property are governed by a three-year
statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338(b).) 
The “’discovery rule’ . . . postpones accrual of a cause of action until
the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.” (Ventura29
LLC v. City of San Buenaventura (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1028, 1044.) “A
plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she ‘has reason
at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.” (Id.) “Under the
discovery rule, suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,
coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements, will generally trigger the
statute of limitations period.” (Id.) 
 
“A
plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his or her claim would be
barred by the applicable orthodox statute of limitations, and who intends to
rely on the discovery rule to toll the orthodox limitation
period, ‘must specifically plead facts which show (1) the time and manner of
discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite
reasonable diligence. [Citations.] Mere conclusory assertions that delay in
discovery was reasonable are insufficient and will not enable the complaint to
withstand general demurrer. [Citation.]’ [Citations.] Arguments
that discovery-rule issues are necessarily factual and cannot be
resolved on demurrer have been rejected.” (Ventura29 LLC v. City of San
Buenaventura, supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at p. 1044.)
“The
duration of the limitations period applicable to a declaratory relief action is
determined by the nature of the underlying obligation sought to be adjudicated.
[Citation] Thus, a declaratory judgment action . . . to enforce a statutory
liability must be brought within the same . . . period after accrual of the
cause of action . . . as an action for damages or injunction on the same
liability.” (Snyder v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 1196, 1208.)
“A
demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,
but is not necessarily, barred. [Citation] In order for the bar of the statute
of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” (Snyder v. California Ins.
Guarantee Assn., supra, 229 Cal.App.4th at p. 1208.)

Application

Plaintiff
alleges he acquired the Castlewoods Property in 2016. (Complaint ¶ 4.) Plaintiff
further alleges that, “[b]ased on publicly available satellite imagery reviewed
after this dispute arose, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon
alleges, that Defendant constructed a deck on the Alana Property sometime
between October 2012 and December 2013.” (Complaint ¶¶ 3, 5.) Because Plaintiff alleges
the standard statute of limitations began sometime between October 2012 and
December 2013, Plaintiff must allege facts showing the discovery rule postponed
the accrual of his causes of action. (Ventura29 LLC v.
City of San Buenaventura, supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at p. 1044.) Specifically, Plaintiff must allege (1) “the
time and manner of discovery” and (2) “the inability to have made earlier
discovery despite reasonable diligence.” (Id.) 
Plaintiff
alleges he “discovered that Defendant was in the process of expanding the
existing deck on the Alana Property”, and “discovered the encroaching portion
of the deck” “[i]n or around June 2023” while removing overgrown foliage to
extend the height of the original fence between the properties. (Complaint ¶¶
6, 18.) Thus, Plaintiff has alleged the time and manner of discovery.
Plaintiff also
alleges that “[b]ecause of
the existing foliage, at the time the deck appears to have been constructed on
the Alana Property, Plaintiff had no way of knowing whether, or even if, the
deck extended onto the Castlewoods Property.” (Complaint ¶ 5.)  Thus, Plaintiff has alleged he was unable to
make an earlier discovery. 
Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s “cannot and does not plausibly allege that a ‘reasonable
investigation’ would not have led him to discover this large ‘elevated’ deck in
his backyard.” (Reply p. 2.)  “Once
belated discovery is pleaded, the issue of whether plaintiff exercised
reasonable diligence in discovering the negligent cause of the injury is a
question of fact.” (Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo (1988) 199
Cal.App.3d 520, 527.) “When a plaintiff reasonably should have
discovered facts for purposes of the accrual of a case of action or application
of the delayed discovery rule is generally a question of fact, properly decided
as a matter of law only if the evidence (or, in this case, the allegations in
the complaint and facts properly subject to judicial notice) can support only
one reasonable conclusion.” (Broberg v. The Guardian Life Ins. Co. of
America (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 912, 921.) 
Plaintiff alleged he did not discover
that the deck extended onto the Castlewoods Property until June 2023, when he
removed the overgrown foliage. (Complaint ¶¶ 5-6.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff has alleged belated discovery, and this court cannot, as
a matter of law, determine that Plaintiff’s failure to discover the deck until
that time was unreasonable. 
Defendant
further argues Plaintiff’s causes of action are time-barred because Plaintiff
“admits in his FAC that a portion of the deck was erected sometime between
October 2013 and December 2013.” (Demurrer p. 9.) However, Plaintiff’s first
amended complaint clearly alleges that he believes the deck was constructed
sometime between October 2012 and December 2013 because he reviewed satellite
imagery “after this dispute arose.” (Complaint ¶ 3 [Emphasis added].)
Accordingly, although Plaintiff admits the deck was constructed in 2012 or
2013, Plaintiff does not allege he discovered the deck encroachment in 2012 or
2013. 
Plaintiff filed
his original complaint on February 16, 2024. February 16, 2024, is within three
years from June 2023. (Complaint ¶¶ 6, 18.) Thus, Plaintiff’s causes of action
are not barred by the statute of limitations.

Unclear

Defendant
argues that “[o]nly the causes of action that are based on the alleged deck
expansion in 2023 are not time barred by the three-year statute of limitations”
and because the first amended complaint “fails to distinguish between the
encroachment caused by the original deck versus any encroachment by the
expansion of the original deck” Defendant is left “to guess what part of the
deck is actually at issue in this action.” (Demurrer p. 10.)
 
This
court has found that Plaintiff’s causes of action based on the encroachment of
the original deck are not time barred. Accordingly, Defendant’s argument is
meritless.
 

Sham Pleadings

 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s “attempt to plead around a statute of limitations
problem has caused him to submit sham pleadings.” (Demurrer p. 10.) Defendant
states that in Plaintiff’s original complaint, he alleged that “In or around
October 2023, Plaintiff removed the overgrown foliage to permit the
construction of a new fence between the properties” and discovered the deck.
(Demurrer p. 10.) But in Plaintiff’s first amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges
he discovered the deck in June 2023. (Demurrer p. 10.) Defendant also argues
that the survey attached to Plaintiff’s complaint was dated “August 27, 2022,
almost a year before October 2023, the date [Plaintiff] now says he first
discovered the encroachment by the deck.” (Demurrer p. 10.) Defendant states
that “[t]hese inconsistent and arbitrary dates for discovery of the
encroachment render all of [Plaintiff’s] claims subject to the sham pleading
doctrine.” (Demurrer pp. 10-11.)
 
In
his opposition, Plaintiff states the original complaint’s allegation he
discovered the deck in October 2023 was a “scrivener’s error in the original
complaint and the four months has no bearing on the timeliness of the claims.”
(Opposition p. 8.) Plaintiff also states that the survey attached to the first
amended complaint is dated July 17, 2023, and Defendant’s “argument is based on
his interpretation of the file path at the bottom of the survey, which only
indicates the location of the survey on that user’s computer.” (Opposition p.
7.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant “assumes, with no factual basis whatsoever,
that ‘1_LS_Survey-Projects-08-27-2022’ in the file path location must refer to
the actual date of the survey.” (Opposition p. 8.) Finally, Plaintiff states
that Defendant “completely ignores the fact that the same path includes
07-15-2023 (the indicated date of the field survey was completed) and 7/17/2023
8:11 PM (the date the survey was signed).” (Opposition p. 8.) 
 
“Under
the sham-pleading doctrine, admissions in an original complaint that has been superseded
by an amended pleading remain within the court’s cognizance and the alteration
of such statements by amendment designed to conceal fundamental vulnerabilities
in a plaintiff’s case will not be accepted.” (Lockton v. O’Rourke (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1061.) “[I]f
a party files an amended pleading and attempts to avoid defects of original
complaint by either omitting facts that rendered prior complaint defective or
adding facts inconsistent with prior allegations, [the] court may take judicial
notice of prior pleadings and disregard inconsistent allegations or read into
amended complaint the allegations of the superseded complaint.” (Id.)
 
This
court agrees that whether the deck expansion was discovered in June 2023 or
October 2023 has no bearing on the relevant statute of limitations. Plaintiff’s
original complaint was filed on February 16, 2024, which is within the
three-year of limitations, regardless of whether the time began to accrue in
June 2023 or October 2023. Further, Plaintiff stated that the inconsistent
dates were due to a scrivener’s error. (Opposition p. 8.) This court finds that
Plaintiff’s explanation is persuasive.
 
Further,
Plaintiff’s first amended complaint alleges he commissioned a survey in July
2023. (Complaint ¶ 22.) The survey attached to the first amended complaint is
signed and dated July 17, 2023. (Ex. 1.) Accordingly, Plaintiff alleges the
survey was created in July 2023.  Based
on the face of the pleading, this court finds no basis to conclude the file
name shows the survey was created in August 2022. Moreover, this court agrees
with Plaintiff that any dispute over when this survey was created is better suited
for discovery.
 
VI.          
CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court overrules Defendant’s demurrer.
