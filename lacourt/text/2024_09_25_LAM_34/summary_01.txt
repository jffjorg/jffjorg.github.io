And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motions to compel initial responses to discovery, ordering both plaintiffs to pay sanctions of $910.00 each to the defendant and/or her counsel within 60 days. The defendant had filed eight discovery motions, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, and had served both plaintiffs with notices of non-opposition. The plaintiffs failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant is entitled to orders compelling responses as well as deeming admitted the matters referred to in her requests for admission. The judge has also awarded fees to the defendant's counsel for drafting the motions and preparing the replies, as well as filing fees for each motion.
