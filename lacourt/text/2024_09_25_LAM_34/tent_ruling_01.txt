Background
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiffs
Adelina McCloud (“McCloud”) and Ellina Kelly (“Kelly”) (“Plaintiffs”) filed their
pro per complaint against eleven (11) named defendants, including moving
defendant Denise Hayes Spears, and all persons unknown claiming title to the
property located at 232 West 70th Street in Los Angeles. Plaintiffs asserted
causes of action for wrongful foreclosure, quiet title, fraud, and conversion.
 
On September 25, 2023,
moving defendant Spears (“Defendant”) filed her answer.
 
On August 19, 2024,
Defendant filed eight (8) discovery motions, four directed to McCloud and four
directed to Kelly. Defendant seeks to compel initial responses to her form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of
documents directed to each plaintiff, and for an order deeming admitted the
matters referred to in Defendant’s requests for admission.
 
Neither McCloud nor Kelly
filed a reply. Defendant filed Notices of Non-Opposition as to all eight
motions on September 18, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response .
. . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any
objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)-(b).)  
 
Similarly, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it . . . [t]he party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . .
.   [and] The party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.  (Id., § 2031.300(a)-(b).)  
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response…[t]he party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Id., § 2033.280(a).)  Where a party fails to respond to requests
for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Id.,
§ 2033.280 (b).)  The court
“shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests
for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id., § 2033.280(c).)

further undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant served both plaintiffs by U.S. Mail on August 19,
2024 for a hearing on September 25, 2024. (See 08-19-2024 POSs [x8].) The
deadline for service via U.S. Mail was August 29, 2024. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1005(b) [sixteen court plus five calendar days].) Service was
proper and timely.
 
Given that neither plaintiff filed an opposition, it is
undisputed that Defendant propounded the discovery in question on May 15, 2024,
and that by June 26, 2024, more than thirty days afterward, neither plaintiff
had responded to any set. (08-19-2024 Benbow Decls. [x8], ¶¶ 2-3 and Exh. 1, p.
7 [discovery POSs].)
 
Defendant is entitled to orders compelling responses to her
interrogatories and requests for production and deeming admitted the matters
referred to in her requests for admission.
 
Sanctions
 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under [section 2023.010 et seq.] against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel [initial responses] ... unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300(c) [requests for production]; 2033.280(c) [requests
for admission].)
 
Neither
plaintiff filed an opposition, so neither has shown substantial justification
or other injustice. Defendant is entitled to sanctions.
 
Defendant’s
counsel charges a reasonable hourly rate of $335 hourly. She estimates 0.5
hours spent drafting each motion and 0.5 hours preparing each reply. (Benbow
Decls [x8], ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs filed no opposition, so no reply was necessary.
The Court awards 0.5 for each motion at a $335 hourly rate.
 
Defendant
also incurred filing fees of $60.00 in connection with each motion.
 
The
Court awards 0.5 hours in fees for each motion at a rate of $335 hourly. This
amounts to $670.00 imposed against McCloud and $670.00 imposed against Kelly.
The Court also awards $60.00 in filing fees for each motion, for a total of
$240.00 for each plaintiff.
 
The
Court imposes sanctions on each plaintiff in the total amount of $910.00,
payable to Defendant and/or her counsel within sixty (60) days of this order.
