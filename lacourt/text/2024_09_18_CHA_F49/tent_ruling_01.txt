MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT SIGMA
POOL SERVICE TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET TWO; REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV01298

 
Motion
filed: 8/26/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Isaac Aleman 
RESPONDING PARTY: None 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Defendant Sigma Pool Service to serve full and
complete verified responses to Requests for Production, Set Two, and to impose monetary
sanctions against Defendant and his attorney of record, in the amount of $1,265.98.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained from a motor vehicle collision on August 26, 2021.
 
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff Issac Aleman (“Aleman” or
“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint against Defendants Sigma Pool Service, Carlos
Marvin Loaisiga Blanco (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50,
alleging one causes of action for Negligence/Negligence Per Se. Subsequently,
Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on June 23, 2023.
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production, Set Two (the “Motion”). 
 
On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition to the Motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand may move for an
order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (b).) The party that fails to timely respond waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product, unless the Court, on motion, determines that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) the party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance, and (2) the party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Plaintiff’s counsel
(“Counsel”) attests that on April 15, 2024, Defendant Sigma Pool Service was served
with the second set of Requests for Production via email, to which responses
were due on May 16, 2024. (Thompson Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. “A.”) Having not
received any responses by the due date, Counsel sent a follow up email to Defendants’
counsel on June 26, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4.) On July 23, 2024, Counsel sent
another email to Defendants’ counsel, requesting responses, without objection,
to be provided by August 2, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “C.”)  Despite these efforts, no responses had been
served by Defendant by the time of the filing of the Motion. (Id. ¶ 6.)
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant Sigma Pool Service failed to serve a timely
response to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set Two, thereby waiving any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision
(a).
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“Except as provided in subdivision (d) [inapplicable here],
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust [...]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Additionally, California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A)
further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
Given that the Court has granted the
Motion, it finds that the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, subdivision (c) applicable in this case. 
 
Accordingly, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed
in connection with the Motion to be $978.48, calculated based on a reasonable
hourly rate of $575.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent, in addition to a $115.98
filing fee (Thompson Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Isaac Aleman’s Motion to Compel Responses to Request
for Production, Set Two, is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Sigma
Pool Service is ordered to serve responses, without objection, to Requests for Production,
Set Two, within 20 days.
 
Plaintiff Isaac
Aleman’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Defendant
Sigma Pool Service and
its attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $978.48 to Plaintiff’s
attorney of record within 20 days.
