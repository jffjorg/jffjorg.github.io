Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24CHCV00906
* Hearing Date: September 18, 2024
* Department: F49

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Kenneth M. Stern
* Defendant: Voss, Cook & Thel LLP, James Damon, and Does 1-50

**Background**

* The case arises from an alleged landlord-tenant dispute
* Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants alleging fraud, breach of contract, and declaratory relief

**Tentative Ruling**

* The motion to strike under California's Anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16) is granted as to defendants

**Analysis**

* The court applied a two-pronged approach to evaluate the motion
	1. The first prong requires defendants to show that the allegations arise from protected activity (speech or petitioning)
	2. The second prong requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits

**First Prong**

* Defendants successfully showed that their activities (serving notices to quit) were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute
* Plaintiff's argument that the notices were never served and were not intended for litigation was unsupported by evidence

**Second Prong**

* Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits
* The court found that defendants' evidence showed that litigation was seriously contemplated and only avoided because the plaintiff vacated the premises
* The litigation privilege under California Civil Code section 47(b) applies, barring the plaintiff's complaint

**Conclusion**

* The special motion to strike is granted as to defendants Voss, Cook & Thel LLP and James Damon.

**Significant Statements**

* "The claim that the eviction was 'illegal' ... does not transform these protected activities into something different or independent."
* "To conclude otherwise would effectively shift to the defendant a merits burden statutorily assigned to the plaintiff."
* "Plaintiffs' burden as to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP test is akin to that of a party opposing a motion for summary judgment."
