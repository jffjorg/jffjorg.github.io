 Case Number:  23CHCV01029    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    4/24/24     Case    Name:  K L Ventures Inc., v. L.A.    Hardwood Flooring, Inc. and Does 1-20     Case    # 23CHCV01029      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    APRIL 24,  2024    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER  RESPONSES AND PRODUCTION TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, NO. 22, SET TWO  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV01029    Motion  filed: 2/29/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant L.A. Hardwood Flooring, Inc.  (“LAHD” or “Defendant”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff K L Ventures Inc. (“Plaintiff””) NOTICE: OK.    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses to Defendant’s  Requests for Production, No. 22, Set Two.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is CONTINUED.   BACKGROUND   On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Complaint against  Defendant L.A. Hardwood Flooring Inc. and Does 1-20, alleging the following  causes of action: (1) Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Breach of Implied  Warranty - Merchantability, (3) Breach of Implied Warranty – Fitness of  Purpose, and (4) Fraud. Subsequently, Defendant filed its Answer to the  Complaint on May 16, 2023.   On February 29, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to  Compel Further Responses to Request for Production, No. 22, Set Two (the  “Motion”). Subsequently, on April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Opposition.   No replying papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   A motion to compel further responses to a demand for  inspection or production of documents may be brought based on: (1) incomplete  statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of  inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).)   A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.      45-Day  Rule   “Unless notice of this motion [to compel  further responses to production of documents] is given within 45 days of the  service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on  or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the  responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right  to compel a further response to the demand for productions.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2031.310, subd. (c).)   A court lacks jurisdiction to rule on untimely motions  to compel further responses. (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58  Cal.App.4th 1403, 1408-1410 (Sexton); Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior  Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 683 [The statutory deadline for filing  motions to compel further responses are “mandatory and the court may not  entertain a belated motion to compel.”]   Here, Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Requests  for Production, Set Two, were served via email on January 2, 2024 (Netzah  Decl., ¶ 3), thereby establishing the deadline for Defendant to file a motion  to compel further responses as February 20, 2024, pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedures sections 2031.310 subdivision (a) and 1005 subdivision (b).    Furthermore, Defendant’s counsel attests that on  February 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel granted an extension for Defendant to  file any necessary motions to compel further responses until February 29, 2024.  The instant Motion was filed on February 29, meeting the deadline.   Consequently, the Court concludes that the instant  Motion was filed timely.     2.      Separate  Statement   A motion to compel further responses to  a demand for production must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).) “A separate statement is a separate  document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the  information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the  responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)   Defendant has met the above requirement  by filing a separate statement explaining the demand for production at issue, Plaintiff’s  responses, and why further responses are necessary.   3.      Meet  and Confer   A motion to compel further responses to a demand for  productions must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)              Here, Defendant’s counsel acknowledges that a meet and  confer session did not take place before his filing of the instant Motion.  (Netzah Decl., ¶ 12.) He attests that he sustained a second-degree burn injury  on February 16, 2024, and was in the process of healing during that period. (Id.,  ¶¶ 6-10.) Additionally, Defendant’s counsel attempted to request another  extension from Plaintiff on February 29, 2024; however, his request was denied.  (Id., ¶ 11.)   Plaintiff contends that the Court lacks “jurisdiction”  to decide on the merits of the Motion due to Defendant’s failure to meet and  confer before filing the Motion and to provide a code-compliant declaration,  citing Sexton, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th, at 1410.    The Sexton case considers the statutory  requirement for a 45-day limitation and held that “although the 45-day  limitation is not ‘jurisdictional’ in the fundamental sense, it is  ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the trial court without authority  to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Id., at 1403.)  However, Sexton did not opine that the same determination can be  extended to other requirements such as meet and confer.    As the Court of Appeal pointed out in Sinaiko  Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko), “[a]lthough the ‘meet and confer’ requirement  is an express prerequisite to moving to compel further responses to  interrogatories [Citation], and inspection demands [Citation], no such  requirement appears in the statues permitting sanctions based on a party’s  violation of a court order compelling responses [Citations] or for misuse of  discovery [Citation].”   In line with the observation of the  Sinaiko court, the Court finds that the ruling in Obregon v.  Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424 (Obregon) is directly  relevant to the meet and confer requirement. According to Obregon, an  inadequate effort at informal resolution does not require complete denial of  the requested discovery. (Id., at 433.) The Obregon court stated,  “[N]ot every finding that additional informal resolution efforts are required  can be categorized as a failure so egregious as to justify summary denial of  discovery. Such categorical rulings should be reserved for cases of clear  intent to burden or harass, cases of clear flaunting of statutory  responsibilities, cases of established track records of lack of good faith, and  the like. The range of a judge's discretion is broad, and litigants cannot  always predict exactly where on that broad range a particular judge might  alight in a particular case.” (Id., at 434.)   Based on the aforementioned records, the Court, in its  discretion, determines that Defendant’s failure to fulfill the pre-filing meet  and confer requirement was not motivated by any intent to burden or harass, nor  was it indicative of a lack of good faith. Consequently, in accordance with the  Obregon ruling, the Court concludes that complete denial of the Motion  is not warranted.   Accordingly, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on  Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, No.  22, Set Two, to allow the parties additional time to comply with the meet and  confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision  (c).    CONCLUSION  The  hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for  Productions, No. 22, Set Two is CONTINUED to May 08 , 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  in Department F-49.   Defendant is ordered to file and serve a supplemental meet  and confer declaration that complies with the requirements of Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision (c) prior to the above-set hearing date.   Moving  party to give notice.
