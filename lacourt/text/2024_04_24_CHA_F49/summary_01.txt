Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motion to set aside the Court's Minute Order dated February 8, 2024, which deemed Defendant's Request for Admission, Set One, as admitted. The Order is set aside and vacated. However, the request to vacate the monetary sanction is denied. The Court finds that extrinsic mistake exists and that granting the relief will not cause prejudice or injustice to Defendant. The Court also concludes that the request for admission was not properly served due to errors in email transmission. The Court orders the Plaintiff's attorney to comply with the monetary sanctions imposed by the Order dated February 8, 2024.
