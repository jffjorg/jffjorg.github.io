[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
 
DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL’S MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:             Defendant’s Counsel’s 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       N/A - Unopposed         
Defense Counsel’s Motion To Be Relieved As Counsel 
 
The court considered the moving papers, filed in connection with this
motion.  
 
BACKGROUND 
This action stems from the assignment of the claims sued upon being
assigned to Plaintiff’s assignor a corporation and insurance underwriter who
sues based on a debt of $99,028.24. (Complaint, ¶ 2.) The motion now before the
Court is Defense Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (Motion). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed
order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding,
including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties
who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
Here, Defense counsel has met all the necessary requirements to grant the
Motion. Counsel has filed both forms MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, form
MC-052 denotes all upcoming hearings, including the March 4, 2023 hearing.
Finally, counsel files this Motion because Defendant filed for relief under
Title 11, Chapter 7 of the United States Code.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the court grants Defense counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved As Counsel.   
Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
