And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant's Motion for Relief from Waiver, as Defendant failed to respond to discovery in a timely manner and did not provide substantially compliant responses. The judge also grants Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, as Defendant's objections to the interrogatories are without merit and the information sought is relevant to the claims raised in the action. The judge orders Defendant to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to Plaintiff's Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-5, within 30 days of the date of the order. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as it is procedurally improper.
