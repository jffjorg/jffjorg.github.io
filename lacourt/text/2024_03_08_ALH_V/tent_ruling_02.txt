[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
 
PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL’S MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:             Plaintiff’s Counsel 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       N/A 
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s
Motion To Be Relieved As Counsel 
 
The court considered the moving papers, filed in connection with this
motion.  
 
BACKGROUND 
This case stems from an automobile collision that occurred on March 6,
2023 when Hector Rafael Mejia Garcia1 and Eduardo Alberto Ramirez
(Plaintiffs) were hit by John Doe and Does 1-50. (Complaint, ¶ GN-1.)
Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on March 2, 2023. The Motion now before the Court
is Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.  
LEGAL STANDARD 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed
order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding,
including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties
who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel has met all the necessary requirements to grant
the Motion. Counsel has filed both forms MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, form
MC-052 denotes all upcoming hearings, including the Case Management Conference
on March 12, 2024. Finally, counsel files this Motion under CCP § 284(2),
noting that there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. As Plaintiff’s counsel only files this Motion as to Hector Rafael
Mejia Garcia, all appropriate notice has been given. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s counsel’s Motion to
Be Relieved As Counsel.   
Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
