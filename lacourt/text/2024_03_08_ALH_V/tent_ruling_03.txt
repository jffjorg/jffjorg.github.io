Dismissal Of Plaintiffs’ Complaint

BACKGROUND 
 
This case stems from allegations of a staged motor vehicle collision
involving Hayk Aleksandrovich, Armen Margaryan, and Garik Grigoryan
(Defendants), that occurred on January 22, 2023. (Complaint, ¶ 25.) U-Haul Co.
of California, U-Haul Co. of Arizona, and Arcoa (Plaintiffs) file suit on July
25, 2023 alleging seven causes of action against Defendants.  
On December 21, 2023, the case was dismissed without prejudice after
Plaintiffs failed to appear for a scheduled Case Management Conference (CMC),
Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service of Summons and
Complaint, and Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Lack of Prosecution. 
Plaintiffs filed a Motion To Set Aside And Vacate The Court’s December 21, 2023
Dismissal Of Plaintiffs’ Complaint (Motion). No opposition has been
filed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
CCP Section 473(b) governs motions to vacate based on mistake,
inadvertence, and excusable neglect and provides: “The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (See
CCP Section 473(b).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on July 25, 2023.  On
July 26, 2023, the Court set a hearing on October 3, 2023, for Order to Show
Cause re: Failure to Filed a Proof of Service which was mailed to counsel at
the address provided on the complaint.  Plaintiffs failed to appear at the
October 3, 2023 hearing and the court set a further hearing for December 21,
2023 (Case Management Conference (CMC), Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File
Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint, and Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
for Lack of Prosecution).  Plaintiff failed to appear against on December
21, 2023, and the court accordingly dismissed the case without prejudice. 
Plaintiffs now move to set aside and vacate the court’s order.  In support
of their motion, Plaintiffs provide the Declaration
of Dan A. Everakes (Everakes Decl.) which states that although the notice for
the December 21, 2023 was mailed to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s office, counsel never
“received” the notice and therefore never was able to calendar the notice.
(Everakes Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs argue that the failure to appear was
accordingly due to mistake and inadvertence, which it discovered after
receiving the notice of dismissal. (Everakes Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6.)  
As the court is aware, California has a strong public policy
in favor of deciding cases on the merits, particularly where the opposing party
has suffered no prejudice. (Oliveros¿v. County of Los Angeles¿(2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1389, 1398-1399. Also see CCP § 583.130.) The Court accordingly
grants the Motion.  Plaintiffs’ counsel is advised, however, that failure
to receive notices that are mailed to its address of record will not be
considered adequate justification for failure to appear in this matter in the
future.   
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion To Set Aside
And Vacate The Court’s December 21, 2023 Dismissal of Plaintiffs’
Complaint. 
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
