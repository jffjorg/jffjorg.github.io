Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Nathan Young. The judge grants the demurrer with leave to amend as to the second, third, and fifth causes of action, and denies it as to the fourth cause of action. The second and third causes of action relate to an account stated and open book account, which the judge finds are defective because they do not allege that the parties agreed to treat the money due under the lease as items under an open book account. The fifth cause of action for private nuisance is also defective because it does not allege how Defendant 9 Silver impeded Plaintiffs' right to use and enjoy the property.

The judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleading as to the second and third causes of action, and denies it as to the fourth cause of action for negligence. The judge finds that Defendant Young can be held vicariously liable for the negligent conduct of Defendant 9 Silver, but that the FAC fails to plead facts showing how Defendant 9 Silver impeded Plaintiffs' right to use and enjoy the property.

The judge sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for March 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to give notice of the amended complaint.
