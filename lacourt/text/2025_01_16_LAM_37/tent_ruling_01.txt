Background
 
On January 9, 2024, Daniel and
Elizabeth Rogosin (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against 9 Sliver LLC; Nathan
Young (collectively “Defendants”); and Does 1 to 100. The operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges five causes of action: 
 
1)    
Breach of Contract’
2)    
Account Stated; 
3)    
Open Book Account; 
4)    
Negligence; and 
5)    
Private Nuisance. 
 
On July 17, 2024, the court
granted Defendants’ motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC with leave
to amend. The FAC was not amended. 
 
Defendant Young now demurs to the
FAC. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Untimely
Demurrers May Be Treated as a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
 
Plaintiffs assert the demurrer is
untimely because it was not filed concurrently with the motion to strike. (CCP §
435(b)(3), (d); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) Defendant Young asserts the demurrer is
timely because “[w]hen motion to strike is granted, that starts the clock anew
for when an answer is due” meaning a demurrer can be filed rather than an
answer. (Reply at p. 2: 6-9.) Defendant Young cites no statute of case law to
support his proposition. “If a party serves and files a notice of motion to
strike without demurring to the complaint, the time to answer is extended” but
“[t]he filing of a notice of motion to strike an answer or complaint, or
portion thereof, shall not extend the time within which to demur.” (CCP § 435(c)(d).)

 
The court agrees that the demurrer
is untimely but the court proceeds to treat the untimely demurrer as a motion
for judgment on the pleadings. (CCP § 438; Korchemny v. Piterman (2021)
68 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1054.) 
 
B.        Summary of Allegations
 
The FAC alleges that on or
about January 6, 2022, Plaintiffs entered a residential lease (the “Lease”)
with Defendants for a property located in Los Angeles, CA (the “Property”).
(FAC, ¶ 1, Ex. 1.) Under the Lease, Defendants would rent the Premises until
January 31, 2024, for a rent of $18,000 per month, to be paid on the first day
of each month. (FAC, ¶ 2.) Defendant Nathan Young (“Young”) personally
guaranteed the Lease. (SAC, ¶ 3.) “Defendants have
breached the term of the Lease by failing to pay the monthly rent owed for
October 2023.” (FAC, ¶ 4.)
 
Plaintiffs have
filed an unlawful detainer action (the “UD Action”) (LASC Case No.
23STCV26741). FAC, ¶ 5.) Defendants vacated the Property in
November 2023 without paying the rent due for November 2023. (FAC, ¶ 6.) For
the months of October and November 2023, Plaintiffs are owed a total of $36,000
for past rent due. (FAC, ¶ 6.)  Because
the Lease was due to expire in January 2024 and costs associated with repairs
and legal fees incurred in the UD Action, Defendants owe a total of $117,260
including credit for the security deposit Defendants paid in the sum of
$36,000. (FAC, ¶¶ 7-10, Ex. 2, 3.)  
 
Defendant Young now demurs to
the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action. 
 
C.        2nd and 3rd Causes of Action – Account
Stated and Open Book 
 
“The essential elements of an
account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing
the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a
promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.” (Zinn
v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.) “In California,
it has long been settled the allegation of claims using common counts is good
against special or general demurrers. [Citation.] The only essential
allegations of a common count are ‘(1) the statement of indebtedness in a
certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3)
nonpayment.’ [Citation.]” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 445, 460.)
 
Defendant Young demurs to the
second and third causes of action on the basis that Defendant Young only acted
as guarantor for the breach of payment of the Lease, and for payments due based
on an open book account and account stated. (FAC, Ex. 1 at p. 7 of 8.) While
the FAC alleges that Defendants entered the Lease, the Lease Agreement show
that the Lease was only between Plaintiffs and Defendant 9 Silver LLC, with
Defendant Young acting as guarantor for breach of payments due under the Lease.
(FAC, ¶ 16, Ex.1.) “[J]udicially
noticeable facts may supersede any inconsistent factual allegations contained
in a complaint.” (City of Chula Vista v. County of San
Diego (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1713, 171.) 
 
“An express contract, which
defines the duties and liabilities of the parties, whether it be oral or
written, is not, as a rule, an open account.” (Durkin v. Durkin (1955)
133 Cal.App.2d 283, 290.) “This general rule has been applied in cases where
money is owed pursuant to the terms of an express contract.” (Eloquence
Corporation v. Home Consignment Center (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 655, 665.) An exception
to this rule “may lie where the parties had agreed to treat money due
under an express contract as items under an open book account.” (Ibid.
[italics original].) “As one court put it, under California law, ‘moneys due
under an express contract cannot be recovered in an action on an ‘open book
account’ in the absence of a contrary agreement between the parties.’” (Ibid.
[italics original] citing Armstrong Petroleum Corp. v. Tri-Valley Oil &
Gas Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1396, fn. 9.) 
The FAC fails to plead facts
that show that Defendants agreed to treat the money due under the Lease as
items under an open book account and that Defendant Young agreed to act as
guarantor for the items due in the open book account. 
 
“The law is established in
California that a debt which is predicated upon the breach of the terms of an
express contract cannot be the basis of an account stated.” (Moore v.
Bartholomae Corp. (1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 474, 477.) “[A]n action on an
account stated is not based on the parties’ original transactions, but on the
new contract under which the parties have agreed to the balance due.” (Professional
Collection Consultants v. Lauron (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 958, 968.
 
The court agrees that the FAC
fails to plead facts to show that Defendants entered a new contract that is
separate from the Lease. Moreover, Defendant Young cannot be held liable as
guarantor for an account stated because he is not a party to those transactions
and there are no facts showing he acted as guarantor for those transactions. 
 
The motion for judgment on the
pleading is granted as to the second and third causes of action with leave to
amend. 
 
D.        4th and 5th Causes of Action –
Negligence and Private Nuisance
 
“The elements of a cause of action
for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal duty to use due care;
(b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the proximate or legal
cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917 [internal quotations omitted].) “A duty may arise through
statute, contract, or the relationship of the parties.” (Lichtman v. Siemens
Industry Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 914, 920 [internal quotations and
citations omitted].) The essence of an action for private nuisance is a
substantial, unreasonable interference with the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment
of his property. (See Mendez v. Rancho Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016)
3 Cal.App.5th 248, 262-263.) 
 
Defendant Young demurs to the
fifth and sixth causes of action on the basis that he was not a tenant under
the Lease and cannot be liable for negligence and nuisance. Moreover, Defendant
Young asserts that the Lease granted Defendant 9 Silver the right to use and
enjoy the property and the fifth cause of action is devoid of facts showing how
Defendant 9 Silver impeded Plaintiffs’ right to use and enjoy the property. 
 
While the FAC does not allege that
Defendant Young is the managing member of Defendant 9 Silver, the FAC does
allege that an agency relationship exists between the Defendants. (FAC, ¶ 8.) “[A]
principal who personally engages in no misconduct may be vicariously
liable for an act of malicious prosecution committed by an agent within the
course and scope of the agency.” (Downey Venture v. LMI Ins. Co. (1998)
66 Cal.App.4th 478, 513.) Defendant Young does not challenge that an agency
relationship exists between him and Defendant 9 Silver, thus Defendant Young
can be held vicariously liable for the negligent conduct of its agent, 9 Silver
LLC. 
 
As to the nuisance claim,
Plaintiffs assert that Exhibit 2 lists the obstructions and interference with
the use of the Property, such “as various replacement and construction work to
repair the nuisance caused by Defendants.” (Opposition, at p. 9:8-9.) Exhibit 2
shows an itemization of costs a to how the money from the security deposit was
used to make various repairs. Exhibit 2 does not state how each repair
constituted a nuisance. For example, costs for “Bedroom Door Molding” and “Septic
Plumbing” fail to show how such repair/replacement obstructed or interfered
with the use of the Property and how Defendants caused said obstruction or
interference. 
 
The court denies the motion for
judgment on the pleading as to the fourth cause of action for negligence and grants
the motion as to the fifth cause for private nuisance with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion
for judgment on the pleading is granted with leave to amend as the second,
third, and fifth causes of action and denied as to the fourth cause of action. Plaintiffs
are granted 10 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended
Complaint for March 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
