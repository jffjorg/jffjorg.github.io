Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion to stay and quash deposition notices and subpoenas and for a protective order enforcing the discovery cut-off. The motion to stay and quash all third-party notices of deposition and deposition subpoenas served after the June 26, 2023, discovery cut-off is granted. However, the request for a protective order enforcing the discovery cut-off and request for monetary sanctions is denied.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's motion to compel, finding that the parties had agreed to proceed with depositions after the discovery cut-off and that the plaintiff had failed to meet and confer with the defendants.

The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the parties' agreements and stipulations. The judge's decision is intended to prevent further discovery and to protect the parties' rights.
