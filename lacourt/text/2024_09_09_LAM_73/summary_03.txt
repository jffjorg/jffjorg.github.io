And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, set two, nos. 50, 51, and 57. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant, Catherine Belanger, provide further responses to these requests, but the defendant claimed that her responses were code compliant and that the plaintiff had failed to properly meet and confer.

The judge found that the defendant's responses were code compliant, and therefore denied the plaintiff's motion. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant had served further responses and that the further responses were code compliant.

The case involves allegations of elder financial abuse, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, and the plaintiff is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The case is scheduled for hearing on September 9, 2024, in Department 73 of the Los Angeles Superior Court.
