```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.

The Plaintiff filed a representative action seeking recovery of civil penalties for alleged Labor Code violations. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests, but ultimately produced documents and served objections-free responses.

The Court finds that the motions are now moot, as Defendant has provided responses to the discovery requests. The Court also finds that there is substantial justification for the delayed responses and therefore denies the request for monetary sanctions.

The Judge orders that the motions are denied as moot, and no sanctions are imposed. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
