And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22LBCV00381, denying A1's motion to compel the deposition of Cargomatic's Chairman and CEO, Richard Gerstein. The motion was filed on December 18, 2023, out of an abundance of caution, and a hearing was set for January 16, 2024. Cargomatic filed an untimely opposition on January 8, 2024, proposing alternative dates for Gerstein's deposition. A1 filed a reply on January 10, 2024, stating that Gerstein failed to appear for deposition on January 11, 2024, and is now unavailable to attend due to traveling out of the country. The Judge found that the motion was premature and cannot be granted. However, the Judge noted that A1 served a notice of deposition for January 11, 2024, and also for January 24, 2024, and it appears Gerstein failed to appear on both dates, making it possible that a motion to compel is now ripe. The Judge offers to specially set a hearing date on shortened time if A1 wishes to file a new motion to compel the deposition.
