And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the Court's past six to nine months of experience with a dramatic increase in motions to compel further responses and motions to compel PMK depositions in lemon law cases. The Judge finds that the attorneys for both parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith with each other to resolve the issues in their cases. The Judge has ruled on similar discovery motions in the past and believes that Counsel can easily resolve the issues with the assistance of the Court's prior rulings.

The Judge notes that the parties have another discovery motion scheduled for April 30, 2024, and orders that the hearing on this motion be continued to that date. The Judge expects Counsel to meet and confer with each other, with the Court's prior rulings in mind, and to file a joint statement of items in dispute if they are unable to resolve their issues.

The Judge also orders that the parties file a joint statement concerning the other motion scheduled for April 30, 2024, and that they take the motions off calendar using the online reservation system if they resolve their issues. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file short briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any argument against imposition of sanctions.

The Judge notes that the 3/01/24 FSC and 3/04/24 jury trial are continued to 6/07/24 and 6/10/24, respectively. The Judge orders the plaintiff to give notice and that parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating their intention to submit on the tentative.
