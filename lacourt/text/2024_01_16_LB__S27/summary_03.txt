The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion that was continued and ordered parties to meet and confer to resolve the issues presented. The parties failed to file a joint statement of items in dispute by the revised deadline, but have not taken the motion off calendar. The court assumes that all issues have been resolved and is taking the motion off calendar. A case management conference has been set for March 6, 2024. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must notify the court via email and include the case number and a statement identifying the party submitting. If no parties submit on the tentative, they should appear remotely.
