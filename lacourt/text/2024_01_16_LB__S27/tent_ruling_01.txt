  Case Number:  22LBCV00381    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  S27 A1 moves to compel the deposition of Cargomatic’s Chairman and CEO,
Richard Gerstein.  The parties met and
conferred and ultimately agreed to hold Gerstein’s deposition on 1/11/24.  A1 filed the motion “out of an abundance of
caution” on 12/18/23, setting it for hearing on 1/16/24.
 
Any opposition to the motion was due on or before 1/03/24.  Cargomatic filed untimely opposition on
1/08/24.  In the opposition, Cargomatic
indicates 1/11/24 is no longer an available date, and it has provided
alternative dates.  Specifically, Exhibit
2 to the opposition shows Cargomatic told A1 that 1/24-26, the week of 1/29,
and the week of 2/05 are all available.  
 
A1 filed a reply on 1/10/24.  A1
indicates it noticed Gerstein’s deposition for 1/24/24, but now Gerstein is
going out of the country and unavailable to attend.  A1 therefore contends an order compelling him
to do so is necessary.
 
CCP §2025.450(a) permits a party to move to compel a deposition if a
deponent fails to appear for his noticed deposition.  In this case, A1 filed the motion to compel
BEFORE Gerstein failed to appear.  The motion
was therefore not ripe.  The Court
understands A1’s frustration and reasons for filing the motion, but the Court cannot
grant a prematurely filed motion.
 
The motion is denied.  The Court
notes that trial is scheduled for 3/25/24. 
The Court also notes that A1 DID serve a notice of deposition for 1/11/24
and also for 1/24/24, and it appears Gerstein failed to appear on both
dates.  It is therefore possible (the
Court is not ruling on this issue) that a motion to compel is now ripe.  If A1 wishes to file a motion to compel the
deposition, the Court will specially set a hearing date on shortened time, in light
of the approaching 3/25/24 hearing date. 
  
 
A1 is ordered to give notice.
