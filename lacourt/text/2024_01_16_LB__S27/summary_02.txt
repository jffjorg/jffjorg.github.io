And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Eric Gallegos against the County of Los Angeles, SSA Terminals, LLC, and Francisco Hinojosa. The lawsuit arises from a motor vehicle accident that allegedly caused Gallegos to sustain whiplash injuries. The defendants have moved to compel production of documents, seek an order to show cause (OSC) re: contempt against Gallegos' attorney, and seek imposition of monetary sanctions. The judge has found that the motion is substantively moot, as the defendants have not articulated any documents that remain responsive, non-privileged, and outstanding. The judge has also found that sanctions are justified against Gallegos' attorney, Mendez & Sanchez, for failing to comply with the subpoena and for making a frivolous motion. The judge has imposed sanctions in the amount of $2610, which must be paid within twenty days. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative.
