This is a matter relating to malpractice, fraud, and conversion.  Plaintiff Jose Ronquillo seeks default judgment against Defendants Sidney Sungchul Sohn, Alexander Tsao, and Venerable-Counselors At Law, PC. While Plaintiff requests $5,795,600 in damages, the First Amended Complaint references only $1,000,000 in damages.  This is problematic as “[t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 580.)  Further, phrases such as “in an amount not less than” do not give notice for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 580.  (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174.)    Thus, Plaintiff can either accept $1,000,000 in damages or else amend the First Amended Complaint’s allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening Defendants’ defaults.  (Cole v. Roebling Const. Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 443; Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 24, 27-28.) Further, Plaintiff failed to (1) include Defendants Sidney Sungchul Sohn and Alexander Tsao in the proposed judgment and (2) dismiss the Doe Defendants. For all these reasons, the Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff to give notice.
