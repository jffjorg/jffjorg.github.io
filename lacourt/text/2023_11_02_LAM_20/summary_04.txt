```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the Plaintiff's Default Judgment Application without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Jose Ronquillo, is seeking default judgment against the Defendants, Sidney Sungchul Sohn, Alexander Tsao, and Venerable-Counselors At Law, PC, for alleged malpractice, fraud, and conversion. However, the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint only references $1,000,000 in damages, which is problematic because the relief granted to the Plaintiff cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint. The judge is giving the Plaintiff an option to either accept the $1,000,000 in damages or amend the complaint's allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening the Defendants' defaults. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to include certain Defendants in the proposed judgment and did not dismiss the Doe Defendants. Therefore, the judge is denying the default judgment application and ordering the Plaintiff to give notice.
