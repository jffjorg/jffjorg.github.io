And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion for summary judgment. The court has considered the deposition of Ms. Landers, which was taken on March 21, 2024. The court has also considered the evidentiary objections submitted by the defendants. The court has determined that the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) does not apply to the case, as the plaintiffs' second cause of action is one sounding in general negligence, not medical malpractice. The court has also declined to consider an additional declaration submitted by the plaintiffs, which included excerpts from the deposition of Ms. Frances Ghodsi, as the court had only requested briefing on the deposition of Ms. Landers. The court has continued the hearing to allow the parties to complete Ms. Landers' deposition.
