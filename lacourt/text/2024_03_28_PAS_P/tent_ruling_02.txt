As the hearing on the motion for summary judgment was continued to allow
parties to complete Ms. Landers’ deposition, the Court discusses Ms. Landers’
March 21, 2024 deposition in detail. 


[2]
In considering Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections submitted with their reply,
the Court uses the numbering set forth in the evidentiary objections. 


[3] Defendants also argue that, because this is a case
involving medical negligence, any potential damage award should be capped by
the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA). MICRA limits the
non-economic recovery for medical malpractice in California to $350,000. (CC §
3333.2(b).)  As noted above, however, the
Plaintiffs’ Second Cause of Action is one sounding in general negligence.  Therefore, MICRA does not apply. 
 


[4] Plaintiffs also included an additional declaration by
their attorney, attaching an excerpt of Ms. Frances Ghodsi’s February 6, 2023
deposition which is not already in evidence on the motion. In continuing the
hearing, the Court requested briefing only as to the deposition of Ms. Landers.
Accordingly, the Court declines to consider the Ghodsi deposition excerpts.
