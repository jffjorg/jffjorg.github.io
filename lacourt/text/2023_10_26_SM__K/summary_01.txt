And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the defendant's motion to tax certain costs sought by the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The plaintiff was awarded $210,811 after a jury trial, and the defendant seeks to tax certain costs related to the trial.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to tax the plaintiff's filing fee for opposing continuance, as this fee was reasonable and necessary. The court has granted the defendant's motion to tax the plaintiff's expert witness fee in the amount of $4,375, as this witness was not designated as a retained expert.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to tax the plaintiff's photocopying costs in the amount of $800, as these costs were not reasonably helpful to the jury. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to tax the plaintiff's interpreter fees in the amount of $990, as these fees were not authorized by the court.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for hotel stay costs, finding that these expenses were unnecessary and not authorized under CCP 1033.5(c)(4). The court has therefore granted the defendant's motion to tax these costs in the full amount of $2,808.11.

In total, the court has taxed $8,973 of the plaintiff's costs, leaving a net cost award of $28,121.85.
