SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On January 2,
2024, Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (Plaintiff) served Defendant Tania
Minaskanian (Defendant) with Requests for Admissions, Set One, by mail. Plaintiff
has not received a response to these requests for admissions. On February 22,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to resolve this discovery problem
informally. They requested that Defendant’s responses be received no later than
5 p.m. on Mach 4, 2024. Defendant did not respond to that letter. Plaintiff
filed this motion on March 19, 2024. Plaintiff seeks an order deeming the
Requests for Admissions admitted. No opposition has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
“Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action
admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters
of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”
(CCP § 2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared…” (CCP § 2033.250(a).) 
 
If a party to
whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the
party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based
on privilege or the work product doctrine. (CCP § 2033.280(a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
Defendant has
not served any responses to Plaintiff’s requests for admission. Plaintiff moved
for an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to deem requests for admissions admitted is granted.
