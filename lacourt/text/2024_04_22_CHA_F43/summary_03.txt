And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., served the defendant, Tania Minaskanian, with requests for admissions on January 2, 2024. The defendant failed to respond to the requests, and the plaintiff moved for an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The judge notes that the defendant has not served any responses to the requests and that the plaintiff has not received a response to their informal attempts to resolve the discovery problem. The judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.010, 2033.250(a), 2033.280(a), and 2033.280(b) to support their ruling.
