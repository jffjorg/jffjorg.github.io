Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Category 2 Defendants (Parsoda USA, Inc. dba Pacifica Wholesale Tile and Stone, Lilly Industries, Inc. dba The Slab Studio, and Marbolis, Inc.) in a personal injury action alleging exposure to toxic silica, metals, and other fibrogenic substances. The Court overrules the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment, finding that the Complaint adequately alleges the legal duty to disclose and the concealment of the toxic hazards of the stone products. The Court grants the motion to strike the allegation concerning "other stone products to be identified in discovery" and the request for punitive damages, as the Complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to support these claims. The Court grants leave to amend the Complaint regarding the request for punitive damages.
