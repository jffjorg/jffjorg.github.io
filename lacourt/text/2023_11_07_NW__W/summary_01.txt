And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company and Sunrise Ford to the complaint filed by Jessica Alvarado and Brian Mendes. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim.

The judge agrees with the defendants that the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment fails to state a claim. The complaint does not allege with particularity the defect that was allegedly concealed, and the court finds that the allegations are insufficient to support a fraudulent concealment claim. The judge also finds that the fifth cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule, which prevents a party from recovering in tort for economic losses unless they can establish tortious conduct independent of a breach of contract.

The judge also agrees with the defendants that the sixth cause of action for negligent repair fails to state a claim. The complaint does not adequately allege the essential element of damages, and the court finds that the allegations are insufficient to state a claim.

The judge sustains the demurrer to both the fifth and sixth causes of action with leave to amend. This means that the plaintiffs have the opportunity to revise their complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court.
