And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's decedent, Manuel Villalpando, was employed by German Machine Products (GMP) and was injured and died as a result of an accident at work. The defendant, Yama Seiki USA, Inc., is a manufacturer of industrial machines and argues that the accident was caused by GMP's serious and willful misconduct. The judge found that the defendant failed to meet its initial burden of proof and that the opposition raised issues of disputed material fact. The judge also notes that the defendant's motion is based on conclusory arguments and provides almost no fact-based analysis. As a result, the motion is denied.
