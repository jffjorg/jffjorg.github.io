Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendant, Centinela Valley Union High School District, against Plaintiff, John Doe J.Y. The Plaintiff alleges childhood sexual abuse by the District's former employee, Catherine Schindler, while he was a student in the school district. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the government claims presentation requirement and that the Plaintiff's second cause of action, failure to report child abuse in violation of CANRA, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the District.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff is exempt from the claims presentation requirement under the Government Claims Act due to the alleged childhood sexual abuse. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's arguments are similar to those already decided by the Court in Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) and are not persuasive.

The Judge denies the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings in part and finds it mooted in part due to the Plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of the second cause of action. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice.
