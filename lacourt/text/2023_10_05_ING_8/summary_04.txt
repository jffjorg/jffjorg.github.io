And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The case involves a dispute between Inglewood Church of Christ and Zeeba Vans Company, Inc., dba Zeeba Vans, Kayvon Marashi, and Michael Paletz. The plaintiff alleges causes of action for breach of contract, account stated, and fraud/intentional misrepresentation/deceit. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims fail because the defendants are not parties to the contract and the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support its claims.

The Judge finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails because the defendants are not parties to the contract and the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support its claim. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's account stated claim fails because the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support its claim. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is the account stated claim, with 20 days leave to amend.

The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's fraud/intentional misrepresentation/deceit claim is uncertain and fails to specify which type of fraud is being alleged. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, which is the fraud/intentional misrepresentation/deceit claim, with 20 days leave to amend.

The Judge invites oral argument as to how the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) could be further amended to address the issues raised in the demurrer.
