Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the Graves Amendment. The defendant has shown that it is in the business of renting vehicles, rented a vehicle to Lendowski, and was not negligent. The defendant has also presented evidence that the vehicle was inspected and no defects were found. The plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition, failing to present any triable issues of material fact. Therefore, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment, and the defendant's motion is granted.
