And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for determination of good faith settlement without prejudice. The motion was filed by Carter, who settled with the plaintiff. The Judge applies the factors identified by the California Supreme Court in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates to determine whether the settlement was made in good faith. The settlement must be within the "reasonable range" of the settling tortfeasor's share of liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The Judge concludes that the settlement must be fair and reasonable, and that the defendant's motion is denied.
