The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is continued to allow counsel to file a meet and confer declaration. The moving party has not satisfied the meet and confer requirement, and the court notes that the required declaration is not attached to the motion. The court will continue the hearing on this motion to allow counsel to meet and confer with plaintiff's counsel and file the required declaration. The proposed continuance date is December 27, 2023.
