Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant (CITY OF LOS ANGELES, ENTITY UNKNOWN) is to overrule the demurrer. The judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action for negligence against the defendants, and that the complaint is not uncertain or a sham pleading. The judge also grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of Google Maps photos of the intersection of Allison and Douglas, but notes that the court is not mandated to accept the truth of the judicially noticed document's contents. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and allows the case to proceed to discovery.
