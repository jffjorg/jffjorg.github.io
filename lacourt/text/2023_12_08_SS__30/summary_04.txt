And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action for negligence and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the defendant.

The court found that the plaintiff fails to allege that the defendant had a duty to protect him from the assault, and that the defendant did not have a duty to control the conduct of third parties or warn the plaintiff of potential harm. The court also found that the plaintiff's allegations of negligent hiring, supervision, and retention are insufficient to support a cause of action.

The court has granted the defendant's motion, but has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
