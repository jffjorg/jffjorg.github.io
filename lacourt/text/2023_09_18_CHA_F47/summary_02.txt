And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash the four subpoenas issued by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seeking medical records and information from the Los Angeles City Fire Department, Providence St. Joseph Medical Center, and other parties. The judge finds that the subpoenas are overbroad in terms of time and scope, and that the defendant has failed to establish that the information sought is directly relevant to the issues in the case.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification and did not misuse the discovery process or act in bad faith.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint merely alleges that the plaintiff was seriously injured in an incident, but does not specify which body parts were injured. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to explore injuries to any parts of the plaintiff's body within the last 10 years, but that the subpoenas should be limited to 10 years and exclude mental health records.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to give clear notice of the relief sought, and that the notice of motion incorrectly stated that three subpoenas were at issue when actually four were at issue.
