And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash the four subpoenas issued by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seeking medical records and information from the Los Angeles City Fire Department, Providence St. Joseph Medical Center, and other parties. The judge finds that the subpoenas are overbroad in terms of time and scope, and that the defendant has failed to establish that the information sought is directly relevant to the issues in the case.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification and did not misuse the discovery process or act in bad faith.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint merely alleges that the plaintiff was seriously injured in an incident, but does not specify which body parts were injured. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to explore injuries to any parts of the plaintiff's body within the last 10 years, but that the subpoenas should be limited to 10 years and exclude mental health records.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to give clear notice of the relief sought, and that the notice of motion incorrectly stated that three subpoenas were at issue when actually four were at issue.

**English Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is inclined to grant the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas issued by the Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, because the subpoenas are overly broad in scope and time. The Judge finds that the Defendant has not sufficiently demonstrated the relevance of the information sought, nor has the defendant demonstrated a compelling need for the breadth of discovery requested. The specific injuries claimed by Plaintiff are unclear to the court. However, the Judge is denying the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant because the Judge doesn't believe the Defendant acted in bad faith or misused the discovery process. The Judge also notes the Plaintiff's notice of motion was deficient.

**Summary in English Text:**

The Judge's tentative ruling in case number 22CHCV00910 grants Plaintiff Blanca Fajardo's motion to quash four subpoenas issued by Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The subpoenas sought medical, billing, and radiological records from the LAFD and Providence St. Joseph Medical Center related to an incident where Fajardo claims she was injured due to a bus driver's negligence. The Judge found the subpoenas to be overly broad because neither party clearly identified the specific injuries Fajardo is claiming, making it impossible to determine the relevance of *all* the requested records. While the Defendant offered to limit the subpoenas to 10 years and exclude mental health and STD records, the Judge determined this was still insufficient without knowing the precise injuries. The Judge denied Fajardo's request for sanctions against the Defendant and their counsel, finding they acted with substantial justification. The judge also noted errors in the Plaintiff's notice of motion. The subpoenas are quashed, but the Defendant *may* be able to reissue more narrowly tailored subpoenas if the Plaintiff's injuries are clarified in further discovery.
