SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Hamid Siddiqi’s
(Plaintiff) claim that Defendant Nick Kazemi dba K Construction (Kazemi)
breached a home improvement contract. 
Plaintiff contends that Kazemi agreed to perform construction work
relating to an existing retaining wall and to construct a swimming pool at
Plaintiff’s residence for a total contract price of $200,000.00.  Plaintiff contends that he paid Kazemi
$195,000.00; however, Kazemi demanded an additional $30,000.00 to $40,000.00 to
complete the job.  Plaintiff contends
that when he refused to pay the additional sum, Kazemi abandoned the project.  Defendant Business Alliance Insurance Company
(BAIC) issued a $15,000 contractor’s bond to Kazemi.  Plaintiff is suing BAIC to require it to pay
the bond amount to Plaintiff.    
 
On 5/5/23, Plaintiff served BAIC’s counsel, by email, with Form Interrogatories – Construction Litigation, Set 1;
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, and Requests for Admissions, Set 1.  (See Soffer Decls. and exhibits
attached thereto).  BAIC failed to serve
responses by the 6/6/23 due date. 
(Soffer Decls.).  On 6/7/23,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to BAIC’s counsel regarding the failure to
respond and waiver of objections.  Id.  BAIC’s counsel did not respond to the meet
and confer communication and failed to serve responses, despite Plaintiff
granting an extension to respond until 6/19/23 and inviting BAIC’s counsel to
request a further extension, if needed.  Id.
 
Therefore, on 6/21/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motions seeking: (1) An order compelling BAIC to provide verified
responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories –
Construction Litigation, Set 1, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1,
and produce all documents responsive to the Requests for Production of
Documents.  Additionally, Plaintiff
requests an order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,216.65
against BAIC; and (2) An order deeming admitted the truth of matters specified
in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set 1, propounded on BAIC and imposing
monetary sanctions in the amount of $941.65 against BAIC.  BAIC has not opposed or otherwise responded
to the motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to BAIC’s failure to provide timely responses to the
subject Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling responses without objections.  CCP 2030.290(a), (b); CCP 2031.300(a),
(b).  
 
Similarly, due to BAIC’s failure to provide responses to
the subject Requests for Admissions, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming
the matters admitted.  CCP
2033.280(a)-(c).    
 
The Court also finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an
award of sanctions against BAIC on each motion for its failure to properly
respond to the subject discovery requests. 
CCP 2030.290(c); CCP 2031.300(c); CCP 2033.280(b), (c); CCP 2023.030(a);
CCP 2023.010(d).  
 
The Court awards Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of
$1,216.65 for the motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and
Requests for Production of Documents based on 2.1 hours of attorney time spent
preparing the motion at $550/hour plus the $61.65 filing fee.  (Soffer Decl. ¶8).
 
The Court awards Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of
$941.65 for the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted based on 1.6
hours of attorney spent preparing the motion at $550/hour plus the $61.65
filing fee.  (Soffer Decl. ¶8).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. 
Responses, without objections, to the Form Interrogatories and Requests
for Production of Documents are due within 30 days.  The Requests for Admissions are deemed
admitted.  Sanctions are payable within
30 days.
 
The Court notes that in the future, separate motions with
separate reservations must be made for each discovery vehicle at issue.  In other words, the motion to compel should
have been two  separate motions with two separate
reservations.  Additionally, the Court
notes that Plaintiff failed to electronically bookmark the motion to deem
Requests for Admissions admitted as required. 
See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  In
the future, failure to comply with these requirements may result in matters
being placed off calendar or continued for re-submission and/or the imposition
of sanctions.
