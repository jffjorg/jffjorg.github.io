And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and deem Requests for Admissions admitted. The plaintiff is entitled to verified responses, without objections, to the Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, as well as an award of sanctions against the defendant for its failure to properly respond to the discovery requests. The court also awards the plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $1,216.65 for the motion to compel responses and $941.65 for the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted. The defendant is ordered to provide responses, without objections, to the discovery requests within 30 days and to pay the sanctions within 30 days. The court notes that future motions should be separate and have separate reservations for each discovery vehicle at issue, and that failure to comply with these requirements may result in matters being placed off calendar or continued for re-submission and/or the imposition of sanctions.
