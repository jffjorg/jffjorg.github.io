## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Hamid Siddiqi, in his dispute with Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC). BAIC, which issued a bond to Kazemi, a contractor who allegedly breached a contract with Siddiqi, failed to respond to Siddiqi's discovery requests. The judge found this lack of cooperation unacceptable and granted Siddiqi's motions to compel responses and deem certain admissions. BAIC was also ordered to pay sanctions to Siddiqi for their failure to comply with discovery rules.  


The judge also noted that in the future, Siddiqi should file separate motions for each type of discovery request and ensure proper electronic formatting.

Here's the summary in English text:

The judge has granted two motions filed by the plaintiff, Hamid Siddiqi, against the defendant, Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC). The plaintiff is suing BAIC to require it to pay the bond amount of $15,000.00, as the contractor, Nick Kazemi, who was insured by BAIC, abandoned the project after receiving $195,000.00 from the plaintiff for a home improvement contract worth $200,000.00.

BAIC failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, despite being given an extension. The plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling BAIC to provide verified responses without objections. The court has awarded sanctions against BAIC in the amount of $1,216.65 for the motion to compel responses and $941.65 for the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted.

The court notes that BAIC's failure to respond to discovery requests was unreasonable and that the plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. The court has granted the motions, and BAIC must provide responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The Requests for Admissions are deemed admitted, and BAIC must pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to electronically bookmark the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted as required and that in the future, separate motions with separate reservations must be made for each discovery vehicle at issue. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in matters being placed off calendar or continued for re-submission and/or the imposition of sanctions.
