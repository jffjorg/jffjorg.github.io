## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Hamid Siddiqi, in his dispute with Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC). BAIC, which issued a bond to Kazemi, a contractor who allegedly breached a contract with Siddiqi, failed to respond to Siddiqi's discovery requests. The judge found this lack of cooperation unacceptable and granted Siddiqi's motions to compel responses and deem certain admissions. BAIC was also ordered to pay sanctions to Siddiqi for their failure to comply with discovery rules.  


The judge also noted that in the future, Siddiqi should file separate motions for each type of discovery request and ensure proper electronic formatting.

Here's the summary in English text:

The judge has granted two motions filed by the plaintiff, Hamid Siddiqi, against the defendant, Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC). The plaintiff is suing BAIC to require it to pay the bond amount of $15,000.00, as the contractor, Nick Kazemi, who was insured by BAIC, abandoned the project after receiving $195,000.00 from the plaintiff for a home improvement contract worth $200,000.00.

BAIC failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, despite being given an extension. The plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling BAIC to provide verified responses without objections. The court has awarded sanctions against BAIC in the amount of $1,216.65 for the motion to compel responses and $941.65 for the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted.

The court notes that BAIC's failure to respond to discovery requests was unreasonable and that the plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. The court has granted the motions, and BAIC must provide responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The Requests for Admissions are deemed admitted, and BAIC must pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to electronically bookmark the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted as required and that in the future, separate motions with separate reservations must be made for each discovery vehicle at issue. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in matters being placed off calendar or continued for re-submission and/or the imposition of sanctions.

**Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The judge is granting the plaintiff Hamid Siddiqi's motions to compel Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC) to provide verified responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and to deem the requests for admissions admitted. This is due to BAIC's failure to respond to the discovery requests in a timely manner. The judge is also awarding sanctions against BAIC in the amount of $1,216.65 for the motion to compel and $941.65 for the motion to deem admitted, to be paid within 30 days.

The ruling stems from a case where Siddiqi claims Kazemi breached a home improvement contract, and Siddiqi is suing BAIC to recover the amount of Kazemi's contractor bond. The Judge also noted the Plaintiff should file separate motions for separate discovery requests and electronically bookmark the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted.

English Text Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Hamid Siddiqi's motions against Defendant Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC).  BAIC failed to respond to Siddiqi's discovery requests (interrogatories, document requests, and requests for admissions) related to a construction dispute involving a contractor, Nick Kazemi, who allegedly breached a contract with Siddiqi.  Because BAIC did not respond, the judge ordered BAIC to provide full responses to the interrogatories and document requests within 30 days, without objections.  Furthermore, the judge ruled that the requests for admissions are deemed admitted.  The judge also imposed monetary sanctions against BAIC, totaling $2158.30 ($1216.65 + $941.65), payable within 30 days. The sanctions are for BAIC's failure to respond to the discovery requests. The judge also provided instructions for future filings, noting that separate motions should be filed for each type of discovery request and that electronic bookmarking is required.
