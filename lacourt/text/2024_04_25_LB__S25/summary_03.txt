And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is issued in the case of Rossylyn Inez Sanchez vs. Christopher Michael Moehl. The plaintiff, Rossylyn Inez Sanchez, was injured in an automobile accident on October 7, 2021, and filed a complaint against the defendant, Christopher Michael Moehl, and others. The defendant served form interrogatories on November 20, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. The defendant then requested further responses, which the plaintiff eventually provided, but with objections. The defendant filed a motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories, which the plaintiff opposed. The court finds that the plaintiff waived any objections by failing to timely respond to the form interrogatories. The court orders the plaintiff to serve amended responses, without objection, within 10 days of this ruling. Additionally, the court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,985.00 to the defendant, as the prevailing party.
