Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Miguel Gonzalez's Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint against Defendants Nicholas Tran and Cuong Tran. The proposed cross-complaint arises from the same August 31, 2021, motor vehicle accident that forms the basis of Plaintiff's complaint. Defendant Gonzalez's counsel states that the cross-complaint was delayed due to "mistake" and subsequent delay in seeking leave. The judge finds that there is no evidence of bad faith by the moving party for a short delay in filing the cross-complaint, and therefore grants the motion.
