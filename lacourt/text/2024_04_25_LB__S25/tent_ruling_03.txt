 Case Number:  23LBCV01778    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  S25 MOTION: DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL MOEHL’S MOTION TO COMPEL VERIFIED RESPONSES AND FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONSMoving Party: Defendant Christopher Michael MoehlOpposing Party: Plaintiff Rossylyn Inez SanchezTentative Ruling: Plaintiff is ordered to serve amended responses, without objection, to Form Interrogatories 2.5, 2.6, 6.5 and 17.1, within 10 days of this ruling. Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) Sanctions in the amount of $2,985 are awarded to Defendants. Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290(c).Procedural BackgroundPlaintiff Rossylyn Inez Sanchez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Melton Truck Lines, Inc., Christopher Michael Moehl, and Does 1 to 50, (“Defendants”), for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence for an automobile accident that occurred on October 7, 2021. Plaintiff filed the complaint on September 21, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants negligently owned, entrusted, and operated a motor vehicle, resulting in injury to the plaintiff. Furthermore, Plaintiff claims that Defendants negligently hired, trained, and supervised their agents or employees, which contributed to the injuries sustained by Plaintiff.On November 20, 2023, Defendant Moehl service Form Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiff. The responses were due on or before December 22, 2023, however, Defendant Moehl granted Plaintiff an extension to January 3, 2024. When no response was received, defense counsel emailed a meet and confer letter requesting a conference within seven days and verified responses without objections on or before January 23, 2024. No response was received by defense counsel.On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff served unverified responses with multiple objections to the request. Subsequently, on February 13, 2024, defense counsel sent opposing counselanother meet and confer letter concerning the “deficient” discovery responses. Plaintiff’s counsel requested to respond by March 5, 2024, to reply. Defense counsel allegedly did not respond to the request until after the February 22, 2024, case management conference. On that day, presumably as a trial date of September 16, 2024, was then set, Defense counsel requested further responses be served by February 27, 2024. As Plaintiff’s counsel assumed her prior proposed deadline of March 5, 2024, was previously acceptable to defense, she requested an extension to March 5. However, in light of the Sept 16 trial date, defense counsel requested further responses by February 27 or indicated motions to compel would be filed.On February 28, 2024, Defendants filed this instance motion. Plaintiff served additional responses on March 8, 2024. On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition this motion. On April 18, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. Notably, Defendants also filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) but withdrew the motion once further responses were received.AnalysisA party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)FORM INTERROGATORIES 2.5, 2.6 AND 6.5. Defendant requests further responses, without objection, to Form Interrogatory Nos. 2.5, 2.6, 6.5, and 17.1. Defendant does not dispute that request for further responses to FROGS nos. 2.5, 2.6, and 6.5 are moot given Plaintiff’s supplemental responses. The Court, however, agrees that Plaintiff waived objections by failing to timely respond by the January 3, 2024, deadline, which the Court notes was an extension of time to respond. Thus, Plaintiff is ordered to served amended responses, without objection, within 10 days of this Order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)FORM INTERROGATORY 17.1. The Court finds that Plaintiff fails to justify her objections and show the adequacy of the responses. The information sought is relevant to this case and that the provided responses are insufficient because they lack specific details required tosubstantiate the claims made. Specifically, Plaintiff has not provided the necessary contact information for herself as a self-employed individual, nor has she specified the medical providers involved by name and address, which are critical for verifying the claims related to medical treatments and their impact on her ability to work. Furthermore, the references to medical records appear to be vague and lack the specificity needed to assess the claims of lost wages and future earning capacity effectively. For cases involving compensation for injuries, the type of information is relevant and important to the evaluation of Plaintiff’s claims. As the Plaintiff failed to timely respond by January 3, the Court finds Plaintiff waived objections pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a). Thus, Plaintiff is ordered to amend her response, without objection, within 10 days of this Order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)SanctionsCode of Civil Procedure § 2030.290(c) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”As previously set forth by this Court, defense counsel made multiple attempts to informally resolve these discovery disputes. Although Plaintiff eventually provided additional responses as requested by Defendants in March 2024, several responses remained inadequate, and the Court was required to intervene.As the prevailing party, Defendant is entitled to sanctions. Defendant counsel’s declaration sets forth the basis of an award of $2,985.00, which the court finds reasonable considering the level of effort made by defense counsel to obtain the required discovery.
