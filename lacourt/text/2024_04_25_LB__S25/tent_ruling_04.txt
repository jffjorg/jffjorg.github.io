 Case Number:  24LBUD00684    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  S25 Motion: (1) Demurrer to Complaint for Unlawful Detainer              (2) Motion to StrikeMoving Party: Defendant Martin RochaResponding Party: Plaintiff Teresa RodriguezTENTATIVE RULING: Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED and Defendant's Motion to Strike is DENIED.Procedural Background:This is an unlawful detainer action. On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Rodriguez filed a complaint against Defendant Rocha for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff Rodriguez alleges as follows. Starting in January 1997, Rocha rented a residential property in Wilmington as a month-to-month tenancy. On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff Rodriguez served a three-day notice to quit on Defendant Rocha. Plaintiff Rodriguez alleges Defendant Rocha subsequently failed to comply with the notice. On April 3, 2024, Defendant Rocha filed the present demurrer and motion to strike.Analysis:A party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)Defendant Rocha contends the Complaint is insufficiently pled for the following reasons: (1) the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action; (2) the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Civil Code section 430.10(a), (3) the complaint the vague, uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible.The Court finds that Plaintiff’s complaint adequately alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer. The complaint is on the approved Judicial Council form and identities the pertinent information to support an unlawful detainer claim. The required supporting documentation in support of Plaintiff’s claim is also attached.Defendant Rocha suggestion the Court lack subject matter jurisdiction is without support. The property at issue is located within the City of Los Angeles as the City of Wilmington, as indicated on the complaint, is a neighborhood within the County of Los Angeles and City of Los Angeles. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (g). “[f]acts and propositions that are of such common knowledge within the territorial jurisdiction of the court that they cannot reasonably be the subject of dispute.”)Further, whether Plaintiff Rodriguez failed to serve proper notices of AB1482 exemption is a question of fact to be litigated at a later stage of the case and is not proper grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike.The Complaint alleges this action is solely for the nonpayment of rent. (Complaint, ¶ 6(f)(2).) However, in the attached notice to quit, Plaintiff states the lease is forfeited due to Defendant Rocha’s allegedly inappropriate conduct and behavior. (Complaint, Ex. 2.) In opposition, Plaintiff admits this cause of action “is not based on non-payment of rent” and concedes the incorrect box was checked on the Complaint. (Opp., p. 2:26-3:5.) Plaintiff argues the supporting exhibits to the complaint, e.g. the notice to quit, provides Defendant Rocha with enough information as to overcome Defendant Rocha’s contention that the complaint is vague.The Court takes all properly pled facts as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. (Coleman v. Medtronic, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 413, 422, 167 Cal.Rptr.3d 300; Berg & Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Boyle (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1034, 100 Cal.Rptr.3d 875.) Inconsistent allegations in amended complaints are disregarded unless the inconsistency is explained. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Internat., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 239.) Exhibits attached to the complaint take precedence to the extent they contradict allegations in the complaint. (Ibid.) Bank of New York Mellon v. Citibank, N.A., 8 Cal. App. 5th 935, 943, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 504, 510 (2017), as modified (Mar. 1, 2017). This is instance, the inconsistency has been explained as a mistake with the notice to quit providing the Defendant Rocha with sufficient information to respond to Plaintiff’s claim.Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED and the Motion to Strike is DENIED.Defendant Rocha to answer within 10 days. Plaintiff to give notice.
