And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The Judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike. The Judge finds that the complaint adequately alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer and that the court has subject matter jurisdiction. The Judge also finds that the complaint is not vague and uncertain. The Judge notes that the Defendant's contention that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction is without support and that whether the Plaintiff failed to serve proper notices of AB1482 exemption is a question of fact to be litigated at a later stage of the case. The Judge also notes that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer and that the supporting exhibits to the complaint provide sufficient information to overcome the Defendant's contention that the complaint is vague.
