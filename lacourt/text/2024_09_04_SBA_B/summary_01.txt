  - "The court's first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable." (Nelson v. Anderson)
  - "It is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable. Rather the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable." (Seever v. Copley Press, Inc.)

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to tax costs is GRANTED. The motion is to strike Item 16 (Other) in the amount of $3875 for mediation fees from the plaintiff's memorandum of costs. The Judge found that the mediation costs were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation because the mediation was held before the complaint was filed, and the Judge concluded that the mediation was not court-ordered. The Judge ruled that the mediation was merely convenient and/or beneficial to the preparation of litigation, and therefore, the costs are not recoverable.
