Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vivian Lissett Gonzalez v. Leah Harris Komar, et al. (Case No. 22STCV28036). Plaintiff Gonzalez has filed a motion for sanctions against defendants Komar and others for their failure to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions ordered by the court. The court has found that defendants have violated the court's order and have not served their discovery responses. However, the court has declined to impose issue, evidence, and terminating sanctions, finding that such sanctions would be unduly harsh and punitive. Instead, the court has granted plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500, payable by defense counsel. The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer about payment of sanctions.
