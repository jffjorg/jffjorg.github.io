CASE:                         Frank Perez v. Carparts.com, Inc.
 
CASE NO.:                 21STCV12551
 





















 
MOTION
TO BIFURCATE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Carparts.com, Inc. 
                                                
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Frank
Perez
 
 
            On March 13, 2023, Defendant Carparts.com, Inc. filed this
motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trial.  Trial in
this matter is currently scheduled for August 5, 2024.  
 
            Defendant
properly sought a bifurcation (or severance) order in advance of the trial
date.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., § 598 [court to issue order bifurcating
case on noticed motion by the pretrial conference or, absent a pretrial
conference, no later than 30 days in advance of trial].)¿ A trial court may
also “on its own motion . . . make such an order at any time.”¿ (Id.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            However,
given that in the Personal Injury (PI) Court system this case will be tried by
a different court than the Court ruling on this motion, the Court finds it
appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted.¿
In the PI Court system, the trial court rules on motions in limine, even those
that significantly affect trial preparation.¿ While this bifurcation request is
not a motion in limine, the logic of having the trial judge determine it here
is similar. The request for bifurcation here appears to be one for which the
trial judge should make a discretionary determination based on its
experience.¿¿ 
¿ 
            As such,
Defendant’s motion to bifurcate is denied without prejudice to allow Defendant
to raise this issue for the trial judge to consider at the time that the judge
rules upon motions in limine.¿ The Court recognizes that California Rules of
Court, rule 3.57, subdivision (c) states, “A motion in limine may not be used
for the purpose of seeking an order to try an issue before the trial of another
issue or issues,” and thus this order should not be construed in a way that
contradicts this rule.¿ Defendant may direct the trial court to this order,
which should not be construed to in any way bind the trial court in making a
bifurcation decision on its own motion.¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is denied without prejudice.¿ Trial is scheduled for August 5,
2024.¿ If and/or when the case proceeds to trial, the bifurcation briefing
should be included in the trial binders in Tab B along with any motions in
limine filed at that time.¿ 
¿ 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
