This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian regarding a motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trial in the case of Frank Perez v. Carparts.com, Inc. (Case No. 21STCV12551). The defendant, Carparts.com, Inc., filed the motion on March 13, 2023, and the trial is currently scheduled for August 5, 2024. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning the defendant can still raise the issue at the trial. The judge found that it is appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, rather than the judge making the decision. The judge also noted that this ruling should not be construed as contradictory to California Rules of Court, rule 3.57, subdivision (c), which states that a motion in limine may not be used to seek an order to try an issue before the trial of another issue or issues.
