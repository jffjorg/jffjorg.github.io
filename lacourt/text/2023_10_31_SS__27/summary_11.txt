```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to discovery and imposes sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $1,285. The court finds that the plaintiff's responses to the special interrogatories were incomplete and evasive, and that the defendant's objections were not baseless. The court also finds that the plaintiff's counsel did not meet their burden to show that they did not counsel the discovery abuse, and therefore imposes sanctions against them. The court orders the plaintiff to provide further responses to the at-issue special interrogatories and to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
