MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
City of Los Angeles 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 3, 2021, Plaintiff Ronnie Palache filed this
action against Defendant City of Los Angeles for injuries arising from an
alleged trip and fall on an uneven sidewalk. 
Plaintiff is self-represented.   
 
            On December
1, 2022, Defendant filed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories
and Special Interrogatories.  The Court granted the motions on
December 30, 2022.          
            
            On January
12, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s response to Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents.¿ The Court granted the motion on May
16, 2023.  Defendant filed a proof of
service showing Plaintiff was served with notice of the ruling on May 18, 2023.
 
            To date,
Plaintiff has not provided responses to the foregoing discovery requests.
 
             On October 3, 2023, Defendant filed this motion
for imposition of terminating sanctions. 

            
            The motion
is unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030
gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process.¿ Misuse of the discovery process includes
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court
order to provide discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),
(g).)¿ A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the
party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)¿ A violation of a discovery order is sufficient
for the imposition of terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating sanctions are
appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s orders.¿ (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)¿¿¿ 
The court should consider the totality
of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a
greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a
lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the
ultimate sanction.”  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)
        
Before any sanctions may be imposed
the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of
the party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court
for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of
diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had
the ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)¿ 
A terminating sanction is a
“drastic measure which should be employed with caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not
be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history
of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction
against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his
discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are
not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair
disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of
information.¿ (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64
[superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229
Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            As the
Court stated in Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 795-796,
“[t]erminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying
the court’s orders.”¿ Terminating sanctions are appropriate here for that very
reason.¿ Plaintiff did not provide Defendant with his discovery responses, disobeyed
Court Orders compelling him to provide discovery responses, and has failed to
file an opposition to this motion.
 
            The Court
finds Plaintiff knew of his discovery obligations and knew of the Court Orders
compelling his compliance.¿ The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to provide initial
discovery responses was willful as was his disobedience to the Court’s Orders. 
Given Plaintiff’s apparent disinterest in prosecuting this action, the Court
finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.¿ 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            
            Based on
the foregoing, the unopposed motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Ronnie Palache’s Complaint against
Defendant City of Los Angeles is dismissed with prejudice. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
