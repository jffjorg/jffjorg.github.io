Significant Statements:
- "Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders."
- "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution'."
- "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is an unopposed motion for terminating sanctions filed by the City of Los Angeles against Ronnie Palache, the plaintiff. The motion is based on Palache's failure to provide discovery responses, disobeying court orders, and failing to file an opposition to the motion. The court finds that Palache's failure was willful and disobedient, and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. Therefore, the court grants the motion and dismisses Palache's complaint with prejudice.
