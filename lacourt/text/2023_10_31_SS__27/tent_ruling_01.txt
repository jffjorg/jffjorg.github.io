DEMURRER



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Judith Swank
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Stephen
Harris
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff Stephen Harris filed his
Complaint against Defendant Jack Swank for damages arising from an automobile
accident.  Mr. Swank (“Decedent”) later
passed away.  On October 20, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a Creditor’s Claim.  After
the claim was rejected, Plaintiff brought a motion to substitute Judith
Lorraine Swank (“Ms. Swank”) as the personal representative of Decedent.  On August 29, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to substitute.  Accordingly,
it was ordered that Ms. Swank be substituted as a party defendant in place of
Decedent; Plaintiff was ordered to serve Ms. Swank with an amended complaint
within 20 days of the ruling.  
            
            This case
was originally assigned to the Honorable Michelle C. Kim in Department 31 of
the Personal Injury Hub Courts.  On
October 3, 2023, Defendant filed a preemptory challenge to Judge Kim.  The challenge was granted and thereafter,
this action was transferred to Department 27. 
            
            On October
5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
            Relevant
Background to the Demurrer
 
            On September
15, 2023, Ms. Swank filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  
            
            On September
25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amended Complaint” asserting a single cause of
action for Negligence.  The “Amended
Complaint” is deemed “Received” in the Court’s electronic case file.  The proof of service attached to the filing
shows Plaintiff was personally served with the “Amended Complaint” on September
18, 2023.
 
            On September
29, 2023, Swank filed this Amended Demurrer to the “Amended Complaint”.  
 
            On October
5, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amended Complaint (1st)” which appears as “Filed”
and “Granted” in the Court’s electronic case file. 
 
            On October
18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to the Demurrer.
 
            On October
24, 2023, Swank filed a Reply.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
At the outset, the Court notes there is a lack of clarity as
to the pleading at issue.  Plaintiff has
filed at least three complaints.  (See
10/19/18 Complaint; 9/25/23 “Amended Complaint”; 10/5/23 “Amended Complaint
(1st)”.)  Nor is it clear whether the
September 25, 2023 “Amended Complaint” is valid given that it appears as
“Received” and not “Filed” in the electronic case file.  Furthermore, a review of the September 25,
2023 “Amended Complaint” and the October 5, 2023 “Amended Complaint (1st)” reveal
differences in the respective pleadings. 
The Court will hear from the parties on these issues.
 
Notwithstanding the lack of clarity, the Court observes the
amended complaints each appear to name Ms. Swank in her individual capacity
rather than the representative of Decedent. 
This very issue forms one of four arguments Ms. Swank raises in support
of her Demurrer.  For this reason, the
Court considers the merits of the Demurrer. 

 
The Court first
considers whether the “amended complaints” name Ms. Swank in her individual or
representative capacity..  Ms. Swank
argues Plaintiff was not given leave to serve and file an amended complaint
naming Ms. Swank as a defendant in her individual capacity.  Ms. Swank is correct.  Plaintiff’s motion to substitute parties
sought an order to substitute Ms. Swank as the personal representative of
Decedent.  Missing from the September 25,
2023 pleading and the October 18, 2023 pleading are any allegations making that
very distinction.  The Demurrer has
merit.  Accordingly, the Demurrer should
be sustained.
 
Ms. Swank also
offers three additional arguments in support of her Demurrer.  She argues (1) the Court erred in granting
Plaintiff’s motion to substitute parties, (2) the Court lacks authority to add
parties three years after case is filed, and (3) Plaintiff’s motion to
substitute parties was untimely.  These
arguments fail.  Each argument was addressed
in and considered in the August 29, 2023 ruling.  At bottom, Ms. Swank takes issue with that
ruling.  As such, Ms. Swank should have
filed a motion for reconsideration but did not avail herself of that option.  The time has passed for reconsideration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Nor is this Court the proper court to
reconsider the August 29, 2023 order made by Judge Kim.  (Id.)
    
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Court is inclined to sustain the
demurrer with leave to amend.  However,
given the lack of clarity regarding the pleadings at issue, the Court will hear
from the parties.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
