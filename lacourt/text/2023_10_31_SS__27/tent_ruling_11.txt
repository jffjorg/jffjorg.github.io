RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Maritza
Ramirez
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On April 12, 2023, Defendant City of Los Angeles, filed this
motion to compel Plaintiff, Maritza Ramirez, to provide further responses to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One.  Defendant
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel. Plaintiff filed a request to
continue the hearing on May 4, 2023, to allow the parties to participate in an
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  Defendant
filed a reply on May 10, 2023.  The Court
granted Plaintiff’s request.
 
The parties participated in an IDC on August 7, 2023.  Plaintiff represented to the Court that her
supplemental responses to the Defendant’s discovery would be produced by August
21, 2023.  Pursuant to oral stipulation,
the Court continued the IDC to September 5, 2023.  The Court directed the parties to meet and
confer within 5 days after supplemental discovery is produced and to
electronically file a Joint Report Re: Status Discovery five court days prior
to the September 5, 2023 IDC.  
 
On August 29, 2023, the parties filed a Joint Report
indicating that Plaintiff had served supplemental responses which Defendant
still found to be deficient.
 
On September 5, 2023, the parties participated in another IDC.  The issues were not resolved.  The Court directed the parties to meet and
confer regarding discovery responses. 
Defendant was directed to file a Notice of Outcome within 5 days following
the meet and confer.
 
On October 13, 2023, Defendant filed a supplemental brief
and separate statement.  Defendant explains
that Plaintiff served Second Supplemental Responses on September 7, 2023 and Third
Supplemental Responses on September 28, 2023. 
After reviewing those responses, Defendant has determined the following:
 
·        
Defendant is satisfied with revised
responses to and withdraws its motion regarding Interrogatories Nos. 8, 10, 11,
12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 35, 36, 43, 44, 45, 58, and 60.
·        
Interrogatories Nos. 9, 14, 15, 18,
21, 25, 28, 31, 37, 39, 41, 51, 53, 56, and 59 remain deficient.
·        
Responses to Interrogatories Nos.
17, 22, 23, 38, 40, 42, 47, 49, 52, 54, 55, 61, 62, 63, and 64 were not
supplemented in the Second or Third Supplemental Responses and remain at issue.
 
            Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition.[1]  
 
            The Court
rules as follows.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, parties may
move for a further response to interrogatories or where a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete, a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or where an objection is without merit or
too general.  
 
Notice of the motions must be given within 45 days of
service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.
(c).)  The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)   
 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all
motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement
with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and
legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345, subd. (a)(3).)¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions¿ 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿ 
 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿
The court in Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58
Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings) noted that discovery sanctions against an
attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against a party:¿
 
By
the terms of the statute, a trial court under section 2023.030(a) may not
impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless the court finds
that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct resulting in
sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against
a party, which are based on the party’s misuse of the discovery process,
monetary sanctions against the party’s attorney require a finding the ‘attorney
advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney’s
actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181
Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an attorney’s
advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,” the attorney
has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an attorney offers
sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the burden shifts to
the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend that conduct. (Id.
at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d
501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
moves for an order compelling a further response to Special Interrogatories Nos.
9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 47, 49, 51, 52,
53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 61, 62, 63, and 64.  
 
Legal Principles
 
Section 2030.220(a) requires responses to each interrogatory
“to the extent possible” which are “as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available” to the responding party.¿ Section 2030.220
(c) states:¿ If the responding party does not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but
shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by
inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information
is equally available to the propounding party.¿¿ “The responding party must
make a reasonable effort to obtain wherever information is sought; and if
unable to do so, must specify why the information is unavailable and what
efforts the responding party made to obtain it.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782; Weil & Brown, Cal. Civ. Proc. Before Trial
(The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:1061.)¿¿ Based on these principles, the Court rules

Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and her
counsel.  Given that the Court has
granted this motion, sanctions are warranted. 
Pursuant to Hennings, supra, imposition of monetary
sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel shows that he or she
did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p.
81.)¿¿ Plaintiff’s counsel does not meet their burden.¿¿ 
¿
Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and her
counsel in the amount of $1,285 which represents 5 hours at defense counsel’s
hourly rate and $60 in filing fees.¿¿¿ 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion is granted. 
Plaintiff Maritza Ramirez is ordered to provide further responses to the
at-issue Special Interrogatories.  
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff and
her counsel are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, sanctions in the sum of
$1,285 to Defendant, by and through its counsel.
 


 
            Discovery
responses are to be provided and sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the
date of this order.
 
            Moving
