And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Daryl J. Williams, counsel for Plaintiff Annabella Rodriguez. The motion was filed due to the client's lack of cooperation and unreasonable settlement demands. Despite several meetings and attempts to resolve the issues, the client refused to sign a voluntary consent to substitute attorney. The judge notes that the motion complies with the requirements of California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 and that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.
