Before making the required findings on the record and ruling on the
motion, the Court would be interested in hearing from Petitioner how it
determined to use a discount rate of 10.17%, what discount rate it (or its
competitors) have used in similar cases, and whether it would negotiate further
with Transferor to increase the amount paid to Transferor by lowering the
discount rate and paying Transferor the $1,500 Petitioner is saving by Transferor
not hiring an attorney.

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“‘Structured settlement agreement’ means an
arrangement for periodic payment of damages established by settlement or
judgment in resolution of a tort claim in which the payment of the judgment or
award is paid in whole, or in part, in periodic tax-free payments rather than a
lump-sum payment. A structured settlement agreement entered into pursuant to
Section 667.7 of the Code of Civil Procedure or Section 970.6 or 984 of the
Government Code is not subject to the provisions of this article other than the
requirements of Section 10138.” (Ins. Code, § 10134, subd. (j).)
 
        Transfers
of structured settlement payment rights are regulated by statute. (Ins. Code,
§§ 10134, et seq.)
 
“A transfer of structured settlement
payment rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and
finds the following conditions are met:
 
“(a) The transfer of the structured settlement
payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee,
taking into account the welfare and support of his or her dependents.
 
“(b) The transfer complies with the requirements of
this article, will not contravene other applicable law, and the court has
reviewed and approved the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5.”
 
(Ins. Code, § 10137.)
 
“The court shall
retain continuing jurisdiction to interpret and monitor the implementation and
closing of the transaction that is the subject of the transfer agreement as
justice requires.” (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (i).)
 
        Additional
statutory requirements can be found in Insurance Code sections 10136 through
10139.5.
 
II.       Discussion
 
Transferor wants to transfer the
following structured settlement payment to Petitioner: $565,849.20, which is
comprised of thirty-six monthly payments, beginning on January 17, 2033 and
ending on December 17, 2035. (Amended Exhibit A, p. 3.) 
 
        Petitioner
has proposed a total payment to Transferor of $210,000.00. (Amended Exhibit A,
p. 9.)
 
        Using
a federal discount rate of 5.20%, the discounted present value of the future
payment is $336,492.21. (Amended Exhibit A, p. 9.) The rate used in determining
the purchase price is 10.17%. (Ibid.)
 
        According
to the Declaration of Transferor, Transferor is an unmarried 26-year-old adult
with no children and no court-ordered child support obligation. (Amended Decl.
¶ 8.) Transferor has previously completed other transfers and has previously
attempted still other transfers that were denied, dismissed, or withdrawn. (Id.
at ¶¶ 9–10.) Transferor is planning to use a portion of the structured
settlement to venture into an investment opportunity with real property in
Detroit, Michigan. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Transferor did not receive independent
legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. (Id. at ¶
12.)
 
        Pursuant
to Insurance Code section 10137, subdivision (b), the Court first considers
whether all of the procedural requirements for such a transfer have been met.
 
(1)       Transferor received and
signed a disclosure form that meets the specifications of Insurance Code
section 10136, subdivision (b).
 
(2)       The transfer agreement
meets the specifications of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c).
 
(3)      
None
of the prohibited provisions listed in Insurance Code section 10138,
subdivision (a) are included in the transfer agreement.
 
(4)      
The
requirements of Insurance Code section 10139.3 have been followed.
 
(5)      
The
Petition includes the information required by Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subd. (c).
 
(6)       Petitioner has advised
Transferor in the manner required by Insurance Code section 10139.5, subd. (h).
 
The Petition complies with the procedural requirements of the law.
However, given that Transferor did not receive independent legal or
financial advice regarding the proposed transaction, the Court is concerned whether the transfer
of payment rights is in Payee’s best interest. (See Ins. Code, §§ 10137, subd.
(a); 10139.5, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
The Court is unaware of any evidence that Transferor actually
negotiated the 10.17% discount rate. The Court wonders if Petitioner would have
increased the payout to Transferor if Transferor had been represented by
counsel in these negotiations?
 
Further, the Court wonders whether Petitioner would increase the
payout to payee by the $1,500.00 that it is saving because payee has decided
not to retain counsel?  
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
Before making the required findings on the record and ruling on the
motion, the Court would be interested in hearing from Petitioner how it
determined to use a discount rate of 10.17%, what discount rate it (or its
competitors) have used in similar cases, and whether it would negotiate further
with Transferor to increase the amount paid to Transferor by lowering the
discount rate and paying Transferor the $1,500 Petitioner is saving by Transferor
not hiring an attorney.
