And here is the English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the Defendants' demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint, finding that the complaint does not state a cause of action for legal malpractice. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant's attorney failed to contact her and provided ineffective assistance of counsel, but the judge found that the complaint is uncertain and unclear. The judge granted the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to clarify the allegations and provide sufficient evidence of causation.
