The Judge's Tentative Ruling is as follows:

The Court is considering the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Joshua Maria (Transferor) to J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner). The Petitioner proposes to pay $210,000.00 for the transfer of payment rights worth $565,849.20. The Court is concerned whether the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee. The Court notes that the Transferor did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. The Court is interested in hearing from Petitioner how it determined to use a discount rate of 10.17% and whether it would negotiate further with Transferor to increase the amount paid to Transferor by lowering the discount rate and paying Transferor the $1,500.00 that Petitioner is saving because Transferor did not hire an attorney.
