ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“The attorney in an action or special
proceeding may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final
determination, as follows: 1. Upon the consent of both client and attorney,
filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes; 2. Upon the order of the
court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one
to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284.)
 
An attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following
forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2)
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3)
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the aforementioned forms on the client and
all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's
declaration must show that the client's address was confirmed within the last
30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.) 

 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for
withdrawal should be granted.  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
I.         
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel complies with all of the
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel
provided notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel; proposed order
granting attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel; and declaration in
support of the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
The declaration only states that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel have
irreconcilable differences. (MC-052, Item 2.) The motion states that the
specific facts are confidential and required to be kept confidential. (MC-051,
Item 3.)
 
There is a significant risk of prejudice to Plaintiff by the proposed
withdrawal. Aside from narrow exceptions such as in small claims court, the
California Supreme Court has long held that corporations cannot represent
themselves in propria persona. (Merco Constr.
Eng’rs, Inc. v. Mun. Ct. (1978) 21 Cal.3d.724, 730.)
 
        However, trial is scheduled for nine
months from now. Plaintiff has ample time to find new counsel if it wishes to
continue prosecuting this matter. 
 
II.       Conclusion
 
The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
