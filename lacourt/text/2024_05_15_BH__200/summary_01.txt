```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for entry of judgment in favor of Owner against Prime. The judge found that the issue of apportionment of responsibility by and among the parties will have to be decided at a trial. The judge noted that the settlement between Owner and Plaintiff was reasonable under the circumstances and that Prime's insurer had denied coverage. The judge also found that Prime's claim that it should have obtained the consent of its insurer was unrealistic given the insurer's denial of coverage. The judge declined Prime's request to order the case into mediation and instead ordered the case to proceed to trial. The judge concluded that the case is complex and that the issue of liability will have to be decided at trial.
