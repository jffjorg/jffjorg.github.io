[1] Though the Court is now made aware of the separate
litigation between Owner and Prime’s insurer concerning coverage, LASC Case No.
23STCV13426, the parties did not advise the undersigned of that litigation
before or during trial, notwithstanding the issues the Court addressed
concerning indemnity before trial, nor file a Notice of Related Case. That
action apparently remains pending. Prime had agreed with Owner to provide
insurance for Owner.
