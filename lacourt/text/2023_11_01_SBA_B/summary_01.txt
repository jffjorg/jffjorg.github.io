And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions before the court. The plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents is denied because the deposition subpoenas were never served on the non-party entities. The non-party entities have a right to privacy and the private financial information sought is not relevant to the litigation.

The non-party John Munn's motions to quash deposition subpoenas are granted because the deposition subpoenas are facially defective and the private financial information sought is not relevant to the litigation.

The motion to be relieved as counsel is granted because the attorney has shown valid reasons for withdrawal and has followed the proper procedures.

The court orders that the non-party John Munn give notice of the court's ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents and the non-party John Munn's motions to quash deposition subpoenas. The court also orders that counsel give notice of the court's ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel.
