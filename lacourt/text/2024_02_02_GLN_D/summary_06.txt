The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Afenger v. General Motors LLC, stating that the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant are taken off calendar as moot. This is because the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on January 9, 2024, before the deadline for opposing the demurrer and motion to strike. The judge reminds the parties of their obligations to meet and confer in connection with any further challenge to the amended pleading, and to set up remote appearances through LACourtConnect if they wish to appear in court. The case is set for a future hearing, but the date is not specified.
