Significant Statements:
  - "When the Court is faced with a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, the Court will usually order that the Plaintiff and Defendant provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side..." (Manno Decl., para. 15, Ex. 6, p. 5)
  - "The court has reviewed the file in this matter and notes that the parties have entered into a Stipulation and Protective Orderâ€”Confidential Designation Only, which was signed and filed as an order of the court on July 24, 2023. The document production is subject to an already existing protective order, and this argument is simply a waste of time."
