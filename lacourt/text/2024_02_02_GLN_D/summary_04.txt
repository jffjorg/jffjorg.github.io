Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by defendants NRG Clean Power, Inc. and American Contractors Indemnity Company. The motion was filed in response to plaintiff Jack Sarkisian's complaint alleging breach of contract and fraud against NRG. The court finds that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists between plaintiff and NRG, and therefore grants the motion as brought by NRG. However, the court denies the motion as brought by American Contractors Indemnity Company, as there is no showing that this party is a party to a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy.

The court orders plaintiff and NRG to arbitrate this matter according to the agreement to arbitrate included in the Terms and Conditions of the Home Improvement Contract between them. The court also orders the action to be stayed in its entirety pending the outcome of the arbitration.
