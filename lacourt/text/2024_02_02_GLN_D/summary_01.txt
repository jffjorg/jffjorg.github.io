Summary:
The plaintiff, Sally Jace, is seeking a trial preference due to her memory loss resulting from four strokes in 2013. The plaintiff argues that she will not be able to effectively testify at trial if it is delayed, and that granting a preference will serve the interests of justice. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that memory loss is not a sufficient basis for a trial preference and that the plaintiff has not submitted sufficient medical evidence to support her claim.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference, finding that the interests of justice will not be served by granting a preference. The trial date of December 24, 2024 will remain unchanged, and the parties are cautioned that the court will consider this trial date firm.
