Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights, pending answers to several questions. The court is concerned about the lack of a copy of the underlying Settlement Agreement and will inquire about the reason for the previous completed transfer and what was done with the funds. The court will also inquire about the effectiveness of the non-assignment clause in the annuity contract and how the address of the annuity holder was confirmed. The court notes that the petition does not include a copy of the Settlement Agreement and that the annuity documentation specifies a "Designated Office for Communication" in Dresher, Pennsylvania, but the proof of service shows service on Prudential Insurance at an address in Reading, Pennsylvania. The court will discuss this issue at the hearing.
