[2] Petitioner
Clapp requests that the court take judicial notice of the Judgment from California
DUI Lawyers Assn. v. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles, (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 517, 532 (RJN, Ex. A). There is no need to judicially notice
governing case law.


[3] Clapp
alternatively seeks a writ of prohibition. 
A writ of prohibition arrests the proceedings of any tribunal,
corporation, board, or person exercising judicial functions, when such
proceedings are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal,
corporation, board, or person.  CCP
§1102.  A writ of prohibition is a narrow
writ intended to restrain judicial actions in excess of jurisdiction.  Prohibition is a writ to restrain judicial
actions in excess of jurisdiction. 
Code Civ. Proc. §1102.   It does not lie to restrain the acts of an
arbitrator.  International Film
Investors v. Arbitration Tribunal of Directors Guild of America, Inc.,
(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 699, 704.  Also, a
writ of prohibition lies only to “preventively preempt jurisdictional defects
or errors”.  Saunders v. Superior
Court, (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 11 (trial court had
jurisdiction to decide whether cell phone records seized pursuant to search
warrant were subject to public access). 
Prohibition will not lie to set aside a final decision.  Clapp concedes as much.  See Pet. Op. Br. at 4.


[4] Section
23152(b) creates a rebuttable presumption of driving under the influence when
it is established that the chemical test was performed within three hours of
driving.  Burge v. Department of Motor
Vehicles, (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 384. 
The Legislature, “recognizing in fact that [chemical] tests taken within
three hours after driving accurately reflect blood-alcohol concentration during
driving, determined that independent proof of this fact need not be
offered.”  Id. at 391.  The rebuttable presumption applies until
evidence sufficient to negate the presumption is presented, at which time the
presumption “disappears”.  Coffey v.
Shiomoto, (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1198, 1210.  This means that the presumption applies
unless the driver presents evidence which, if believed, would support a finding of the nonexistence of the
presumed fact.  Id. at 1210.   


[5] The DMV enacted new regulations, effective
July 1, 2024, defining a “Hearing Officer” as follows:  “The hearing officer or hearing board is not
an advocate for the Department but is a neutral decision-maker and determines
whether a license or privilege should be issued, renewed, denied, revoked, or
suspended under the applicable statutes and regulations. (2) The hearing
officer may investigate, gather evidence, and subpoena witnesses as necessary
to make an accurate determination and obtain complete information regarding the
case.”  13 CCR §115.01(b).
 


[6] In Sims v. Apfel, (2000) 530
U.S. 103, 110-11, one of the cases relied upon by Today’s Fresh Start,
supra, 57 Cal.4th at 220), the United States Supreme Court explained in
social security proceedings the hearing officer has a “duty to investigate the
facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits….”  The DMV has no such objective investigative
duty for an APS hearing.
