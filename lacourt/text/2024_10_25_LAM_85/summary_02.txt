Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a request from Petitioner Clapp for judicial notice of the Judgment from California DUI Lawyers Assn v. California Department of Motor Vehicles (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 517. The Judge finds that there is no need to take judicial notice of the governing case law.

The Judge also considers Clapp's alternative request for a writ of prohibition, which would restrain the DMV from enforcing its new regulations defining a "Hearing Officer". The Judge finds that a writ of prohibition lies only to preventively preempt jurisdictional defects or errors, and that it does not lie to set aside a final decision.

The Judge notes that the DMV's new regulations define a "Hearing Officer" as a neutral decision-maker who determines whether a license or privilege should be issued, renewed, denied, revoked, or suspended under the applicable statutes and regulations. The Judge also notes that the rebuttable presumption of driving under the influence created by Section 23152(b) of the Vehicle Code applies until evidence sufficient to negate the presumption is presented.

The Judge concludes that the DMV's new regulations are valid and that the Hearing Officer has a neutral role in determining whether a license or privilege should be issued, renewed, denied, revoked, or suspended.
