 Case Number:  21STCV17384    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  F49 SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Darrin Privett, M.D.
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Ronald Nevarez, et al.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Summary Judgment on the First Amended
Complaint for Wrongful Death and Negligence
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On December 26, 2018, 68 year-old Sylvia Nevarez
presented to the emergency room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital with
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Sylvia also indicated “chest discomfort” three
weeks earlier. After an examination and tests, Hospital offered admission, but
Sylvia elected to leave and return home. 

 
Sometime after discharge, the cardiology tests were
apparently reviewed. Sylvia was apparently still on the premises however, and
placed in the “cardiac catheritization lab” by cardiologist James Lee. Sylvia
subsequently became unresponsive, and was not successful resuscitated that
evening. Plaintiffs contend the death was the result of the delayed diagnosis
and treatment.
 
On May 10, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for
Negligence. On March 2, 2022, Plaintiffs dismissed James Lee, M.D. On October
3, 2022, the parties stipulated to the filing of a first amended complaint. On
October 31, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint for Wrongful
Death and Negligence. On February 28, 2022, the court overruled the demurrer of
Darrin Privett, M.D. 
 
On April 7, 2023, the case was transferred from
Department 27 (Personal Injury) to Department 49. On October 2, 2023, the court
granted the motion of Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. The court entered
judgment in favor of Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital on October 24, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Darrin Privett, M.D. moves for summary judgment
on grounds that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.
Plaintiffs in opposition challenges any bar under the statute of limitations.
Privett in reply reiterates the bar under the statute of limitations, the lack
of any triable issues raised in opposition, and failure to address the the
three year statute of limitations argument. Privett also disregards the
arguments regarding the standard of care as not pertinent to determining any
statute of limitations bar. 
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.” (Lyons v.
Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation
omitted).)
 
Statute of Limitations
Privett contends the complaint is barred by the one-year statute of
limitations. Sylvia passed away on December 26, 2018, and the complaint was not
filed until May 10, 2021. Privett specifically challenges the delay between the
death and second review by Dr. Eckstein “nearly two years” after the death.
Plaintiffs were aware of the identity of Privett from the produced medical
records. Deposition testimony from widower, Ronald Nevarez, admitted suspicion no
later than March 2019, following a review of the produced medical records. 
 
Even if the complaint is valid under the one year statute of limitations,
Privett alternatively argues for a bar under the three year statute of
limitations. Plaintiffs may not allege any delayed discovery under this
standard. The notice of intent to sue letter was not served on Privett until
March 9, 2022—more than three months following the three year statute of
limitations on December 26, 2021. 
 
Plaintiffs in opposition contend that the identity of Privett was unclear
given multiple doctors involvement, thereby constituting a valid basis of
“ignorance” as to potential malpractice. It was not until December 12, 2020, when a
second review of the autopsy report was completed that Plaintiffs confirmed
medical malpractice. Plaintiffs offer no opposition to the March 9, 2022 timing
of the notice of intent to sue as to Privett.
 
Generally, a statute of limitations begins to run “when the cause of
action is complete with all of its elements”—namely, wrongdoing, causation, and
resulting harm. (Norgart v. Upjohn Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397; Pooshs v.
Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 788, 797 [“A cause of action
accrues ‘when [it] is complete with all of its elements’—those elements being
wrongdoing, harm, and causation”].) An exception to the general rule on accrual
is identified as the “discovery rule.” (Norgart
v. Upjohn Co., supra, 21 Cal.4th
at p. 397; Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA,
Inc., supra, 51 Cal.4th at p.
797.) “Under the discovery
rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or
should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done
something wrong to her [him].” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110 (“Jolly”).)
 
Plaintiffs
maintain the “confusion” in the medical records caused by “errors found in the
medical records” added to the delayed discovery. Plaintiffs also emphasize the
declaration of Marc Eckstein, M.D., who reviewed the January 17, 2019, autopsy
report on December 12, 2020, and concluded the delayed diagnosis and treatment
caused the death. [First Amend. Comp., ¶ 15.] The court assumes the subject
allegation effectively constitutes the pled accrual date for realization of
medical malpractice. Again, service of the notice of intent to sue remains
undisputed as March 9, 2022, with the complaint previously filed on May 10,
2021. Plaintiffs lack any argument regarding relation back to the complaint
upon the discovery of facts regarding Dr. Privett, well after the December 12,
2020 review of the records by Dr. Eckstein.
 
The court
considers the challenged factual basis of accrual presented as either around the
January 17, 2019, autopsy report, which overlaps with the January 2019 time period
presented in the deposition of Ronald Nevarez, or the moment of the second
review and report completed by Dr. Eckstein in December 2020. “Possession of ‘presumptive’
as well as ‘actual’ knowledge will commence the running of the statute. The
applicable principle has been expressed as follows: ‘when the plaintiff has
notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation . . . the statute
commences to run.’ (Citation.) This “inquiry” rule has been previously applied
in the area of medical malpractice. (Citations.)” (Sanchez v. South Hoover
Hospital (1976) 18 Cal.3d 93, 101; see Gutierrez
v. Mofid (1985) 39 Cal.3d 896-899.) The Jolly case clarified the standard
as a matter of factual suspicion triggering the requirement to proceed with
investigation, rather than wait for conclusive facts to appear. (Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at pp. 1110-1111; Kleefeld v. Superior Court
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1683-1684.) “[I]t is the discovery of facts, not
their legal significance, that starts the statute.” (Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1113.)
 
The
standard specifically rejects categorical certainty as a basis of accrual.
Plaintiffs’ argument in opposition regarding Plaintiffs’ unawareness and
confusion as to the responsible treating physician and therefore implicit lack
of exact understanding of the cause of Sylvias death until the Dr. Eckstein
report in no way establishes a delayed accrual of the statute of limitations. A
standard requiring medically verified understanding was specifically overruled.
(Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1110-1111; Knowles v. Superior Court
(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1300.)
 
A more
recent case relied upon by Plaintiff further clarifies the distinctions
triggering suspicion based on the definition of “injury” in Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.5. “In an action for injury or death against a health
care provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the
time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of
injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of
reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs
first.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) “The word ‘injury’ for purposes of section
340.5 is a term of art that “refer[s] to the damaging effect of the alleged
wrongful act and not to the act itself.” (Brewer
v. Remington (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 14, 24.)
Under this standard, the death of Sylvia constituted injury itself. The death
occurred while at the hospital and under the treatment of Privett, and
therefore any claimed manifestation of harm was concurrent. (Id. at pp.
28-31.) 


The
standard still requires awareness of the potential cause for harm. (Id. at pp.
26-27.) In deposition, Ronald Nevarez admits to requesting medical records in
January 2019, and disappointment with the quality of care the date after
Christmas. [Declaration Marissa Feinstein, Ex. G: Deposition of Ronald Nevarez,
28:15-30:24.] Ronald admitted that upon learning of Sylvia’s death, to
suspecting wrongdoing. Ronald ordered the autopsy upon the advice of others,
who also told him to consult a lawyer. The time frame was within a one-and-one
half month time frame from the date of death. [Id., 31:3-24-32:18.]
Ronald also testifies to the opinions of his children regarding noted
deficiencies upon reviewing the medical records. [38:2-40:25.] Plaintiff
subsequently contacted a lawyer in March 2019. [41:9-23.] The children confirm
this account, including review of records, recommendation for an attorney
consultation, and the autopsy. [Feinstein Decl., Ex. H: Deposition of Ronnie
Nevarez, 12:10-13:25.]
 
“While
resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,
where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of
only one legitimate inference, summary judgment is proper.” (Jolly, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1112.) The time frame of the review of the
medical records, ordered autopsy, and consultation with counsel occurred no
later than March 2019. The section 364 letter to Privett went out on March 9,
2022, and Privett was not substituted into the actin until June 13, 2022—
96 days
later. [Feinstein Decl., Ex. C, D.] 
 
The court
finds the complaint against Dr. Privett is barred by the one year statute of
limitations. Plaintiffs were aware of facts supporting a potential negligence
claim, admitted to suspicion, and even consulted an attorney in March 2019. The
approximate three year delay from the time of the first attorney consultation
and service of the intent to sue letter in no way renders the action subject to
the three year statute of limitations. (Brewer
v. Remington, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th
24.) The plain language of the statute requires the determination of the
statute of limitations on the earlier of the two items—one year upon the
discovery of facts, or no more than three years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.)
 
The motion for summary judgment is
granted.
