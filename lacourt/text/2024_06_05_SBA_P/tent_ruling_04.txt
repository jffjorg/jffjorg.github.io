 Case Number:  24TRCV00019    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  P Motion: Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s ComplaintRULING:The Court considered the moving papers. After review, the Court rules that Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety. Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend.BACKGROUNDOn January 3, 2024, Plaintiff Shannon Neighbors (“Plaintiff”) filed a form Complaint for general negligence and premises liability against Defendant T.J. Maxx of CA, LLC (erroneously sued as The TJX Companies, Inc.) alleging that on March 4, 2022, she was at TJ Maxx/HomeGoods in Westchester when she was hit by a chair that was falling over. (Complaint, p.4.)On April 23, 2024, Defendant filed the demurrer without strike.As of June 3, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.DISCUSSIONMeet and Confer“Before filing a demurrer…the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a); see also CCP § 435.5 (imposing similar requirements for a motion to strike).)On April 18, 2024, I spoke with attorney Avi Muhtar to meet and confer regarding this demurrer. We were unable to reach an agreement. (Thompson Decl. ¶ 4.) Therefore, the requirement is satisfied.DemurrerA. Legal Standard“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)The question of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations is of no concern at the pleadings stage. (See Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp., (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214. [“It is not the ordinary function of a demurrer to test the truth of the plaintiff's allegations or the accuracy with which he describes the defendant's conduct.”])AnalysisDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s first (general negligence) and second (premises liability) causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e).) Defendant also argues that the first (general negligence) and second (premises liability) causes of action are uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(f).)In this case, Plaintiff’s form complaint alleges two, seemingly identical, causes of action. Both allege one key fact: “Plaintiff was hit by a chair that was falling over.” This fact is insufficient to put Defendant on notice as to the factual basis for their culpability.In addition, the complaint also alleges a “willful failure to warn” as required by Civil Code section 846. However, no allegation of recreational activity is alleged.CONCLUSIONAccordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety. Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend.Defendant is ordered to give notice of ruling.
