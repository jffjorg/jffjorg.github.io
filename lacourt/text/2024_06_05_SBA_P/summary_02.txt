Here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel a neuropsychological examination of the plaintiff and denies the request for sanctions. The defendant sought an order compelling the plaintiff's appearance at an independent medical examination within 30 days of the hearing. The defendant also sought $608.00 in sanctions for bringing this motion. The judge finds that the defendant failed to provide the required information for the examination, including the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty of the person who will perform the examination. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to establish good cause for the examination and failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel.
