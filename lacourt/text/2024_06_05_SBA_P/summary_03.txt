And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action in the second amended complaint. The court finds that the second cause of action for breach of oral contract is insufficiently alleged because it does not allege a breach of the oral agreement. The court also finds that the third cause of action for breach of written contract is insufficiently alleged because it does not allege that the defendant failed to comply with the arbitration clause. The court sustains the demurrer and gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
