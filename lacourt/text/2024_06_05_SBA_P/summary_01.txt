English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to quash the deposition notices for David and Jason Craik. The defendants argued that the Craiks are "apex" officers who do not possess unique or superior knowledge of the case. The plaintiffs argued that the Craiks have knowledge of material issues and that the defendants failed to inform them of certain adverse health events. However, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the Craiks had direct personal factual information pertaining to material issues in the action. The court also found that the plaintiffs waived the argument that the information they seek is not available by less intrusive means. The court granted the defendants' motion based on their uncontested contention that there are less intrusive means of discovery.
