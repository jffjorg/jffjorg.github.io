And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling granted the defendant's motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $25,158.35. The defendant incurred these fees and costs in connection with the successful anti-SLAPP motion and the instant motion for attorney fees and costs. The court found that the fees and costs were reasonable and did not include excessive time billed or duplicative entries. The court also denied the defendant's request for an additional $2,975 in attorney fees that she anticipated incurring in connection with the reply brief and hearing on the fees motion.
