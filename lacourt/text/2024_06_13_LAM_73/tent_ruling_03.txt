REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 5/31/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 14,
2024, Plaintiff R2 Westlake Development, LLC filed the instant action against Defendant
Andy Gumaer. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiff alleges it is the owner
of the residential real property which is located at 1698 Miller Ranch Drive,
Thousand Oaks, California 91362 (the "Subject Property"). On and
about December 7,2 023, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written purchase
agreement (the "Agreement") whereby Defendant agreed to purchase from
Plaintiff for the sum of $5,950,000.00 the Subject Property, with the closing
of escrow to occur fourteen (14) days from acceptance of the offer. After
entering into the Agreement, Defendant failed to pay the deposit due and owing
despite being notified by Plaintiff that the payment had to be made and demand
being made for said deposit. On or about December 14 and 15,2023, as required
by the parties' Agreement, Plaintiff served Defendant with a Notice to Buyer to
Perform No. 1 that required Defendant to deposit the initial deposit
($178,500.00) within two (2) days after delivery of the notice. Defendant
failed to cure or perform under the Notice to Buyer to Perform No. 1. Plaintiff
sold the Subject Property for less than Defendant was to pay. As a direct and
proximate result of the breach of the Agreement by Defendant, Plaintiff has
been damaged in the amount of $178,500.00. The
Complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of contract.
 
On June 6, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.  
 
On
May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request for Default Judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendant
in the total amount of $184,759.20, consisting of the amount demanded in the
complaint of $178,500.00, and $6,259.50 in interest.

Problems: Plaintiff has
not stated that it knows Defendant is not in the U.S. military service. Note
that Plaintiff also did not schedule an OSC re default hearing, Plaintiff
scheduled a CMC hearing for 06/13/24. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff submitted its JC Form CIV-100. However, Plaintiff failed to sufficiently
fill out item number eight of the form pertaining to the declaration of non-military
status. 
 
A
declaration of non-military status is required to obtain a judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(5);
Interinsurance Exchange v. Collins (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1445, 1447.) The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil
Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. Appen. §§ 501–591) requires: “In any action or
proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of any
appearance by the defendant, the plaintiff, before entering judgment shall
file in the court an affidavit setting forth facts showing that the defendant
is not in military service.... If an affidavit is not filed showing that the
defendant is not in the military service, no judgment shall be entered without
first securing an order of court directing such entry.... Whenever ... facts
may be ... established ... by ... declaration, ... the filing of such ...
declaration ... shall satisfy the requirement ... that facts be established by
affidavit.” (50 U.S.C. Appen. § 520(1).)
 
Here, Plaintiff checked subsection (f) of item number eight
of the form, stating “I do not have the date of birth or social security number of the
defendant so I cannot access http://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/.” (Plaintiff’s
Request for Entry of Default, p. 3.) Thus, Plaintiff has not sufficiently
filled out item number eight because Plaintiff does not state that Defendant is
not in the U.S. military service. Since Defendant’s military status is unknown,
the Court finds default judgment cannot be entered. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
