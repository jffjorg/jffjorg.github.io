Demurrer AND MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF
tHE complaint (filed 04/26/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Demurrer
and Motion to Strike is CONTINUED to July 12, 2024. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 26,
2024, Plaintiffs Chelsea Spagnola and Michael Spagnola filed this action
against Defendants Ford Motor Company and Autonation Ford Valencia. 
 
This consumer
warranty case arises in connection with a 2002 Ford Explorer (the “Subject
Vehicle”) that Plaintiff allegedly purchased from Defendant in July 2022. (Compl.,
¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant concealed a known engine and transmission
defects that caused various problems, including delayed acceleration, harsh
shifting, and jerking. (Compl., ¶ 24.) Plaintiff presented the Subject Vehicle
to Defendants for a reasonable number of repair attempts to no avail. (Compl.,
¶ 86.) Under the
Song-Beverly Act, Defendants had an affirmative duty to promptly offer to
repurchase or replace the Subject Vehicle at the time it failed to conform the
Subject Vehicle to the terms of the express warranty after a reasonable number
of repair attempts. (Compl., ¶ 15.) Defendants have
failed to either promptly replace the Subject Vehicle or to promptly make
restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.
(Compl., ¶ 16.)
 
The Complaint
alleges six causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(D);
(2) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(B); (3) Violation of Civil Code
Section 1793.2(A)(3); (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability; (5)
Negligent Repair; and (6) Fraudulent Inducement Concealment.
 
On 4/26/2024,
Defendants filed the instant demurrer to the sixth cause of action for
fraudulent inducement – concealment and motion to strike the prayer for
punitive damages.  
 
On 5/31/2024,
Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike.  
 
On 06/06/2024, Defendants filed a notice of Non-Opposition in support of
Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike, stating that Plaintiffs failed to
file an opposition.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.) 
 
B.     Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendants motions should be
overruled because Defendants failed to properly meet and confer. 
 
Here, counsel for Defendants sent an email to Plaintiffs on April 18, 2024, discussing the basis of Defendants’ demurrer and motion to
strike, and requesting a telephonic conference. (Elias Decl., Ex.
1.) It does not appear that any discussions took place between the parties and
no further meet and confer efforts were made before Defendants filed the
instant motions on April 26, 2024. The Court finds Defendants’ efforts fall short of the good-faith effort
requirements set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41(a). However,
failure to meet and confer is not a proper ground for overruling a demurrer.
(CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) Thus, the Court continues the hearing to
allow the parties to meet and confer in
good faith to determine whether the issues raised by the demurrer may be
resolved. 
 
Moving party did not
file a reply to Plaintiffs’ opposition. Instead, Defendants filed a notice of
non-opposition stating that Plaintiffs did not file an opposition. Therefore, the
Court is unsure if Defendants received Plaintiffs’ opposition. The proofs of
service on Plaintiffs’ opposition indicates they were sent to Defendants’
counsel via email. If there is to be a reply it is to be filed within 5 days.
 
DISPOSITION
 

The
Demurrer and Motion to Strike is CONTINUED to July 12, 2024.
