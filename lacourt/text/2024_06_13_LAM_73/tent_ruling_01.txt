I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
13, 2022, Plaintiff Wesley Michael Groves (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Courtney Young (“Courtney”) and Maurice Young (“Maurice”).
On November
9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Abuse of Process; (2) Malicious Prosecution; (3) Trespass
to Chattel; (4) Assault; and (5) Battery. 
The FAC
alleges the following. Plaintiff and Courtney are siblings and following their
mother’s passing, had joint ownership of the residence located 4255 Enoro Drive
(the “Enoro Property”). (FAC, ¶ 9.) On August 23, 2020 Courtney, her husband
Maurice, and their two children moved into the Enoro Property where Plaintiff
was also residing. (Id., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff and Courtney began to have
disagreements over several issues related to the property. (Ibid.) On
December 21, 2020, a dispute occurred between Courtney and Plaintiff that led
to Courtney calling law enforcement to the Enoro Property and filing a false
police report accusing Plaintiff of assault. (Id., ¶ 16.) Courtney also
filed a Petition for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) based on the
December 21, 2020 incident. (Id., ¶ 19.) Plaintiff alleges Courtney
exercised bad faith in filing her TRO petition, simply to gain an unfair
advantage relative to the ultimate determination of possession and ownership of
the Enoro Property. (Id., ¶ 20.)
On March 21,
2024, this Court entered an order granting Defendant’s Special Motion
to Strike (“anti-SLAPP”) motion.
On
April 19, 2024, Defendant Courtney Young filed a Motion for Award of Attorneys’ fees
and costs, arguing:
·      
Defendant moves for an order pursuant to CCP §
425.16 compelling Plaintiff to reimburse Defendant for $22,542.50 in
attorneys’ fees and $315.85 in costs incurred in connection with Defendant’s
successful Special Motion to Strike, for $2,300 in attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with preparing this fees Motion and the supporting evidence, and for
$2,975 in attorneys’ fees that Defendant anticipates she will incur in
connection with the Reply brief and hearing on this fees Motion. (See Kossoff
Decl. ¶¶ 3-19.)
·      
Defendant moves on the grounds that the Court granted Defendant’s
anti-SLAPP motion, Defendant is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant
to CCP § 425.16(c), and the fees and costs incurred are reasonable. 
 
Plaintiff
did not file an opposition.
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.    
Legal Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing party may
recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may include
attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
California Municipal Code section 151. 10 provides: “Any person
who demands, accepts or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum
rent or maximum adjusted rent in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
or any regulations or orders promulgated hereunder, shall be liable in a civil
action to the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted or retained
for damages of three times the amount by which the payment or payments
demanded, accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent
which could be lawfully demanded, accepted or retained together with reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the court."
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
B.    
Discussion
 
a.     Hourly Rate
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) 
 
Defendant
seeks to recover fees for two attorneys that billed time in connection with
Defendants’ anti-SLAPP and the instant motion. In this matter, Defendants’
counsel charged rates discounted from their standard hourly rates. Their
discounted hourly rates are as follows: 
 
·       
Alan Kossoff
(Attorney): $625/hour 
·       
Amber Melius
(Attorney): $575/hour 
 
The Court finds that the rates requested by
Defendant is reasonable and not higher than rates charged by attorneys with
comparable skill and expertise. Kossoff
attests to his experience and the reasonableness of the rates. (Kossoff Decl.,
¶¶ 11-17.) Based on the evidence before it, the Court is not inclined to
reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
b.     Reasonable
Hours Incurred
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) 
 
While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
 
Defendant moves for attorney fees and costs in the total
amount of $25,158.35 incurred in connection with her successful anti-SLAPP
motion and the instant motion for attorney fees and costs. Defendant asserts the total time
spent on the anti-SLAPP motion took 23.4 hours, the reply to Plaintiff’s
Opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion took 11.6 hours, to prepare and attend the
hearing took 2.5 hours and the instant motion took 4 hours. (Kossoff Decl., ¶¶ 7-16.)
 
Having
analyzed the instant motion, the anti-SLAPP motion, and pleadings, the Court
finds that the fees sought by Defendants are reasonable and do not include
excessive time billed or duplicative entries. “Parties who litigate with no
holds barred in cases such as this, in which the prevailing party is entitled
to a fee award, assume the risk they will have to reimburse the excessive
expenses they force upon their adversaries.” (Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 647, 653-654.) Here, the Court does not find that the time billed by
defense counsel was excessive.
 
Since
Defendant’s motion for attorney fees is unopposed, the Court does not grant the
request for $2,975 in attorneys’ fees that Defendant anticipated she will
incur in connection with the Reply brief and hearing on this fees Motion.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with her
successful anti-SLAPP motion and the instant motion is
GRANTED.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Defendant’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED.
The Court awards Defendant $25,158.35 in attorney fees and costs.
