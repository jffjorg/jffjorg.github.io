And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the motion by the defendant, Casuda Canyon Restaurant Corporation, to compel arbitration of the plaintiff, David Romero's, claims. The defendant claims that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement, but the court finds that the defendant has not met its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement. The court notes that the electronic signature of the agreement is not authenticated and that the defendant's own evidence raises doubts about the authenticity of the signature. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
