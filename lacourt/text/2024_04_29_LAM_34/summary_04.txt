Santopietro filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint, which was opposed by Vasdekis. The Judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, meaning that the cross-complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge notes that the pleadings are confusing and difficult to follow, and encourages the parties to use proper headings and proofread their documents. The case involves allegations of breach of contract, fraud, and unfair business practices, and raises issues of statute of limitations and standing.
