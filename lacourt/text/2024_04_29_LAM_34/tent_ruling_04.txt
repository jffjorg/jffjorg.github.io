 Case Number:  23STCV19315    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Demurrer
to Cross-Complaint 
 
Moving Party: George
Santopietro 
Resp. Party:    Lia Vasdekis 
 
 
The Demurrer to the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint
is OVERRULED.
 
 
PRELIMINARY COMMENTS:
 
        First, on February 28, 2024, George
Santopietro filed his “Amended” First Amended Complaint. This document was not
signed by Santopietro’s Counsel; this document cannot be accepted by the Court
as a pleading. Moreover, even if the document had been signed, Santopietro did
not request leave to file a second amended pleading, and the Court did not grant
such leave. Thus, this document is a nullity. 
 
        Second, Cross-Complainant’s Counsel’s
Opposition was difficult to follow. For instance, Counsel states:
 
“B. The essence of the Complaint
by Vasdekis against Santopietro is (for the purpose of opposing these
Demurrers, this section is showing disputed facts and undisputed facts that
establish her cross complaint to be sufficient). All quotes in this section
are taken from the Cross Complaint by Vasdekis (herein her cross complaint
is also referred to from time to time as “VCC”)”  (Opposition, p. 3:3-7 [bolding and typos in
original].)
 
It is not clear to
the Court what this paragraph intends to convey. Similarly, the opposition has
numerous paragraphs that contain sentence fragments.  For instance:
 
“A contract was entered into. Shown
in her pleadings, i.e Vasdekis was hired by Santopietro to deliver the Property
for $60,000 for the 7-nights.”  (Opposition,
p. 5:6-7.)
 
 
        Lastly, the opposition is apparently
filed on behalf of Cross-Complainant Lia Vasdekis. (See Opposition, p. 1:25.) However,
the signature line underneath counsel’s signature states that counsel is “Attorney
for James Vasdekis.”  (Opposition, p.
7:26.)  As far as the Court is aware,
there is no party to this case named James Vasdekis.
 
The Court encourages Defense Counsel to
consider using additional headings and sub-headings and to actually proof-read future
pleadings before filing them with the Court.

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by demurrer
or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or more of”
various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).)
 
“A demurrer to a
complaint or cross-complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or
cross-complaint or to any of the causes of action stated therein.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
 
“In reviewing the sufficiency
of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules.
We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed. Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318, citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
George Santopietro demurs to the first cause
of action (breach of contract and aiding and abetting breach of contract),
second cause of action (fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud), and third cause
of action (unfair business practices) in the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint. 
 
George Santopietro argues: (1) that the
Vasdekis Cross-Complaint is conclusionary; (2) that Lia Vasdekis’s claims are
barred by the applicable statutes of limitation; (3) that Lia Vasdekis lacks
standing to brings these claims; and (4) that there are other defects with Lia
Vasdekis’s claims, such as with failure to meet with heightened pleading
requirement for fraud. (Demurrer, pp. 2:11–13, 5:6–7, 5:21–22, 6:12–15, 7:1–2,
7:22–23.)
 
Lia Vasdekis disagrees, arguing that the
allegations are sufficient. (Opposition, pp. 5:1–2, 5:22, 7:5.) 
 
        George Santopietro
reiterates his arguments in his Reply. 
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
1. 
    Standing
 
George Santopietro gave Lia Vasdekis standing
to sue him by first suing her. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10.)
 
2. 
    The Pleadings
 
The Vasdekis Cross-Complaint is not
conclusionary. Rather, she pleads various causes of actions, three of which are
against George Santopietro. These causes of action are specific, certain, list
all of the elements necessary for these causes of action, and, where necessary,
meet the heightened pleading requirements. (Vasdekis Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 13–21,
25–27, 30–31, 33–34, 37.)
 
3. 
    The Statutes of Limitations
 
“Civil actions,
without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this
title, after the cause of action shall have accrued, unless where, in special
cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 312.)
 
        However, the Vasdekis
Cross-Complaint is in a special category.
 
“Although
ordinarily the statute of limitations will bar a cross-complaint in the same
fashion as if the defendant had brought an independent action, the rule is
different when the original complaint was filed before the statute of
limitations on the cross-complaint had elapsed. Such a cross-complaint need
only be subject-matter related to the plaintiff's complaint – i.e., arise out
of the same occurrence (see §§ 426.10, 428.10) – to relate back to the date of
filing the complaint for statute of limitation purposes.” (Sidney v. Super. Ct. (1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 710, 714, cleaned up.)
 
Here, the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint is subject-matter
related to the occurrence in George Santopietro’s Complaint and his FAC — i.e.,
the events that allegedly occurred in August 2019 on George Santopietro’s real
property. (Complaint, ¶ 8; FAC, ¶ 7.) 
 
Thus, to the extent that the FAC is safe from
the applicable statutes of limitations, the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint is safe
from the applicable statutes of limitations. 
 
But the reverse is also true — if the
Complaint and FAC were filed after the applicable statutes of limitations, then
the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint was almost certainly also filed after the
applicable statutes of limitations. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following causes of
action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing; (3) fraud; (4) fraud in the inducement; (5) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200; (6) breach of fiduciary duty; (7) aiding
and abetting; and (8) violation of Penal Code section 496. 
 
The FAC alleges the following causes of
action: (1) aiding and abetting breach of contract; (2) aiding and abetting
fraud; (3) aiding and abetting fraud in the inducement; (4) violation of
Business of Professions Code section 17200; and (5) violation of Penal Code
section 496. 
 
George Santopietro demurs to the following
causes of action in the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint: (1) breach of contract and
aiding and abetting breach of contract; (2) fraud and conspiracy to commit
fraud; and (3) unfair business practices.
 
According to various pleadings, all of this
conduct happened in August 2019. However, the Court is unable to pinpoint based
on the pleadings exactly when each part of the conduct occurred. 
 
Notably, the Complaint in this matter was
filed on August 14, 2023 — meaning that some conduct that occurred before
August 14, 2020 and other conduct that occurred before August 14, 2019 would
presumably be barred by the statute of limitations, unless some exception
applied.
 
This is because:
 
(1)      
the statute of limitations for breach of contract is
four years (Code Civ. Proc., §
337, subd. (a)); 
 
(2)      
the
statute of limitations for aiding and abetting a tort is the same as the
underlying tort (Am. Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225
Cal.App.4th 1451, 1478–1479, citations omitted); 
 
(3)      
the statute of limitations for fraud is three years (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (d));
 
(4)      
the statute of limitations for civil conspiracy is
based on the nature of the conspiracy alleged (Kenworthy v.
Brown (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 298, 301, citation and italics omitted);
 
(5)      
the statute of limitations for violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200 is four years (Bus. & Prof.
Code, § 17208); and
 
(6)      
the statute of limitations for a violation of Penal
Code section 496 is three years (Pen. Code § 801; see also People v. Allen (1999)
21 Cal.4th 846, 861, fn. 14).
 
At this time, George Santopietro has not met
his burden to show that the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint is time-barred. 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Demurrer to the Vasdekis Cross-Complaint
is OVERRULED.
