And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion to compel answers from Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi is granted in part. Azizi shall attend a further deposition within thirty days of the issuance of this order and answer the four questions above, except that as to question #1, he is only required to answer as to any adult children. The court will apply the balancing test outlined in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Association and will limit the response to the first question to any adult children Azizi has. The court does not see the impropriety of the fourth question and will not compel Azizi to answer it in a way that suggests he has insurance on the property.
