And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED. The Judge notes that although the Court is denying the motion, it is making no ruling on what evidence will be admitted at trial. The issues of whether Defendants fabricated evidence and bribed or attempted to bribe a witness are premature and disputed and will be considered by a jury at trial. The Judge emphasizes that terminating sanctions should be used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information, and that these sanctions should not be imposed for punishment. The Judge also notes that a decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly and that a court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations.
