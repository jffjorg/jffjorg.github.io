And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to dismiss filed by defendant Gul Jaisinghani, and has determined that the motion is moot. The defendant contends that the complaint must be dismissed because the plaintiff, George M. Halimi, failed to provide written notice under Business and Professions Code § 6201(a) before filing suit. However, the Court has found that the defendant's counsel exercised the client's right to arbitrate the fee agreement, as provided in the parties' fee agreement. Therefore, the Court concludes that the matter should be arbitrated, rather than dismissed.
