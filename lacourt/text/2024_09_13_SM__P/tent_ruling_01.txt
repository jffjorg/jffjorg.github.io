Albert Gregory
Pinto v. Maha Visconti Case No. 21STCV25467
Hearing Date:
September 13, 2024
Plaintiff Pinto’s Motion for Summary
Adjudication; Defendant Visconti’s Motion to Vacate Entire Ruling; Defendant
Visconti’s Motion for Reconsideration; Motion to Stay Proceedings 
Attorney plaintiff Pinto represented defendant
Visconti in various cases. Visconti alleges Pinto used his position to obtain
improper loans and transfers, was physically abusive, and filed a false
domestic violence report against her, leading to her arrest and current
incarceration. 
Pinto’s request for the court to take judicial notice
of the Minute Order and Criminal Abstract Judgment for People v. Maha El
Pinto Maqaddem, Case No. SA098438-01, hereinafter referred to as
Exhibit C and B, respectively, are GRANTED under Evidence Code 452(d) as they
are court documents. 
Pinto argues summary adjudication should be granted as
to liability for all four causes of action against Visconti based on collateral
estoppel. The minute order and the criminal abstract in the related criminal
matter are connected to the same incident and involve the same parties. Pinto
Decl. ¶¶2-9 Exh C; Khodadian Decl. ¶¶3,8 Exh. B. Visconti was convicted for
attacking Pinto in violation of Penal Code sections 273.5(a), 12022.7(e), and
205. Id. Based on this, Pino has satisfied his initial burden. Pinto
meets his initial burden on summary judgement. Visconti does not file an
opposition to the motion; thus, summary judgment is GRANTED. 
Motion to Vacate
Entire Ruling – 04/26/24
 
Visconti moves
for reconsideration of the court’s April 26, 2024 order. The motion is untimely
under CCP 1008(a) as it is filed more than ten days after the court’s order.
The motion additionally lacks a memorandum of points. The motion only has the notice of hearing and several
exhibits. CRC rule 3.1113 states
that, “[a] party filing a
motion, except for a motion listed in rule 3.1114, must serve and file a
supporting memorandum.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a). “The memorandum
must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks
cited in support of the position advanced.” Id., rule 3.1113(b). CRC
rule 3.1114 does not list motions for reconsideration as an exception to the
rule requiring a memorandum of points. Thus, the motion is not procedurally proper
and is untimely. DENIED. 
 
Motion for
Reconsideration – 03/05/24
 
Visconti moves
for reconsideration of the court’s March 5, 2024 order. Visconti argues the
court should reconsider the March 5, 2024 order because it was ruled on without
her presence or participation. Per her declaration, she was not served with any
motion scheduled by Mr. Khodadian for March 5, 2024. Visconti Decl. ¶1. However,
this does not present the court with new facts, as the motion was properly
served on Visconti by mail per the motion's proof of service. 1/25/24 Motion
for Sanctions. Further, the motion is untimely per CCP 1008. DENIED. 
 
Motion to Vacate Void Order – 6/06/24 and
Stay Proceedings 
Visconti moves to
reconsider the court’s June 6, 2024 order and stay the proceedings. The motions
are unintelligible, as they cite no authority for the relief sought and
impermissibly lack a memorandum of points, which is required under CRC rule 3.1113(a).
“The memorandum must contain a statement
of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and
a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(b). CRC rule
3.1114 does not list motions for a stay in the proceedings or reconsideration
as an exception to the rule requiring a memorandum of points. Thus, the motions
are not proper, and the papers do not clearly state what is being alleged, nor
the basis for the allegations. DENIED. 
 
At Visconti’s request on 9/10/24, the
court ordered the Sheriff’s office to provide Visconti with access to video
court appearances, to the extent that such is possible in the facility where
she currently being held.
