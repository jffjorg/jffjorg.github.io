And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions filed by the parties and has issued a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Pinto, is seeking summary adjudication on all four causes of action against the defendant, Visconti, based on collateral estoppel. The judge grants Pinto's request and grants summary adjudication on all four causes of action against Visconti.

Visconti has filed several motions, including a motion to vacate the entire ruling, a motion for reconsideration of previous orders, and a motion to stay proceedings. The judge denies all of these motions, finding that they are either untimely or lack a memorandum of points, as required by the California Rules of Court.

The judge also notes that Visconti has requested access to video court appearances, and the court has ordered the Sheriff's office to provide her with access to such appearances, to the extent that it is possible in the facility where she is currently being held.
