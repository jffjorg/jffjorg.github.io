And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mendoza v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, et al. The defendants, I.A.T.S.E. Local 80 and Local 80 IASTE Building Corporation, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, alleging that the complaint fails to adequately allege respondent superior liability. The court has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint does not sufficiently allege that Local 80 was the assailant's employer or that Local 80 engaged in a cover-up as defined by California Code of Civil Procedure ยง340.16(e)(4)(A). The court has ruled that the First Amended Complaint does not address the defects identified in the prior demurrer, including the lack of allegations regarding the binding effect of Conover's statements and the failure to allege that Local 80 was the assailant's employer. The court has denied Mendoza's request to amend the complaint and has ordered the case to proceed to trial.
