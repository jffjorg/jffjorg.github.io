George M. Halimi
v. Gul Jaisinghani, Case No. 24SMCV01101
Hearing Date:
September 13, 2024
Defendant
Jaisinghani’s Motion to Dismiss 
 
Attorney plaintiff
Halimi filed a breach of contract claim against former client defendant Jaisinghani,
alleging failure to pay $324,000 in legal services provided. Defendant Jaisinghani
moves for the dismissal of the complaint under Business and Professions Code § 6201(a).

 
Jaisinghani contends dismissal is mandatory as he was not
given written notice under Business and Professions Code §6201(a). The Code
requires dismissing the action for failure to provide written notice to the
client before or when serving a summons or starting any legal action for fees
or costs under a contract. Bus. & Prof. Code § 6201(a). 
The court order for service of summons to be made by publication
was on May 15, 2024. See 05/15/24 Minute Order. 
Per the parties’ fee agreement, if a dispute arose
regarding attorney’s fees or costs, and the attorney files suit, the client has
a right to arbitrate. Opp., Exh. 1. Plaintiff Halimi provides evidence that defendant
Jaisinghani’s counsel exercised his client’s right to arbitrate the fee
agreement. Id. Exh. 2. The matter should be arbitrated, per the fee
agreement and Jaisinghani’s exercise of his right to arbitrate. Dismissal would
not be proper, as defendant exercised his arbitration rights under the contract.
The motion is MOOT.
