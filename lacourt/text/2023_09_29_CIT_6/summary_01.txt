And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's Complaint. The motion was filed on March 23, 2023, and the Plaintiff opposed it on September 7, 2023. The Defendant replied on September 25, 2023.

The Judge finds that the Defendant's motion is not actually a motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b), but rather a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action. The Judge agrees with the Plaintiff that the case of Thurston v. Omni Hotels Management Corp. does not support the Defendant's contention that the Plaintiff lacks standing.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to show that she has standing to bring this action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Judge notes that the Defendant's contention regarding the Plaintiff's lack of bona fide intent and standing is a reiteration of the Defendant's contention that the Plaintiff lacks standing, which has already been addressed.

The Judge orders the Defendant to file an Answer to the Complaint within ten calendar days of this order and the Plaintiff to give notice and provide proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court's order.
