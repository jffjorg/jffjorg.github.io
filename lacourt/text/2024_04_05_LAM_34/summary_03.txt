And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Kia America, Inc. The plaintiff, Anthony Camacho, filed a complaint against Kia America, Inc. on causes of action arising from the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant argues that the third cause of action, which alleges that Kia America, Inc. did not make available sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge disagrees and denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficiently specific to withstand the motion.
