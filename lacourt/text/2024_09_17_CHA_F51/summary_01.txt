Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Moving Defendants (Les R.

The Court found that Moving Defendants failed to meet their initial evidentiary burden to establish a defense to liability for private nuisance, trespass, and negligence. The Court held that triable issues remain as to whether Moving Defendants exercised reasonable care in their conduct, use, and maintenance of their property. The Court also denied the motion for summary judgment because the evidence presented by Moving Defendants was insufficient and inadmissible.
