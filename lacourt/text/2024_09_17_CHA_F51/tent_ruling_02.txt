   [1] The  Court notes that on reply, Moving Defendants assert that “a co-defendant does  not have standing to oppose another defendant’s motion for summary judgment.” (Thursby/Palmer  Reply 4:3–4, citing Atlas Construction v. Swinerton Builders (2021) 60  Cal.App.5th 175, 186.) The Court notes that this case has been ordered not  published and is therefore uncitable. (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 8.1115.)  Moreover, the Court of Appeal has previously ruled that a co-defendant who failed  to file an opposition to a co-defendant’s motion for summary judgment when it  had every opportunity to do so was subject to collaterally estopped from  litigating issues of indemnity on the cross-complaint. (Columbus Line, Inc.  v. Gray Line Sight-Seeing Companies Associated, Inc. (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d  622, 631 [“it was incumbent on Columbus to protect its own interests by  vigorously opposing the motion instead of merely relying on plaintiffs'  opposition, for Columbus knew (or should have known) that summary judgment  exonerating Gray Line from liability to plaintiffs, if it became final, would  preclude any claim of indemnity.”].)
