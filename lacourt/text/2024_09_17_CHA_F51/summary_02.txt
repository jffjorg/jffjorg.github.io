And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that the moving defendants argue that a co-defendant does not have standing to oppose another defendant's motion for summary judgment. However, the court finds this argument unconvincing, citing a previous case where a co-defendant who failed to file an opposition to a co-defendant's motion for summary judgment was subject to collateral estoppel from litigating issues of indemnity. The court rules that the moving defendants' argument is without merit and that the co-defendant is not entitled to oppose the motion for summary judgment.
