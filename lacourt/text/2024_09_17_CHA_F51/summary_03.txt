```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to quash the service of process. The defendant, Paul Antieri, argued that the service was defective because the plaintiff did not file an affidavit of due diligence in court and did not request an order for posting. However, the judge found that the proof of service filed by the plaintiff contained a signed declaration of diligence, stating that the process server made several unsuccessful attempts to serve the defendant before effectuating substitute service. The judge also noted that the defendant's contentions that he was not properly served were insufficient to rebut the presumption that the substitute service was proper. Therefore, the judge denied the motions to quash.
