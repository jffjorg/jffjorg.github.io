Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration based on the 2018 Master Service Agreement (MSA). The plaintiff, American Capital Enterprises, Inc., had argued that the arbitration agreement was invalid due to conflicting venue and jurisdiction clauses, as well as allegations of fraud and inconspicuousness. However, the court finds that the 2018 MSA governs the dispute and that the arbitration agreement is valid. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to show a defense to enforcement. The action is stayed pending resolution of arbitration.
