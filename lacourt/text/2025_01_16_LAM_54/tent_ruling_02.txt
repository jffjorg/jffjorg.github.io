Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel
Moving Party: James C. Pettis,
counsel of record for Defendants Omerta Farms, LLC and
Jonathan Lachman
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      THE MOTION IS GRANTED. 
 
COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative,
please email the courtroom at¿SMCdept54@lacourt.org¿with notice
to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:30 am on the day of
the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers. No opposition
has been received.
 
The Court may issue
an order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to
the client.  (CCP § 284.)  The attorney may withdraw from representation
where the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client’s
interest—for example, counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the
litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Attorney James C.
Pettis, counsel of record for Defendant Omerta Farms, LLC, seeks to withdraw
from representation of defendant Omerta Farms, LLC. Counsel states that that the
relationship between him and the client has broken down. Counsel has complied
with CRC 3.1362. 
 
Trial is set for February
24, 2025, but the Court also notes that these Defendants are listed in the
Court’s file as being in default. The Court also notes that Defendant Omerta
Farms, as a corporation, must be represented by counsel. The parties should
address these issues at argument.
 
 The Court finds there is good cause for
Counsel’s withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
