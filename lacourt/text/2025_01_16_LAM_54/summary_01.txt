The defendant, Arizona Tile, LLC, filed a motion to compel the deposition of Pedro Mota and Brad Eskovski, but the court has denied this motion.

The court considered the defendant's motion papers, but no opposition was filed. The defendant served Pedro Mota with a deposition subpoena and notice of deposition on December 3, 2024, and set the deposition for December 12, 2024. However, Pedro Mota did not appear for the deposition, along with another business associated with him.

The court noted that the notice of deposition must be served at least 10 days before the date set for the deposition, but in this case, it was served only 8 and 9 days before.
