T/R:    PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT IS CONTINUED
TO JANUARY 27, 2025 AT 9:00, TO ALLOW DEFENDANT TO SHOW COMPLIANCE WITH THE
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
 
            PLAINTIFF
TO NOTICE.  
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative,
please email the courtroom at¿SMCdept54@lacourt.org¿with notice
to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:30 am on the day of

The Court considers the moving and opposition papers. 
 
            Plaintiff
moves pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 for an order and entry of
judgment to enforce the terms of the settlement between Plaintiff and Defendant
Sandra Lee Skeeter. Plaintiff also seeks attorney fees and costs in the amount
of $4,428.41 incurred by Plaintiff to enforce the terms of the settlement.
 
Section 664.6 states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
            The
parties entered into a settlement agreement on October 9, 2024. (Decl. Ruttenberg,
¶ 4, Ex. A.) In paragraph 6 Plaintiff and Skeeter stipulated that the settlement
may be enforced pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, and that, in any proceeding
to enforce this settlement agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred therein. (Decl.
Ruttenberg, ¶ 5.) The settlement states at Paragraph 2: “As a material
condition of this settlement, Defendant Skeeter agrees that, by no later than
October 30, 2024, she will file a complaint for unlawful detainer (UD) against
Defendant Steckel, who is currently occupying her real property at 10530
Whipple Street, Toluca Lake, CA 91602.” (Decl. Ruttenberg, ¶ 4, Ex. A.)
Plaintiff has not filed the unlawful detainer complaint. (Decl. Ruttenberg, ¶ 6.)

 
            In
opposition, Defendant states that she is in the process of evicting her tenant.
(Decl. Skeeter, ¶ 3.) She states that, by law, it would not have been possible
to file the unlawful detainer complaint by October 30, 2024. (Decl. Skeeter, ¶
4.) Defendant has not shown that the UD complaint has been filed.
 
            The
motion is continued to provide Defendant an opportunity to file in this Court a
declaration showing that the unlawful detainer complaint has been filed.
