And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the discovery limits for an upcoming arbitration hearing. The agreement between the parties limits discovery to two depositions and any expert witnesses expected to testify, as well as the exchange of documents and witness lists two weeks prior to the hearing. The arbitrator will balance fairness and expediency when determining whether to allow additional discovery. The judge rejects the plaintiff's challenge to mutuality, finding that the agreement waives the right to trial in favor of arbitration and allows the defendant to terminate the agreement in the future, but not for already-existing claims. The judge also finds that shifting discovery costs to the employee is substantively unconscionable, citing a similar case, Murrey v. Superior Ct. (2023). The judge's ruling aims to ensure a prompt and inexpensive resolution to the dispute.
