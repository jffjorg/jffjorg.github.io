[1]
The medical billing provider is not a defendant in the instant action.


[2]
Defendant solely relies on CCP § 377.32 to support this proposition. The other
cited authority so not discuss this statute. 
 


[3]
The court does not see how these sections of the probate code bolster
Plaintiff’s claim to be her husband’s successor in interest because they
discuss division of community property in intestacy.


[4]
The courts notes that, as plead, Plaintiff seeks reimbursement of $86,413.47
but the quoted Policy language states “You pay all costs over lifetime benefit
of $50,000.” (FAC ¶ 7, Prayer for Relief ¶ 2.) Plaintiff has not plead other
portions of the Policy indicating she can recover more than the lifetime
benefit. 
 


[5]
Defendant relies on Bionghi v.
Metropolitan Water Dist. of So. California (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1358,
which was not at the demurrer stage but at summary judgment. Additionally,
reliance on that case is misplaced because the Court there carved out insurance
contracts as an exception due to a special relationship. (Id.at p. 1370.) The Bionghi Court
cited Careau & Co. v. Security Pac.
Bus. Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371 as expressing the carve out
for special relationships, including those stemming from insurance contracts. (Ibid.) Defendant’s reliance on Habitat Trust for Wildlife, Inc. v. City of
Rancho Cucamonga (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1306 also fails because the Court
there found, at summary judgment, no breach of contract cause of action. That
case did not involve and insurance contract. 


[6]
Read in context of the entire FAC, this is not a conclusory statement. 


[7]
Indeed, it appears to the court that Plaintiff knows what the “plain language”
of the Policy is and that Defendant is in breach. (FAC ¶ 26(a).)


[8]
There are allegations of such conduct by non-party PHI. (FAC ¶¶ 10, 11.)


[9]
Defendant relies on Wiley v. Rhodes, (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d
1470, 1474 to support their proposition. However, Wiley awarded attorneys’ fees as costs on default judgment and did
not concern breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in
the insurance context. Plaintiff’s opposition fails to address this point.
