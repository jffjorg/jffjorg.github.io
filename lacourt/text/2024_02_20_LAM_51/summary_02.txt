And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff is seeking reimbursement of $86,413.47 from the defendant, citing a breach of an insurance contract. The defendant relies on certain statutes and case law to argue that the plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement. However, the judge finds that these arguments are unpersuasive and that the defendant's reliance on certain cases is misplaced. The judge notes that the policy language quoted by the plaintiff states that the plaintiff will only be reimbursed for costs over a lifetime benefit of $50,000, and that the plaintiff has not pleaded any other portions of the policy that would allow for greater reimbursement. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of conduct by non-party PHI are relevant to the case. Overall, the judge is not convinced that the defendant has shown that the plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement.
