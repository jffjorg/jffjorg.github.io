And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the joint motion to continue the trial, which was filed by the plaintiff and the defendant. The parties requested a continuance due to ongoing discovery and scheduling conflicts. The court found good cause for the continuance, citing the need for further fact and expert discovery, as well as the busy trial calendars of the parties' counsel. The judge has reset the trial date to on or after March 10, 2025, and has also reset the final status conference and discovery deadlines. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the new trial date.
