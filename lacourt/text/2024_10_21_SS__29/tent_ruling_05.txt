21STCV35166
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On September 23, 2021, Maria Benitez (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Jessica Morales Perez, Aristeo Morales (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out of a motor
vehicle accident occurring on September 27, 2019. 
 
Defendants filed their answer on March 6, 2023.
 
On August 19, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
Defendants also seek sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendants
seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition within 10 days of
this hearing, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.
 
Defendants
first noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for May 22, 2023. (Trafton Decl., ¶ 2.)  After numerous continuances, mostly requested
by Plaintiff, and one failure to appear by Plaintiff, the parties agreed to a
deposition date of August 12, 2024. 
(Id., ¶¶ 3-13.)
 
Defendants
noticed the deposition for August 12, 2024. 
(Id., ¶ 13 & Exh. K.)  Plaintiff
did not object and did not appear.  (Id.,
¶¶ 13-15 & Exh. M.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel did send an email approximately one hour before the deposition stating
(without further explanation) that Plaintiff was “unable to attend” the
deposition.  (Id., ¶ 14 & Exh. L.)
 
Defendants
counsel followed up to inquire about the nonappearance, but Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶ 16 & Exh. N.)
 
Defendants
need not show anything more.  Defendants properly
noticed Plaintiff’s deposition, and Plaintiff did not object or appear.  The motion to compel is granted.
 
The
Court also grants, in part, Defendants’ request for sanctions.  The motion to compel is granted, the conduct
of Plaintiff and counsel is not substantially justified, and the imposition of
sanctions would not be unjust.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(g)(1).)
 
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $765, calculated based on three hours of
attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $235 per
hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See
Trafton Decl., ¶ 18.) 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Maria Benitez.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Maria Benitez to appear for deposition by video conference
and answer questions under oath on November __, 2024, at 11:00 a.m.  Defendants are to provide the link for the
deposition to Plaintiff’s counsel at least 24 hours in advance of the
deposition.  
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Maria
Benitez and her attorneys of record, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $765 to Defendants
(through Defendants’ counsel) within 30 days of notice.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
