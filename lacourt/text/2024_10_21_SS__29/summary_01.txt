And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is setting a tentative ruling for a hearing on October 21, 2024, regarding a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendant. The judge expresses uncertainty about whether all the evidence referenced in the papers has been submitted, specifically a deposition transcript that was mentioned but not received. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion is unclear, as the plaintiff claims they need more time to obtain essential facts, but it is not clear whether they are requesting a continuance based on this or the court's inherent power. Additionally, the judge is concerned that the plaintiff, who is representing herself in pro per, may not be aware of the legal principles governing evidence and may need guidance on how to address the defendant's objections to some of the evidence. The judge will discuss these issues with the parties' counsel and may need to continue the hearing to address them.
