The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendant and Does 1 through 100 for motor vehicle negligence, negligence per se, negligent infliction of emotional stress, and negligent entrustment arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff did not appear at the Final Status Conference or Trial, and the court dismissed the case on July 29, 2024.

Additionally, the court has set an Order to Show Cause regarding monetary sanctions in the amount of up to $500, which may be imposed on the plaintiff and/or counsel for failure to serve the defendant within the time period set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(b), or for failure to appear at a trial setting conference.
