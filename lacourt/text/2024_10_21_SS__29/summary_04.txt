And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff had failed to appear at several hearings, including the trial setting conference, and filed multiple motions to set aside the dismissal. The judge notes that the plaintiff's motions were filed more than six months after the dismissal, which is beyond the statutory deadline for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge has no power or discretion to extend the deadline, and therefore denies the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give any required notice.
