  Case Number:  23STCV02267    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  74 Andrew
Leavenworth, et al. v. Self-Realization Fellowship Church, et al.
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set
One) from Defendant Ujjal Maker and Request for Sanctions
 
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and
reply.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
over personal property.
            On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff Andrew
Leavenworth (Plaintiff) filed a first amended complaint (FAC) on behalf of Joan
Wight (Decedent). Gurbir Maker, Ujjal Maker (Defendant), Alisa Miller Fein,
Chris Bagley, Self-Realization Fellowship Church, Doris Schneider, and Rosario
Hurley are the named Defendants.
            On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff
served Defendant with requests for production of documents (set one) (RFPs).
            On April 21, 2023, Defendant served
its initial responses. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            On June 2, 2023, and June 7, 2023,
Defendant served amended responses and produced responsive documents. Plaintiff
was still dissatisfied.
            On July 25, 2023, Defendant served
further amended responses and produced additional responsive documents. On July
26, 2023, Defendant served verifications to the further amended responses.
            On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 1-10.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response to a demand for inspection if the
propounding party deems that an answer or statement of compliance is evasive or
incomplete, or that an objection is “without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a
motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause for the discovery
sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).) ¿  
DISCUSSION
            The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further discovery because its separate statement is insufficient. (Mills
v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 892-893.) Under California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345, subdivision (c), the separate statement in this context
must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other
document to determine the full request and the full response. Accordingly, the
separate statement must include, for each discovery request at issue, the text
of each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (c)(2).) 
            Here, Plaintiff’s separate statement
does not include Defendant’s further amended responses from July 25, 2023. The
court also notes that Plaintiff had ample time to rectify the deficient
separate statement. That is, by July 26, 2023, Defendant had served Plaintiff
with further amended responses and verifications. Within 45 days of that date,
Plaintiff could have filed another motion to compel or an amended motion with a
sufficient separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
CONCLUSION
              The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to RFP Nos. 1-10 and his request for sanctions. The
court orders Plaintiff to pay by February 23, 2024, Defendant’s counsel $1, 500
for attorney’s fees as discovery sanctions. (The court is also ordering
Plaintiff to pay an additional $1,500 by February 23, 2024, to Defendant’s
counsel on behalf of Gurbir Maker, for a total of $3,000 in attorney’s fees for
the two motions which involved duplication, which the court allocates 50/50 to
the two Makers.)
            Plaintiff shall give notice.////////////////////////////Andrew
