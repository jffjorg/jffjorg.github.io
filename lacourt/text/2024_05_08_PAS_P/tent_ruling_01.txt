ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES1.I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a negligence
suit arising from an alleged robbery of Plaintiff Gerlach’s Liquor. Plaintiff
alleges that it hired Baskin & Baskin to provide security at the store and that
on May 10, 2020, Baskin allegedly failed to do so and thieves made off with the
store’s wares.  
          Baskin filed this motion to compel on March
7, 2024. It is unopposed. (4/25/24 Non-Opposition.)
          Before the Court is Baskin’s motion
for an order compelling response to Requests for Production of Documents, Set

II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
“Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the
action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) “If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP §
2025.480(a).)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.480(j).)
