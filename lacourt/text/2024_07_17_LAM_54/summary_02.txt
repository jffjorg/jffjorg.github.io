And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to lift stay filed by the Plaintiff, Christina Ramirez. The motion was opposed by the Defendants, Law Offices of Adam Zolonz, APC, and Adam Zolonz. The Court has denied the motion to lift the stay. The Plaintiff argued that recent changes to Code of Civil Procedure § 1294(a) grant the Court discretion to lift the stay while the appeal is perfected, and that lifting the stay would not prejudice the Defendant. However, the Court found that absent clear expression of intent by the legislature, it cannot retroactively apply the revisions to CCP § 1294(a). The Court also noted that Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.4 applies where the Court has ordered arbitration, and here, the Court denied the motion for arbitration. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change and the parties are invited to submit on the tentative if they wish to do so.
