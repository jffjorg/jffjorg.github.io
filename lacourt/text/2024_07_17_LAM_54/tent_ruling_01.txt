COUNSEL TO GIVE NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers. No
opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue
an order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to
the client.  (CCP § 284.)  The attorney may withdraw from representation
as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client’s
interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the
litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Attorney Randy S.
Snyder, counsel of record for Defendants Robert Haro; R. Douglas Spiro, Jr.;
Cole Harris; CSM Sycamore, LLC; and Capital Stone Management, Inc, seeks to
withdraw from representation of each Defendant. Counsel states that, due to a
change in the management of 1999 Sycamore, LLC, conflicts have arisen among
counsel’s clients in this action. Trial has not been set in this matter, and no
prejudice will result from Counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC
3.1362. 
 
There is good cause
for Counsel’s withdrawal. The motions are GRANTED.  As this will result in corporate defendants
without counsel, the Court will set an OSC re representation of the corporate
entities.
