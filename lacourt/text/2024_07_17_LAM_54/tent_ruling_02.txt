BACKGROUND
 
An appeal is pending on this Court’s order denying Defendant’s motion to
compel arbitration. Plaintiff
now moves to lift the stay in this Court on the grounds that (1) recent changes
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1294(a) grant the Court discretion to lift the
stay while the appeal is perfected, (2) lifting the stay would not prejudice
the Defendant, and (3) Plaintiff, the aggrieved employee, will continue to
endure prejudice while the stay is imposed. 
 
Plaintiff contends that
Senate Bill 365, amends CCP § 1294 to allow for the proceedings to continue
while an appeal is perfected. Plaintiff argues that based on the legislative
history of the amendment, SB 365 is intended to prevent corporate defendants
from abusing the automatic stay when appealing a denied motion to compel
arbitration.  
 
In opposition,
Defendant asserts that under CCP § 1281.4 the appellate stay may not be lifted
while there are overlapping issues. Defendant also argues that the latest
enactment of SB 365 should not be given retroactive application.  
 
Absent clear expression
of intent by the legislature, the Court cannot retroactively apply the revisions
to CCP § 1294(a). (Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. (2002) 28
Cal.4th 828, 840–841; McClung v. Employment Development Dept. (2004) 34
Cal.4th 467.) The Supreme Court in McClung held that, absent express
legislative intent, laws are applied prospectively. (Id. 34 Cal.4th at
476.) Plaintiff does not provide any legislative history that expressly shows
that the legislature intended SB 365 to be retroactively applied. 
 
CCP §1281.4 applies
where the Court has ordered arbitration. Here, the Court denied the motion for
arbitration.
