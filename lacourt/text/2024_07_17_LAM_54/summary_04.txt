And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of BestOcean Worldwide Logistics, Inc. v. Softtrans Logistics, Inc. The case involves a breach of contract lawsuit, and the Plaintiff, BestOcean Worldwide Logistics, Inc., has moved to set aside a default judgment entered against the Defendant, Softtrans Logistics, Inc.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the default judgment under CCP § 473(b), which allows for relief from a judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the Judge has granted relief to the Defendant under CCP § 473(d), which allows the Court to correct clerical mistakes in its judgments or orders.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the service of the lawsuit on the Defendant was improper, and that the Defendant was denied relief under CCP § 473(b) because the default was taken against the Defendant, not the Plaintiff. The Judge has set aside the default against the Defendant, and the case will proceed to a hearing on July 17, 2024.
