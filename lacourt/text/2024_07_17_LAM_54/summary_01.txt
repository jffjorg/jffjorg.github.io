And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of counsel Randy S. Snyder to withdraw from representation of each defendant in the case. Counsel has stated that conflicts have arisen among counsel's clients in this action, and trial has not been set. As a result, the judge has determined that there is good cause for counsel's withdrawal. Counsel is required to file proof of service of the order within 5 days of notice of the ruling, and will be relieved from representation upon filing of proof of service. The judge has also set an order to show cause (OSC) regarding the representation of the corporate entities.
