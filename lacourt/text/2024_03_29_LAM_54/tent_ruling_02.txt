BACKGROUND
 
            On July 5,
2023, Plaintiffs Gerald Whitt, Alexander Whitt, Matthew Whitt,
Christopher Whitt, and Deborah Milam filed
the operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) against three corporate
defendants and eight individual defendants, asserting causes of action for
intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach
of contract, conspiracy, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.
Plaintiffs were minority shareholders of Cloud B, a manufacturer and
distributor of plush toys. Plaintiffs allege the majority shareholder Defendants
conspired with the takeover Defendants to sell Cloud B and loot Cloud B’s
assets, making Plaintiffs’ shares worthless.

            Defendant
Linda Suh (“Defendant”) was the CEO and Board co-chair of Cloud B. (FAC, ¶ 9.)
Prior to October 30, 2018, Defendant was the owner of 18.02% of the shares in
Cloud B. (Id.) Defendant was first served, via substitute service, on
February 3, 2024, three years and 99 days after the filing of the original
complaint on October 27, 2020. 
 
            On February
29, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant
to CCP § 418.10. The motion is made on the grounds that Defendant was served
more than 3 years after the filing of the complaint, warranting dismissal under
CCP § 583.210. 
            
ANALYSIS
 
Under CCP § 583.210, a complaint must be served on a defendant
within three years after the complaint is filed, and proof of service must be
filed within 60 days of service. (CCP § 583.210.) “If service is not made in an
action within the time prescribed in this article . . . [t]he action shall not
be further prosecuted and no further proceedings shall be held in the action
[and] [t]he action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on
motion of any person interested in the action . . . .” (CCP § 583.250(a).)
 
In computing the time
within which service must be made, time is excluded when: 
 
a)    The defendant was not amenable to the process of the court. 
b)    The prosecution of the action or proceedings in the action was stayed
and the stay affected service. 
c)    The validity of service was the subject of litigation by the parties. 
d)    Service, for any other reason was impossible, impracticable, or futile
due to causes beyond the plaintiff’s control. Failure to discover relevant
facts or evidence is not a cause beyond the plaintiff’s control for the purpose
of the subdivision. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., section
583.240.)  
 
Defendant’s evidentiary objections are overruled. 
 
Defendant moves to dismiss the action on the grounds that she was
served more than three years after the filing of the complaint, warranting
dismissal under CCP § 583.210. 
 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendant purposefully avoided service and
the three-year period was tolled under CCP § 583.240 because service “was
impossible, impracticable or futile due to causes beyond plaintiff’s control.”
(CCP § 583.240(d).) 
 
Plaintiffs' counsel took reasonable steps to serve Defendant. After
some weeks of service attempts at outdated addresses, Plaintiffs located Defendant’s
current home address and began efforts to serve her personally at that address.
Plaintiffs' process servers made five separate attempts on five different days
between September 2 and 9, 2023, including mornings and early evenings. Despite
cars being present in the driveway and dogs barking within the home, no one ever
came to the door. (Wells Decl., 4-7, Exhs. A- C.) 
 
It is highly likely at this time that Defendant knew she had been
sued. Her co-Defendants Richard Brenner and Jeffrey Johnson had been served on
August 24, 2023 and August 30, 2023, and were represented by the same counsel Defendant
has now. On September 20, 2023, Defense counsel reached out to Plaintiffs'
counsel on behalf of Brenner and Johnson to ask for an extension of time to
respond to the FAC against them, acknowledging receipt of the FAC. (Ritt Decl.,
¶ 10.) Counsel stated that he was unable to accept service for Defendant. (Ritt
Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. C.)
 
“Section 583.210 is designed to a give defendants timely notice of
an action so they can make efforts to preserve evidence.” (Shipley v. Sugita
(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 320, 326.) The evidence supports the conclusion that
Defendant was on notice of the suit. Earlier service “was impossible,
impracticable or futile due to causes beyond plaintiff’s control.” (CCP §
583.240(d).)
 
The Court does not reach Plaintiffs’ other grounds in opposition. 
 
The motion to dismiss is DENIED.
