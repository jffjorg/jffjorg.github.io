And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition of the defendant, Michael Edward Bass, due to misconduct during the first deposition. The ruling also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the reduced total amount of $3,185.00. The judge finds that the defendant's evasive answers during the deposition provide good cause for a subsequent deposition and constitute misuse of the discovery process. The ruling notes that the defendant's deposition was interrupted and he gave lengthy, irrelevant orations in response to yes-or-no questions. The judge also finds that the defendant's failure to appear at a second deposition and his evasive answers constitute a misuse of the discovery process, warranting sanctions.
