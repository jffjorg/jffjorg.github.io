And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Defendant Linda Suh. The motion was based on the argument that the complaint was served more than three years after it was filed, which is a ground for dismissal under CCP § 583.210. However, the judge found that the three-year period was tolled due to causes beyond the plaintiff's control, specifically that Defendant Linda Suh purposefully avoided service. The judge noted that Plaintiffs took reasonable steps to serve Defendant, including attempting to serve her personally at her current home address, and that it is likely that Defendant knew she had been sued. The judge also found that Defendant was on notice of the suit due to the service of her co-Defendants Richard Brenner and Jeffrey Johnson, who had been served earlier. The judge did not reach the other grounds in opposition to the motion.
