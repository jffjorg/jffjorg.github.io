 Case Number:  23PSCV00394    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANTS
EMAN TANAGHO AND MICHAEL TANAGHO’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO VACATE AND
SET ASIDE DEFAULTS is GRANTED, because the court must set
aside the default entered due to Defense Counsel’s error. 
 
Background
 
This case
arises from an attempt to collect a judgment. Plaintiff OR Construction, Inc.
alleges the following against Defendants Eman Tanagho (“Eman”) and Michael
Tanagho (“Michael”) (collectively, “Defendants”): On March 23, 2021, Plaintiff
received a final judgment in case no. 19PSCV01164 entitled OR CONSTRUCTION, INC. vs EMAN TANAGHO.[1]
However, to prevent Plaintiff’s from collecting their claim, Eman transferred
certain real property to her children, Jamil and Michael.[2]
 
On February
9, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit asserting the following causes of action (COAs): 1.     Set Aside Fraudulent Transfer 2.     Conspiracy
 
On October
19, 2023, the court allowed for service by publication.
 
On November
22, 2023, the proof of public was filed indicating that the summons was issued
in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune on 11/01/23, 11/08/23, 11/15/23, and
11/22/23.[3]
 
On January
23, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. 
 
On March 19,
2024, Defendants filed the instant motion. (An ‘answer’ has been ‘filed’ with
the court.) 
 
On April 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Declaration Of Stanley Kip Southwick In Response To
Motion To Vacate And Set Aside Defaults’ (“Opposition”). 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Defendants
make this application pursuant to C.C.P. §473(b) on the grounds of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Motion p. 2:2-3; see also Motion
p. 8:1-5.) 
 
In turn, CCP
section 473 subdivision (b) states that: “The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect . . . .”
 
Discussion
 
Defendants
move to set aside the default because of their attorney Counsel Jing Wang’s
excusable neglect. (Motion p. 9:4-9.) 
 
More
specifically, Defense Counsel explains that on 1/11/24, she sent an email to
Plaintiff’s Counsel with a new settlement offer[4]
and a request to extend the time to file a responsive pleading to 1/19/24, but
that Plaintiff’s Counsel did not respond that email and that in the interim, “she
became side-tracked with the trial preparation in her other case that was
scheduled to start trial on January 30, 2024.” (Motion p. 8:17-19.) 
 
According to the appellate court in Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 1119, 1128, “[a] party seeking relief under section 473 on the grounds
of excusable neglect bears the burden of demonstrating that the neglect was
excusable in order to secure relief. [internal citation omitted.] The test of whether neglect was excusable is whether a ‘reasonably prudent person’ under
the same or similar circumstances might have made the same error.” 
 
Here, absent
a meaningful analysis provided by Defense Counsel, it is unclear whether an
attorney’s preoccupation with another case is what a reasonable
attorney would have done. If the court is to subscribe to Defense Counsel’s
notion that an attorney forgetting about a case is reasonable, that
would obviate the very purpose of an attorney which is to advocate for
their clients, which inherently requires performing legal services in a timely
manner. 
 
Notwithstanding, as the basis of the motion is
that Counsel is at fault, it is unclear why Defense Counsel is seeking relief
under the discretionary provision instead of the mandatory provision of
CCP section 473(b).[5] Consequently, as “it is not what a paper is named, but what it is that fixes its
character,” (Parnham v. Parnham (1939) 32 Cal.App.2d 93, 96), the court turns to the mandatory provision of CCP
section 473(b). 
The mandatory relief
provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) apply
specifically to defaults, default judgments, and dismissals, and provide in
relevant part:
Notwithstanding any other
requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an
application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,[6]
is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit
attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate
any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk . . . or (2) resulting default
judgment or dismissal entered . . . . (emphasis and underline added.) 
Case law instructs that so
long as counsel is willing to fall on their sword, relief is mandatory. (See Abers
v. Rohrs (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1210.) “Section 473’s provision for
mandatory relief from a dismissal based upon a declaration of attorney error
does not require a determination the error was excusable. It applies even
when the attorney has no excuse.” (Ibid, emphasis added; see also SJP
Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511,
516-517 [“Relief is mandatory when a complying affidavit is filed, even if the
attorney's neglect was inexcusable.”]. 
Effectively, as Counsel has filed a declaration explaining that the
default was entered due to her oversight, no other explanation, including as to
the parties’ communications,[7] is
needed. 
To the extent that Plaintiff
opposes the motion, it does not appear to dispute that the default should be
set aside. Rather, Plaintiff asks for monetary sanction in the amount of $1,000
to be imposed upon Defendants and/or Counsel Wang pursuant to CCP section
473(c)(1)(A) for Defendants evading service. 
In
turn, the statute provides the following: 
(c)(1) Whenever the court grants relief from a default, default judgment,
or dismissal based on any of the provisions of this section, the court
may do any of the following:
(A) Impose a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an
offending attorney or party.
(B) Direct that an offending attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund.
(C) Grant other relief as is appropriate. 
However, section 473(b)(2)
expressly carves out an exception to the foregoing should the default have been
entered due to an attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. Thus,
imposition of monetary sanctions is precluded by statute based upon the facts
presented in this motion.[8]
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the
motion is granted.
