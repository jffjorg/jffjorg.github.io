And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Martha I. Dube Rowley, has filed a fifth petition to confirm the contractual arbitration award against Abraham Anthony Prattella, an individual. The court has previously denied similar petitions without prejudice, citing that Prattella is not a named party to the arbitration award. Despite clear instructions and previous rulings, the plaintiff continues to name Prattella as a party, defying the arbitrator's decision and the court's rulings. Therefore, the court denies the petition with prejudice and dismisses the case with prejudice.
