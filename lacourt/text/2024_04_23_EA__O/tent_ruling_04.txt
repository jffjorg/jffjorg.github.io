[1] A notice of related case has not
been filed. (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.300, subd. (b) [“Whenever a party in a civil action knows or learns
that the action or proceeding is related to another action or proceeding
pending, dismissed, or disposed of by judgment in any state or federal court in
California, the party must serve and file a Notice of Related Case.”].)
 


[2] Jamil passed away
and his undivided, half interest in the real property was passed to Michael as
a surviving joint tenant.
 


[3] Thus, service was
statutorily compliant. 
 


[4] The judgment in the
19PSCV01164 case was for $48,664.42. Based upon the court’s understanding,
Defendants’ settlement offer was for delivery of 2008 Toyota Sienna Passenger
Van and $3,000.00. Thus, while Defense Counsel may attest that she was “very
optimistic” that a settlement could be reached (Motion p. 5:4-6), the court is
somewhat unpersuaded as the cost of a used 2008 vehicle and $3,000 dramatically
falls short of the judgment. 


[5] CCP section 473, subdivision (b)
contains two distinct provisions for relief from default. (Todd v.
Thrifty Corp. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 986, 991.
 


[6] As the motion was
filed about two months after entry of default, the motion is timely. 
 


[7] According to the
motion and Counsel Wang’s declaration, the parties were attempting to settle
the matter. Counsel Wang explains that she was communicating with Plaintiff’s
attorney, Ryan Southwick, who stated that he would relay the settlement offer
to his client. (Motion p. 11.) Part of the offers included a request to file an
answer, which was granted by Plaintiff, requiring an answer by 1/19/24.
Counsel, however, due to trial preparation, overlooked the date.  
 


[8] Even if the court
were to grant the motion pursuant to the discretion provision of CCP section
473, the court would deny the request for sanctions against Defendants and/or
Defense Counsel Wang due to numerous attempts to settle the matter and
communications between the parties. (See Motion, Ex. A-J.) That said, in
opposition, Plaintiff’s Counsel Stanley Kip Southwick contends that Ryan
Southwick is a legal assistant. But that is inapposite as Plaintiff’s emails
with Plaintiff’s firm is to Skip Southwick and Ryan is merely CC’d to the
emails; the emails sent from Plaintiff’s firm are in fact signed by
Stanley.
