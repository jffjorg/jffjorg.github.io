And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by Protective Insurance Company to amend the judgment against Angel On My Shoulder, Inc. to add another name, Angeles On My Shoulder, Inc. The plaintiff's attorney claims to have discovered this information through a search of the defendant's business records. The court previously requested more information on how the attorney came by this information and continued the hearing to allow the plaintiff to file additional evidence. The supplemental declaration filed by the plaintiff's attorney includes five exhibits, including screen captures of business searches from the California Secretary of State's website. However, the court is concerned that it is unclear which entity the exhibits apply to, and will request clarification on Exhibits A and B at the hearing. The court will also request information on whether the plaintiff has served the defendant with the various motions filed in connection with this issue.
