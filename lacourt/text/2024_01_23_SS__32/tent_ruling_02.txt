CASE NUMBER:


21STCV13238




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Default




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Debora M Reed




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On April 7, 2021, Plaintiff Vita Lancucka (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendant Debora M Reed and Does 1 through 100 for negligence
and premises liability. 
 
On July 30, 2021, default was entered against Defendant Debora M Reed
(“Defendant”). 
 
On August 2, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On September 28, 2023, the Court informed Defendant that it was in
default.
 
On October 16, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to set aside
the default. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
“After six months from default, a
trial court may still vacate a default on equitable ground even if statutory
relief is unavailable.”¿ (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975,
981.)¿ A party may obtain equitable relief from
an entry of dismissal based on an extrinsic mistake when the moving party: (1)
has a meritorious case, (2) articulates a satisfactory excuse for not
presenting a defense to the original action, and (3) demonstrates diligence in
seeking to set aside the dismissal once discovered.¿ (Id. at p. 982.)¿ 
 
An extrinsic
mistake is broadly defined “. . . to encompass almost any set of extrinsic
circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing. It does not
seem to matter if the particular circumstances qualify as fraudulent or
mistaken in the strict sense.”¿(In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d
337, 342.) An ‘extrinsic’ mistake means a mistake that deprived a party of the
opportunity to present a claim or defense while an ‘intrinsic’ mistake is one
that goes to the merits of a proceeding.¿ (In re Marriage of Stevenot (1984) 154
Cal.App.3d 1051, 1064-1065.)¿ 
 
A default cannot
be set aside when the complaining party’s negligence contributed to the rise to
the fraud or mistake.¿(See Kulchar v. Kulchar (1969) 1 Cal.3d 467,
473-474 [complaining party’s failure to investigate and assemble evidence at
trial as grounds for denying equitable relief sought].)¿An extrinsic mistake
may result from a disability when the disability renders the party incompetent or
incapacitated such that it deprives the party from asserting a claim or
defense. (See id. at pp. 471-472.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
Defendant asks the Court to set aside the default on
equitable grounds. Defendant’s counsel states that Plaintiff will not stipulate
to setting aside the default. No opposition has been filed by Plaintiff. 
 
Defendant contends she had no notice that default was entered
against her and argues none of the parties realized this until September 28,
2023, when the Court observed the default during a final status conference.
(Min. Order, 9/28/23; Mann Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant argues that after filing her
answer a few days after default was entered, the parties began discovery to
litigate the case. (Mann Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
Defendant appears to contend that the extrinsic mistake was
that the Court accepted Defendant’s answer, despite the entry of default, and
signed a subsequent trial continuance stipulation. (Motion, 6.) However, although
Defendant does not appear to discuss the three elements under Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, there, the court declined to decide
whether a different test applied when default judgment had not been entered.
(See Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal.4th at 982.) Here, the
record shows that Defendant filed an answer three days after default was
entered, and Defendant asserts she participated in discovery. Additionally, on
October 14, 2022, the Court signed a stipulation to continue trial. Also, it
does not appear that Plaintiff requested default judgment until November 1,
2023. Therefore, in light of the above, and seeing no opposition, the motion to
set aside the entry of default is granted on equitable grounds. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set aside the default
entered against her on July 30, 2021.   
 
The Court accepts the answer filed on August 2, 2021 as the operative
responsive pleading. The matter is set for a Final Status Conference on May 8,
2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Trial is set for May 22, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.
 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
