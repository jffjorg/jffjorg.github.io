CASE NUMBER:


21STCV22840




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Tax Costs




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Andrew Rosen and Julie Rosen




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Samuel Youngs Edgerton III



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 18, 2021, Plaintiffs Andrew Rosen and Julie Rosen (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint against Defendant Samuel Youngs Edgerton III (“Defendant”) for
negligence and premises liability.
 
On November 12, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On September 26, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment. Judgment for Defendant was entered on October 24, 2023. 
 
On November 8, 2023, Defendant filed and served his Memorandum of
Costs (forms MC-010 and MC-011), claiming $15,881.52 in costs. 
 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to strike
Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs, or in the alternative, Tax Costs. 
 
The opposition was due January 9, 2024, but filed on January 16, 2024.
However, seeing no prejudice to Plaintiffs, the Court will consider Defendant’s
untimely opposition.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”¿Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount.”¿“Items not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) There is no requirement that copies of bills,
invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs
must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) 
 
On a motion to tax, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill appear to
be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to
the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision
is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because the right to costs is
governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to award costs not
statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The court’s first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and
whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.) The objecting
party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were not necessary or
reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs are not
recoverable. (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and
filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was
served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiffs assert that this motion was due on
November 28, 2023. (Motion, 4.) However, the motion was filed on November 29,
2023. Regardless, the proof of service of the Cost Memorandum shows it was
served electronically on November 8, 2023, which was a court day. Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4) states “[a]ny document that is served
electronically between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day shall be
deemed served on that court day. Any document that is served electronically on
a noncourt day shall be deemed served on the next court day.” Therefore, the
Memorandum of Costs was deemed served on November 8, 2023. Fifteen days after
was November 23, 2023. Since Plaintiffs filed this motion on November 29, 2023,
it is untimely. However, in the opposition, Defendant did not challenge the timeliness
of Plaintiffs’ motion. Therefore, the Court will consider the merits of the
motion.[1] 
 
Plaintiffs next argue the memorandum of costs was prematurely served.
(Motion, 5.) However, as Defendant indicates, because he served the Cost
Memorandum on November 8, 2023, and within 180 days after judgment was entered
on October 24, 2023, it is timely. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1).)  The record does not indicate that the clerk
served notice of the entry of judgment. 
 
Turning to the merits of the motion, as Plaintiffs did not “recover
any relief against” Defendant, Defendant is the prevailing party in this
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Defendant is therefore
entitled to recover his costs.
 
Plaintiffs object to and seek to strike the following portions of
Defendant’s memorandum of costs: filing and motion fees, deposition costs,
service of process, witness fees, and other. 
 
Filing
and Motion Fees, Deposition Costs
 
Plaintiffs do not provide any evidence or argument as to why the
filing or motion fees are unreasonable. Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(1)
expressly allows for filing, motion, and jury fees. Similarly, Plaintiffs also
do not show how the deposition costs are unreasonable. Accordingly, the Court
denies the motion as to these costs.
 
Expert
Witness
 
Plaintiffs argue that the $4,725 in costs for expert witness John
Brault (item 8b) is not allowed under section 1033.5. Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5(b)(1), fees of experts not ordered by the court are not
allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law. 
 
In
opposition, Defendant does not address this objection. The Court notes that
item 8b of the Cost Memorandum allows expert fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure 998. Defendant does not indicate that a 998 offer was made during
this case. As a result, Defendant fails to show the cost was allowed under
1033.5. As a result, the Court grants the motion to strike as to the expert
witness cost. 
 
Deposition
Costs
 
Plaintiffs challenge item 4 ($8,104.23), because it includes costs for
deposition transcripts. Section 1033.5(b)(5) only excludes transcripts of court
proceedings not ordered by the court. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(5).) Instead,
Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(3)(A) expressly authorizes costs for the “[t]aking, video recording,
and transcribing” necessary depositions. Therefore, Plaintiffs have
failed to show the costs are not allowed under the statute.
 
Second, Plaintiffs argue the amount is unreasonable. Looking at the
face of the memorandum, the amount for depositions does not appear
unreasonable. Also, Plaintiff provides no evidence or argument for why the
amount is unreasonable. Therefore, the Court denies the motion as to these
costs. (See County of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113-14
[the party did not meet its burden where it submitted no affidavits in support
of motion to tax costs, but merely alleged depositions were unnecessary or
unreasonable].)
 
Other
 
Plaintiffs also object to the $513.75 in “other” costs, arguing it is
not allowed under section 1033.5. However, the memorandum indicates this cost
is for the Motion for Summary Judgment Reservation fee. Plaintiff does not
provide a reason why the motion reservation fee is not allowed as a motion fee.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(a).)  Therefore,
Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden. As a result, the Court denies the motion
as to these costs.  
 
Lastly, Plaintiffs objected to the Service of Process costs in their
Notice of Motion but failed to provide any argument or reason in their
memorandum. The costs appear reasonable on the face of the Cost Memorandum.
Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden and the motion to strike these
costs is denied. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to strike costs is GRANTED in
part and DENIED in part. 
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
