And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vita Lancucka v. Debora M Reed, case number 21STCV13238. The Defendant, Debora M Reed, has filed a motion to set aside the default that was entered against her on July 30, 2021. The Court has granted the motion on equitable grounds.

The case began on April 7, 2021, when Plaintiff Vita Lancucka filed a complaint against Defendant Debora M Reed. On July 30, 2021, default was entered against the Defendant. The Defendant then filed an answer on August 2, 2021.

The Defendant argues that she was not aware that default had been entered against her until September 28, 2023, when the Court observed the default during a final status conference. The Defendant also argues that she participated in discovery after filing her answer and that the Court signed a stipulation to continue trial on October 14, 2022. The Plaintiff did not request default judgment until November 1, 2023.

The Court has considered the legal standard for setting aside a default, which is found in California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The Court has also considered the case of Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, which sets out the elements that must be met in order to obtain equitable relief from an entry of dismissal.

In this case, the Court has found that the Defendant has met the elements of Rappleyea v. Campbell and has granted the motion to set aside the default on equitable grounds. The matter is now set for a Final Status Conference on May 8, 2024, and trial is set for May 22, 2024.
