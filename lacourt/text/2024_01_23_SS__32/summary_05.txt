And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena served on International Orthopedic Center (IOC) by the defendants, Randy George Cudworth, Del Amo Construction, Inc., and Enterprise FM Trust LSR. The judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than 60 days after the date for production, and that the defendants failed to demonstrate that they engaged in a good faith meet and confer process with IOC before filing the motion. The judge also noted that IOC's non-compliance with the subpoena was clear on March 1, 2022, when the records were not produced, and that the defendants had 60 days to meet and confer with IOC to try to resolve the issue before filing the motion. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to compel and rejected the defendants' request for monetary sanctions.
