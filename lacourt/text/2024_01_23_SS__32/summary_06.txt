The two cases involve common questions of law and fact and stem from the same motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 29, 2020 in El Monte, California. The Plaintiff in Kroger is the employer of the Plaintiff in the present case, seeking worker's compensation benefits. The Court finds that the motion to consolidate is timely and does not present any complexity or prejudice issues. Therefore, the motion is granted, and all future papers must be filed in 22STCV07018 only and all future hearings must be scheduled in 22STCV07018 only.
