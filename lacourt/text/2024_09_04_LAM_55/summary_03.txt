And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the notice to pay rent or quit served on the defendants is defective. The defendants claimed that the notice precludes payment by mail, but the court finds that the notice complies with Section 1161(2) of the California Code of Civil Procedure because it does not preclude payment by mail. The notice includes a street address and does not require in-person payments, and the inclusion of the hours and days that in-person payments can be made does not preclude payment by mail. Therefore, the court has denied the defendants' motion.
