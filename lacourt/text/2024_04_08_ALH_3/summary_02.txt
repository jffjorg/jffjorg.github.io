And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the plaintiff's motions to compel defendants to serve timely responses to discovery requests and to deem admitted certain requests for admission. The defendants failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, despite being given two extensions. The judge found that the defendants' excuses for not serving responses, including the age and health of one of the defendants, were unpersuasive. The judge ordered the defendants to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days of the date of the order. The judge also granted the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the requests for admission. The judge imposed monetary sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $2,998.96, consisting of 8 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $300, $493.20 in motion reservation fees, and $105.76 for e-filing fees. The defendants and their counsel are jointly and severally liable for the sanctions.
