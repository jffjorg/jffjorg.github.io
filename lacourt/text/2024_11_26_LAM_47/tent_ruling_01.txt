STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on May 23, 2024. Plaintiff leased a 2022
Honda Pilot which developed numerous defects in every major system of the
vehicle. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production, form interrogatories, and special
interrogatories propounded to Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED IN PART as to Requests
Nos. 13-24, 26, 35, 48-52, 57, 60, and 62 only and otherwise DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED IN PART with respect to
Interrogatories Nos. 1.1 and 15.1 only and otherwise DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED IN PART as to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 1, 6, 15, and 20 through 22 and otherwise DENIED.  
 
Defendant is ordered to provide
verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the requests specified
herein within 30 days of this order.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 13-24,
26-27, 34-35, 46, 48-52, 57-58, 60-62, 65-66, 69, and 71-72 propounded to
Defendant. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Plaintiff propounded the Requests
for Production at issue on this motion to Defendant on July 19, 2024.
(Declaration of Sam Azmitash ISO Mot. ¶ 8; Exh. D.) Defendant provided
responses on responses on August 20, 2024 via email, and verifications by email
on August 23, 2024. (Id.¶ 9; Exh. E.) 45 days plus two court days for
service by email was October 9, 2024. Although this motion was not filed until
October 10, 2024, it was served on October 9, 2024. As the Code of Civil
Procedure specifies that notice must be given within the time limit, the
Court finds that the motion is timely made because it was served on the October
9 deadline. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a
meet-and-confer letter to Defendant’s counsel on September 20, 2024. (Azimtash Decl.
¶ 11; Exh. F.) No response was received. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff has
therefore satisfied her statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
Good Cause
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant. Plaintiff’s
moving papers offer no explanation of why good cause exists for these requests
beyond sweeping assertions that all of the requests at issue are necessary to
support a Song-Beverly claim. This is not “a fact specific showing of
relevance” as required to demonstrate good cause. (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th
443, 448.) The Court therefore refuses to compel further responses to any
request whose relevance is not facially apparent.
 
1.      Requests Nos. 13-24, 26, 57, 60, 62,
 
Requests 13 through 24, 26, 57, 60,
and 62 seek, in essence, any document of any kind which relates to “powertrain
defects” in any 2022 Honda Pilot. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. Nos. 13-24, 26, 57,
60, 62.)  Plaintiff defines “powertrain
defects” to mean “such defects which result in symptoms, including but not
limited to any of the following: symptoms related to vehicle jerking while
driving; symptoms related to vehicle hesitating when accelerating; symptoms
related to vehicle’s braking uncontrollably; symptoms related to vehicle
slowing down by itself’ symptoms related to brake being faulty; symptoms
related to bouncing back and forth of vehicle when shifting; symptoms leading
to update of Programmed Fuel Injection Software; and/or any other similar
concern identified in the repair history for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.” (Azimtash
Decl. Exh. D. p.3:11-17.) 
 
Powertrain defects are expressly
alleged as one of the many defects in the vehicle. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Evidence
of similar defects in other vehicles are both relevant and admissible. (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153.) Admissible evidence is
discoverable. (Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117-18.) Documents regarding warranty complaints, service
histories, and employee records concerning a defect in all affected vehicles,
as well as documents regarding the manufacturer’s responses and instructions to
cure that defect are discoverable. (See Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 971 [holding that the trial court’s approval of a
discovery referee’s report and recommendation of sanctions for failure to
produce documents of this nature relating to the subject defect in all affected
vehicles was not an abuse of discretion].) 
 
The Court therefore finds that
these requests readily demonstrate their relevance to this dispute, and,
therefore, good cause for these requests.
 
2.     
Requests Nos. 27, 46, 58, 
 
Requests Nos. 27, 46, and 58 seek documents
more broadly related to 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles, including (1) documents
concerning any technical service bulletins (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. No. 27); (2)
all documents relating to 2022 Honda Pilots which were repurchased or replaced
(No. 46); and (3) all Early Warning Reports Defendant submitted to the NHTSA
concerning 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles (No. 48.) These requests are overbroad, as
they extend beyond documents pertaining to similar defects in the same year,
make, and model of vehicle into other, unrelated defects. The Court therefore
does not find good cause for these requests. 
 
3.     
 Requests
Nos. 34, 61, 65
 
Requests Nos. 34, 61, and 65 seek
documents relied upon or employed in other actions concerning the same
powertrain defects. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. Nos. 34, 61, 65.) As Plaintiff has
not demonstrated the relevance of other actions to this dispute, the Court does
not find good cause for these requests.
 
4.     
Request No. 35
 
Request No. 35 seeks any document
on which Defendant relied in formulating its Answer to the Complaint. (Exh. D.
No. 35.) This request bears directly on the pleadings in this action and
therefore shows good cause on its face.
 
5.     
Requests Nos. 48-52
 
Requests Nos. 48 through 52 seek
documents regarding management of customer call centers (No. 48), efforts and
objectives to reduce repurchases or vehicle replacements (Nos. 49-50), plans,
policies, and procedures for achieving buyback reduction goals (No. 51) and
reports of repurchases or replacements authorized by Defendant or any of its
agents or employees (No. 52.).) Contrary to Defendant’s assertion that “motive
is irrelevant,” these materials are directly relevant to Plaintiff’s
Song-Beverly claims, because whether a policy or procedure demonstrates a lack
of good faith is a question to be decided by a jury. (See, e.g., Kwan v.
Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186.) As evidence
must be relevant to be considered by a jury (see Evid. Code § 350), materials
which go to the intent behind policies or procedures must therefore be
relevant. Relevant evidence is discoverable. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)
These requests demonstrate good cause on their face.
 
6.     
Requests Nos. 66, 69, 72, and 72
 
These requests seek (1) Defendant’s
dealership agreement with DCH Honda of Oxnard (Exh. D. No. 66); (2) reports
from the dealership regarding its repair procedures (No. 69); (3) repair
literature provided to the dealership (No. 71) and documents relating to
replacement parts provided to the dealership (No. 72.) Nothing in Plaintiff’s
papers establishes the relevance of these requests. Plaintiff has therefore
failed to demonstrate good cause for these requests. 
 
Defendant’s Responses
 
            Defendant
asserted substantively similar responses to all of the requests for which good
cause has been shown, asserting objections for vagueness, ambiguity,
overbreadth, irrelevance, argumentative requests, and invading attorney-client privilege,
the work-product doctrine, and privacy, before refusing to provide substantive
answers or asserting, subject to those objections, that no responsive documents
exist. (See Azimtash Decl. Exh. E.) Although Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s
objections have been waived by the failure to serve verified responses
within the statutory time to respond, Plaintiff is mistaken. Timely responses
to discovery preserve objections even if those responses are unverified. (Food
4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651,
657.) 
 
            As to the
substance of Defendant’s objections, Defendant asserts that the remaining
discovery requests employ such nebulous and far-reaching terms that they cannot
be answered or otherwise touch on matters which are not germane to this action.
The Court disagrees. The outstanding requests are directly tethered to the
allegations in the pleadings or are expressly relevant under well-settled case
law. The Court is therefore not persuaded that the requests are so vague as to
preclude Defendant from intelligibly responding. Moreover, Defendant has
entirely failed to address its privilege, work-product, or privacy objections
as to the remaining requests, and has therefore not justified its objections in
that respect.
 
            The Court
therefore finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling further
responses to Requests for Production Nos. 13-24, 26, 35, 48-52, 57, 60, and 62
only.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is
GRANTED IN PART as to Requests Nos. 13-24, 26, 35, 48-52, 57, 60, and 62 only
and otherwise DENIED. 
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 3.7, 12.1
through 12.5, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1 through 50.6 propounded to Defendant. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Plaintiff propounded the
interrogatories at issue on this motion to Defendant on July 19, 2024.
(Declaration of Sam Azmitash ISO Mot. ¶ 8; Exh. D.) Defendant provided
responses on responses on August 20, 2024 via email, and verifications by email
on August 23, 2024. (Id.¶ 9; Exh. E.) 45 days plus two court days for
service by email was October 9, 2024. Although this motion was not filed until
October 10, 2024, it was served on October 9, 2024. As the Code of Civil
Procedure specifies that notice must be given within the time limit, the
Court finds that the motion is timely made because it was served on the October
9 deadline. 
 
Meet and
Confer
 
A party making a
motion to compel further responses must include a declaration stating facts
showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues
presented by the motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2030.310(b).) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a
meet-and-confer letter to Defendant’s counsel on September 20, 2024. (Azimtash
Decl. ¶ 11; Exh. F.) No response was received. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff has
therefore satisfied her statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
//
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 3.7, 12.1
through 12.5, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1 through 50.6. Although Plaintiff asserts
that Defendant’s objections have been waived by the failure to serve verified
responses within the statutory time to respond, Plaintiff is mistaken. Timely
responses to discovery preserve objections even if those responses are
unverified. (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (Fletcher)
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) 
 
1.     
Interrogatory No. 1.1
 
Form Interrogatory No. 1.1 seeks the contact information of
each person who prepared or assisted in the preparation of the responses to the
interrogatories. (Plaintiff’s Exh. D. No. 1.1.) Defendant responded by
asserting boilerplate objections for invasion of the attorney-client privilege,
the work-product doctrine, and privacy, before answering that the responses
were prepared by counsel based on information gathered from documents related
to the vehicle in this lawsuit. (Id. Exh. E. No. 1.1.) Defendant does
not address its objections in its opposition to this motion beyond asserting
that its response was sufficient. The Court disagrees. Defendant has not
justified its objections, and, moreover, a code-compliant response to this
interrogatory would have, at minimum, identified the attorneys who prepared
these interrogatories with the information required. Plaintiff is entitled to a
further response to this request.
 
2.     
Interrogatory No. 3.7
 
Form Interrogatory No. 3.7 asks if
any public entity has registered or licensed the respondent’s business in the
past five years, and asks them to identify each license or registration, state
the name of the public entity, and give the dates of issuance and expiration.
(Exh. D. No. 3.7.) Defendant asserted objections for overbreadth, irrelevance,
and undue burden, before stating that it has been registered with the Secretary
of State since 1959. (Id. Exh. E. No. 3.7.) 
 
Defendant contends that this
interrogatory is entirely immaterial to this action. In response, Plaintiff
claims that the interrogatory is inquiring into whether Defendant has been
registered or licensed by any public entity in a manner that is “relevant to
its business activities involving the manufacture, sale, or warranty of
vehicles.” (Reply p.4:24-26.) The Court is not persuaded. Broad inquiries into
whether a vehicle manufacturer has been nonspecifically “registered or
licensed” has no bearing on this dispute. Plaintiff is not entitled to a
further response to this request.
 
3.     
Interrogatory No. 12.1 
 
Form Interrogatory No. 12.1 seeks the contact information of each
individual who witnessed the “incident”, made any statements at the scene,
heard any statements made about the incident at the scene, or who respondent or
anyone acting on respondent’s behalf claims has knowledge of the incident
except for expert witnesses. (Plaintiff’s Exh. D. No. 12.1.) “Incident” is
defined as “each and every opportunity that the Subject Vehicle was presented
to [Defendant’s] authorized repair facility for repairs, maintenance, and/or
service.” (Exh. D. p.2.) Defendant asserted objections for vagueness,
ambiguity, overbreadth, and invasion of privacy, before identifying two
dealerships and, on information and belief, various technicians, service
advisors, and counsel. (Plaintiff’s Exh. E. No. 12.1.) The Court fails to see
how Defendant’s response is insufficient, notwithstanding Plaintiff’s assertion
that Defendant is obligated to provide information to which it has access. Despite
asserting objections, Defendant substantively responded by identifying the
locations where the vehicle was presented for repairs, provided identifying
information for each prospective witness, and explained the inability to
provide further detail. This response appears sufficient, and Plaintiff has not
demonstrated that a further response is warranted. 
 
4.      Form Interrogatories Nos. 12.2 through 12.5
 
Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.2 through 12.5 asks whether the Respondent has
interviewed any individual concerning the incident, has obtained any written
statements, video recordings, models, or diagrams regarding the incident, and
to provide contact information of all individuals involved with any of this
evidence. (See, e.g, Plaintiff’s Exh. D. No. 12.2.) Defendant asserted similar
boilerplate objections to each response before categorically stating, subject
to those objections, “No.” (Exh. E. Nos. 12.2-12.5.) Notwithstanding the
objections, these responses are sufficient. Each interrogatory asks a yes-or-no
question to which Defendant responded,“no.” No further response is required. 
 
5.      Form Interrogatory No. 15.1
 
Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 asks
the respondent to identify each denial of a material allegation and each
special or affirmative defense and for each state all facts on which the denial
is based, provide the contact information of all persons with knowledge of
those facts, and identify all documents and other tangible things which support
that position and the contact information of the person who has each document.
(Plaintiff’s Exh. D No. 15.1.) In response, Defendant merely asserted
objections for vagueness, ambiguity, overbreadth, and the work-product doctrine
and privilege, before stating that they were asserted preemptively to preserve
its potential defenses. This response is evasive on its face. Plaintiff is
entitled to a plain statement of the facts, evidence, and witnesses which would
tend to support Defendant’s contentions in its answer. 
 
6.     
Form Interrogatory No.  17.1
 
Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 seeks
all facts in support of any response other than an unqualified admission to the
contemporaneous requests for admission, the contact information of anyone with knowledge
of those facts, any documents or tangible things in support of that response,
and the contact information of anyone with those documents. (Plaintiff’s Exh.
D. No. 17.1.)
 
Although Plaintiff challenges the
sufficiency of Defendant’s response to portions of this interrogatory,
Plaintiff has not furnished the Court with the requests for admissions on which
this interrogatory is premised. As a consequence, the Court cannot determine
the sufficiency of the responses. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has
not demonstrated that a further response is warranted.
 
7.     
Form Interrogatory No. 50.1
 
Form Interrogatory No. 50.1 seeks
documents related to any agreement alleged in the pleadings and the contact
information of each person in possession of those documents, as well as any
persons with knowledge of unwritten modifications to the agreement and any
documents which evidence those modifications. (Plaintiff’s Exh. D. No. 50.1.)
Defendant responded to this interrogatory by identifying the 2022 Honda Pilot
Warranty Booklet and sale contract for the subject vehicle, before stating
these materials should be in Plaintiff’s possession. (Exh. E. No. 50.1.)
Defendant categorically stated there are no portions of the agreements not in
writing, and there are no modifications to those agreements. (Id.) This
response is sufficient, and no further response is required. 
 
8.     
Form Interrogatories Nos. 50.2-50.6
 
Form Interrogatories 50.2 through
50.6 seek information regarding breach, excuse of performance, voluntary
termination, enforceability, or ambiguity regarding each agreement alleged in
the pleadings. (See, e.g., Plaintiff’s Exh. D. No. 50.2-50.6.) In response to
each, Defendant asserted boilerplate objections for vagueness, ambiguity,
invasion of attorney-client privilege, and invasion of the work-product
doctrine, before categorically asserting that Defendant does not contend any
agreement was breached, had performance excused or was terminated, or is
unenforceable or ambiguous. (Exh. E. Nos. 50.2-50.6.) These responses are
sufficient, notwithstanding the objections, and no further response is
required. Plaintiff’s assertions regarding policies and procedures are not
material to these interrogatories, which only pertain to agreements, not
to policy and procedure documents. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories is
GRANTED IN PART with respect to Interrogatories Nos. 1.1 and 15.1 only and
otherwise DENIED. 
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1, 6, 8-9,
12, 15, and 17 through 23 propounded to Defendant.

Plaintiff propounded the
interrogatories at issue on this motion to Defendant on July 19, 2024.
(Declaration of Sam Azmitash ISO Mot. ¶ 8; Exh. D.) Defendant provided
responses on responses on August 20, 2024 via email, and verifications by email
on August 23, 2024. (Id.¶ 9; Exh. E.) 45 days plus two court days for
service by email was October 9, 2024. Although this motion was not filed until

//
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1, 6, 8-9, 12, 15, and 17 through 23
propounded to Defendant. Although Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s objections
have been waived by the failure to serve verified responses within the
statutory time to respond, Plaintiff is mistaken. Timely responses to discovery
preserve objections even if those responses are unverified. (Food 4 Less
Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) 
 
1.     
Special Interrogatory No. 1
 
Special Interrogatory No.1 asked
Defendant to identify each agent or employee of any Defendant who inspected the
vehicle that is the subject of the action, performed repairs on the vehicle, or
was present when those vehicles took place. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. No. 1.) Defendant’s
response asserted boilerplate objections for vagueness, ambiguity, overbreadth,
irrelevance, and invasion of privacy, before identifying AHM Field Technical
Specialist Serge Vang, DCH Honda of Oxnard, and Ocean Honda of Ventura. (Id.
Exh. E. No.1.) Defendant then referred Plaintiff to the service records from
DCH Honda of Oxnard and Ocean Honda of Ventura, citing Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.230. (Id.)
 
Defendant argues that its response is
sufficient without endeavoring to justify its objections as to this response.
Because Defendant has not addressed its objections in connection with this
response, the Court disagrees. Plaintiff is entitled to a complete response
without objections.
 
2.     
Special Interrogatory No. 6
 
Special Interrogatory No. 6 asks
Defendant whether it contends that it is under no obligation to repurchase or
replace the subject vehicle, and if so, to describe, in detail, the facts
supporting that contention. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. No. 6.) In response,
Defendant asserted objections for vagueness, ambiguity, and overbreadth, as
well as to the extent the question called for a legal conclusion or analysis,
before offering a narrative explanation and referring Plaintiff to other
documents. (Id. Exh. E. No. 6.) 
 
Defendant argues that its response
is sufficient without endeavoring to justify its objections as to this
response. Because Defendant has not addressed its objections in connection with
this response, the Court disagrees. Plaintiff is entitled to a complete
response without objections.
 
3.     
Special Interrogatory No. 8
 
Special Interrogatory No. 8 asks
Defendant to state, for each code or identifier that corresponds “to a
potential or actual condition, issue, problem or defect” corresponding to the
“powertrain defects” in 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles, a description of the issue
and the databases, systems, or software in which the code or identifier can be
used. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. No. 8.) Plaintiff defines “powertrain defects” to
mean “such defects which result in symptoms, including but not limited to any
of the following: symptoms related to vehicle jerking while driving; symptoms
related to vehicle hesitating when accelerating; symptoms related to vehicle’s
braking uncontrollably; symptoms related to vehicle slowing down by itself;
symptoms related to brake being faulty; symptoms related to bouncing back and
forth of vehicle when shifting; symptoms leading to update of Programmed Fuel
Injection Software; and/or any other similar concern identified in the repair
history for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.” (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. p.3:21-28.) 
 
Defendant objected to this
interrogatory as compound on its face, as well as vague, ambiguous, overbroad,
irrelevant, and invading privacy. The Court concurs with Defendant that this
interrogatory is compound on its face in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.060 subdivision (f). Moreover, Plaintiff does not explain, either
in her moving papers or her Separate Statement, what information this
interrogatory seeks that has some bearing on the case at hand. The Court is not
persuaded that a further response is warranted to this interrogatory.
 
4.     
Special Interrogatory No. 9
 
Special Interrogatory No. 9 asks
Defendant to list each database, system, or software used to store, query, or
analyze a laundry list of categories of information. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D.
No. 9.) Defendant objected to this interrogatory as, inter alia,
compound on its face. The Court concurs. Plaintiff is not entitled to a further
response to this interrogatory. 
 
5.     
Special Interrogatory No. 12
 
Special Interrogatory No. 12 asks
Defendant to state the number of days shown by its records that the subject
vehicle was out of service by reason of any defect or condition complained of
by Plaintiff. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. No. 12.) Defendant asserted boilerplate
objections for vagueness, ambiguity, overbreadth, irrelevance, and not
accounting for “the statutory construct of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.” (Exh. E. No. 12.) Defendant does not address its objections in the
opposition to this motion, and, therefore, has not justified those objections.
Plaintiff is entitled to a further response to this interrogatory.
 
6.     
Special Interrogatory No. 15
 
Special Interrogatory No. 15 asks
Defendant to describe, in detail, all steps Defendant or its authorized repair
facilities took to repair and permanently fix the powertrain defects in the
subject vehicle. (Azimtash Exh. D No. 15.) Defendant responded with
substantively identical boilerplate objections, before referring Plaintiff to
the service records from DCH Honda of Oxnard and Ocean Honda of Ventura and the
Tech Line Contact Reports. (Id. Exh. E. No. 15.) 
 
Defendant, in opposition, asserts
that this interrogatory is vague, overbroad, and irrelevant. Defendant is
wrong. The interrogatory, in plain terms, asks Defendant to describe what
actions it took to repair the vehicle which is alleged to be defective.
Plaintiff is entitled to a straightforward response. 
 
7.     
Special Interrogatories Nos. 17-19
 
Special Interrogatories Nos. 17,
18, and 19 ask Defendant to state, respectively, any past, present, or future
assessments relating to the powertrain defects in 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles (Azimtash
Decl. Exh. D. no. 17), any past or future modifications of the manufacturing
process for 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles, (no. 18), and its assessment of the
powertrain defects in 2022 Honda Pilot Vehicles (no. 19), with specified categories
of information for all three interrogatories. Defendant objected to these
interrogatories as, inter alia, compound on their face and overbroad. (Id.
Exh. E. Nos. 17-19.) The Court concurs. Plaintiff is not entitled to a further
response to these interrogatories.
 
8.     
 Special
Interrogatory Nos. 20-21
 
Special Interrogatories Nos. 20
and 21 ask Defendant to identify all databases maintained by it or its agents
containing electronically stored information relating to its efforts to
investigate and repair powertrain defects in 2022 Honda Pilot vehicles.
(Azimtash Decl. Exh. D. Nos. 20, 21.) Defendant objected to these
interrogatories as overbroad, irrelevant, vague, “directed to discovery on
discovery,” and argumentative. (Id. Exh. E. Nos. 20, 21.) None of these
objections have merit. First, “discovery on discovery” is not a valid
objection, and none of the authorities cited by Defendant stand for the
position that Plaintiff may not inquire into the manner in which Defendant
stores relevant information. (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546 [discussing the broad scope of discovery]; Lipton v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611 [same]; Stewart v.
Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013 [same].)
Second, an interrogatory which asks where Defendant stores information that
relates, on its face, to the allegations in the pleadings is by definition
“reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence” and is not overbroad or
vague on its face. Nor is the Court persuaded that the interrogatories are
argumentative, as Defendant need not acknowledge that the vehicle was, in fact,
defective to come into possession of records investigating, among other things,
whether a defect existed at all. The Court is not satisfied that these
objections have merit. As Defendant does not address the remainder of its
objections with respect to these interrogatories, the Court finds that those
objections are similarly unjustified. 
 
Plaintiff is therefore entitled to
a further response to these interrogatories.
 
9.     
Special Interrogatory No. 22
 
Special Interrogatory No. 22 asks
Defendant to identify all databases, custodians, and search terms used to
respond to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents. (Azimtash Decl.
Exh. D. No. 22.) Defendant objected to these interrogatories as overbroad,
vague, “directed to discovery on discovery,” argumentative, and invading
attorney-client privilege. (Id. Exh. E. No. 22.) These objections are
specious and evasive. Plaintiff is manifestly entitled to inquire into the
search methods used by Defendant to produce documents in response to discovery
so as to determine whether there is any deficiency in Defendant’s production.
Moreover, Defendant makes no showing that any material is privileged and fails
to explain how this request is “overbroad or vague” beyond bare assertions.
Further, as stated above, “discovery on discovery” is not a valid objection.
The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a further response to
this interrogatory.
 
10.  Special
Interrogatory No. 23
 
Special Interrogatory No. 23 asks
Defendant to identify all documents reviewed by it or its employees, agents, or
representatives in denying the request for repurchase. (Azimtash Decl. Exh. D.
No. 23.) In response, Defendant asserted objections for vagueness, ambiguity,
and overbreadth, before responding that the interrogatory is not applicable
because Defendant did not deny a pre-litigation request for refund or
replacement. (Id. Exh. E. No. 23.) Notwithstanding the boilerplate
nature of Defendant’s objections, the Court finds this response sufficient.
Defendant plainly states that it did not deny a request for repurchase. No
further response is required.
