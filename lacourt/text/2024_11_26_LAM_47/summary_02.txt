And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The plaintiff failed to provide evidence establishing the existence of a settlement, the terms of the settlement, and the parties' compliance or lack thereof. The plaintiff's motion consisted solely of a two-page notice of motion and a proof of service, without a memorandum of points and authorities. As a result, the judge finds that the motion lacks sufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's claims. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and notes that any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by the next day. The judge also warns that submitting on the tentative ruling will waive the right to be present at the hearing and may result in an order that modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
