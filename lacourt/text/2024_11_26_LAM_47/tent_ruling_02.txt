STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This was an action for employment discrimination and retaliation.
Plaintiff alleged that the City of Los Angeles failed to provide Plaintiff a
private room to pump her breast milk and that she suffered retaliation when she
complained.

settlement agreement between the parties. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to enforce a
settlement agreement between the parties. However, Plaintiff’s “moving papers”
consist of a two-page notice of motion and a proof of service. No memorandum of
points and authorities is included, nor has Plaintiff furnished any evidence
establishing the existence of a settlement, the terms of any settlement, and
the parties’ compliance or lack thereof. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
