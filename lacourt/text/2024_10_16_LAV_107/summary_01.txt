Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Horizons Senior Apts/Cirrus Asset Management, 26075 Malibu Hills Road LLC, Cynthia Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers, with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff, Leslie Klinger, has not sufficiently alleged facts to support her causes of action, including intentional tort, negligence, premises liability, breach of contract, fraud, and breach of implied warranty of habitability. The court also finds that the plaintiff's first amended complaint is uncertain and does not provide sufficient notice of the claims being made against the defendants. The court grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure these defects and to re-plead the causes of action in a clear and concise manner.
