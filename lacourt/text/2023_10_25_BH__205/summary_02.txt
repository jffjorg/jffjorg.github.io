Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to answer filed by the plaintiff, Rose Mary Benvie, against the defendants, Sidney Gale Gathrid and Michele Gathrid. The dispute arises from a car accident in which the defendant Sidney Gale Gathrid rear-ended the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was traveling at an unsafe speed, failed to maintain a safe stopping distance, and was inattentive to road conditions. The defendant has raised nine affirmative defenses, but the judge has found that seven of them are insufficient and will be stricken. The judge has given the defendant 20 days to amend their answer to include specific facts to support their affirmative defenses. The judge has also noted that the defendant cannot assert defenses with the hope that facts will later be discovered to support them and must seek leave to amend their answer if they later discover facts to support a new defense.
