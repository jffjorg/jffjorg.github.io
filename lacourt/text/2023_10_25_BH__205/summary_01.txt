```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the plaintiff's complaint. The case involves a claim of medical negligence, where the plaintiff suffered an allergic reaction to neurotoxin injections performed by the defendant. The defendant served requests for production of documents, but the plaintiff failed to respond. Despite multiple attempts to meet and confer with the plaintiff, the plaintiff's counsel failed to file an opposition to the motion to compel. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests is willful and that less severe sanctions have not served to curb the plaintiff's discovery abuses. Therefore, the court grants terminating sanctions and dismisses the plaintiff's complaint.
