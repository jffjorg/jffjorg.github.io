And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Susannah Bernard, the cross-complainant, to set aside and vacate the dismissal of her cross-complaint. The cross-complaint was dismissed on February 6, 2024, after counsel for cross-complainant failed to attend a scheduled hearing. Counsel has filed a declaration stating that they were unexpectedly unable to attend the hearing due to a leaky ceiling and subsequent roof damage at their home. The judge finds that this was a surprise and excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge sets a new hearing date for September 25, 2024, and requires the cross-complainant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
