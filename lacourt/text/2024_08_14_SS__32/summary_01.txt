And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion for determination of good faith settlement between Cross-Defendants Erika Rodriguez and Abel Rodriguez and Plaintiffs Ayden Moreno, Christy Moreno, David Moreno, and Isaac Moreno. The hearing is scheduled for July 30, 2024. The motion is opposed by Defendants Park Mobile III, LP dba Parklane Mobile Estates and Cal-AM Properties, Inc.

The Court grants judicial notice of the filings in this case and determines that the motion is denied due to the lack of new facts or law since the previous denial of the motion on August 11, 2023. The Court also finds that the moving party has failed to address the deficiencies discussed in the previous order denying the motion.

The Court notes that under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, a party cannot file repetitive motions without showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law. The Court concludes that the motion for determination of good faith settlement is denied and that the moving party shall give notice and file a proof of service of such.
