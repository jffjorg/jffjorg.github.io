And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a new trial filed by the plaintiff, Bergman, in a case against the defendant, Halamendaris. The motion was filed on August 8, 2023, and the judge has determined that it is timely and properly served. The judge has also determined that the motion must be based on one or more grounds listed in California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 657.

The plaintiff is seeking a new trial based on an irregularity in the proceedings at trial, but the judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing prejudice in this context. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's claim that the court should have granted a waiver of jury fees and excused her resulting jury waiver is without merit.

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented at trial and has determined that it supports the verdict substantially. The plaintiff presented no evidence that would support a greater verdict, and the several instances of impeachment of the plaintiff's testimony did not help her case.

As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The judge has also determined that it must rule on this motion by October 20, 2023, as required by CCP section 660(b) and (c).
