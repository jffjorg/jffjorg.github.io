And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a new trial filed by the plaintiff, Bergman, in a case against the defendant, Halamendaris. The motion was filed on August 8, 2023, and the judge has determined that it is timely and properly served. The judge has also determined that the motion must be based on one or more grounds listed in California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 657.

The plaintiff is seeking a new trial based on an irregularity in the proceedings at trial, but the judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing prejudice in this context. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's claim that the court should have granted a waiver of jury fees and excused her resulting jury waiver is without merit.

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented at trial and has determined that it supports the verdict substantially. The plaintiff presented no evidence that would support a greater verdict, and the several instances of impeachment of the plaintiff's testimony did not help her case.

As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The judge has also determined that it must rule on this motion by October 20, 2023, as required by CCP section 660(b) and (c).

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The plaintiff argues that the court's ruling that she waived jury in this matter was an irregularity, but the court finds that the plaintiff failed to present specific evidence of irregularity in the proceedings which was prejudicial. The court also finds that the plaintiff presented no admissible evidence of medical bills or the value of her vehicle, and was impeached on several points. The court concludes that the verdict was supported by substantial evidence and reasonable inferences, and that the plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to show that an error, if error there was, was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for a new trial.

## Case Summary: Bergman v. Halamendaris (20STCV39629)

**Case Number:** 20STCV39629
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** E
**Plaintiff:** Bergman
**Defendant:** Halamendaris

**Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling by Judge [Judge's Name] on Plaintiff Bergman's motion for a new trial. The Judge denies the motion for the following reasons:

* **Improper Service:** Plaintiff failed to properly serve Defendant with notice of her motion for a new trial, violating CCP sections 1005 and 659.
* **Lack of Evidence:** Plaintiff failed to present admissible evidence supporting her claims for medical bills, vehicle damage, lost personal property, and lost earnings.  
* **Impeachment:** Plaintiff's testimony was impeached through her prior deposition testimony and inconsistent statements regarding the severity of the car accident.
* **Credibility:** The Judge found Plaintiff's testimony less credible than Defendant's and the testimony of the percipient witness, Jerry Ibanez.
* **Verdict Supported by Evidence:** The Judge found the verdict in favor of Plaintiff for $5,000.00 was supported by substantial evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence presented.

**Key Points of Dispute:**

* **Jury Waiver:** Plaintiff argues the Court erred by allowing her jury waiver to stand. However, the Judge found the waiver was valid under CCP section 631(f)(5).
* **Severity of Accident:**  Plaintiff initially claimed a more severe impact than Defendant and the percipient witness described.

**Significant Statements:**

* "Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to show that such error [regarding jury waiver], if error there was, was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial."
* "Neither the law nor the evidence supports Plaintiff’s current claim that either the Court should have reached a different verdict, or that a jury would have reached a different verdict on the same evidence."


**English Summary:**

The Judge denies Plaintiff's motion for a new trial because she did not properly serve the motion, failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her claims, and her testimony was deemed less credible than the other witnesses. The Judge found the original verdict in favor of Plaintiff to be supported by the evidence presented at trial, even if there were some inconsistencies in the testimony.
