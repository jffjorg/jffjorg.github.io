And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied a motion to amend a judgment rendered in 2009. The plaintiffs, Alvin E. Williams and Judith M. Brown-Williams, have repeatedly sought to amend the judgment, but their motions have been denied. The court finds that the current motion is essentially the same as one previously denied and is therefore abusive. The plaintiffs allege that Judge Mooney and the defendants colluded to defraud them, but they have provided no authority to support their claim. The court notes that judgments that are void on their face may be amended, but the plaintiffs' allegations of fraud go beyond what would be evident on the face of the judgment. The court warns the plaintiffs that further improper repetitive motions may result in sanctions against them.
