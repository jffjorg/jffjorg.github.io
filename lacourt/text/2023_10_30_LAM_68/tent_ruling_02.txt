 Case Number:  BC342574    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  68 Alvin E.
Williams, et al. vs. Bentley Motors Inc., et al., BC342574
Motion to
Amend Judgment

Moving
Parties: Plaintiffs Alvin E. Williams and Judith M. Brown-Williams

Motion
            Judgement was rendered in 2009.  It is now 2023.  Plaintiffs repeatedly seek to have the Court
amend this final judgment.
This motion is essentially the same as one that Plaintiffs filed a
couple months ago which this Court denied on September 1, 2023.  And it is repetitive of the numerous motions
that Plaintiffs have filed over the years seeking such relief, all of which
have been denied.  This motion is not
appropriate and it is abusive.  THE
COURT DENIES THIS MOTION.
Plaintiffs have once again filed a motion to amend a judgment that was
entered on April 27, 2009. Plaintiffs’ reason for requesting this amendment is
that Judge Mooney allegedly acted in collusion with the defendants in this case
to defraud Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs are requesting that the judgment be
amended to include exemplary damages and to increase the judgment amount.
            Plaintiffs have cited no authority
for amending a judgment under the circumstances which Plaintiffs are alleging.
Plaintiffs cite CCP § 187, but this section is simply about the general powers
conferred upon a court. Plaintiffs also cite some authority regarding judgments
as the final determination of the right of the parties (CCP § 577), but this authority
does not support what Plaintiffs are arguing should be done.
            Judgments that are void on their
face may be amended at any time. (Manson, Iver, & York v. Black
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) However, Plaintiffs allegations of fraud go
beyond what would be evident on the face of the judgment.
            PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IS DENIED.
            THE COURT CAUTIONS PLAINTIFFS THAT FURTHER
IMPROPER REPETITIVE MOTIONS MAY RESULT IN THE COURT ISSUING SANCTIONS AGAINST
PLAINTIFFS.
