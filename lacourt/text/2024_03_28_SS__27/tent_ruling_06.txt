Legal Standard
 
CCP section 387(d) provides the following: 
 
(1) The court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene
in the action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is
satisfied:  
 
(A) A provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene. 
 
(B) The person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to
the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and that person
is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that
person’s ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is
adequately represented by one or more of the existing parties. 
 
(2) The court may, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to
intervene in the action or proceeding if the person has an interest in the
matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an
interest against both. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 387(d).) 
 
To establish a
direct and immediate interest in the litigation for purposes of permissive
intervention, a non-party seeking intervention must show that he or she stands
to gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment, even if no specific
interest in the property or transaction at issue exists.¿ (Simpson
Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987) 196
Cal.App.3d 1192, 1201.)¿ “Whether the
intervener’s interest is sufficiently direct must
be decided on the facts of each case¿. . . .¿And section 387
should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.”¿ (Id.¿at p. 1200.)¿ “In order that a
party may be permitted to intervene it is not necessary that his interest in
the action be such that he will inevitably be affected by the judgment.¿ It is enough
that there be a substantial probability that his interests will also be so
affected.¿ ‘The purposes of
intervention are to protect the interests of those who may be affected by the
judgment¿. . . .’”¿ (Timberidge¿Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa¿(1978) 86
Cal.App.3d 873, 881-882 (citations and emphasis omitted).¿ 
 
Under California
law, an insurance carrier who is not a party to an action can intervene on
behalf of its insured when the insurance carrier could be subject to a
subsequent action under Insurance¿Code¿section¿11580.¿ (See¿Reliance Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court¿(2000) 84
Cal.App.4th¿383, 386,¿(“An insurer’s
right to intervene in an action against the insured, for personal injury or
property damages, arises as a result of Ins. Code section 11580.”).)¿¿“Section 11580
provides that a judgment creditor may proceed directly against any liability
insurance covering the¿defendant, and¿obtain
satisfaction of the judgment up to the amount of the policy limits.¿¿Thus, where the
insurer may be subject to a direct action under Insurance Code section 11580 by
a judgment creditor who has or will obtain a default judgment in a¿third party¿action against
the insured, intervention is appropriate.”¿ (Id.;¿see also¿Jade K. v.¿Viguri¿(1989) 210
Cal.App.3d 1459, 1468¿(permitting an
insurer to intervene in lawsuit to litigate liability and damage issues).)¿ “‘Intervention may
. . . be allowed in the insurance context, where third party claimants are
involved, when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured
is not defending an action, to avoid harm to the insurer.’”¿ (Western
Heritage Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1205
(quoting Royal Indemnity Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc. (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 194, 206).)¿ 
 
Background and Analysis
 
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present
auto accident lawsuit against Defendant Sammy Estrada and SH&H Inc. At the
accident's time, Estrada was employed by SH&H, Inc. The intervening
Defendant, Houston Specialty Insurance Company, was SH&H, Inc.'s insurer at
the time of the accident. On August 21, 2021, SH&H became a forfeited
company and remains in such a status, thereby unable to defend itself. Houston
now moves the Court to intervene on behalf of SH&H.
 
Intervention is permissible here because the
Proposed Intervenor, as Defendant’s insurer, could be subject to direct action
under Insurance Code section 11580 should there be an unfavorable judgment.
SH&H remains a forfeited company and, as such, is unable to defend itself.
The Proposed Intervenor intends to intervene to defend against the claim on
behalf of Defendant SH&H and to protect its own interests. The Proposed
Intervenor has notified all parties in this action and received no opposition.
Consequently, the motion is GRANTED.
 
Moving Party is ORDERED to file its
pleading-in-Intervention within 20 days of today and to give notice.
