And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery. The motion was served electronically on March 5, 2024, but the required notice period for electronic service is 18 court days, which would have made the hearing date March 29, 2024. Since the hearing is currently set for March 28, 2024, it is untimely. The court cannot ignore the untimely nature of the motion and must deny it. The judge cites Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 87 in support of this ruling.
