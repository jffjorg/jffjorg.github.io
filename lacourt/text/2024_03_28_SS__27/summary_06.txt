Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to intervene filed by Houston Specialty Insurance Company, the insurer of SH&H Inc., which is a forfeited company and unable to defend itself in the present auto accident lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Vertin Ferretiz against SH&H Inc. and Sammy Estrada. The judge finds that intervention is permissible under California law, as Houston Specialty Insurance Company could be subject to a direct action under Insurance Code section 11580 if there is an unfavorable judgment. The company intends to intervene to defend against the claim on behalf of SH&H Inc. and to protect its own interests. The motion is granted, and the moving party is ordered to file its pleading-in-intervention within 20 days of the date of the tentative ruling.
