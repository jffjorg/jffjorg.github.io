And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition and production of documents. The plaintiff filed the motion after the defendant, Boris Navarro, failed to appear for his deposition on February 21, 2024, despite receiving multiple deposition notices. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated sufficient meet and confer efforts and good cause for the document production. The judge is also ordering defendant Navarro to pay sanctions of $1,500 to the plaintiff for failing to comply with the deposition notice. Additionally, the judge is granting the plaintiff's request to compel defendant Navarro's deposition and production of documents, but is allowing defendant Navarro to obtain new counsel before proceeding with the deposition.
