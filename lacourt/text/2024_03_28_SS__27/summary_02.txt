And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to bifurcate brought by West Coast Arborist, Inc. (WCA) without prejudice. The motion was brought in response to a settlement agreement between the City of La Mirada and the plaintiff, Margaret Bock, for $25,000. WCA challenged the settlement, arguing that the amount does not reflect the City's proportionate liability and suggesting collusion between the City and the plaintiff. The judge has decided that the issue of indemnity, which is the basis for WCA's motion, may be resolved through the good faith settlement motion that is pending. The judge has given WCA the option to raise the issue at the time of trial. The parties are advised to submit by email to the tentative ruling by the hearing date or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
