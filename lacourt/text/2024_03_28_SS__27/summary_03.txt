```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash defendant's subpoenas for insurance claim files or in the alternative for a protective order. The court has denied the motion, finding that the subpoenas are not overly broad and do not seek protected information. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not include the original subpoenas in the separate statement and that the motion is therefore moot as to those subpoenas. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to determine whether any declarations or communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine.

The court has also denied the request for sanctions. The judge has instructed the parties to submit on the tentative ruling by email or to appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If the parties do not submit or appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
