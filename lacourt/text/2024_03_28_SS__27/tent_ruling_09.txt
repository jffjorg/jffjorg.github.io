Factual Background
 
On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed the present
auto accident case against Defendants Edwin Flores and Miledi Flores. On
February 4, 2020, the Parties entered into a settlement pursuant to a
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment and Installment. The settlement required
Defendants to pay Plaintiff a sum of $20,000.00 in installment payments,
beginning on March 6, 2020. The Court also retained jurisdiction over this
matter to enforce the terms of the settlement pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. On March 5, 2020, the Court dismissed this matter
without prejudice. So Far, Defendants have made payments totaling $9,900.00.
However, Defendants have failed to make any of the payments after July 6, 2023.
Plaintiff now requests that Judgment be entered against Defendants in the sum
amount of $15,950.56.
 
Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 664.6
states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can
enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.¿ (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)¿ To enforce a
written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following three
elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the minds
on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the material
terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the parties.¿ (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)
 
CCP § 664.6
“require[s] the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement
under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is
sought to be enforced.”  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)  CCP §
664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply
to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is
directed.”  (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30,
35-37 [“A written settlement agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6
unless it is signed by all of the parties to the agreement, not merely the
parties against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”].)  “A procedure
in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing signed by both sides
minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary nature of
the section 664.6 procedure.”  (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)
 
Analysis
 
The Court
reviewed the settlement agreement and finds that there was a meeting of the
minds between the settling parties, wherein Defendants Edwin Flores and Miledi
Flores agreed to pay $20,000.00 according to a settlement plan over five years
in exchange for the release of the claims and dismissal with prejudice upon
completion of the plan. The terms were put in writing, with signatures from the
Defendants and an authorized representative for Plaintiff. The requirements to
enforce the settlement agreement under CCP § 664.6 have been met.
 
Defendants also do not oppose the
present motion.
 
Plaintiff
requests $15,959.56 based on an unpaid principal of $10,100.00, interest of
$5,625.56, and court costs of $225.00, citing Section 5 of the stipulation as
the basis for both interest and costs. Upon examination, Section 5 authorizes
only costs but does not provide for interest. Consequently, Plaintiff's motion
is GRANTED in part, and judgment is to be entered against Defendants, jointly
and severally, for the total amount of $10,325.00.  Plaintiff is to lodge an appropriate judgment
for court signature within 5 court days.
