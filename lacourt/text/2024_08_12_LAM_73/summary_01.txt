This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf Treu on a motion filed by Plaintiffs Fidel Suarez, Alvin Neal, Miguel Lopez, Mahali Cardoza, Christy Aguilar, Abran Esparza, Reyes Romo, Eric Ruiz, and Eloy Hernandez to amend the Complaint and add class action allegations. The Plaintiffs claim that they were employed by Defendants CDJR of West Covina, Envision WC CDRJ Auto, LLC, Envision Motors Holdings, LLC, Envision Motors Investments, LLC, Envision Motors Management, LLC, Frank Zarabi, and Ayman Sarriendine, and that the Defendants failed to compensate them for all hours worked. The Plaintiffs are seeking to add class action allegations to the Complaint, alleging that the Defendants failed to pay overtime wages, minimum wage violations, and other wage and hour violations.

The Court has found that the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file the First Amended Complaint substantially complies with the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are timely and necessary. The Court has also found that the Plaintiffs' amendments are not too late or futile. Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Plaintiffs' motion and orders them to file and serve the proposed First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
