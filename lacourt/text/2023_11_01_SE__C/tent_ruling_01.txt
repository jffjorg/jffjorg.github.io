Background
Plaintiff
a Complaint against Defendants Tim Childress, 10PL Global, Inc. (10PL Global),
and Axelavate Transportation, LLC (Axelavate) (collectively Defendants)
alleging Breach of Contract, Common Counts, Conversion, and Fraud related to a
contract where Defendants moved shipping containers to Plaintiff’s warehouse.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knowingly overbilled Plaintiff for 2605
shipping containers instead of the 1428 containers. Additionally, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants are hiding a shipping container from Plaintiffs.  
Default
was entered as to Defendants. Defendants Childress and Axelavate set aside the
default and filed a Cross-Complaint against 10PL Global. 10PL Global defaulted
as to the Cross-Complaint.
Legal
Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery ... by taking in California the oral deposition of
any person, including any party to the action. 
The person deposed may be a natural person, an organization such as a
public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental
agency.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.010.) “If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450(a).)   
Discussion

Plaintiff seeks to compel the deposition of
Daniel Lee, who is the President of 10PL Global and a public accountant at
Gaytan & Leevan in Los Angeles. (Sunkin Decl., ¶¶ 3 and 4.) On March 17,
2023, Plaintiff’s process server personally served Daniel Lee the Deposition
Subpoena to appear for deposition on April 21, 2023. (Grevillius Decl., ¶ 2.)
Mr. Lee failed to appear for his deposition or object to appearing and failed
to object or respond to the requests for production. Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Deposition Attendance and Requests for Production is GRANTED.
Sanctions
“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).)
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Daniel Lee in
the amount of $16,121.74, consisting of five hours preparing the subpoena and
related documents, ten hours preparing for the deposition, 1.6 hours traveling
to and from the deposition, ten hours preparing the motion, and 0.4 hours
meeting and conferring with Mr. Lee at a rate of $500.00 and $670.00 for
serving the subpoena, $698.78 for the court reporter, $22.96 to deliver the
meet and confer letter, $60.00 filing fee, and $670.00 to serve the Motion. The
Court finds the requested sanctions excessive and reduced the amount to $4,008.78.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance of Daniel Lee and Responses to Requests
for Production at Deposition is GRANTED. Daniel Lee is ordered to appear for
deposition within 60 days of this order. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED and imposed against Daniel Lee in the reduced amount of $2,758.78. This
sanction is to be paid within 60 days of this order.
