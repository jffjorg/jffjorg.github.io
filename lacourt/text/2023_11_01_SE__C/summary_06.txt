And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of American Express National Bank v. Ilan Asherian, dba A to Z Textile, Inc. (Case No. 23NWCV00500). The Defendant, Ilan Asherian, has moved to set aside a default judgment entered against him in favor of the Plaintiff, American Express National Bank, for $62,560.72. The default judgment was entered after the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant owed this amount on a credit card account. The Defendant claims that he was never served with the Complaint and that the proof of service has an incorrect address. The Judge has found that the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment is within the six-month period allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 473.5, and that there is a strong public policy in favor of granting the Motion. Therefore, the Judge has continued the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment to November 8, 2023, at 9:30 AM, and allowed the Defendant to file a supplemental declaration with a proposed pleading by November 6, 2023.
