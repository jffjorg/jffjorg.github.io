And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Bob Wondries, defendant in a case brought by Genoveva Lozano against Ford Motor Company and Bob Wondries for alleged negligent repair of a 2019 Ford Explorer. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Complaint sufficiently states a cause of action for negligent repair. The Judge has held that the economic loss rule does not apply in this case because the duty of repair is independent of the warranty contract issued by Ford. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient damages to overcome the motion. The case will proceed to a hearing on November 1, 2023.
