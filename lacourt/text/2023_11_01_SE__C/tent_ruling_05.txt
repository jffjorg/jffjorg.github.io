HEARING:   11/1/23 @ 9:30 AM
#5
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED with the limitations set forth below.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $3,210.00.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiffs Marco Suarez and Jose Ortiz Orozco
(collectively Plaintiffs) move to compel Defendant General Motor’s (Defendant)
further response to Request for Production (set one) pursuant to CCP §
2031.310.
Background
On December 9, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendant for alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act for
failure to repair or repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle. Plaintiffs claim they
purchased a 2017 Chevrolet Colorado on February 25, 2017 which was defective.
Legal Standard
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
Meet and Confer
The Court finds that the parties adequately met
and conferred.
Discussion
Plaintiffs
seek to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 16, 19-32, 37-41, 45, and 46.

Defendant
objected to each request and stated that it would not produce any documents. The
parties represent that they have met and conferred as to Requests Nos. 16,
19-32, 45, and 46 and Defendant stated it was willing to produce documents as
to those Requests. However, Defendant has not provided supplemental responses
as of the date of this hearing. Thus, Defendant is ordered to supplement its
Responses identifying which documents it has produced are responsive to each
Request as well as produce documents responsive to the Requests.
Requests
Nos. 37-41 seek codes related to similar vehicles and customer complaints and
labor operations codes from 2018 to present. These requests are overbroad
because they seek information not related to Plaintiff’s vehicle. Therefore,
these requests will be limited to codes related to repairs made to Plaintiff’s
vehicle. Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos.
37-41 with the codes applicable to repairs made to Plaintiff’s vehicle.  
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h),
2033.290(d).) 
The
Court finds that Defendant failed to act with substantial justification because
it agreed to produce documents only after Plaintiff filed this Motion and has
failed to do so. Additionally, it has not agreed to supplement its responses as
required by the Code. 
Plaintiff
seeks $3,210.00 in sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record
consisting of three hours drafting the motion, two hours reviewing the
opposition and drafting a reply, and two hours for preparing for and attending
the hearing at a rate of $450.00 per hour and the $60.00 filing fee. Sanctions
are awarded in the amount of $3,210.00 against Defendant and its counsel.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED with the limitations
set forth above. Defendant is ordered to serve its responses within 20 days of
this Order. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against
Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$3,210.00. This sanction is to be paid within 30 days of this Order.
