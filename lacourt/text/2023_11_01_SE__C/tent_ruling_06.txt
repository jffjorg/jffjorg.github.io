Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment is CONTINUED to November 8, 2023 at 9:30
AM.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Ilan Asherian, dba A to Z Textile,
Inc. (Defendant) moves for relief from default judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(b).
This Motion is unopposed.
Background
 On, February 15, 2023 Plaintiff American
Express National Bank (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint for Account Stated and Open
Book Account against Defendant related to a credit card account. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant owes $62,560.72. Plaintiff requested entry of default on
April 26, 2023 and moved for default judgment on May 19, 2023 which was
granted. On August 11, 2023, Defendant moved to set aside the default.
Legal
Standard
“When
service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against
him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to
set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.
The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in
no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default
judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.” (CCP §
473.5.)
Discussion

Here, Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default
is within the six month period allowed by CCP § 473. Thus, there is a strong
public policy in favor of granting Defendant’s Motion.
Default judgment against Defendant is set aside
because the proof of service has the incorrect address. Defendant states that
his address is 1555 High Knoll Road, Encino, California 91436. (Asherian Decl.,
¶ 6.) The proof of service provides the address where Defendant was served was
15555 High Knoll Road, Encino, California 91436. Further, Defendant
states that he was never served with the Complaint. (Asherian Decl., ¶ 5.)
Additionally, the proof of service states that “Ilan Asherian d/b/a Atoz
Textile Inc” was served and also that an unidentified person other than
Defendant was served. Thus, it is not clear to this Court that Defendant was
served with the Complaint. However, Defendant has not filed a proposed responsive
pleading pursuant to CCP § 473.5(b) or challenged jurisdiction pursuant to CCP
§ 418.10.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment is CONTINUED to November 8, 2023 at 9:30
AM in Dept C. Defendant may file a supplemental declaration with a proposed
pleading by November 6, 2023.
