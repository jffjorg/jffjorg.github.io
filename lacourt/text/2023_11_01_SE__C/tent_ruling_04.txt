Defendant Bob Wondries’ Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings is DENIED.
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Bob Wondries Motors (Bob Wondries)
demurs to Plaintiff Genoveva Lozano’s Complaint on the grounds that it fails to
state a cause of action. 
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendant Ford Motor Company (Ford) for Violation of
the Song-Beverly Act and against Bob Wondries for Negligent Repair. Plaintiff
purchased a 2019 Ford Explorer from Ford on July 18, 2019 and presented the
vehicle to Bob Wondries on multiple occasions for repairs.
Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges that “Plaintiff delivered the Subject Vehicle to [Bob
Wondries] for repair [sic] on numerous occasions.” (Compl. ¶ 28.) Bob Wondries
“breached its duty to Plaintiff to use ordinary care and skill by failing to
properly store, prepare and repair of the Subject Vehicle ….” (Compl. ¶ 30.)
Bob Wondries’ “negligent breach of its duties owed to Plaintiff was a proximate
cause of Plaintiff’s damages.” (Compl. ¶ 31.)
Legal
Standard
The standard for ruling
on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that
applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings,
together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v. California Legislature
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of the
complaint as a matter of law; as such, it raises only a question of law.” (Osornio
v. Weingarten (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 304, 316.) No matter how unlikely or
improbable, the complainant’s allegations must be accepted as true for the
purpose of ruling on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural
Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) However, the Court does not
need to assume the truth of “contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.” (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
Discussion

Bob Wondries argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint
is barred by the economic loss rule because Plaintiff claims solely economic
damages. (Mot., p. 3) “Simply stated, the economic loss rule provides: ‘ “ ‘[W]here
a purchaser's expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he
bought is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for
he has suffered only ‘economic’ losses.’ ” ’ ” (Robinson Helicopter Co.,
Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) Plaintiff argues there is
an exception to the economic loss rule for contracts for services, citing to North
American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 774.
(Opp., p. 3.) Plaintiff further argues the economic loss rule does not apply to
damage to other portions of a larger product from defective products.
Bob Wondries argues that North American
Chemical has “been largely ignored or distinguished by subsequent
California Supreme Court opinions,” citing to Erlich v. Menezes (1999)
21 Cal.4th 543 and Robinson, supra, 34 Cal.4th 979. Bob Wondries cites
to Peregrine
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Clinical Supplies Management, Inc. (C.D. Cal.,
June 22, 2015, No. SACV121608JGBANX) 2015 WL 13309286 to support its contention
that North American Chemical has been ignored or distinguished. Peregrine
states that “although the California Court of Appeal's decision in North
American Chemical has not been expressly overruled, its holding has largely
been ignored or contradicted in subsequent opinions by the California Supreme
Court.” The basis for Peregrine's conclusion is that “when summarizing
the categories of contract cases in which tort damages have been permitted, the
[California Supreme Court] made no mention of services contracts.” Peregrine,
2015 WL 13309286, at *6 (citing Erlich, supra, 21 Cal. 4th 543, 551-52).
However, in Erlich, the California Supreme Court was not discussing the
economic loss rule. The cited portion of the opinion holds that “conduct
amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a
duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.” (Erlich,
supra, 21 Cal. 4th at 551.) Thus, the economic loss rule does not bar
recovery in this case because the duty of repair here is independent of the
warranty contract issued by Ford. Therefore, Bob Wondries’ Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings is denied because Plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to
allege a cause of action for negligent repair.
Bob Wondries also argues that Plaintiff has failed to plead damages,
however, the defect must appear on the face of the Complaint. Here, Plaintiff
has stated that the alleged negligent repair “was a proximate cause of
Plaintiff’s damages.” (Compl. ¶ 31.) Thus, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient
damages to overcome a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.
 
Accordingly, Defendant
Bob Wondries’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
