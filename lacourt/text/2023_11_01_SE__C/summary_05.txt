And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant, General Motors, regarding several document requests. The defendant had objected to each request and stated it would not produce any documents, but the parties had met and conferred and the defendant agreed to produce documents as to certain requests. However, the defendant has not yet provided the requested documents, so the judge has ordered the defendant to supplement its responses and provide the requested documents.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, in the amount of $3,210.00, for failing to act with substantial justification in opposing the motion. The judge has ordered the defendant and its counsel to pay the sanction within 30 days.
