  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Defendants Wen Auguste Lee and Jin Gao. The Court finds that the Defendants have failed to comply with a court order compelling them to appear for deposition and produce documents, and have shown a disregard for the Court's order. As a result, the Court strikes the Defendants' Answers and orders them to pay $2,040.00 in monetary sanctions. The Court declines to impose additional monetary sanctions, as terminating sanctions are sufficient punishment for the Defendants' actions.
