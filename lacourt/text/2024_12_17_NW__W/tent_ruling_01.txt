BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs
Claudia Calderon and Carlos Arajo (Plaintiffs”) allege they entered into a
month-to-month tenancy with Defendant 14600 Saticoy Street LLC, through its
agent Defendant Anza Management Company (“Defendants”). Plaintiffs further
allege during their tenancy at the Subject Property, and Defendants’ ownership,
management and/or operations of the Subject Property, the building is and has
been unsafe, untenantable, in a serious state of disrepair, and in gross
violation of building, health, and safety codes. 
 
On
February 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants, alleging: (1)
Contractual and Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability; (2)
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1941, 1941.1 (Statutory Breach of The Implied
Warranty of Habitability); (3) Contractual and Tortious Breach of the Covenant
of Quiet Enjoyment; (4) Nuisance; (5) Negligence; (6) Violation of Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. Unfair, Unlawful, and Deceptive Business Practices;
(7) Violation of Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30 (Financial Abuse of
Elders and Disabled Persons); and (8) Negligent Hiring, Training and
Supervision. 
 
On
January 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding new causes
of action.
 
On
September 20, 2024, the Court continued the trial date from October 7, 2024 to
January 27, 2025. Pre-trial deadlines were not continued and remained based on
the previous trial date. (Minute Order 9/20/24.) 
 
On
November 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel the deposition
of Anza Management Company’s (“Anza”) Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2055.010 and 2025.450, on the grounds there
is good cause to compel compliance. Plaintiffs request $2,810.00 in monetary sanctions.

 
On
November 13, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition, arguing that the motion is
untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020. Defendants request
$2,337.50 in sanctions.

Deposition of Anza Management Company’s Person Most Knowledgeable is DENIED.

LEGAL STANDARD
 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document . . . described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
“A
motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with both of the following:
1.
The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
2.
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)
 
If
a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of
that party unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)
 
MEET AND
CONFER
 
The Declaration of Johnathan
Nielsen, Plaintiffs’ counsel, describes a meet and confer effort that took
place to determine if Defendants would produce the PMK for a deposition. (Nielsen
Decl. ¶ 4, 6; Exhibits 3, 5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Motion to Compel Deposition
 
Plaintiffs seek an order compelling the appearance of Defendant
Anza Management Company (“Anza”) Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) for a
deposition. The motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections
2055.010 and 2025.450, on the grounds there is good cause to compel compliance.
Plaintiffs argue that they timely provided required notice of the deposition
and Anza’s counsel refused to produce the PMK for deposition.
 
In support, Plaintiffs
provide the declaration of counsel Johnathan Nielsen. Attorney Neilsen declares
that Plaintiffs properly noticed the deposition by email on August 16, 2024, prior
to the discovery cutoff on September 9, 2024. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.) However,
as a courtesy, Plaintiffs agreed to not go forward with the deposition if
available dates were provided. Defendants objected to the deposition on August
30, 2024. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 2, 4, Exhibits 1, 3.) On September 3, 2024,
Defendants’ counsel replied that “alternative dates will be provided.” (Nielsen
Decl. ¶ 5, Exhibit 4.) Nielson responded: 
“Due to discovery cut-off, I need confirmation that you are waiving the
discovery cut-off date for the purpose of taking the depositions we noticed. If
I don't have alternative dates and confirmation of waiving discovery cut-off by
10:00 a.m. on Thursday September 5th, I will have to go forward with the
deposition on September 6th to protect our clients' rights.” 
(Nielsen
Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit 5.) 
Defendants’
counsel, Laura Adler, replied to the above email that the deposition would not
proceed on September 6th and requested a 90-120 day trial
continuance because attorney Ronald Whitaker was no longer with the company and
they were unable to proceed as staffed. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit 6.)
Plaintiffs do not indicate that they responded to the email. 
In opposition, Defendants argue that the instant motion
is untimely because the deadline to complete depositions of percipient
witnesses was September 9, 2024, and the corresponding deadline to hear a
motion to compel was September 23, 2024. Defendants claim that there was no agreement
to extend the discovery cutoff dates. (Opposition at p. 5.) Defendants assert
that although the Court continued the trial from October 7,
2024 to January 27, 2025, the
discovery deadlines were not continued. (Minute Order 9/20/24.)
Defendants also point out that Plaintiffs did not raise this issue during the
hearing on September 20, 2024,
and that Plaintiffs stated in their opposition that “Discovery and Expert
Discovery are cut-off”. (Page 3, line 17 of Plaintiffs’ Opposition dated
September 19, 2024). 
 
Defendants
further argue that Plaintiffs motion to compel is improper because discovery
has closed and Plaintiffs have made no effort to reopen discovery before filing
the instant motion, citing Pelton-Shepherd Indus., Inc. v. Delta Packaging
Prod., Inc., (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 1568, 1585. The Court agrees.
 
Any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.
(Code Civ. Proc.§ 2024.020 (a).) Here, the discovery motion cut-off in this
case is closed. The discovery cut-offs are associated with the previous trial
date, October 7, 2024. (Minute Order 9/20/24.) Therefore, the last day to hear
a discovery motion was September 23, 2024. Since the motions to compel
depositions are being heard on December 17, 2024, they are untimely.
 
The
Court cannot grant discovery motions after the cutoff date unless the moving
party has moved under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 to have the
motions heard closer to the trial date. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v.
Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586-1587.) The
Court’s discretion in allowing the motions to be heard closer to the trial date
than allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 is bounded by the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which include the
trial court’s consideration of the statutory factors. (Id. at p.
1586-1587.) Here, Plaintiffs have not sought leave under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 to
reopen discovery, nor have they discussed the statutory factors of section
2024.050. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition is denied. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions against
Defendant Anza and its Counsel in the sum of $2,810.00 pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.450(g). However, the Court has denied Plaintiffs
motion to compel, and therefore section 2025.450(g) does not apply. Plaintiffs
also argue that Defendants have refused to produce their PMK or provide
alternative dates for their PMK’s deposition, despite Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s
numerous attempts to accommodate Anza and their PMK’s schedule. 
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions against
Plaintiffs and their Counsel in the sum of $2,337.50. Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ act of filing the motion to compel after the motion hearing
deadline is an abuse of the discovery process. 
 
This is a text-book example of lawyers failing to
cooperate in the discovery process. Both sides are guilty, in different ways,
for this behavior. As Plaintiffs point out, Defendants did not provide
alternative dates for the deposition after indicating that alternative dates
would be provided. Also, Plaintiffs’ counsel made numerous attempts to
accommodate Defendants’ schedule as a curtesy. On the other hand, Plaintiffs do
not address why they did not respond to Defense counsel Laura Adler’s email on
September 3, 2024; why they did not bring up this issue during the hearing on
September 20, 2024; why they stated in their opposition to the motion to
continue the trial that discovery was closed; and why they waited until
November 6th to bring the instant motion. 
 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions are denied as
both parties’ positions were substantially justified, in light of the other
parties’ intransigence.
