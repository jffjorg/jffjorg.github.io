 Case Number:  22STCV10620    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  B ANTONIAS ROMERO V. BERNICE STEWDART-DONALDSON, ET AL.MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET THREE, REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET THREE, REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, SET THREE, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONSDate of Hearing: October 10, 2024 Trial Date: November 12, 2024Department: B Case No.: 22STCV10620Moving Party: Plaintiff Antonias RomeroResponding Party: Defendant County of Los AngelesBACKGROUNDOn March 28, 2022, Plaintiff Antonias Romero (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Bernice Stewdart-Donaldson (“Donaldson”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), and DOES 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on May 1, 2021, Plaintiff was a pedestrian crossing an intersection when Donaldson, acting within his scope of employment under the County and City, negligently struck Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges serious injuries as a result.On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed three motions to compel further responses against County, as to the following discovery documents: (1) Special Interrogatories, Set Three; (2) Requests for Production, Set Three; and (3) Requests for Admission, Set Three (“Discovery Motions”). Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the total amount of $3,180 ($1,060 per motion).On June 6, 2024, the action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective as of June 24, 2024.On September 30, 2024, the County filed oppositions to all three motions.[TENTATIVE] RULINGPlaintiff’s Discovery Motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.LEGAL STANDARDCal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of theoption to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP § 2030.300(a).)Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP §§ 2030.300(c).)Under California law, the objecting party has the burden of justifying its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court order further responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).)DISCUSSIONMeet and Confer RequirementA motion to compel further responses shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2030.300(b).) Here, Plaintiff’s counsel provides a declaration demonstrating diligent efforts to meet and confer with opposing counsel. (Anderson Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) On July 25, 2024, counsel sent a Meet and Confer Letter to opposing counsel, outlining the deficiencies in the County’s responses and offering fifteen additional days for further response. (Ibid. at ¶ 5; Exh. C [July 25, 2024 Meet and Confer Letter].) On August 27, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a second Meet and Confer Letter to opposing counsel outlining remaining deficiencies. (Ibid. at ¶ 6; Exh. E [August 27, 2024 Meet and Confer Letter].) Plaintiff declares that, as of September 3, 2024, the County’s discovery responses remain deficient. (Ibid. at ¶ 7.) Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts to be sufficient pursuant to CCP § 2030.300(b).)Special Interrogatories, Set ThreePlaintiff moves to compel the County’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three Nos. 36-42, 49-53The motion is denied as to Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, and 53. These pertain to the July 12, 2015, Los Angeles Times article titled “Walking in L.A.: Times Analysis Finds the County’s 817 Most Dangerous Intersections.” This article is inadmissible hearsay and therefore irrelevant to the litigation. (Cal. Evid. Code § 1200.) The motion is also denied as to No. 40. No. 40 contains multiple inquiries, thus making the question compound, overbroad and confusing.The motion is granted as to No. 49. Training or instruction provided to the County’s agents regarding dangerous intersection conditions are relevant to the pending litigation. The County is ordered to provide a verified, objection-free, supplemental response to Special Interrogatories, Set Three, No. 49 within 15 days of this order.Requests for Production, Set ThreePlaintiff moves to compel the County’s further responses to Requests for Production, Set Three, Nos. 45-48, 50, and 52-55.The motion is denied as to Requests for Production, Set Three, Nos. 45, 46, 47, and 48. These pertain to the July 12, 2015, Los Angeles Times article titled “Walking in L.A.: Times Analysis Finds the County’s 817 Most Dangerous Intersections.” This article is inadmissible hearsay and therefore irrelevant to the litigation. (Cal. Evid. Code § 1200.)The motion is granted as to Nos. 50, 52, 54, and 55. These production requests articulate clear inquiries as to the County’s safety procedures regarding the intersection where Plaintiff was struck and are therefore relevant to the litigation. The County is ordered to provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Requests for Production, Set Three, Nos. 50, 52, 54, and 55 within 15 days of this order.Requests for Admission, Set ThreePlaintiff moves to compel the County’s further responses to Requests for Admission, Set Three, Nos. 40-43, 45-47, 49, 51-55, and 57.The motion is denied as to Requests for Admission, Set Three, Nos. 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 57. These pertain to the July 12, 2015, Los Angeles Times article titled “Walking in L.A.: Times Analysis Finds the County’s 817 Most Dangerous Intersections.” This article is inadmissible hearsay and therefore irrelevant to the litigation. (Cal. Evid. Code § 1200.)The motion is denied as to No. 55 as it calls for speculation.Monetary Sanctions“The court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under CCP § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)Here, the County’s objections were largely meritorious since the majority of Plaintiff’s discovery requests pertained to inadmissible hearsay. Therefore, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Plaintiff's Discovery Motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions are DENIED.The Court ORDERS that the County provide verified, complete and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set Three, Nos. 50, 52, 54, and 55, and Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three, No. 49 within 15 days of this order.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
