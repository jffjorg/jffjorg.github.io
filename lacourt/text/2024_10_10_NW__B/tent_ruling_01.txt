(“Gonzalez”), Mario Miranda, Sr. (“Miranda”), and DOES 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Miranda, acting in the scope of their employment under Defendant Gonzalez, was driving a tractor trailer when they negligently collided with Plaintiff’s tractor trailer, causing Plaintiff to suffer personal injuries and property damage.On March 25, 2020, Defendants Gonzalez and Miranda filed a demand for jury trial and posted the requisite fees.On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of posting of jury fees.On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective as of June 24, 2024.On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a demand for jury trial.On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for order granting relief from potential waiver of trial by jury.A jury trial is set for February 10, 2025.LEGAL STANDARD“The right to a trial by jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 631(a).) “In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision (f).” (Ibid.) CCP section 631(f) provides that a party waives trial by jury by (1) failing to appear at the trial; (2) written consent filed with the clerk or judge; (3) oral consent, in open court, entered in the minutes; (4) failingto announce that a jury is required, at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is set upon notice of stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation; (5) failing to timely pay the fee described in subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid that fee; or (6) failing to deposit with the clerk or judge, at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day’s session, the sum provided in subdivision (e). (Ibid., § 631(f).) “The court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Ibid., § 631(g).) “The trial court should grant a motion for relief of a jury waiver ‘unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.’” (Mackovska v. Viewcrest Road Properties LLC (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1, 10 [quoting Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809].) “When there is doubt about whether to grant relief from a jury trial waiver, the court must resolve that doubt in favor of the party seeking a jury trial.” (Ibid.)“In a motion for relief from waiver of a jury trial, the crucial question is whether the party opposing relief will suffer any prejudice if the court grants relief.” (Mackovska, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at 10.) “‘The prejudice which must be shown from granting relief from the waiver is prejudice from the granting of relief and not prejudice from the jury trial.’” (Ibid. [quoting Massie v. AAR Western Skyways, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 405, 411].) “‘The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.’” (Ibid. [quoting Johnson-Stovall v. Superior Court (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 808, 811].) “Denying relief where the party opposing the motion for relief has not shown prejudice is an abuse of discretion.” (Ibid.)ANALYSISThis action was commenced on February 20, 2020. Therefore, jury fees were required to be posted no later than February 19, 2021. (CCP § 631(c)(2))(requiring that, if no initial case management conference is scheduled in a civil action, fees are due no later than 365 days after filing the initial complaint.) Here, Plaintiff posted jury fees on February 15, 2023, nearly two years after the statutory deadline.Plaintiff argues that the late posting of jury fees was inadvertent, as Plaintiff’s counsel believed that both a demand for a jury trial and payment of fees were timely completed. (Dordick Decl. ¶ 3.) Counsel only discovered the error during a review of the Court’s register of actions earlier this year. (Ibid.) Counsel asserts that, after this realization, they promptly posted and served notice of the jury fees. (Ibid.)Additionally, Plaintiff argues that granting this motion will not pose undue hardship on Defendants. Plaintiff notes that both Defendants and Plaintiffs have made jury demands and posted jury fees. (Motion p. 5, lines 21-22.) Therefore, Plaintiff argues, all parties have anticipated a jury trial in preparing for litigation. (Ibid. at lines 22-23.) Plaintiff further notes that trial remains months away. (Ibid. at line 21.)The Court also notes that this motion is unopposed.CONCLUSIONPlaintiff’s motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury is GRANTED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
