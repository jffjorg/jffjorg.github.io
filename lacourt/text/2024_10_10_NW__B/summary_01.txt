And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Girik Issaian's motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury. The motion was filed after Plaintiff discovered that they had posted jury fees late, nearly two years after the statutory deadline. Plaintiff argues that the late posting was inadvertent and that granting relief will not cause undue hardship to the Defendants. The judge finds that Plaintiff's late posting was not intentional and that all parties have anticipated a jury trial in preparing for litigation. The judge also notes that the motion is unopposed. As a result, the judge grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to give notice.
