And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the County. The Plaintiff is seeking to compel the County to provide further responses to special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The Judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part.

The Judge has ordered the County to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to certain discovery requests, including requests for production and special interrogatories. The Judge has also denied the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.

The Judge has based the ruling on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Evidence Code. The Judge has also considered the meet and confer requirement, which requires the parties to engage in good faith discussions before filing a motion to compel.

The ruling is subject to change after the parties have been given an opportunity to respond and the Judge has reviewed the responses.
