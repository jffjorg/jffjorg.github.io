And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery responses filed by Plaintiff Carrie Miller. The motion seeks to compel responses from Defendants The Husl Ltd., Matthew Schellhas, and Varun Bajaj to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories-Employment, and Requests for Production of Documents. The motion also seeks sanctions against the defendants for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The court has deferred ruling on the request for sanctions pending argument at the hearing. The court notes that the defendants have not presented a written acknowledgement of an agreement to stay discovery, which they argue was agreed upon with the plaintiff. The court finds that this argument is unsupported and invalid. The plaintiff has not filed a reply brief to refute the defendants' account of the stay, and therefore, the court will defer ruling on the request for sanctions. The plaintiff will be ordered to give notice of the court's order and to file proof of service of same.
