Demurrer to First Amended Complaint and
Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended Complaint

Defendant Mayer Moizel




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Patrick Salway



 
MOTION
            Plaintiff
Patrick Salway (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Mayer Moizel (“Defendant”) for habitability
violations.  Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint and moves to strike portions of the complaint.  Plaintiff opposes the motions.
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782.)
In its order of
September 19, 2024, the Court overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint.  Defendant cannot demur to the first amended
complaint, when the Court has already overruled Defendant’s demurrer to claims Plaintiff
has repeated in the first amended complaint, as the Court had determined those
claims suffice for pleading purposes.  (Bennett
v. Suncloud (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 91, 96-97.)  Accordingly, the Court overrules the demurrer
as procedurally improper. 
Defendant moves to
strike the prayer for punitive damages. 
In ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages, “judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) To state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a plaintiff must allege the elements set forth in the punitive damages
statute, Civil Code section 3294. (College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721 (College Hospital).) Pursuant to Civil Code
section 3294, a plaintiff must allege the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)  “Malice is defined in the statute as conduct
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (College Hospital, supra,  8 Cal.4th at p. 725.)  “The mere allegation an intentional tort was
committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages. Not only
must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be
alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves v. Superior Ct.
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, internal citations and footnotes omitted.)
Plaintiff alleges
Defendant failed to maintain the apartment Plaintiff leased from Defendant in a
habitable condition; Defendant failed to remedy issues with the apartment even
though Plaintiff informed Defendant of such the issues; and the prior tenant of
the unit where Plaintiff resided sued Defendant regarding the presence of toxic
mold in the unit, but Defendant nonetheless failed to remedy the mold before
leasing the unit to Plaintiff.  (First
Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 15-18, 20, 22-24.) 
Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these allegations
suggest Defendant acted with malice, rather than negligently.  As such, the Court denies the motion to
strike.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint
is overruled.  Defendant’s motion to
strike is denied.  Defendant is to
answer the first amended complaint within 10 days.
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
