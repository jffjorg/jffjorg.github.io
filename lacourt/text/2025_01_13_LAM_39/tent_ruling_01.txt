MOTION
Plaintiff Carrie
Miller (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendants The Husl Ltd.,
Matthew Schellhas, and Varun Bajaj (collectively “Defendants”) to Form
Interrogatories, set one and Form Interrogatories—Employment, set one (“FROG”)
and Requests for Production of Documents, set one.  Plaintiff also moves to deem admitted matters
specified in Requests for Admissions, set one, all of which Plaintiff served on
Defendants.  After Plaintiff filed this
motion, Defendants responded to the discovery noted above.  The motions are, therefore, moot except as for
the issue of sanctions.
In opposition,
Defendants argue Plaintiff and Defendants agreed to a stay of discovery in this
matter.  Defendants fail to present to the
Court a written acknowledgement of such a stay. 
Without a written acknowledgement of this stay, the agreement was
invalid.  (See e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.270, subd. (b) [any extension regarding time to respond “may be informal,
but it shall be confirmed in a writing that specifies the extended date for
service of a response”].)  As such, this
argument is unsupported.
However, Plaintiff
has not filed a reply brief in which she refutes Defendants’ account of what
transpired between the parties concerning Defendants’ responses to the
discovery at issue.  The Court, therefore,
defers ruling on Plaintiff’s request for sanctions pending argument at the hearing
on the motions.  
Plaintiff will be ordered
to give notice of the Court’s order and to file proof of service of same.
