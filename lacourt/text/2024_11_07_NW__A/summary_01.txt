And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the judgment entered against her on January 2, 2024. This is the fourth time the defendant has attempted to challenge the judgment, and the previous three attempts were unsuccessful. The defendant claims that court employees engaged in dishonest practices and disrupted the lawful functions of the Superior Court of the State of California-Van Nuys Courthouse East, but she offers no evidence to support this claim. The Judge finds that the defendant has not shown any extrinsic fraud or improper conduct and that the statutes cited by the defendant do not permit the court to vacate the judgment.
