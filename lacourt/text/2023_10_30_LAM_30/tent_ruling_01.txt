Cornwell vs. City of Compton, et. al.,
Case No. 22STCV07996
 
Tentative Ruling re: 
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant’s Answer
 
Plaintiff Craig J. Cornwell (Plaintiff)
demurs to the 3rd-15th and 17th-19th Affirmative Defenses in the Amended Answer
of Defendant City of Los Angeles (Defendant). The unopposed demurrer is
sustained.
A
plaintiff may demur to a defendant’s answer within 10 days of being served with
the answer (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40(b)) on three grounds: (1) failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a defense; (2) uncertainty; or (3) failure
to state whether a contract alleged in the answer is written or oral. (Id.,
§ 430.20). The demurrer may be to the whole answer or to any one or more
of the several defenses set up in the answer. (Code Civ. Proc., §430.50(b).) 
“Generally
speaking, the determination whether an answer states a defense is governed by
the same principles which are applicable in determining if a complaint states a
cause of action.”  (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964)
226 Cal. App. 2d 725, 732.)  “[T]he demurrer to the answer admits all
issuable facts pleaded therein and eliminates all allegations of the complaint
denied by the answer.”  (Id. at 733.)  Unlike a demurrer to
complaint, “the defect in question need not appear on the face of the answer”
as “[t]he determination of the sufficiency of the answer requires an
examination of the complaint because its adequacy is with reference to the
complaint it purports to answer.” (Ibid.) 
On July 18, 2023, Defendant filed its
initial Answer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC). Defendant then
filed an Amended Answer to the SAC on August 21, 2023, stating a general denial
of Plaintiff’s allegations and nineteen affirmative defenses. 
On October 17, 2023, following the
filing of this demurrer and without Plaintiff’s stipulation, Defendant filed a
Second Amended Answer. As Plaintiff points out, the filing of the Second
Amended Answer is improper under Code Civ. Proc. § 472 (“A party may
amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed… A party may amend the pleading
after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike,
upon stipulation by the parties.”). Defendant’s Amended Answer remains the
operative pleading, and so Plaintiff’s unopposed demurrer is sustained.
