And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Pejman Salimpour, M.D., has moved to strike the allegations and prayer for relief relating to punitive damages in the plaintiff's complaint. The judge has denied the motion. The defendant's scheme to deprive the plaintiff of his fair share of the Property's value, including purchasing the second mortgage and filing a Notice of Foreclosure, was motivated by financial gain and a desire to "punish" the plaintiff for leaving his wife. The plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support recovery of punitive damages, including the defendant's intentional conduct intended to cause harm and take advantage of the plaintiff's financial distress. The judge has found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support a finding of malice under Civil Code section 3294.
