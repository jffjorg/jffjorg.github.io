And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendant's answer. The plaintiff, Craig J. Cornwell, has demurred to the 3rd-15th and 17th-19th affirmative defenses in the defendant's Amended Answer. The judge has sustained the unopposed demurrer. The defendant, City of Los Angeles, had filed an initial answer, an Amended Answer, and a Second Amended Answer, which is deemed improper under California Code of Civil Procedure, § 472. The judge will consider the sufficiency of the defendant's answer and will examine the complaint and answer to determine if the answer states a defense. The judge will determine if the answer is sufficient to constitute a defense, if it is uncertain, or if it fails to state whether a contract alleged is written or oral. The ruling is tentative and will be finalized at the hearing on October 30, 2023.
