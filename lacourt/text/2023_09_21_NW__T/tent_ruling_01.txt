  Case Number:  20VECV01484    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  T 20VECV01484 Napco v LB Property
Tentative ruling: Ex parte application by Hoffman and Hoffman Brothers to special set MSJs.
Denied.  Trial in this matter is set 11/14/2023.  The last date to have an MSJ heard is 10/14/2023,  MSJs have to be filed 75 days before the hearing.  This means that the last date for the MSJs to be filed in this case was 75 days before 10/14/2023 which is 7/31/2023.  Here, the MSJs were filed 8/29/2023 and 9/13/2023.  The motions were not timely filed.  If the court were to special set the motions as requested, the motions would be heard on 24 days notice and 8 days notice.  This doesn't even take into account the 2 extra days because of service by mail.  This means 22 days and 6 days notice.  This is not a situation in which motions were timely filed but there was no hearing date before the trial date.  The motions were not timely filed.  No good cause is shown.  The ex parte application is denied.
Additionally, all parties are reminded of the court's FSC order of 3/28/2023,  Strict compliance is required.
