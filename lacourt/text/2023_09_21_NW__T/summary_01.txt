And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied an ex parte application by Hoffman and Hoffman Brothers to special set motions for summary judgment (MSJs). The application was denied because the MSJs were not filed in a timely manner, with the last date to file being July 31, 2023, and the MSJs being filed on August 29 and September 13, 2023. The court also notes that granting the application would result in a short notice period for the hearing, which would not be fair to the other parties. The judge reminds all parties of the court's FSC order of March 28, 2023, which requires strict compliance. The trial in this matter is set for November 14, 2023, and the last date to have an MSJ heard is October 14, 2023.
