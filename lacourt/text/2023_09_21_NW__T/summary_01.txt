The application was denied because the MSJs were not filed in a timely manner, with the last date to file being July 31, 2023, and the MSJs being filed on August 29 and September 13, 2023. The court also notes that granting the application would result in a short notice period for the hearing, which would not be fair to the other parties.

The trial in this matter is set for November 14, 2023, and the last date to have an MSJ heard is October 14, 2023.
