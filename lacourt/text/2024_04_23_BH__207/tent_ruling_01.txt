MOTIONS


Motion
  to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena (Judith Sender)




MOVING PARTY


Plaintiff
  27715 PCH LLC




OPPOSING PARTY


(none)



 
MOTIONS
 
This action stems from a dispute over the purchase of residential real
estate.  Plaintiff 27715 PCH LLC
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on
third party Judith Sender and requests monetary sanctions.  The Motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Motion to Compel
 
“In California, discovery may
be obtained from a nonparty through an oral deposition, a written deposition,
or a deposition for the production of business records and things. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2020.010, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior
Court of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1030 (hereafter Board
of Registered Nursing).) “To pursue the deposition of a nonparty, a party
must generally serve a deposition subpoena.” (Ibid.).)
 
“‘A deposition subpoena that
commands only the production of business records for copying shall designate
the business records to be produced either by specifically describing each
individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category of item, and
shall specify the form in which any electronically stored information is to be
produced, if a particular form is desired.’ [Citation.]” (Board of
Registered Nursing, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1030.)
 
“‘If a deponent fails to
answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.’ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing, supra,
59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1031.) “‘[D]iscovery conducted by
way of a business records subpoena is a
“deposition.”’ [Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1031-1032.) “If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by [a party or a witness] . . . may make an order . . .
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)
 
            As
a threshold matter, the Court notes that the Declaration of George Daniel,
which purports to authenticate all submitted exhibits, is not signed under
penalty of perjury, and therefore, neither the declaration nor the attached
exhibits have any evidentiary value.
 
            Moreover,
the proof of service for the deposition subpoena to Judith Sender indicates it
was left with “Roberto Ayacel – Employee.” 
However, Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.220 requires personal
service on natural persons.  As such,
service of the deposition subpoena on Judith Sender does not appear proper in
any event.
 
            Furthermore,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346 requires that the motion to compel be
personally served on the nonparty deponent unless they have agreed to accept
service by mail or electronic service. 
Here, the proof of service indicates service of the motion by mail, and
there is no evidence in the record that Judith Sender agreed to service by
mail.
 
Sanctions
 
            Because
Plaintiff has failed to submit any admissible evidence to support of the
Motion, and because it does not appear the deposition subpoena or the motion was
properly served on Judith Sender, the Court declines to award monetary sanctions
for Ms. Sender’s purported failure to respond or attend the deposition.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Judith
Sender’s compliance with the deposition subpoena and denies Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.

Sanctions
 
            Because
Plaintiff has failed to support its motion with admissible evidence, the Court
similarly denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Closing
Escrow Agents Inc.’s compliance with the deposition subpoena and denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
