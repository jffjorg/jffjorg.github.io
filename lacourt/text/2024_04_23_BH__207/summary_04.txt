And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint adequately state a cause of action for wrongful death based on the defendant's negligence in providing care to the decedent. The decedent was a dependent adult with mental limitations who required special care and supervision. However, the defendant failed to provide adequate care and supervision, which led to the decedent's elopement from the hospital and subsequent death. The court orders the defendant to file an answer to the complaint on or before May 14, 2024, and to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
