MOTION
 
Plaintiff Patio Del Moro, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) moves to enforce the stipulated judgment entered into between
Plaintiff and Defendant John Coyne (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.) In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of
fact. The court must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and
binding settlement. To do so, the court may receive oral testimony in addition
to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530,
1533.)
 
The issue on a motion to enforce
settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 is whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement. (See Viejo v.
Bancorp. (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200, 209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make
factual determinations under section 664.6 is generally limited to whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement”].)  In other words, the only issue before the
court is whether an agreement exists; not whether the agreement has been
breached.
 
Here, the parties entered into an
Unlawful Detainer Stipulated Judgment on July 20, 2023, which the Court entered
the same day (See Stipulated Judgment, Jul. 20, 2023; Ex. 3 to Reynoso Decl.)  Pursuant to the terms of the stipulated
judgment, judgment was entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $108,000, plus $1000 in attorney fees and $345 in costs.  Defendant was to pay $6,750 per month plus
$6,000 for a total of $12,750 on the first of each month.  Defendant had 3 days to cure any default
after notice from Plaintiff.  In the
event of default, judgment is to be entered on the remaining balance due, plus
attorney fees of $1,000 and costs of $345.
 
In the event of default, Defendant’s
rights under the lease were also to be forfeited and Plaintiff awarded
possession of the premises, and upon Defendant’s payment of the $108,000,
Defendant could resume leasing the premises.
 
Defendant’s payments stopped in
February of 2024, leaving a remaining balance of $72,000 on the judgment.  (Reynoso Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11 and Ex. 4.)  Plaintiff notified Defendant of his default
of the February payment on February 20, 2024. 
(Reynoso Decl. ¶ 12 and Ex. 5.) 
Plaintiff did not receive a response from Plaintiff within three days
and had not yet received payments for February or March as of April 1, 2024. (Reynoso
Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
Plaintiff seeks a judgment in the
outstanding balance of $72,000, plus $1,000 in attorneys’ fees and $345 in
costs, for a total of $73,345, plus possession of the premises, and forfeiture
of Defendant’s lease.  Plaintiff also
seeks daily interest from April 23, 2024 of $22.53 per day until the judgment
is satisfied.
 
The proposed judgment conforms with
the terms of the stipulated judgment except for the daily interest.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement, with the exception
of the request for daily interest, and will enter the judgment in conformance
with the ruling.  
 
            Plaintiff
shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service
regarding the same.
