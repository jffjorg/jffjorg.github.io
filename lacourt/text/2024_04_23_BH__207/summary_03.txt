Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion for a protective order. The defendants have shown good cause for a protective order due to the excessive number of discovery demands propounded by the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to justify the number of requests, and the court orders that the defendants do not need to respond to the excessive requests for admission and interrogatories. The plaintiff may propound up to 35 requests for admission and interrogatories in the future. The court denies the defendants' request to restrain the plaintiff from serving duplicative discovery requests on separate defendants. The court otherwise denies the defendants' motion and orders them to serve responses to the form interrogatories and requests for production.
