And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Patio Del Moro, LLC to enforce a stipulated judgment entered into with Defendant John Coyne. The stipulated judgment was entered on July 20, 2023, and required Defendant to pay $6,750 per month for a total of $108,000, plus $1,000 in attorney fees and $345 in costs. Defendant's payments stopped in February 2024, leaving a remaining balance of $72,000. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the default and Defendant did not respond within three days. Plaintiff seeks a judgment for the outstanding balance, plus interest and costs, and possession of the premises, and forfeiture of Defendant's lease. The judge grants the motion, except for the request for daily interest, and will enter the judgment in conformity with the ruling.
