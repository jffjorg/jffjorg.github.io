And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Intercommunity Anesthesiology Services, Inc. (IAS) to the second, third, and fourth causes of action of the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FXC) filed by PIH Health Whittier Hospital (PIH). The judge has sustained IAS's demurrer, with 15 days leave to amend.

The judge found that PIH's allegations of unjust enrichment, mistaken receipt, and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 are insufficient. The judge concluded that PIH's unjust enrichment claim is based on payments made to IAS for services actually rendered, and that PIH has not alleged any facts that could show it was induced to believe that a contract existed that obligated it to pay for IAS's services.

The judge also found that PIH's mistaken receipt claim is insufficient because it does not allege fraud or mistake. The judge noted that PIH has not alleged any facts that could show it was induced to believe that a contract existed or that it was required to pay for IAS's services.

Finally, the judge found that PIH's section 17200 claim is insufficiently pled. The judge concluded that PIH must allege some facts that could show it was induced to pay IAS or induced to believe a contract still existed beyond the conclusory assertion that they were.

The judge has granted IAS's demurrer and given PIH 15 days to amend its FXC.
