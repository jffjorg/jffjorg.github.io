Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting summary judgment or adjudication to the defendant, Renaissance Imaging Medical Associates, Inc., as to the seventh and eighth causes of action, and as to the prayer for punitive damages. The motion is denied as to the first through sixth causes of action.

The judge finds that the plaintiff, Analee Santos, does not have a basis for punitive damages because no malicious or oppressive conduct is alleged, and because the only employee against whom any wrongful conduct is alleged was not a managing agent of the defendant.

The judge also finds that the defendant is entitled to relief on the seventh and eighth causes of action, which relate to the plaintiff's requests for FMLA and CFRA leave, because the plaintiff did not meet the minimum time requirements to be eligible for such leave.

However, the judge finds that triable issues of fact exist as to whether the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action or was constructively discharged, and therefore denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on the first through sixth causes of action.

The judge notes that the evidence raises questions as to whether the plaintiff's resignation was voluntary, and whether the defendant's demands for resignation constituted an adverse employment action. The judge finds that it is unclear whether an employer's direct demand for an employee's resignation constitutes an adverse employment action if accepted.
