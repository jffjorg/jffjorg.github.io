And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has granted Defendant Blackfish Capital, LLC's motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Kristin Seymour's claims. The Judge found that the arbitration agreement executed by Plaintiff on May 29, 2021 designates the American Arbitration Association (AAA) as the default arbitration provider, and that Plaintiff's choice of JAMS as an alternative provider is not supported by the agreement. The Judge also found that the agreement does not require Defendant's consent for the choice of arbitration provider, and that the designation of AAA is not one-sided. The Judge rejected Plaintiff's arguments that the choice of AAA is unreasonable because it does not provide for the discovery provided in other arbitration services, finding that the arbitrator retains discretion to permit further discovery if necessary. Finally, the Judge noted that Defendant's preference for AAA is due to the cost savings, with AAA arbitrations generally being less expensive than those with JAMS or ADR Services.
