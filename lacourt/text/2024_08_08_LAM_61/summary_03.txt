And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims for sexual harassment and discrimination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable, but the judge found that the agreement was invalid and unenforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA). The judge also found that the plaintiff had alleged a viable FEHA harassment claim, and that the prohibition on enforcing arbitration agreements under the EFAA applies to "a case which ... relates to the ... sexual harassment dispute." The judge's ruling is based on the text of the EFAA and the case law interpreting its provisions.
