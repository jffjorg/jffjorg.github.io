Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant, Edward Jenkins Realty, Inc. dba Jenkins Property Management, had moved to strike the allegations of punitive damages, claiming that they were not supported by sufficient facts in the complaint. The judge found that the complaint did contain sufficient factual allegations to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, and therefore denied the motion. The judge noted that the defendant failed to file a reply brief in support of its motion.
