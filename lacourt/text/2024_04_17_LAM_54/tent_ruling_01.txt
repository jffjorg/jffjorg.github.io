BACKGROUND
 
On November 24, 2021, Plaintiffs Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte sued Defendants Brian M. Cronin, Natalie Gonzalez
Cronin, ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros, asserting causes of action for
(1) securities fraud; (2) fraud by concealment; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) breach of buyer note;
(6) breach of debt assumption agreement; (7) breach of employment agreement;
and (8) financial elder abuse. 
 
Plaintiffs founded Orthopros, an
orthotics and prosthetics company in 1982. Plaintiffs allege they sold
Orthopros to Defendants via a stock purchase agreement in 2020 for $1,193,756.
Joel and John each received a Buyer Note from Orthopros for $471,886. ARC-IV
agreed to assume certain “contingent liabilities” that Orthopros owed to Joel
and John in an amount not to exceed $249,984. Plaintiffs continued to work for
Orthopros until November 2021. Plaintiff alleges Orthopros defaulted on the
buyer notes by obtaining a $500,000 small business loan.
 
On February 28, 2022, Brian M. Cronin,
ARC-IV, LLC, ARC-V, Inc., and Orthopros filed a cross-complaint against Joel
Bernknopf and John Lamorte, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
employment agreement; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (3) fraud – concealment; and (4) fraud – intentional
misrepresentation.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The moving party on a motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) must submit
“specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).)  If the moving party has
shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections.  (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to RPDs, sets two, three and four, from Defendant ARC-IV and to RPDs,
sets three and four from Defendant Orthopros. On March 21, 2024, the Court
relieved Defendants’ counsel. The Court record reflects that Defendants have
not yet retained counsel. As Defendants Orthopros and ARC-IV are entities, they
cannot proceed in this action without counsel. The motions are CONTINUED. The
Court will set a date at the hearing.

ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Natalie Gonzalez-Cronin moves for summary adjudication of seventh, eleventh,
thirteenth and fourteenth the causes of action. In opposition, Plaintiffs argue
that the motion must be denied because it was untimely served. Defendant served
the motion by electronic service on Friday, February 2, 2024, 75 days before
the hearing date of April 17, 2024. Plaintiff asserts that motion must have
been served no later than Wednesday January 31, 2024.
Defendant’s
motion is untimely. CCP § 437c(a)(2) provides that “[n]otice of the motion and
supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least
75 days before the time appointed for hearing.” (CCP § 437c(a)(2); see Cuff
v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 582, 596.) If
the notice is served by electronic mail, the 75-day period is increased by 2
days. (CCP, § 437c(a)(2).) The Court lacks power to change the notice and
filing periods of section 437c. (See McMahon v. Superior Court (2003)
106 Cal.App.4th 112, 115-18; see also Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 758, 765-66 (discussing McMahon and reversing judgment
for failure to provide notice by the statutorily required minimum time);
Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 299.) 
 
Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
