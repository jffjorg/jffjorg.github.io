Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decisions regarding two motions: a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and a motion for summary adjudication.

Regarding the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, the judge continues the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, sets the motion for a date at the hearing, and informs the parties that they can email the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel or self-represented party before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.

Regarding the motion for summary adjudication, the judge denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication, as the defendant served the motion untimely, in violation of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 437c(a)(2).
