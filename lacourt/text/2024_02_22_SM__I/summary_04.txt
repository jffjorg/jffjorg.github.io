And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the cross-complaint is partly overruled and partly sustained without leave to amend. The case involves a dispute over allegedly incorrect tax advice provided by a law firm to the plaintiff, which resulted in a larger tax liability. The cross-complainants, who are suing the law firm and its partner, allege that the law firm owed them a duty to provide accurate tax advice. The court holds that the law firm owed no direct duty to the cross-complainants, but may have owed a duty if the cross-complainants were intended to rely on the law firm's advice. However, the court notes that the complaint does not clearly show whether the law firm knew that its advice would be relied upon by the cross-complainants. The court also holds that the cross-complainants' claim for indemnity is unlikely to succeed, as the liability is likely to be several rather than joint. The court sustains the demurrer to the cause of action for declaratory relief, as the issue will be resolved on the merits or by the jury's verdict.
