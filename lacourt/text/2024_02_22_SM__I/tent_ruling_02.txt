 Case Number:  23SMCP00627    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed petition to confirm the arbitration award is
DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  The actual
petition to confirm is not signed by counsel, which the court presumes is an
oversight.  An updated (signed) version
needs to be filed.  Further, there is no
proof of service of the motion, which is also required.  Assuming that a signed petition and a POS is
filed, and assuming there is still no opposition, the court would be inclined
to grant.
