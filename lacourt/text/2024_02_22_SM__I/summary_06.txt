Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a sexual assault case involving a plaintiff who was served excessive amounts of alcohol at a bar called Bacari PDR, where the alleged assailant, Trimm, worked as a waiter. The plaintiff alleges that Trimm served her four glasses of wine despite her being underage, and then led her to a secluded bathroom where he allegedly raped her. The defendants, Bacari Founder Holdings, Inc. and Bacari PDR, LLC, argue that they are not liable for Trimm's actions under the Lisa M. doctrine, which holds that an employer is not liable for an employee's sexual assault if the employee was acting outside the scope of their employment. The judge has ruled that the Lisa M. doctrine does not apply in this case, as the alleged rape was committed by an employee who was acting within the course and scope of his employment, and that the defendants are liable for Trimm's actions. The court has also denied the motion to strike, which sought to strike the claims for punitive damages.
