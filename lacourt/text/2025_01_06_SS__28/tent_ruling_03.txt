The Court dismissed all pending  and future claims against Estate by the parties served with Estate’s motion (to  the extent those claims arise from the facts giving rise to this case),  including cross-complaints for equitable indemnity.  On  June 21, 2024, the Court dismissed Estate with prejudice at Plaintiff’s  request.  On  July 15, 2024, the Court dismissed the cross-complaint filed by “Richard Lam,  Helen, Lam, Amy Lam, et al.” on March 15, 2023 without prejudice at their  request.  On  December 4, 2024, Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, and Management  (“Moving Defendants”) filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for an  independent medical examination on March 3, 2025 and for sanctions.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  Trial  is currently scheduled for January 28, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Moving  Defendants ask the Court to compel Plaintiff to appear for an independent  medical examination on March 3, 2025 and to impose sanctions on Plaintiff.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a), provides:  “Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any  party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings  on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or  before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020,  subd. (a).)  DISCUSSION  Moving  Defendants ask the Court for an order under Code of Civil Procedure section  2032.240 requiring Plaintiff to attend an independent medical examination on  March 3, 2025.  Moving Defendants assert  that they properly noticed Plaintiff’s physical examination but Plaintiff failed to appear.   March 3, 2025 is after the discovery cut-off  date provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision  (a).  The Court has not granted a motion  to reopen discovery that would allow Moving Defendants to conduct an independent medical examination on March 3, 2025.   Moving  Defendants have filed a separate motion to continue the trial and related dates  which is set for hearing on January 17, 2025.  The Court  continues the hearing on Moving Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent  medical examination to the same day as the hearing on Moving Defendants’ motion  to continue the trial and related dates.  CONCLUSION            The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion to compel  Plaintiff Marguerita Ludwig’s independent  medical examination filed by Defendants Richard  Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, LLC, and Lam Property Management to  the same day as the hearing on Defendants’ motion to continue the trial and related dates.           Moving parties are ordered to give notice of the Court’s  ruling.            Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of service of  this ruling with the Court within five days.
