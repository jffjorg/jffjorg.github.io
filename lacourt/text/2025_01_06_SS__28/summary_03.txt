And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel Plaintiff Marguerita Ludwig to appear for an independent medical examination filed by the Moving Defendants (Richard Lam, Helen Lam, Amy Lam, 380 Sierra Madre, LLC, and Lam Property Management). The Moving Defendants assert that they properly noticed Plaintiff's physical examination, but Plaintiff failed to appear. However, the Court notes that March 3, 2025, the date of the proposed examination, is after the discovery cut-off date provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a). The Court has not granted a motion to reopen discovery that would allow the Moving Defendants to conduct an independent medical examination on this date.

As a result, the Court continues the hearing on the motion to compel Plaintiff's independent medical examination to the same day as the hearing on the Moving Defendants' motion to continue the trial and related dates, which is set for hearing on January 17, 2025. The Court orders the Moving parties to give notice of the Court's ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
