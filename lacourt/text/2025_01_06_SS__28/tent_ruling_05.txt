depart from the general principle that all persons owe a duty of care to avoid
injuring others, we explained, ‘involves the balancing of a number of
considerations’: ‘the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of
certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection
between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame
attached to the defendant’s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the
extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of
imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the
availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.’ ” (Brown,
supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 217, quoting Rowland v. Christian (1968)
69 Cal.2d 108, 112–113.)
