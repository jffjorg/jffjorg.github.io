And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Plaintiff Sheila Reed and Defendant Wheel Labs, Inc. The parties reached a settlement agreement on August 23, 2024, in which Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $7,500.00 within 30 days of receiving the executed agreement and IRS Form W-9. However, Plaintiff has not received the settlement funds, and Defendant's counsel has not provided a timeline for payment. The court has lifted the stay imposed on April 24, 2023, and granted Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The court has also awarded Plaintiff $1,060.00 in sanctions, which includes four hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and one filing fee. The court has ordered Defendant to pay Plaintiff $7,500.00 within 14 days of the date of this order and to pay the sanctions by February 6, 2025.
