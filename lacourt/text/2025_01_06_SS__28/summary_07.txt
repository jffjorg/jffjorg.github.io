And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Abner Blanco Ramirez, and has denied the motion. The defendants, Lopez and Martinez, filed a motion to compel Ramirez's deposition, citing that they served him with deposition notices in October 2023, February 2024, and April 2024, but Ramirez failed to attend without serving a valid objection. However, the defendants did not provide evidence that Ramirez failed to attend the depositions without serving a valid objection, and did not explain why the depositions did not take place. The judge found that the defendants did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which requires a showing of good cause justifying the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things. The judge therefore denied the motion and ordered the defendants to give notice and file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
