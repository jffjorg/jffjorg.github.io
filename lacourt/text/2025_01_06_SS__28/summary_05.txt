Tentative Ruling:

In this case, the court is considering the duty of care owed by individuals to avoid injuring others. The court explains that departing from this general principle requires balancing a number of factors, including the foreseeability of harm, the certainty of injury, the connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury, moral blame, the policy of preventing future harm, the burden on the defendant, and the availability and cost of insurance. The court references a previous case, Brown v. [Defendant's Name], and the precedent set by Rowland v. Christian (1968). This tentative ruling sets the stage for the upcoming court hearing.
