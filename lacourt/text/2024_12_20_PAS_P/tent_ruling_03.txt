 Case Number:  23AHCV02828    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANTS’
DEMURRER TO THE FAC I.         INTRODUCTION
This case arises out of a dispute
between Plaintiff José Moreno-Carretero (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants Jesús
Lizarán-Rus (“Lizarán”) and PAGRA International Services, LLC (“PAGRA”)
(collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges that he and Lizarán entered
into a valid and enforceable oral contract in 2014, whereby they agreed to
share the proceeds of certain business opportunities, including those related to
Los Altos Food Products, Inc. (“LAF”). Plaintiff further alleges that despite
the agreement, Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiff his share of the
proceeds, instead using PAGRA as a vehicle to receive and conceal funds owed to
him. Defendants deny these claims and challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s
allegations.
On June 18, 2024, the Court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the initial complaint. On July 18, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes of action
for 1) Breach of Contract and 2) Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations.
On August 19, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on December 9, 2024, and Defendants filed a reply on December 13,
2024.
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
In this case, Defendants filed a
meet and confer declaration. However, the declaration indicates that the meet
and confer efforts were conducted via letter and email, rather than through the
required methods of in-person, telephone, or video conference communication.
(Decl., p. 5.) As no meeting occurred in person, by telephone, or via video
conference, the Court finds that counsel failed to comply with the statutory
meet-and-confer requirements under section 430.41.
Judicial Notice
Defendants request judicial notice
of the following documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court:

The Complaint
     filed on December 7, 2023.
The
     Opposition to the Demurrer filed on June 5, 2024.

Judicial notice of court records is
proper under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). As such, the Court
GRANTS Defendants' request for judicial notice
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Pursuant to CCP § 335.1, an action
for injury to an individual cause by the neglect of another must be filed
within two years. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendants demur to the first cause
of action for Breach of Contract, alleging misjoinder of a party, failure to
state a cause of action as to PAGRA, and ambiguity in the allegations.
Defendants also demur to the second cause of action for Intentional Interference
with Contractual Relations, asserting failure to state a cause of action
against PAGRA International Services, LLC, and ambiguity.
First cause of action: Breach of Contract
Defendants demur to the first cause
of action, arguing that the FAC fails to state a claim because PAGRA was not a
party to the 2014 oral contract and could not have breached it. They emphasize
that PAGRA did not exist at the time the alleged contract was formed and
contend that Plaintiff’s attempt to hold PAGRA liable under an alter ego theory
is unsupported by sufficient facts. Defendants further argue that the FAC’s
allegations regarding alter ego are conclusory and fail to establish the
elements necessary to pierce the corporate veil. (Demurrer, pp. 4–6)
In opposition, Plaintiff contends
that the FAC sufficiently alleges a breach of contract claim against Defendant
Lizarán and clarifies that PAGRA is liable under an alter ego theory. Plaintiff
asserts that PAGRA was formed by Lizarán as a vehicle to receive funds derived
from the contract and that PAGRA’s existence should not shield Lizarán from
liability. Plaintiff argues that the FAC includes sufficient facts to allege a
unity of interest between PAGRA and Lizarán, including commingling of assets,
lack of corporate formalities, and shared ownership among Lizarán and his
family. (Opposition, pp. 9–10)
The Court finds that while the FAC
alleges the existence of an oral contract between Plaintiff and Lizarán, it
fails to allege sufficient facts to establish PAGRA’s liability under the
contract. The FAC acknowledges that PAGRA was not formed until 2022, eight
years after the 2014 oral agreement. Plaintiff seeks to hold PAGRA liable under
an alter ego theory, which allows courts to pierce the corporate veil when “an
abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the equitable ownership of a
corporation liable for the actions of the corporation.” (Sonora Diamond
Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.) Under the alter
ego doctrine, the corporate form may be disregarded when it is used to
accomplish a wrongful or inequitable purpose. (Id.)
However, the FAC fails to allege
sufficient specific facts to support the requisite elements for alter ego
liability. While Plaintiff asserts commingling of assets, lack of corporate
formalities, and shared ownership among Lizarán and his family, these allegations
are conclusory and do not demonstrate the unity of interest or inequitable
result required under Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d
290, 300.
Based on the foregoing, the
demurrer as to this cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
Second cause of action: Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations
A claim for intentional
interference of contractual relationship requires the following elements: (1)
plaintiff had a valid and existing contract with a third party; (2) defendant
had knowledge of the contract; (3) defendant committed intentional and unjustified
acts designed to interfere with or disrupt the contract; (4) actual
interference with or disruption of the relationship; and (5) resulting
damages.  (Davis v. Nadrich (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1,
10.)   
Defendants demur to this cause of
action, arguing that it is uncertain and legally insufficient. They assert that
the FAC alleges that both Lizarán and PAGRA breached the contract, effectively
treating PAGRA as a party to the contract. (FAC ¶45.) Defendants rely on Applied
Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, which
held that a party to a contract cannot be held liable in tort for conspiracy to
interfere with its own contract. Similarly, Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. v.
Actelion Ltd. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 945, 961, established that a
contracting party cannot interfere with its own contract. Defendants argue that
because the FAC alleges that PAGRA breached the contract, PAGRA is treated as a
party to the contract and thus cannot be held liable for interfering with it.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the FAC sufficiently alleges all elements of intentional interference with
contractual relations. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that there was a valid,
binding, and enforceable oral contract between Plaintiff and Lizarán, that
PAGRA had knowledge of the contract, and that PAGRA disrupted performance by
concealing that it had received money owed to Plaintiff under the contract and
refusing to pay him. Plaintiff further contends that PAGRA intended to disrupt
performance or knew that disruption was certain or substantially certain to
occur, resulting in damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $734,667.95, plus
interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. (FAC ¶¶ 49–52; Opposition, p. 8¿)
The Court finds that the FAC fails
to sufficiently allege a claim for intentional interference with contractual
relations against PAGRA. While Plaintiff asserts that PAGRA disrupted the
contract by concealing funds and refusing to pay Plaintiff, the FAC
simultaneously alleges that PAGRA is liable for breaching the same contract. As
Defendants correctly argue, a party to a contract cannot interfere with its own
contract. (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 503, 514; Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. v. Actelion Ltd. (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 945, 961.) The allegations treat PAGRA as both a party to and an
interferer with the contract, which is legally impermissible.
Moreover, while Plaintiff attempts
to frame PAGRA as a separate entity acting to interfere with the contract, the
FAC’s reliance on alter ego theory undermines this argument. Under the alter
ego doctrine, PAGRA and Lizarán are treated as a single entity for liability
purposes. 
Additionally, the FAC does not allege specific facts
demonstrating that PAGRA committed intentional and unjustified acts designed to
interfere with or disrupt the contract. The FAC relies on conclusory
allegations rather than providing the necessary factual support to establish
the elements of intentional interference.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
SUSTAINS Defendants’ demurrer as to the second cause of action with leave to
amend. Plaintiff is granted leave to amend to clarify their theory against
PAGRA and to allege further specific facts to support this cause of action.
IV.       ORDER
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer as
to the FAC in its entirety, without leave to amend as to the Breach of Contract
cause of action, and with leave to amend for the Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations cause of action. Plaintiff must file an amended complaint
within 20 days of this order.
Defendants to give notice.
