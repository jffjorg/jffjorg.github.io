 Case Number:  23AHCV02226    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION – SET ONE and MONETARY
SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
This is a lemon law case. On October 9, 2018, Plaintiff Jose Garcia Ruiz
(“Plaintiff”) purchased a new 2019 Honda Pilot (the “Vehicle”), which was
subject to a warranty by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc., (“Honda”).
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint
alleging causes of action for (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of
express warranty, and (2) fraudulent concealment. On October 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further discovery
responses. Honda filed its opposition on December 9, 2024. Plaintiff filed a
reply on December 12, 2024.
Meet and confer
A motion to compel further discovery responses must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration stating, “facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.)
Here, Plaintiff submitted a meet and confer declaration outlining their
efforts to resolve the dispute regarding RFP No. 46. On January 8, 2024,
Plaintiff sent a detailed meet and confer letter to Defendant, addressing the
deficiencies in Defendant’s responses to RFP No. 46 (Nandivada Decl. ¶ 9; Ex.
C). Following this letter, the parties conducted a meet and confer telephone
call to discuss their respective positions on the disputed responses.
Additionally, Plaintiff confirmed the parties’ positions through an email to
Defendant’s counsel on August 9, 2024, before filing the motion (Nandivada
Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. D).
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts satisfy the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.)
 Request for judicial notice
Where the motion is based on a matter of which the Court may take
judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452 or 453, the matter must
be specified in the notice of motion or supporting points and authorities,
unless otherwise permitted by the Court (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d)).
Judicial notice may be taken of “[r]ecords of … any court of this state” (Evid.
Code, § 452, subd. (d)).
Here, Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of the first
amended complaint filed in Khosrow Mobayen v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,
Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 19STCV33467, attached as Exhibit 1
to Plaintiff’s motion. The document is a court record filed in the State of
California, which is a proper subject for judicial notice under Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (d).
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of Exhibit 1.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories or production of documents must be noticed within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.  (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685).) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is
mandatory and jurisdictional.  (Sexton, supra,58 Cal. App. 4th at
1410.)   
            To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding
party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior
Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party
objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably
accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or
(ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of its
accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
III.      ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Honda to provide further responses to Request for
Production (RFP) No. 46, which seeks documents produced in the class action
lawsuit, Mobayen v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Plaintiff argues that
these documents are relevant to claims of fraudulent concealment and civil
penalties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Specifically, Plaintiff
asserts that the requested documents pertain to similar defects in the transmission
of vehicles, including Plaintiff’s 2019 Honda Pilot, as alleged in the Mobayen
case (Motion, pp. 6–8). Plaintiff further contends that this discovery is
critical to establishing Honda’s exclusive knowledge and willfulness in
handling vehicle defects, which is central to both the fraudulent concealment
claim and the potential for civil penalties (Motion, pp. 9–11; Reply, pp. 3–4).
Additionally, Plaintiff challenges Honda’s objections, including claims of
vagueness, overbreadth, and irrelevance, as lacking substantial justification
(Motion, pp. 10–12; Reply, p. 5).
In opposition, Honda argues that
the requested documents are irrelevant to Plaintiff’s claims. Honda asserts
that the Mobayen case involves different vehicle models, systems, and
legal issues, making the discovery inapplicable to Plaintiff’s individual
warranty and fraud claims (Opposition, pp. 4–5). Honda also contends that RFP
No. 46 constitutes an improper “cloned discovery” request, as it seeks all
documents from an unrelated case without specifying their relevance to
Plaintiff’s claims (Opposition, pp. 5–6). Furthermore, Honda raises
confidentiality concerns, asserting that the requested documents contain
sensitive information about non-parties (Opposition, pp. 6–7).
The Court has reviewed RFP No. 46
and finds that the wording, “ALL DOCUMENTS YOU produced in connection with
Mobayen, et al. v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,” is overly broad and vague.
As Honda correctly notes, the requested documents encompass information and
parties that exceed the scope of relevancy to this case. Without a more
targeted request specifying the particular categories of documents or
information sought, the request remains unreasonably expansive and
insufficiently specific. Additionally, the Court acknowledges Honda’s
confidentiality concerns regarding sensitive information about non-parties,
which further justifies narrowing the scope of the request. For these reasons,
the Court finds that RFP No. 46, as presently drafted, is overly broad and not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Accordingly, the motion to compel further responses to RFP No. 46 is DENIED.
 
 
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure §2023.030
grants the court discretion to impose sanctions against any party engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. Misuse includes the failure to respond to
authorized discovery methods or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., §2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) Further, CCP §2030.300(d)
mandates that the court impose monetary sanctions against any party who
unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories,
unless that party acted with substantial justification or if imposing sanctions
would be unjust.
Plaintiff’s sanctions
Plaintiff requests $2, 122.50 in
monetary sanctions against Honda and its counsel under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, alleging that Honda engaged in discovery abuse by
refusing to provide further responses to RFP No. 46 without substantial
justification (Motion, p. 12). Plaintiff further asserts that the requested
documents are relevant to claims of fraudulent concealment and civil penalties,
and that Honda’s refusal to produce them has unnecessarily burdened the Court
and Plaintiff (Motion, pp. 10–12).
The Court finds that Honda’s
objections are supported by substantial justification. RFP No. 46, as currently
worded, is overly broad and inadequately tailored to the claims and defenses in
this case. Honda’s refusal to provide further responses is therefore justified
under the circumstances. Given that the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to RFP No. 46, the Court also DENIES Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions.
Honda’s sanctions
Honda requests monetary sanctions
in the amount of $1,635 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel under
California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030, arguing that
Plaintiff’s motion is frivolous and part of a pattern of discovery abuse
(Opposition, p.4). Honda asserts that Plaintiff has engaged in “cookie-cutter”
discovery tactics by serving overly broad and burdensome requests, including
RFP No. 46, which seeks all documents from a separate class action lawsuit
without specificity or clear relevance (Opposition, p. 9). Honda contends that
opposing this motion has imposed unnecessary legal costs and requests sanctions
to deter similar conduct in the future (Opposition, p. 9). While California
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 authorize sanctions
against parties engaging in misuse of the discovery process, sanctions are only
appropriate if the motion to compel is entirely without merit. The Court finds
that Plaintiff’s motion, while ultimately denied, was not frivolous. Plaintiff
has articulated a reasonable basis for believing that certain documents from
the Mobayen litigation may be relevant to this case. Although the Court
agrees with Honda that RFP No. 46 is overly broad and inadequately tailored,
the motion itself does not rise to the level of bad faith or frivolous conduct.
Consequently, Honda’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER

Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Request for Production – Set
One No. 46.
            The Court
DENIES Plaintiff and Honda’s request for monetary sanctions.
