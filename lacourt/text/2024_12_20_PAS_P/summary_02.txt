And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied plaintiff Jose Garcia Ruiz's motion to compel further responses to Request for Production – Set One No. 46. The court found that the request was overly broad and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court also denied plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) and granted Honda's request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff. The court concluded that Honda's objections to the request were justified and that plaintiff's motion was not frivolous. The court ordered that Honda is not required to provide further responses to the request.
