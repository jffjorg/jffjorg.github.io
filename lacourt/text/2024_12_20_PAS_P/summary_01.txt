And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Honda's motion to bifurcate the trial. The case involves a lawsuit brought by William and Joy Wong against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and fraudulent concealment regarding defects in the infotainment system of a 2018 Honda Odyssey. Honda argued that bifurcation is necessary to protect against premature disclosure of its financial condition, citing Civil Code section 3295(d), which precludes the admission of evidence regarding a defendant's financial condition until the trier of fact determines liability and finds that the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge agrees with Honda that bifurcation is necessary to ensure a fair and impartial trial, and that the potential for overlap of evidence does not outweigh the legislative intent to protect defendants from the prejudicial impact of premature disclosure of their financial condition. The trial is scheduled for January 28, 2025.
