And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted M. Zha's motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment. The court finds that M. Zha was not properly served with process, as the substitute service at the Cork Tree address was improper. The court concludes that the default judgment is void and sets aside the default judgment. The court intends to set a further case management conference and an order to show cause re: proof of service as to M. Zha at the hearing on January 13, 2025.
