And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Tesla's motion to compel binding arbitration in this Song-Beverly action. The case is stayed pending completion of the arbitration. The dispute arises from Naranjo-Zendejas's allegations of vehicle defects and nonconformities to warranty after purchasing a 2023 Tesla Model Y. Tesla argues that Naranjo-Zendejas agreed to an arbitration provision in the order agreement and retail installment sale contract, which requires any disputes to be resolved through arbitration. The court finds that Tesla has produced prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate and that Naranjo-Zendejas has failed to file a timely opposition to the motion. Therefore, the court grants Tesla's motion and stays the case pending completion of the arbitration.
