The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the ex parte application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and order to show cause filed by Jessica M. and Crime Survivors, Inc. against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Board of Parole Hearings. The petitioners seek to cancel the parole suitability hearing of Sergio Linares, which is scheduled for October 2, 2024.

The judge has ordered the hearing on the ex parte application to be advanced to September 26, 2024, at 10:30 a.m., and has authorized remote or in-person appearances. The judge has also set deadlines for filing opposition briefs and reply briefs, and has instructed petitioners' counsel to file a reply brief of five pages or less by September 25, 2024.

If no opposition briefs are filed, the court intends to grant the ex parte application without holding a hearing, and will issue a temporary restraining order and set an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue. The court will also serve the order on petitioners' counsel via email and post a copy on the court's website.
