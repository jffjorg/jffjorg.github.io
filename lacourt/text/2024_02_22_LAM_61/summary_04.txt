And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Brink's Incorporated, has filed a motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff, Ciro Santoyo's, individual claims. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's PAGA claims should be arbitrated pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906. The plaintiff opposes the stay of litigation, arguing that it would prejudice the prosecution of the PAGA claims.

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of establishing the existence of a preponderance of the evidence necessary to its defense. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and stays the representative PAGA claims pending resolution of the individual claims. The court relies on the decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, which holds that a stay can be entered on representative claims pending resolution of individual claims.
