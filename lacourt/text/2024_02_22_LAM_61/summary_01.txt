Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial's motion for a protective order, which sought to take his deposition remotely and limit the time and subject matter. The judge found that the Plaintiff's arguments were unpersuasive and that there was no good cause to deviate from the standard procedures for taking depositions. The judge also awarded sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500, as the Plaintiff did not have substantial justification for their motion.
