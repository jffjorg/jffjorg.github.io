And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between plaintiff Sherif Loza and defendant Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company. The dispute centers around the insurer's handling of Loza's claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits after a car accident in 2016. Loza settled his liability claim against the at-fault driver for $25,000 and then sought payment from Liberty Mutual for UIM benefits. The insurer made a pre-arbitration settlement offer of $20,000, which Loza rejected. The case went to arbitration, where the arbitrator awarded Loza $100,000 in damages.

The insurer argues that a genuine dispute existed as to the value of Loza's claims, citing a case called Rappaport-Scott v. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club. However, the judge finds that this argument is unpersuasive and that triable issues exist as to whether Liberty Mutual conducted a reasonable investigation and complied with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge also finds that Liberty Mutual's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment or adjudication is based solely on the "valuation discrepancy" and does not address the theory asserted in the complaint that the insurer failed to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation or respond to Loza's settlement overtures. The judge denies the insurer's motion for summary judgment or adjudication.
