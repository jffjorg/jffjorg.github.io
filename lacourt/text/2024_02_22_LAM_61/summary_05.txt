And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and attorney fees from the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants' arguments are unsupported, and the lease agreement attached to the complaint provides for attorney fees. The prayer for punitive damages is supported by the allegations of trespass and malicious intent, and the court finds that the defendants' actions were despicable and willful. The court cites several precedential cases to support its decision, including College Hospital v. Superior Court, Dawes v. Sup.Ct. (Mardian), Perlman v. Municipal Court, Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc., and Roberts v. Permanente Corp. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide notice.
