And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel initial responses and requests for sanctions. The defendant, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., served discovery requests on the plaintiff, Walter Moore, et al., on April 25, 2024. The responses were due on May 27, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to provide them despite repeated extensions granted by the defendant. The defendant finally filed a motion to compel initial responses and requests for sanctions on July 24, 2024. The plaintiff provided responses after the motion was filed, but the court finds that sanctions are still appropriate to compensate the defendant for attorney fees incurred in obtaining the responses. The court reduces the amount of sanctions to $2,000 and orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay this amount to the defendant within 20 days.
