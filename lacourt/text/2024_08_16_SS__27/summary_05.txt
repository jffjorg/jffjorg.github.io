**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV00134
* Hearing Date: August 16, 2024
* Department: 27
* Judge: Hon. Lee S. Arian, Department 27

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Elaine Saunders
* Defendant: James Hissong et al., City of Los Angeles

**Notice**: Sufficient

**Ruling**: Demurrer is granted with leave to amend

**Background**

* Accident occurred at the intersection of Western Avenue and Franklin Avenue
* Plaintiff's vehicle was allegedly inside the intersection with full control when Defendant Hissong failed to yield and collided with Plaintiff's car
* Plaintiff sued the City of Los Angeles for failing to properly maintain the traffic signal

**Legal Standard**

* A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action
* Courts read allegations liberally and in context
* Defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice

**Dangerous Condition of Public Property**

* Gov. Code ยง 835: Public entity liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, etc.
* Gov. Code ยง 830.4: Condition is not considered dangerous if it is merely the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs, yield right-of-way signs, or speed restriction signs

**Discussion**

* Plaintiff argues that the inoperative traffic light was a dangerous condition of public property
* Defendant argues that the failure to provide traffic lights or non-operational traffic lights cannot form the basis of a dangerous condition of public property claim
* Court disagrees and grants demurrer with leave to amend, ordering Plaintiff to state with particularity the exact features or conditions of the intersection that render it dangerous

**Significant Statements**

* "When the [traffic] lights were turned off, their defective condition could no longer mislead or misdirect the injured party." (Goodman v. Raposa, supra, at p. 835, 312 P.2d 65)
* "Once the signals failed, the City could reasonably foresee that motorists using due care would obey the provisions of the Vehicle Code and make a full stop before proceeding when it was safe to do so." (Veh.Code, ยง 21800)
* "If the incident occurred during the middle of the night, with minimal visibility due to non-functioning street lights, there could be a visibility problem, and therefore a substantial risk of harm, even when the road or intersection is used with due care."
