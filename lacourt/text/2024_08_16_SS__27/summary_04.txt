And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Arthur Petrousian, the Plaintiff's Counsel, without prejudice. The motion was filed due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the Court was uncertain whether the client received notice of the motion because no return receipt was attached to the filings. The Court will not grant the motion due to insufficient notice. The parties must submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing to argue.
