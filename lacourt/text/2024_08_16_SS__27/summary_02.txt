And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff's counsel had failed to identify the correct defendant(s) in the case, leading to the dismissal on June 17, 2024. However, the counsel has since identified the correct entity defendants, 922 N. Summit, LLC, and Terra Bella Property Management, Inc. The judge found that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's excusable neglect and that the requirements for mandatory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b) have been met. The judge has vacated the dismissal and allowed the plaintiff to continue with the case.
