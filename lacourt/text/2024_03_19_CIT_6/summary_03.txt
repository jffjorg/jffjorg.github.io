And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking a total of $43,966.42, including damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. The judge notes that the plaintiff has resubmitted the same default judgment package without addressing the issues mentioned in the previous order denying the request. The plaintiff has also failed to provide evidence of exemption from California's usury restrictions and has not specified the correct rate of prejudgment interest under Delaware law. Additionally, the plaintiff has not cited a provision in the underlying contract authorizing attorney's fees and has requested an excessive amount. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not provided a declaration in lieu of the original agreement, as required.
