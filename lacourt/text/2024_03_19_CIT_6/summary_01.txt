And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice Defendant John Dieterich's motion for terminating sanctions and request for monetary sanctions in the sum of $2,452.50 against Plaintiff Mohamad Tavana and his attorney, Victor Otten, Esq. and Otten Law Group, APC. The Judge found that the motion was premature, as the deadline for serving verified objection-free discovery responses had not yet passed, and that the defendant had not complied with the Court's order to provide notice of the Court's ruling. The Judge also did not find that there had been a willful failure to serve the discovery responses, as the plaintiff's counsel had made attempts to provide the responses and had been delayed due to medical issues. As a result, the Judge denied the motion and ordered the defendant to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days.
