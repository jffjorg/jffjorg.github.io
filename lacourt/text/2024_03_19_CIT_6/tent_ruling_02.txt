   [1] Defendant’s notice indicates that it seeks an order  striking Plaintiff’s complaint, (Notice, pg. 2 of pdf, line 4), but the  memorandum of points and authorities refers to an answer and cross-complaint,  (Memorandum of Points and Authorities, pg. 6 of pdf, lines 9 and 21-22). Since  the only operative pleading in this action is Plaintiff’s complaint, the Court  assumes Defendant meant the complaint in the memorandum of points and  authorities. The Court also notes that Defendant’s motion violates Rule 2.109  of the California Rules of Court, which provides that papers filed with the  Court must be consecutively numbered. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.109.)  Plaintiff’s papers do not contain any page numbering. The Court admonishes  Plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court  going forward.    [2] Defendant  did not notify the Court of the error in the 1/18/24 Minute Order.
