 Case Number:  23PSCV02621    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc. dba TAB Bank’s Request for Entry of Default  Judgment  Defendant:  Diwan Transport,  Inc., Baljit S Khinda, Narinder Singh, and Sukhraj Singh  COURT RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of contract action. On August 25, 2023, plaintiff Transportation  Alliance Bank, Inc. dba TAB Bank (Plaintiff) filed this action against  defendants Diwan Transport, Inc., Baljit S Khinda, Narinder Singh, Sukhraj  Singh (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of  action for breach of contract, claim and delivery, conversion, and money lent.  On November 22, 2023, default was entered against Defendants. On February 15,  2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks  default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $148,622.80,  including $124,208.59 in damages, $6,708.85 in unpaid interest, $17,705.36 in  late charges and other fees, $3,376.22 in attorney fees, and $1,132.06 in costs.[1] The  Court finds there to be a few problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment. First, Plaintiff did not complete item 2 on Form CIV-100. (See  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) Second, it is not entirely clear  how Plaintiff calculated the amount requested for default judgment. Plaintiff  states that there is an unpaid principal balance of $124,208.59, but it is  unclear how this amount was determined based on missed monthly payments of  $5,923.47 beginning in March 2023. (See Bishop Decl., ¶¶ 8-15.) Plaintiff also  provides little explanation as to how the interest charge was calculated, (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3)), and how the late charges and other  fees were calculated, and what the other fees are, (see Bishop Decl., ¶ 15).  Third, federal  law and/or the laws of the State of Utah appear to govern these agreements. (See  Bishop Decl., Ex. 1, p. 5; Ex. 2, p. 2; Ex. 3, p. 5; Ex. 4, p. 2; Ex. 5, p. 2;  Ex. 6, p. 2.) It is therefore unclear if the interest rates provided under these  agreements comply with Federal or Utah usury law or are otherwise forbidden  under California law. (See Mencor Enterprises, Inc., v. Hets Equities Corp. (1987)  190 Cal.App.3d 432, 439-440 [“Under  California law, the parties lack power to incorporate [other state’s] interest  rate absent a determination that [other state], the state of the chosen law,  has a relationship to the parties or the contract.”])  Fourth, Plaintiff did not provide any  explanation for how it calculated its request for attorney fees. (See Form  Civ-100, ¶ 7; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(9).)  Finally, Plaintiff needs to either  provide the original agreements or a declaration explaining why it submitted  copies instead of the originals. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc.  (2003) 109 CA4th 1118, 1122.)    CONCLUSION             Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
