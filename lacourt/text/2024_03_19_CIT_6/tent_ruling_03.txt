 Case Number:  23PSCV01487    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
US Foods, Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment
 
Defendants: Don Fuegos Chicken LLC and Johnny Cornejo 
COURT RULING
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED
without prejudice. 
BACKGROUND
This is a collection action. On May 16,
2023, Plaintiff US Foods, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants
Don Fuegos Chicken LLC, Johnny Cornejo (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1
through 10, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, open book
account, account stated, reasonable value, and breach of personal guarantee [sic].
On October 18, 2023, the Court denied without prejudice Plaintiff’s request for
entry of default judgment against Defendants. On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed Defendant Johnny Cornejo. 
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff
resubmitted the default judgment package.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by
the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff again seeks default judgment
against Defendants in the total amount of $43,966.42, including $35,176.64 in
damages, $6,765.48 in interest, $1,455.30 in attorney fees, and $569.00 in
costs. The Court notes Plaintiff has essentially resubmitted the same default
judgment package as before without addressing any of the issues mentioned in
the Court’s October 18, 2023 order denying the request for entry of default
judgment. (Order Re: Tentative Ruling (10/18/23).) Plaintiff again requests
prejudgment interest at the rate of 18%, which is generally not permitted under
California law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 3289, subd. (b); Cal. Const. Art XV, §
1.) Plaintiff still presents no evidence to show that Plaintiff is exempt from California’s
usury restrictions, nor does Plaintiff present any information as to what the
correct rate of prejudgment interest is under Delaware law, i.e., the law that
governs the underlying contract. (Compl., Ex. A, p. 4, ¶ 5; see Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2020) 50
Cal.App.5th 1009, 1014 [New York choice of law clause governed determination of
prejudgment interest].) 
Moreover, Plaintiff again cites no
provision of the underlying contract that purportedly authorizes Plaintiff to
recover attorney’s fees here. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) The
only language regarding attorney’s fees the Court could find was in connection
with the personal guaranty, but since Defendant Johnny Cornejo has been
dismissed, that provision is no longer applicable. (Compl., Ex. A, p. 8.)[1] Accordingly, Plaintiff is
not entitled to attorney’s fees. Even if Plaintiff was entitled to attorney’s
fees, Plaintiff again requests the same amount of attorney’s fees as before,
which still exceeds the $1,200.00 amount permitted under Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (b). (Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (b).) 
Furthermore, since this involves an
obligation to repay money, Plaintiff needs to provide either the original
agreement or a copy with a declaration in lieu of the original. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc.
(2003) 109 CA4th 1118, 1122.) Plaintiff still did not provide a declaration in
lieu of the original explaining why Plaintiff is unable to provide the original
to the Court. 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
