Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in an ongoing court case. The plaintiff, SK Rosgosstrakh Pao (RGS), a Russian insurance company, alleges that the defendant, Danil Khachaturov, its former president, embezzled RGS's funds through a fraudulent reinsurance scheme. RGS seeks to obtain documents from Swiss authorities related to Stalis, SA and Hansa Reinsurance Brokers AG, two apparently dissolved entities. The judge grants RGS's motion to approve letters of request to Swiss authorities, but expresses concerns about RGS's ability to pay the fees associated with the request. The judge also grants RGS's motion to compel further responses from Khachaturov, but denies certain requests as being overbroad or overburdensome. Additionally, the judge grants RGS's motion to seal certain exhibits from the declaration of Cheltsova, finding that the documents contain confidential information that should be protected.
