Motion
filed: 5/22/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Juan Mendoza and Elizabeth
Iniguez Marquez (collectively “Plaintiffs”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant FCA USA LLC (“FCA”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling FCA to produce supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ first set
of Requests for Production, Nos. 45-46, and imposing monetary sanctions against
FCA in the amount of $2,620.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED AS MOOT. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“SBA”) lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2020 Jeep Gladiator with VIN: 1C6JJTEG1LL208648
(the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant FCA. Plaintiffs allege
that they purchased the Subject Vehicle on March 12, 2022, entering into a
warranty contract with FCA. (Compl. ¶ 15.)
 
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against
Defendants FCA, San Fernando Motor Company (“SFMC”), and Does 1 through 10,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of SBA – breach of
express warranty (against FCA), and (2) negligent repair (against SFMC).
Subsequently, FCA and SFMC filed their respective Answers to the Complaint on June
21, 2023.
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses from FCA to their Requests for Production (“RFP”),
Nos. 45-46, Set One (the “Motion”).
 
On July 5, 2024, FCA filed its Opposition. Subsequently,
Plaintiffs replied on July 10, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that …
[a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] … [a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[;
or] … [a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further responses to
requests for production must be brought within 45 days of service of the
verified response, supplemental verified response, or on a date to which the
propounding and responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise, the
propounding party waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the
45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service
of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are required
to be verified].)
 
“[T]he time within which to make a
motion to compel production of documents is mandatory and jurisdictional just
as it is for motions to compel further answers to interrogatories.” (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The 45-day deadline
“is ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the court without authority
to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Ibid.)
            
Here, FCA served unverified responses
to Plaintiffs' first set of RFP on January 8, 2024, with FCA’s electronic verifications
following on January 9, 2024. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 4.) The service of verification
establishes the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further as February
27, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day period with an extension of two court
days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3), accounting
for the method of electronic service.
 
Therefore, the Court finds the Motion is filed timely as it
was filed prior to the established deadline.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion [to compel further responses to requests for
production] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, and 9, Ex. “C.”) 
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(3) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (3) To compel further responses to a demand for inspection of
documents or tangible things[.]”
 
Here, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to RFP Nos. 45-46
 
1.     
Moving Party’s
Showing of Good Cause (RFP Nos. 45-46.)
 
A motion to compel further responses to requests for
production shall “set forth specific facts showing good cause”. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) To establish “good cause,” the moving party
must show (1) the items demanded are relevant to the subject matter and (2)
specific facts justify the discovery of the requested items (e.g., why such
information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at
trial). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); see Glenfed Develop.
Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) If “good cause”
is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the responding party to
justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Superior
Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
RFP
No. 45 seeks, “All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of the 2020 Jeep
Gladiator vehicle regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was
presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the
warranty period.”
 
RFP
No. 46 requests, “All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2020 Jeep
Gladiator vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized
repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty.”
 
Here, Plaintiffs argue that
RFP Nos. 45-46 seek information relevant to determining whether a defect or
nonconformity exists in these types of vehicles and when this defect or
nonconformity first appeared. Additionally, Plaintiffs assert that records of
complaints regarding other similar vehicles may refute FCA’s affirmative
defense claiming that defects were caused by Plaintiffs engaging in
unauthorized or unreasonable uses. (Mot. at p. 5.)
 
Moreover, Plaintiffs note
that the information sought in RFP Nos. 45-46 regarding other similar vehicle
complaints and warranty repairs is relevant in determining FCA’s knowledge
about nonconformities and whether FCA willfully violated the statutory
requirements. (Mot. at pp. 5-6.)
 
In Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
138, 154 (Donlen), the Third District held that the trial court had not
erred in denying Ford’s motion in limine to exclude evidence of other
customers’ complaints about the same transmission model Ford installed in
plaintiff’s truck and other vehicles. (Underlines added.) Similarly, in Jensen
v. BMW of North America, LLC (S.D.Cal. 2019) 328 F.R.D. 557, 562-63 (Jensen),
the federal district court in San Diego found that “information regarding
whether the same defects were reported to BMW in other cars of the same
make, model, and year as [p]laintiff’s subject vehicle could conceivably be
relevant to whether BMW acted reasonably in denying [p]laintiff’s warranty
claim. A fact finder may find BMW’s knowledge or lack of knowledge about the
same defects to be a consideration in deciding whether BMW acted in good faith
as to [p]laintiff’s specific case.” (Underlines added.)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges that the Subject Vehicle
contained a defect, which FCA was unable to repair after a reasonable number of
repair attempts. (Compl. ¶¶ 16-19.) Additionally, the Complaint alleges that
Plaintiffs are entitled to a civil penalty under the statute for FCA’s willful
failure to comply with its responsibilities. (Id. ¶ 26.)
 
Thus, the Court finds that the information sought in RFP
Nos. 45-46 is relevant to the claims in the Complaint. The Court especially
notes that the RFP Nos. 45 is limited to “any of the complaints that the
SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented,” which is narrowly tailored to relevant issues.
 
Therefore, in alignment with established precedents,
including those set in Donlen and Jensen, the Court concludes
that good cause exists, and the information sought by RFP Nos. 45-46, is
relevant and not overbroad.
             
2.     
FCA’s
Objections
 
Here, FCA asserted uniform
objections in its initial responses, including vagueness, overbreadth, and irrelevance.
(FCA’s Separate Statement, at pp. 2-3.) 
 
The Court finds the vagueness,
overbreadth, and irrelevance objections do not overcome the Court’s finding of
relevance in the above analysis of good cause. 
 
FCA further contends that the Motion is moot as it has
served the supplemental responses to RFP Nos. 45-46 on July 3, 2024. (Grimsrud Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “1”), which states,
“FCA US has conducted a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry and will comply in full with this request and produce
all responsive documents within its possession, custody, and control,
namely, subject to protective order, all responsive documents found relating to
customer concerns/complaints and warranty claim data based upon the alleged conditions
outlined in Plaintiffs’ repair history, in other 2020 Jeep Gladiator Mojave 4x4
vehicles.” (FCA’s Separate Statement, at pp. 2-3.) (Underlines added.)
 
Plaintiffs acknowledge that
FCA served them with Verification for its supplemental responses on July 10,
2024. (Grimsrud Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs do not dispute that the supplemental
responses to RFP Nos. 45 and 46 are now code-compliant.
 
The Court finds FCA’s
supplemental responses expressly state its agreement to comply, making them
sufficient and compliant with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210,
subdivision (a).
 
Consequently, the Motion is
DENIED AS MOOT.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) (Underlines
added.)
 
Here, considering the supplemental responses were made
after the Motion was filed, and finding no other circumstances making the
imposition of the sanctions under California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a)
unjust, the Court finds that monetary sanctions against FCA and its attorney of
record are justified. 
 
The Court determines the total and reasonable amount
of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the instant Motion is $860.00,
calculated at $400.00 per hour for two hours, in addition to a $60.00 filing
fee.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, Nos. 45-46, Set
One, is DENIED AS MOOT.
 
Plaintiffs’
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
FCA
USA, LLC and its attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay
$860.00 to Plaintiffs’ counsel.
