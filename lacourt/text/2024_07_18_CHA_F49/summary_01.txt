Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

* The motion to compel further responses to requests for production (RFP) Nos. 45-46 is denied as moot because FCA has already served supplemental responses to the RFP.
* The request for monetary sanctions against FCA is granted in part. The court orders FCA and its attorney of record to pay $860.00 to plaintiffs' counsel.
* The court finds that the information sought in RFP Nos. 45-46 is relevant to the claims in the complaint and that good cause exists to compel FCA to produce the information.
* The court also finds that FCA's objections to the RFP are without merit and that the supplemental responses served by FCA are sufficient and compliant with the California Code of Civil Procedure.
* The court notes that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act requires FCA to provide information about complaints and warranty repairs to similar vehicles, and that the information sought in RFP Nos. 45-46 is relevant to determining whether FCA willfully violated the statutory requirements.
