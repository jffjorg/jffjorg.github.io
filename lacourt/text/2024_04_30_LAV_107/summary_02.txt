And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant performed dental procedures on her without her informed consent and that she suffered injuries as a result. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, which states that a plaintiff has one year to file a lawsuit after discovering their injury.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the statute of limitations. The plaintiff argued that she did not discover the factual cause of her injuries until much later than the date she learned of the dental tool fragment being left buried in her tooth, but the judge found that this was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations under the discovery rule.
