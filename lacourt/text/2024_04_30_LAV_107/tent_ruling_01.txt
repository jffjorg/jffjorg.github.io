COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING: Demurrer



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
 
Defendant
Allen
Eggers demurs to the complaint brought by Plaintiff James Hansen. This court
sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
 
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff James
Hansen (“Plaintiff”) and Defendant Allen Eggers (“Defendant”) were co-owners of
a corporation, WJA Management, Inc. (“WJAM”), for which Defendant acted as the
chief financial officer (“CFO”). (Complaint pp. 1–2.) WJAM “was operated for
the purpose of managing income and benefits from operations of Western Jet
Aviation,” a company that provided aircraft services. (Id. at p. 2.) In
December 2021, Defendant dissolved WJAM without Plaintiff’s knowledge and
retained “exclusive control over the assets and property of WJAM, and over the
records and business affairs of WJAM.” (Id. at p. 3.)
 
On September 30,
2022, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging causes of action for (1) Corporations Code §§ 2004, 2005, and
2006; (2) accounting; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) conversion; (5) unjust
enrichment; and (6) constructive fraud.
 
On March 12, 2024,
Defendant and WJAM filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Western Jet
Aviation, and Patricia Hansen.
 
On March 18, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the Complaint. On
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and on April 19, 2024, Defendant
replied to Plaintiff’s opposition.
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 

The Meet and Confer Requirement¿ 

¿ 
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41(a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the
filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer.
 
Defendant’s counsel submits with the
Demurrer a declaration that prior to bringing the Demurrer, he met and
conferred with counsel for Plaintiff. (Rees Decl. ¶ 2.) We are therefore
satisfied that this requirement has been met.
¿ 

Timeliness of Filings¿ 

¿ 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.40, subdivision (a), a
demurrer to a complaint should be filed within 30 days after service of the
complaint. 
¿¿ 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving
papers should be filed at least 16 court days before they are set for hearing,
oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine court days before the set
hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five court
days before the set hearing. Judges have discretion as to whether to consider
or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister v. County of
Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10
Cal.App.3d 193, 196 (disapproved on other grounds by Neel v. Magana, Olney,
Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176).) 
 
Service of the
Complaint was effected by certified mail on July 24, 2023. (Notice of
Withdrawal of Motion to Quash p. 2.) Thus, any demurrer should have been filed
by 30 days of July 24, 2023, or by August 23, 2023. Sixteen court days before
April 30, 2024 was April 8, 2024; nine court days before April 30, 2024 was
April 17, 2024; and five court days before April 30, 2024 was April 23, 2024.
 
Thus, the Demurrer
is untimely as against service of the Complaint, and the Demurrer, the
opposition thereto, and the reply to the opposition were all timely as against
the hearing. Because neither party raises the issue of timeliness, however, and
both parties were able to fully brief their positions on the Demurrer, this
court declines to strike the untimely Demurrer.
 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A complaint is sufficient if it contains
“[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard,
a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550.) 
 
“Shareholders may bring two types of actions, a direct action filed
by the shareholder individually (or on behalf of a class of shareholders
to which he or she belongs) for injury to his or her interest as a shareholder, or a derivative action filed on behalf of the corporation for injury to the corporation for which it has failed or refused to sue.” (Schuster v. Gardner
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 305, 311–12, emphasis omitted.) “[A] derivative suit is
one in which the shareholder seeks redress of the wrong to the corporation.” (Bader
v. Anderson (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.) “Thus, an action is
derivative, i.e., in the corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is
injury to the corporation, or to the whole body of its stock and property
without any severance or distribution among individual holders, or it seeks to
recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.”
(Ibid., quoting Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson & Co. (1969) 1 Cal.3d
93, 106.) “A single cause of action by a shareholder can give rise to
derivative claims, individual claims, or both.” (Goles v. Sawhney (2016)
5 Cal.App.5th 1014, 1018, fn. 3.)
 
Generally, a shareholder wishing to bring a derivative
claim must first make a pre-suit demand on the corporation’s board of directors
that the corporation act on its own behalf. (Bader v. Anderson, supra,
179 Cal.App.4th 775 at 789.) “In deference to the managerial role of directors
and in order to curb potential abuse,  the shareholder asserting
a derivative claim must make a threshold showing that he or she made
[such] a presuit demand on the board to take the desired action.”
(Apple Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 222, 232.) This
demand requirement is codified in California Corporations Code section 800,
subdivision (b)(2) (“Section 800”). (See Corp. Code, § 800, subd.
(b)(2).) “Under [Section 800], a plaintiff must plead with
particularity the attempts that were made to secure
board action before bringing suit, or, alternatively, the factual
basis upon which the plaintiff believes that a demand on the board
was unnecessary, i.e., that a demand would have been futile.” (Apple
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, at 232.)
 
“[T]he particular stockholder who brings the suit is
merely a nominal party plaintiff. It is the corporation that is the ultimate
beneficiary of such a derivative suit. Thus,
the corporation is the real party plaintiff in the action.” (Patrick
v. Alacer Corp. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1003.) Though
the corporation is essentially the plaintiff in
a derivative action, “[w]hen a derivative suit is brought to litigate
the rights of the corporation, the corporation is an indispensable party and
must be joined as a nominal defendant.” (Grosset v. Wenaas (2008) 42
Cal.4th 1100, 1108.) “The corporation must be joined because its
rights, not those of the nominal plaintiff, are to be litigated, and to offer
the real defendants res judicata protection from later suits.” (Patrick v.
Alacer Corp., supra, at 1004, internal citations omitted.) “Naming
the corporation a defendant, not a plaintiff, follows from the joinder rules: ‘If
the consent of any one who should have been joined as plaintiff cannot be
obtained, he may be made a defendant.’” (Ibid., quoting Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 382.)
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 

Derivative
     Claims

 
Plaintiff brings
all causes of action on behalf of himself as an individual and derivatively on behalf
of WJAM. (Complaint p. 1.)
 
Defendant demurs
to each cause of action in the Complaint under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) on the grounds that they each fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him and under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (d) on the
grounds that they each fail to name WJAM, which Defendant contends is an
indispensable party. (Notice of Demurrer pp. 3–6.) Defendant contends that all
of Plaintiff’s claims are derivative claims of WJAM; that Plaintiff “lacks
standing to pursue derivative claims” because the Complaint “fails to allege
the essential facts required of a derivative suit pursuant to Corporations Code
§ 800[, subdivision] (b)”; and that, as “the corporation on whose behalf a
derivative suit is brought,” WJAM “is an indispensable party to the lawsuit.”
(Demurrer pp. 6–7.) Defendant does not demur to any of the causes of
action to the extent they are brought directly by Plaintiff on his own behalf.
 
The Complaint does
not comply with Section 800 because it pleads with particularity neither
Plaintiff’s attempts to make a pre-suit demand on WJAM’s board nor “the factual
basis upon which the plaintiff believes that a demand on the board
was unnecessary.” (Apple Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 18
Cal.App.5th 222 at 232.) Although Plaintiff argues that “demand is not a
prerequisite to a derivative action under the circumstances of this case,” even
if he is correct that demand would have been excused as futile, Section 800
nonetheless requires that he plead “with particularity plaintiff's efforts to
secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not
making such effort.” If demand would have been futile, he must plead as much in
the Complaint. (Corp. Code, § 800, subd. (b)(2); Opposition p. 6.)
 
Additionally, to
the extent that Plaintiff brings each cause of action derivatively on behalf of
WJAM, then WJAM “is an indispensable party and must be joined as a nominal
defendant.” By failing to join WJAM as a defendant, Plaintiff has thus failed
to join a necessary party.
 

Leave to
     Amend

 
“Where the defect raised by
a¿motion¿to¿strike¿or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure,
leave¿to¿amend¿is routinely and¿liberally¿granted to give the plaintiff a
chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) “[An order granting a motion
to strike] is analogous to an order sustaining a demurrer.” (Vaccaro v.
Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.) “If the plaintiff has not had an
opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the demurrer, leave to amend
is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless the complaint shows on its
face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of Stockton v. Superior Court
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.) Courts generally allow at least one time to amend
a complaint, after sustaining a demurrer, even without any request for leave to
amend. (McDonald v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal. App. 3d 297, 303.) 
 
We note that this is the first
time a demurrer has been sustained in this case and that Plaintiff has not yet
amended the Complaint for any reason. We believe the defects raised by the
Demurrer are reasonably capable of cure.
 
Accordingly, this
court SUSTAINS the Demurrer with leave to amend.
