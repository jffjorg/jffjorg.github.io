And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to a demurrer filed by the defendant, Allen Eggers, to a complaint brought by James Hansen, the plaintiff. The defendant demurred to each cause of action in the complaint, arguing that they fail to state a claim and that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring derivative claims. The plaintiff argues that demand was excused as futile and that the complaint complies with Corporations Code §800. The court finds that the complaint fails to comply with Corporations Code §800 and that the defendant's demurrer is sustained. However, the court grants leave to amend to allow the plaintiff to cure the defects in the complaint. The court notes that the defects raised by the demurrer are reasonably capable of cure and that the plaintiff has not yet had an opportunity to amend the complaint.
