And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and default against him. The defendant argues that he was not properly served with the summons and did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit. The court finds that the service was invalid because it occurred at a residence where the defendant no longer resided, and therefore, he did not have an opportunity to defend himself. The court also finds that the defendant was under medical care at the time of the lawsuit and did not have the opportunity to timely respond to the lawsuit. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and orders the defendant to file and serve his answer within 10 days.
