```

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the restrictive covenant requiring all garages to be "detached" is clear and unambiguous and that the defendants did not violate it. The court interprets the covenant as primarily modifying the "single family dwelling" to prevent the construction of duplexes or multi-family dwellings, and not as requiring the garage to be detached. The court also finds that the defendants' construction of an attached garage does not violate the covenant. The ruling is based on the language of the covenant, the extrinsic evidence presented, and the court's interpretation of the covenant.
