BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff American Express
National Bank alleges Defendant Grigor Balyan became indebted to Plaintiff on
an American Express credit card in the amount of $5,334.77. On July 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant asserting a claim for common
counts.
 
Request for entry of
default was entered February 22, 2024. Default Judgment was entered February
26, 2024. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant
Balyan’s Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Balyan moves to set aside the default judgment and default against Balyan on
the grounds Defendant was not properly served and therefore, lacked actual
notice of the lawsuit and there was excusable neglect. 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5 permits the court to vacate a default when service of a
summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the
action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him. (CCP §
473.5(a).) The phrase actual notice means genuine knowledge and does not
include constructive or imputed notice to the client. (Tunis v. Barrow
(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1077.) 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b) allows a court to vacate a prior order upon a showing
that the order was entered due to a party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Additionally, the motion “shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” 
 
“
‘[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential
to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.] Thus, a default judgment
entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner
prescribed by statute is void. [Citation.]’ “ (Dill v. Berquist Construction
Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “Under section 473, subdivision (d),
the court may set aside a default judgment which is valid on its face, but
void, as a matter of law, due to improper service.” (Ellard v. Conway (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.) 
 
Defendant
Balyan first argues the court should set aside the default and default judgment
on the grounds service occurred at a residence at which Defendant no longer
resided. As a result, he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and did
not have an opportunity to defend himself. Moreover, at the time, he was under
medical care due to injuries sustained during a robbery and therefore, failed
to timely respond to the lawsuit. 
 
The court
finds grounds to set aside the default and default judgment. Substituted
service occurred at a residence where Defendant no longer resides. Therefore,
service did not occur at his dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place
of business or usual mailing address and is void on its face. (See CCP §§415.20,
473(d).) 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant Balyan’s Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment is GRANTED.
Defendant is ordered to file and serve his Answer within 10 days.
