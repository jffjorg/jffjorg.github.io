Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case involving a plaintiff who alleges that defendants represented they had a business license and failed to transport their goods to the United States. The plaintiff moved to compel responses to requests for production (RFPs) and requested monetary sanctions. The judge denied the motion, citing several reasons, including that the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of proper service of the deposition subpoena, the subpoena was fatally defective, and the plaintiff's definition of John Doe 1-5 was vague and ambiguous. The judge also noted that the plaintiff, who is a pro per litigant, is not entitled to discovery sanctions.
