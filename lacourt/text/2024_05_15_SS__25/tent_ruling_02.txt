 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
and his wife are the owners of 12799 Norris Avenue, Sylmar, CA.  Plaintiff and Defendant Nowzar Mohebbi
entered into an agreement for purchase of real estate.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Mohebbi breached
the agreement by failing to close the transaction by the date certain and
refusing to stipulate to the release of the Earnest Money and by failing to
provide any factual/legal basis for deviating from the terms and conditions of
the Purchase Agreement. 
 
            The
operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint filed on July 28, 2023.  The FAC alleges (1) breach of contract; (2)
intentional misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) declaratory
relief; and (5) accounting.  The only
remaining cause of action is the breach of contract action.  The Court sustained demurrer without leave to
amend as to all other causes of action on October 26, 2023.
 
            On
November 13, 2023, Defendant Mohebbi filed an answer to the FAC and a
cross-complaint.  Mohebbi’s
cross-complaint alleges (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional
misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; and (4) declaratory
relief.  
 
            On
April 15, 2024, Defendant Mohebbi filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories (Set One) from Plaintiff Gregory Todd.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  On May 3, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of
non-opposition.
