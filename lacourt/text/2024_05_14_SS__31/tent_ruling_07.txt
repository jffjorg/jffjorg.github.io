BACKGROUND Plaintiff Santos Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Housing Authority of The City of Los Angeles (“HACLA”) and Does 1 to 50 for damages arising from a workplace injury. Plaintiff alleges he was employed to perform soldering work on an elevator in Building 2 of the Jordan Downs Housing Project. While the elevator was positioned on the 6th floor, Plaintiff fell six stories in free fall when the elevator suddenly fell and crashed to the 1st floor. Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) sets forth seven causes of action against HACLA and Does 1 to 50 for: (1) negligence – liability for employee, (2) negligence – liability for independent contractor, (3) premises liability, (4) liability for non-delegable duty, (5) liability for dangerous condition on the property, (6) negligence as a common carrier under CA Civil Code §2100, and (5) strict liability under CA Civil Code §2101.  On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint naming Walton Construction, Inc. (“Walton”) as Doe 1. Walton now demurs to the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action of the FAC, arguing these causes of action fail to state sufficient facts because Walton is not a public entity and not a common carrier.  Plaintiff opposes the motion, and Walton filed a reply.   II. DEMURRER Meet and Confer Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The Court finds Walton has fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Mot. Blackstone Decl. ¶¶ 3-7.)  Legal Standard A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”].) A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)  1st Cause of Action – Liability for Employee Walton contends that the first cause of action alleges that all defendants are liable under California Government Code § 815.2, and that it is therefore not viable cause of action against it because Walton is not a public entity.  Contrary to Walton’s assertion that Walton is alleged to be liable under Gov. Code §815.2 [Liability of Public Entities], Walton’s alleged liability as Doe 1 is not tied, in any manner, to this provision.  The FAC alleges in relevant part that Does 1-50 negligently controlled and maintained the elevator by restricting Plaintiff’s access and instructing Plaintiff to utilize the elevator to access the location of the metal beam that needed to be soldered. (FAC at ¶ 14.) As a result of Does 1-50’s control over the temporary platform and failure to stop work upon notice of a dangerous condition, Does 1-50 caused Plaintiff permanent physical and emotional injury. (Id. at ¶¶ 15-18.) In short, the FAC alleges duty, breach, causation, and damages against Does 1 to 50. Paragraph 19 of the first cause of action citing to Gov. Code §815.2 refers specifically to HACLA only.  Accordingly, the demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled.   2nd Cause of Action – Liability For Independent Contractor Walton argues the second cause of action asserts Walton is liable under Gov. Code § 815.4 for injury caused by a tortious act or omission of an independent contractor of a public entity. Here, the SAC alleges that Does 1-50 and/or Does 1-50’s independent contractors negligently conducted itself with respect to control over the elevator, and realleges the factual allegations of access restriction, instructions to Plaintiff, the temporary elevator platform, and the failure to stop work upon notice of a dangerous condition resulting in Plaintiff’s physical and emotional injuries. (FAC at ¶¶ 22-27.) Similar to the first cause of action, the reference to Gov. Code § 815.4 is specific to HACLA only. (Id. at ¶ 28.) Accordingly, Walton’s demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled.   4th Cause of Action – Liability for Non-Delegable Duty Walton argues that the FAC alleges it is liable under Gov. Code § 815.6 for failure to discharge a mandatory duty when it is not a public entity. Walton further contends that it is not a common carrier, but instead a licensed general contractor not engaged in transportation as a regular undertaking or engaged in transportation services. Walton contends this is not a cause of action, and that Plaintiff already asserted a claim against it for negligence in the third cause of action for premises liability. Again, a review of the specific allegations contained FAC provides that the allegation of the Gov. Code is related to HACLA only. (FAC ¶ 47.) The FAC alleges that all defendants hired Steel Craft Fabrication Inc. to perform soldering work, defendants retained control of the work, defendants are common carriers, and that Plaintiff suffered severe physical injuries as a result of defendants’ acts or omissions related elevator access and the temporary elevator platform. (Id. at ¶ 44-46, 48-49). The Court’s review on demurrer is limited to the face of the pleading and all matters judicially noticeable. The function of a demurrer is to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint, but not the truthfulness of the allegations.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) The Court will not consider Walton’s extrinsic facts that it is actually not a common carrier. (Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1144. [“‘[D]efendants cannot set forth allegations of fact in their demurrers which, if true, would defeat plaintiff's complaint.’”].)  In terms of the contention that the fourth cause of action is duplicative of the third cause of action for premises liability, Walton does not provide this as a basis for the demurrer in its Notice. The Notice states Walton is demurring to the fourth cause of action for failure to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against it, and for uncertainty. As a general rule, the trial court may consider only the grounds stated in the notice of motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1545.) The purpose of these requirements is to cause the moving party to “sufficiently define the issues for the information and attention of the adverse party and the court.” (Hernandez v. National Dairy Products (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 490, 493.) The Court will not consider an argument not properly noticed, nor supported in the moving papers with any authority. The contention was raised as one sentence in the moving papers, and Walton notably did not provide any case law until the reply, which prevents Plaintiff from having a meaningful opportunity to respond.    Accordingly, the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is overruled.  5th Cause of Action – Liability for Dangerous Condition of Property Here, Walton’s contention that the cause of action asserting Gov. Code § 835 [Dangerous Condition of Public Property] against it finally has merit. The FAC alleges that all defendants had actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition under Gov. Code § 835 to have sufficient time prior to injury, and that Plaintiff suffered injuries as a result thereof. (FAC ¶¶ 57-58). Only HACLA is alleged to be a public entity for this Gov. Code § 835 to be applicable. (Id. at ¶ 56). There are no allegations that Walton is a public entity for this fifth cause of action to be applicable to it. Plaintiff’s opposition refers to Gov. Code §815.2 and argues that it was specifically alleged against HACLA only. However, Gov. Code §815.2 is related only to the first cause of action. The fifth cause of action alleges Gov. Code § 835, which pertains to public entity liability for a dangerous condition of its property.  Accordingly, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained.  6th Cause of Action – Negligence as a Common Carrier Under Civil Code §2100 Plaintiff re-alleges the factual allegations, and asserts that all defendants were common carriers within the meaning of Civil Code §2100. (FAC ¶¶ 59-62.) Walton argues that it is not a common carrier. There is no requirement that Plaintiff must prove that Walton is a common carrier by alleging all the factors that have bearing on determining whether a party is a common carrier. As previously provided, the purpose of a demurrer is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not to weigh on the truthfulness of the allegations. “No matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff's allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the demurrer.” (Kerivan v. Title Ins. & Trust Co. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 225, 229.) Accordingly, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action is overruled.   7th Cause of Action – Strict Liability Under Civil Code §2101 The FAC alleges that defendants utilized a “carrier persons” (elevator) in its building 2 of the Jordan Downs Housing Project, and that the elevator was not safe or fit for the purpose to which it was put, thereby causing Plaintiff injuries. (FAC ¶¶ 63-65.) Walton contends it cannot be deemed a common carrier. The Court refers to its analysis under the sixth cause of action.  Accordingly, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action is overruled.  III. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Walton’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is SUSTAINED IN PART as to the fifth cause of action for dangerous condition of property only. The demurrer as to the first, second, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action are OVERRULED.  The burden is on Plaintiff to show in what manner they can amend the complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349; Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.) Unless Plaintiff plans on alleging that Walton is actually a public entity for the fifth cause of action to be applicable to it, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action will be sustained without leave to amend.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 13th day of May 2024      Hon.
