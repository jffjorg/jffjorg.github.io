BACKGROUND  Plaintiff Lymbhya Tavera Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Target Brands, Inc. (“Defendant”) for injuries Plaintiff sustained when she slipped on a pool of liquid in Defendant’s store and fell.  On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions to strike Defendant’s Answer and enter judgment in the amount of $2 million dollars on the grounds that Defendant failed to comply with the Court’s December 22, 2023 Order. Defendant opposes the motion, and Plaintiff filed a reply.  Moving Argument Plaintiff argues that following the December 22, 2023 Order, Defendant did not serve responses within the time period ordered. On March 1, 2024, Defendant then produced Target’s policy manual through a link, and this was not attended by any response or acknowledgment to the other requests previously ordered. The issue was raised at IDC on April 9, 2024, and to date, Defendant has not served any responses in compliance with the December 22, 2023 Order.   Opposing Argument Defendant argues the delay in production is due to Defendant waiting for Plaintiff’s counsel to sign a stipulated protective order. Defendant contends this was discussed at the last IDC, and both parties understood the next steps. However, Plaintiff has not signed the protective order, which prevents Defendant from producing the documents. Defendant avers it has been cooperative in producing the documents sought and served its fourth set of supplemental responses on April 18, 2024. Defendant concedes to its tardiness, but argues that terminating sanctions are unwarranted since the documents cannot be produced absent a signed protective order.  Reply Argument Plaintiff reiterates that further responses were not served by January 22, 2024 in compliance with the December 22, 2023 Order, and that the further responses served on April 30, 2024 are incomplete and not code-compliant. Plaintiff contends there is no stipulated protective order, nor did the Court order a protective order as a condition of disclosure.    II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  Plaintiff requests the Court take judicial notice of: (1) the Court’s December 22, 2023 Order, (2) Clerk’s Certificate of Service, (3) Defendant’s Answer filed on August 12, 2020, (4) register of actions, (5) the complaint filed in Arnetta Dean v. Target Corporation, 2024CH01892 on March 11, 2024, and (6) Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. For requests 1-4 and 6, it is unnecessary for the Court to take judicial notice of matters on its own docket. Request 5 is denied; a complaint filed in another action has no bearing on this action.   III. TERMINATING SANCTIONS  Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)   A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution."  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.)  "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  While the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations."  (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.  (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)  Discussion & Conclusion On December 22, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, and ordered Defendant to provide further responses within thirty days as follows: (1) Request Nos. 19, 20, 21, 23, 32 and 36 were granted in part as to any documents not part of the “Guest Incident Investigation Kit” or directly subject to the attorney-client privilege, (2) Request No. 22 was granted only to the extent that Defendant must serve a code-compliant response, (3) Request No. 25 was granted in terms of providing supplemental responses with basic witness information of name and contact information, and (4) Request No. 37 was granted only to the extent of all security reports for all slip and fall incidents occurring anywhere in the subject Target covering 3 years prior to the incident. (Min. Order, Dec. 22, 2023.)  Indeed, as argued by Plaintiff, a protective order was not contemplated in the Court’s December 22, 2023 Order. According to the Court’s recollection, the issues were resolved at the last IDC, and there is no basis for Defendant’s continuous delay in producing documents. No condition precedent was part of the Court’s order December 22, 2023 Order, and Defendant may not unilaterally set such conditions to avoid compliance. At this juncture, and considering the history of this issue, Defendant’s actions evince a measure of bad faith. However, the Court will not impose terminating sanctions at this time. The purpose of discovery sanctions is not for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].) To impose terminating sanctions now does not serve a remedial purpose, and would be disproportionate to Defendant’s misconduct. (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223.) Pursuant to CCP § 2031.310(i), if a party fails to obey an order compelling further response, the court may impose a monetary sanction, issue sanction, evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction. Thus, the Court will first impose a monetary sanction for Defendant’s failure to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s RPDs, set one. Defendant is on notice that if it continues to delay and/or fail to comply with the Court’s December 22, 2023 Order, the Court will impose a greater sanction, which may be evidentiary/issue sanctions and/or terminating sanctions. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516 [If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.].)   III. CONCLUSION Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. However, as provided above, the Court will impose on Defendant and its counsel of record monetary sanctions, payable to Plaintiff through counsel of record within 20 days. Plaintiff’s counsel is requested to provide their rates at the hearing. This tentative will be adjusted accordingly.    Moving party is ordered to give notice.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 13th day of May 2024      Hon.
