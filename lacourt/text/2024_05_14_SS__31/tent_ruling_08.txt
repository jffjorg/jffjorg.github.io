 Case Number:  23STCV00266    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 05/14/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 23STCV00266 PABLO SANTIAGO TOMAS, et al. vs PREMKUMAR NATARAJAN, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR PABLO SANTIAGO TOMAS, Age 6 RECOMMENDATION: Deny.   TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿    Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $500,000, with $5,000 being apportioned to Pablo Santiago Tomas (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $1,000 will be used for medical expenses, $1,250 for attorneys’ fees, and $118.59 will be used for costs. The net balance of $2,631.41 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The expedited petition, filed on May 7, 2024, is denied for the following reasons:  Item 14 requires an Attachment 14a, which should include a copy of the written attorney fee agreement. This was previously noted on the January 24, 2024 denial. Petitioner, through counsel, has not cured this defect.   Further, the Court did not note this previously, but will do so now. Petitioner utilizes an expedited petition (MC-350EX) instead of a regular petition (MC-350). The expedited petition is reserved for the total settlement amount payable to the minor and all other parties to be $50,000 or less. (CRC, rule 7.950.5(a)(8).) If greater, then the total amount payable to the minor must represent payment of the individual-person policy limits of all liability insurance policies covering all proposed contributing parties and all proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable to discharge an adverse judgment on the claim from assets other than the proceeds of their liability insurance policies. (CRC, rule 7.950.5(a)(8)(A) and (B).)  Petitioner did not complete Item 3, which pertains to qualification for expedited approval. The total settlement here payable to claimant and all other persons is greater than $50,000. Therefore, if Petitioner seeks to use MC-350EX, Petitioner must provide an investigation report demonstrating that all defendants are judgment-proof outside of their insurance coverage, as described by Item 3(g)(2). If Petitioner seeks to utilize expedited form MC-350EX, then Petitioner must comply with the requirements set forth by the petition due to its limited purpose use. Otherwise, Petitioner is to file using a regular petition on MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2021], which does not have the same requirements and restrictions.     Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
