And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Lymbhya Tavera Garcia's motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Target Brands, Inc. The motion was filed on April 17, 2024, and seeks to strike Defendant's Answer and enter judgment in the amount of $2 million. The motion is opposed by Defendant, who claims the delay in production is due to waiting for Plaintiff's counsel to sign a stipulated protective order. The Judge finds that Defendant's actions evince a measure of bad faith and imposes a monetary sanction on Defendant for its failure to serve further responses to Plaintiff's RPDs, set one. The Judge denies Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions but will reconsider if Defendant fails to comply with the Court's December 22, 2023 Order.
