And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with the defendant. The plaintiff filed a notice of settlement on October 9, 2023, and the parties agreed to a conditional settlement. However, the court found that there is no written agreement signed by the parties to evaluate. The court's ruling is based on the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which requires a written agreement signed by the parties to enforce a settlement agreement. The court concludes that the plaintiff's motion is denied. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court.
