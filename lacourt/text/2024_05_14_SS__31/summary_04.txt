Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff Carrasco's unopposed motions to compel Defendant Joseph to respond to discovery requests. Defendant Joseph failed to serve timely responses to Plaintiff Carrasco's form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and therefore, any objections have been waived. The court orders Defendant Joseph to serve verified responses within 30 days. The court also awards sanctions of $200 in attorney's fees, $120 in costs, and $520 in monetary sanctions to Plaintiff Carrasco. The court orders Defendant Joseph to pay these sanctions within 30 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must email the court with the case number and hearing date.
