The defendant objected to the deposition notice, claiming it was unilaterally set. The court finds that the unilateral setting of the deposition is not a valid basis for objection.

The court will work with the parties to schedule an in-court discussion to discuss the issues prior to ruling on the motion. The court will also allow the parties to submit their arguments in writing or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
