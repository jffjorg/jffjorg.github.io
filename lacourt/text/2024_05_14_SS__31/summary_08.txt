And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the expedited petition filed by the petitioner to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor. The petition was filed on May 7, 2024, and the petitioner has failed to cure several defects, including the lack of an Attachment 14a and the failure to complete Item 3. The petitioner's use of the expedited petition form MC-350EX is also improper, as the total settlement amount payable to the minor and other parties exceeds $50,000. The judge orders the petitioner to file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
