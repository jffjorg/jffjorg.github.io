Petition to Confirm Minor’s
Compromise

 
The court considered
the petition. No opposition was received.
The court CONTINUES the petition to confirm minor’s compromise of claimant Jeremy Elijah Chavez Laynez, a minor
by and through their guardian ad litem Beatriz Laynez.
 
Background
This is a
habitability case. Plaintiffs Beatriz Laynez, an individual; Emili Gabriela
Chavez Laynez, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem; Beatriz Laynez;
Jayleen Arlette Chavez Laynez, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem,
Beatriz Laynez; and Jeremy Elijah Chavez-Laynez, a minor by and through her
guardian ad litem, Beatriz Laynez filed this action against Defendants Alvarado
Equities LLC, Robert Staback, as Trustee of The Rudolph and Grace Staback
Revocable Inter Vivos Trust, and JNM Realty Inc. alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability; (2) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (3)
Negligence; and (5) Breach of Contract.
Claimant Jeremy Elijah Chavez Laynez, a minor by and through their guardian ad litem Beatriz Laynez filed
the petition on May 6, 2024.
 
Discussion
            Claimant Jeremy Elijah Chavez Laynez, a minor
by and through their guardian ad litem Beatriz Laynez, petitions for
approval of compromise of pending action.
Court approval
is required to establish an enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim. (Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP, § 372.) Indeed, until a petition for such approval is granted by the
court, there is no final settlement, and any settlement agreement therefore is
voidable. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-05.) Petitions for approval of the compromise
of a pending action are governed by Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 7.950–7.955 and
Probate Code §§ 2504, et seq. Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.” Rule 7.950 states that the
Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form MC-350.
In addition to
approval of the settlement, attorney fees to be paid for representing the minor
or incompetent must be approved by the court. (Fam. Code, § 6602; Prob.
Code, § 3601.)  The court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(a)-(b).)
The court reviewed the petition and
settlement and finds it fair and reasonable. The petition herein was properly
filed on the Judicial Council Forms and is verified. (Petition, p. 10.) Petitioner
properly include in sections 10 and 11 of the MC-350 form the total amount
settled for all Plaintiffs, $50,000, and the amount paid to claimant, $2,500,
by Defendants Alvarado Equities LLC and JNM Realty Inc. Sections 14-17 show
that the claimant would receive a net payment of $1,613.82, after total
attorney’s fees and expenses (other than medical). The petition indicates no
medical expenses. (Id., § 12.)
The petition shows that claimant agreed to
settle their claim arising out of Defendant’s alleged improper maintenance of
the subject property, resulting in insect infestations, unsanitary conditions,
damaged, and general dilapidation/improper maintenance. (Petition, § 5.) Claimant’s
injuries include damage to personal property, personal injury, emotional
distress, pain, anxiety, discomfort, annoyance, inconvenience, diminishment in
the value of their leasehold, rent abatement, restitution of all rents paid. (Id.,
§ 6.) Claimant did not receive any care and treatment for the injuries. (Id.,
§ 7.) The claimant has recovered completely from the effects of the injuries,
with no permanent injuries. (Id., § 8(a).)
The amount of attorney’s fees requested
for claimant is $625. (Petition, § 13(a).) Hence, the amount of attorney’s fees
is approximately 25 percent of the recovery for claimant. The petitioner is
requesting costs of $261.18 for claimant. (Id., § 13(b).) Counsel has
provided a declaration and the retainer fee agreement. The Court finds the
attorney’s fees and costs reasonable. 
However, it is unclear why Defendants
Alvarado Equities LLC and JNM Realty Inc. are paying $18,250 in attorney fees
to Plaintiffs’ counsel and how that is appropriate. (Petition, § 17(f).) 
Based on the
foregoing, the court CONTINUES
the petition for counsel to explain the $18,250 in anticipated fees.
 
It is so
ordered.
