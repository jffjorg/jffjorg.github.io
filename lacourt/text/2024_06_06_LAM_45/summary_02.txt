And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Yevgeny Ostrovskiy (plaintiff) and Mikhail Siretskiy, et al. (defendants). The case involves a dispute over a failed real estate investment agreement. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached the agreement and committed fraud. The defendants have filed a demurrer, arguing that the plaintiff's claims do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has sustained the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract and fraud. The court has granted the plaintiff 30 days leave to amend. The court has also denied the motion to strike, finding that it is moot given the grant of leave to amend.
