And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of plaintiff Richard Lopez, granting his motion for summary judgment. The court finds that Lopez has demonstrated that he has been the sole rightful owner of the Property since May 2017, and that the Settlement Agreement does not entitle defendant Rafael David Miranda to any interest in the Property. The court also finds that the Trust Transfer Deed, which was recorded by Miranda, is void because it was based on an improper default judgment and was recorded knowing it was false. As a result, the court grants summary adjudication in favor of Lopez on the first, second, and third causes of action, and orders that a proposed judgment be prepared.
