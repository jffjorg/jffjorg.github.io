Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The defendant demurred to the plaintiff's entire complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that the plaintiff's claims are barred by res judicata because they were already addressed in a previous case (Cho I) and were unsuccessful. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrer, which further supports the decision to sustain the demurrer.
