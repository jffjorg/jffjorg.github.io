al. vs. John Goshorn
Trial Date: N/A
 
MOTION AND REQUEST TO STAY PROCEEDINGS
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Aqua Blue
Construction, Inc., and Britton Julien
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant John
Goshorn
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiffs are requesting that the Court stay all
proceedings pending their appeal.
 
RULING: Motion to stay is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
Plaintiffs Aqua Blue Construction, Inc., and Britton Rodne
Juliet (Plaintiffs) filed this action on May 31, 2022, after Defendant John
Goshorn (Defendant) allegedly failed to pay for change orders to a pool and spa
construction contract.
 
This Court ordered the parties to arbitration on December
29, 2022, based on arbitration agreement in the parties’ pool and spa
construction contract, dated April 29, 2021.
 
On June 13, 2023, the arbitrator, Justice Richard D.
Aldritch, held a preliminary management conference for the arbitration. At the
conference, Plaintiffs’ objections to the arbitration being treated as a
consumer case was discussed.
 
On June 15, 2023, the arbitrator issued a scheduling order
and confirmed JAMS’ preliminary determination that this is a consumer case.
 
Plaintiffs failed to make timely payment of an invoice
issues by JAMS on July 13, 2023, or within 30 days thereafter. On September 25,
2023, JAMS administratively stayed the arbitration and vacated the hearing
dates. Plaintiffs then refused to pay JAMS’ additional invoice issued on August
4, 2023. Defendant claimed that because the case was stuck in procedural limbo
with no hearing dates due to Plaintiffs’ failure to pay the fees, Defendant
filed with the Court his notice of Plaintiffs’ material breach of the
arbitration agreement and election to proceed in court pursuant to CCP §
1291.98 on November 7, 2023.
 
On April 12, 2024, this Court issued an order granting
Goshorn’s motion for sanctions and awarding sanctions in the amount of
$36,974.79. The Court denied Aqua Blue’s motion seeking an order to show cause
for contempt against Goshorn for violating the Court’s order to arbitrate this
matter. The Court also denied Aqua Blue’s motion seeking monetary sanctions
against Goshorn for his decision to terminate the arbitration proceedings. The
case was returned to Court and the arbitration stay was lifted. A corrected
order was issued on April 15, 2024.
 
On May 2, 2024, Aqua Blue and Britton Julien filed an appeal
of the Court’s April 12 order. The Court issued a nunc pro tunc order on May
17, 2024, striking the April 12, 2024. On May 24, 2024, the Court issued a
second nunc pro tunc order correcting the April 15 order to show that it
supersedes the April 12 order. On June 6, 2024, Aqua Blue and Britton Julien
filed two appeals for the Court’s April 15 and May 24 orders.
 
On June 3, 2024, Aqua Blue and Britton Julien filed their
motion and request to stay proceedings pending their appeals. Their appeal is
based on the constitutionality of CCP sections relied upon by this Court in its
ruling. They argue that granting the motion to stay proceedings is proper and
would result in significant savings of judicial resources pending a decision on
the appeal. They also argue that the motion is based entirely on the
discretionary power of the Court to either grant or deny the stay of the
proceedings. They also note that there was no automatic stay of proceedings
attached to the filing of the currently pending appeals.
 
Goshorn filed his opposition on June 10, 2024. He argues
that there is no good cause to stay the case because CCP § 1294(a) signifies
the Legislature’s intent for cases such as this to proceed pending appeal, and
he argues that Plaintiffs’ appeal is unlikely to succeed. Next, he argues that
there is no basis to stay the case under CCP § 904.1(a)(12). Finally, Goshorn
argues that justice delayed is justice denied.
 
ANALYSIS
Because this request for a stay is not based on any
automatic stay, the only authority that Aqua Blue and Julien cite in support of
their motion for a stay of proceedings is Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.515(f).
That rule reads as follows:
“In ruling on a
motion for a stay order, the assigned judge must determine whether the stay
will promote the ends of justice, considering the imminence of any trial or
other proceeding that might materially affect the status of the action to be
stayed, and whether a final judgment in that action would have a res judicata
or collateral estoppel effect with regard to any common issue of the included
actions.” (Rule 3.515(f).)
 
Aqua Blue and Julien argue that while there are no imminent
trial dates, allowing this case to proceed would be a waste of time and
judicial resources because they are predicting that the Court of Appeal will
overturn this Court’s prior orders. They do not, however, cite any authority
for why they are likely to succeed. They also argue that neither party will be
prejudiced if the action is stayed for several months to allow the writs of
mandate to be considered and ruled upon. Finally, they argue that a stay will
ensure that neither party is forced to waste resources once the writs are ruled
upon.
 
In his opposition, Goshorn argues that Aqua Blue applies the
wrong standard. Rule 3.515 applies only to motions under CCP § 404.5. (See Cal.
Rules of Court Rule. 3.515(a).) CCP § 404.5 applies to stays that are put in
place pending a determination of whether coordination of complex cases is
appropriate. Rule 3.515 would not be applicable to this case.
 
Goshorn’s counsel represents in his opposition that he is
not aware of any standard expressed by the Legislature or the Rules of Court
setting out factors to be considered in a request to stay for a breach of
contract/fraud case, so Goshorn argues that the general good cause standard for
granting any discretionary relief should apply.
 
Goshorn argues that that there is no good cause to stay the
case. First, he points out that a recent amendment to CCP § 1294(a) by the
Legislature eliminates the automatic stay for appeals of order denying
petitions to compel arbitration, which is effectively what Aqua Blue and Julien
are appealing. Next, he argues that Aqua Blue’s constitutional arguments are
unlikely to succeed on appeal because the Court of Appeal has already
repeatedly held that CCP § 1281.98 is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.
(See Hohenshelt v. Superior Court (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 1319, 1325-1326;
Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 645; and Espinoza
v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 783.) Goshorn also argues that
because Aqua Blue previously opposed arbitrating the matter, did not request
the case be compelled to arbitration in opposition to Goshorn’s motion under
CCP § 1281.98, and served discovery and filed multiple motions with the Court
after the arbitration was terminated, then an appellate court would be unlikely
to now grant a request by Aqua Blue to compel arbitration once more.
 
While Goshorn also cites Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises
2024 WL 2313710, he does not acknowledge that it creates a split of authority
among the Courts of Appeal as to whether CCP §§ 1281.97 and 1281.98 remain
valid because they may now be preempted by the FAA.  Because the law is no longer clear, it makes
sense to stay this case until the conflict is cleared up or this case is
reviewed by the Court of Appeal.
 
Goshorn also argues that there is no basis to stay under CCP
§ 904.1(a)(12) because there is no authority that would indicate that an appeal
of the sanctions award would justify a stay of the entire case.  However, Aqua Blue has challenged both the
sanctions award and the arbitration withdrawal provisions upon which those
sanctions were based.
 
Given the new uncertainty over the state of the law, the
court believes it prudent to stay this matter for now.
 
Based on the foregoing, Aqua Blue and Julien’s motion and
request for stay of proceedings is granted. The case is stayed pending the
outcome of the appeal or some change of circumstances that might warrant
lifting the stay.
