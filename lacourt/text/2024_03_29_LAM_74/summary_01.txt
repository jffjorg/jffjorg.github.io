And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling takes the petition to confirm an arbitration award off calendar. The dispute arose from an employment dispute between Sean D. Caston (Petitioner) and American Trust Investment Services, Inc. (Respondent). The arbitration award was issued on February 16, 2023, and Petitioner filed a petition to confirm the award on June 12, 2023. Respondent filed a response requesting to vacate the award on July 24, 2023, and an additional response on January 29, 2024. The court notes that an older, arguably related case is pending in Department 26. Therefore, the court orders Petitioner to file a notice of related case in Department 26 by April 5, 2024.
