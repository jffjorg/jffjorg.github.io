  Case Number:  23STCP02038    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  74 Sean D.
Caston v. American Trust Investment Services, Inc.
Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute between Petitioner Sean D. Caston
(Petitioner) and Respondent American Trust Investment Services, Inc.
(Respondent). 
            On
February 16, 2023, FINRA Dispute Resolution Services issued an arbitration
award.
            On
June 12, 2023, Petitioner filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.
            On
July 24, 2023, Respondent filed a response requesting that the court vacate the
award.
            On
January 29, 2024, Respondent filed an additional response.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION 
            The court takes the petition off calendar. Although the
docket for this action suggests the court denied Respondent’s notice of related
case, the denial resulted from inadvertence in the case management system. The
court’s February 22, 2024, minute order correctly indicates that the court took
no action on the notice of related case because an older, arguably related case
(American Trust Investor Services, Inc. v. Sean D. Caston, Los Angeles
Superior Court Case No. 23STCP01815) is pending in Department 26. The court
orders Petitioner to file no later than April 5, 2024, a notice of related case
in Department 26.
