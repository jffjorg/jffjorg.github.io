     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant first national insurance
  company OF AMERICA’s demurrer 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff
Houman Nikbakht filed this action against Defendants First National Insurance
Company of America, Terri Anderson, and Infinity Assurance Group. The complaint
asserts causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4)
intentional misrepresentation, (5) and negligence/professional negligence. 
            Plaintiff purchased a policy from
Defendant First National to insure his property located in Los Angeles. In
August 2023, the property suffered a power surge which damaged the electrical
appliances, outlets, and switches. Plaintiff alleges that First National
improperly denied his claim. 
            On November 15, 2024, Defendant
First National filed the instant demurrer to the fifth cause of action. Plaintiff
filed a notice of non-opposition on December 23, 2024.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Turnbull Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            “[N]egligence
is not among the theories of recovery generally available against insurers.” (Sanchez
v. Lindsey Morden Claims Services, Inc. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 249, 254.)
This is because “conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious
only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)
“[T]he mere negligent breach of a contract” is insufficient to justify tort
liability. (Id. at p. 552.) In the insurance context, courts “rely on
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied in every contract, to
justify tort liability.” (Ibid.) 
            Here, Plaintiff’s negligence claim
alleges that Defendant “wrongfully and negligently failed to provide the
insurance requested by Plaintiff.” (Compl. ¶ 67.) The alleged wrongful denial
of coverage is nothing more than a breach of the insurance contract. (See id.,
¶¶ 34-35.) To the extent that Defendant acted in bad faith, Plaintiff has a
claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The
complaint otherwise alleges no “duty independent of the contract.” (See Erlich,
supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 551.) 
            Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendant negligently failed “to fully inform and discuss with Plaintiff the
adequacy of insurance for the Property.” (Compl. ¶ 67.) Plaintiff cites no
authority imposing such a duty on insurers. To the contrary, “[i]t is up to the
insured to determine whether he or she has sufficient coverage for his or her
needs.” (Everett v. State Farm General Ins. Co. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
649, 660.) Therefore, the negligence claim fails as a matter of law. Plaintiff
concedes this through his notice of non-opposition to the demurrer.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant First National’s demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
