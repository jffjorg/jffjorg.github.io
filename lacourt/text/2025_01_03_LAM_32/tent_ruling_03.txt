            v.
 
LUIS DIAZ ROJAS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV41020
  Hearing Date:  January 3, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses (CRS# 7744)   




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 
            On September 11, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to requests for production.
Because Plaintiff did not receive the responses, Defendant was ordered to send
them by mail and email within 5 days.  
            On October 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses on the grounds that Defendant
failed to obey the Court’s September 11 order. Defendant filed his opposition
on November 26, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on December 23, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) 
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant served his amended
response to the subject RFPs on September 16, 2024, five days after the Court’s
September 11 order. (Koorenny Decl. ¶ 5-7.) Plaintiff’s motion fails to
properly explain the defect with Defendant’s response. The response states that
Defendant is unable to comply with the request because the requested documents
have never been in Defendant’s possession, custody, or control. (Plntf.’s Ex.
D.) This is a compliant response. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.) 
            Without authority or basis,
Plaintiff asks the Court to amend its order to compel Defendant to provide
responses without objection. Defendant is entitled to assert objections to
preserve them while providing a substantive response. Despite objecting,
Defendant still provided a responsive answer by stating that he does not
possess the requested documents. Plaintiff’s dissatisfaction with this answer
is not a reason to compel a further response.
            In sum, Defendant has served a
code-compliant response to the RFPs. Therefore, there is no basis to compel a
further response. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is DENIED.
