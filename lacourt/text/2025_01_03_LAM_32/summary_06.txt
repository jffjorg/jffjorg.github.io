And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the plaintiff's negligence claim against First National Insurance Company of America. The court found that the plaintiff's claim failed to state a cause of action because negligence is not a viable theory of recovery against an insurer. The court also noted that the plaintiff's allegations of negligent failure to provide insurance coverage and to fully inform the plaintiff of the adequacy of the insurance were insufficient to impose a duty on the insurer. The court sustained the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff will not be able to refile the claim.
