Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Heather Toomes, ordering the defendant, UHC of California, to produce non-privileged documents from January 2017 onwards relating to the coverage position change in 2018. The change in 2018 is relevant because it affected the plaintiff's surgery request. The judge has also allowed the plaintiff to obtain documents dating back to the beginning of 2017, which is the start of the policy's development. The judge has inherent discretion to modify its previous order and has exercised that discretion in this case.
