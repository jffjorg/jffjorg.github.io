     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for summary judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 29, 2022, Plaintiff Seji
Yonezawa filed this action against Defendants Nikkei Memorial Group, Inc. dba
Kubota Mortuary (Kubota) and Evergreen Cemetery (Evergreen), asserting causes
of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, and (3) intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The complaint stems from the following facts.
            Plaintiff’s daughter, Kyoko Yonezawa
(Kyoko) passed away in April 2019. (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 8.) Kyoko was married to Alex
Sinclair (Sinclair). (Id., ¶ 6.) Defendants contractually agreed to
split Kyoko’s ashes evenly, with 50% going to Plaintiff and his wife and 50%
going to Sinclair. (Id., ¶¶ 9, 10.) In reality, Defendants gave 80% of
Kyoko’s ashes to Plaintiff and 20% to Sinclair. (Id., ¶ 13.) This led
Sinclair to file suit against Plaintiff, causing Plaintiff to incur substantial
legal expenses. (Id., ¶¶ 14-15.) 
            On August 23, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed his opposition on
November 26, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on December 23, 2024.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.” (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            Defendants’ objections are
overruled. 
DISCUSSION
I.
Statute of Limitations
The statute of limitations for “[a]n
action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument
of writing” is two years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339(1).) The statute of
limitations for “[a]n action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the
death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another” is
two years. (Id., § 335.1.) Thus, the oral contract, negligence, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress claims are subject to a two-year
statute of limitations. Under the discovery rule, the limitations period begins
running when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered their cause of
action with reasonable diligence. (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005)
35 Cal.4th 797, 807.)                 
            Defendants argue that Plaintiff
should have discovered by April 26, 2019 that Sinclair was only receiving 20%
of Kyoko’s ashes. Sinclair had requested two smaller urns to hold his portion
of the ashes, which could not hold 50% of the ashes. (Def.’s Stmt. of
Undisputed Facts (UF) 3-4.) On April 26, 2019, Plaintiff signed two releases
indicating that Kyoko’s remains would be distributed “8/10 to residence of Dr.
Seji Yonezawa” and “2/10 to residence of Dr. Alexander Sinclair.” (Allen Decl.,
Ex. D.) This evidence shows as a matter of law that Plaintiff discovered or
should have discovered the breach by April 26, 2019. 
            Plaintiff argues that when he signed
the releases, Kubota did not have any Japanese-speaking employees explain the
documents to him. (Yonezawa Decl. ¶ 16.) Plaintiff avers that Kubota advertised
Japanese services but did not have Japanese-speaking employees and communicated
with Sinclair in English. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
            This is not “substantial responsive
evidence” sufficient to raise a triable issue. (See Sangster, supra, 68
Cal.App.4th at p. 163.) Plaintiff does not aver that the lack of
Japanese-speaking employees rendered him unable to understand the releases
written in English. To the contrary, even though Kubota communicated
exclusively in English, Plaintiff understood that Kubota orally agreed to
divide the ashes 50/50. (Yonezawa Decl. ¶ 8.) At that same in-person meeting,
Plaintiff also understood that Sinclair expressed an interest in smaller urns.
(Ibid.) Thus, there is no evidence that Plaintiff did not understand
English or required a Japanese interpreter.
            In any case, “a person who signs an
instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that she failed
to read it before signing,” unless the instrument was “procured by
misrepresentation, overreaching, deception, or fraud.” (Jimenez v. 24 Hour
Fitness USA, Inc. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 546, 563.) This applies even if
the person is not fluent in English. (See Randas v. YMCA of Metropolitan Los
Angeles (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 158, 163 [release of liability written in
English was valid against a plaintiff who was only literate in Greek where the
plaintiff “made no claim of respondent’s fraud or overreaching” and did not “claim
that respondent had reason to suspect she did not or could not read the release”].)

            Here, Plaintiff offers no evidence
that the releases were “procured by misrepresentation, overreaching, deception,
or fraud,” or that Kubota “had reason to suspect []he did not or could not read
the release.” (See Jimenez, supra, 237 Cal.App.4th at p. 563; Randas,
supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p. 163.) Thus, the releases are valid and
demonstrate Plaintiff’s knowledge of the purported breach for purposes of the
discovery rule.
Lastly, Plaintiff claims that he “did not
notice any differences between [his] portion and Dr. Sinclair’s portion”
because he was in remorse over Kyoko’s death. (Yonezawa ¶ 17.) However, this
does not rebut the fact that Plaintiff signed the releases expressly indicating
the 80/20 split. Plaintiff’s declaration does not aver that his grief prevented
him from reading the releases, nor does Plaintiff cite any authority suggesting
that personal grief excuses reasonable diligence for purposes of the discovery
rule. 
In sum, Defendants have demonstrated as a
matter of law that Plaintiff discovered or through reasonable diligence should
have discovered his causes of action by April 26, 2019. Because Plaintiff filed
this action three years later, the oral contract, negligence, and IIED claims
are barred by the two-year statute of limitations.
II.
Breach of Written Contract
            The statute of limitations for an
action arising from a written contract is four years. (Code Civ. Proc., §
337(a).) Thus, the written contract claim is not time-barred. However, a
nonparty to an agreement generally cannot enforce it. (See Pillar Project AG
v. Payward Ventures, Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 671, 675.) Here, it is
undisputed that Sinclair, as the surviving spouse, had sole authority over the
disposition of Kyoko’s remains. (UF 1; Health & Saf. Code, § 7100.) Thus,
the Funeral Service Contract was signed by Sinclair and Kubota. (Allen Decl.,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff was not a party to this contract, and the contract does not
specify the division of Kyoko’s remains. (Ibid.) 
            Nonetheless, “[a] contract, made
expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time
before the parties thereto rescind it.” (Civ. Code, § 1559.) “California law
permits third party beneficiaries to enforce the terms of a contract made for
their benefit.” (Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1021.) Plaintiff argues that he is a third-party
beneficiary under an instrument titled “Declaration for Disposition of Cremated
Remains.” (Yonezawa Decl., Ex. 4.) The declaration indicates that Kyoko’s
remains would be divided 50/50 between Plaintiff and Sinclair. (Ibid.)[1] 
However, the declaration is facially not a
contract. A note at the bottom of the declaration states that “Business and Professions
Code § 7685.2(b) requires Funeral Establishment to complete this form, provided
by the Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, when making arrangements for cremation.” (Ibid.)
Business and Professions Code section 7685.2(b) states that “[a] funeral
establishment shall obtain from the person with the right to control the
disposition . . . a signed declaration designating specific instructions with
respect to the disposition of cremated remains or hydrolyzed human remains. The
bureau shall make available a form upon which the declaration shall be made.”
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7685.2(b).)  
            Plaintiff cites no authority or
evidence suggesting that the declaration required by Business and Professions Code
section 7685.2(b) constitutes a contract. The declaration also lacks
consideration, as it merely contains instructions from Sinclair. Plaintiff
otherwise cites no evidence that the terms of the Funeral Service Contract
require a 50/50 division of the remains, or that he is a third-party
beneficiary to that contract. 
In sum, Defendants have demonstrated that
there is no written contract enforceable by Plaintiff requiring Kyoko’s remains
to be distributed 50/50 between Plaintiff and Sinclair. Therefore, the breach
of written contract claim fails as a matter of law.
            Because all the claims in the
complaint fail as a matter of law, summary judgment is warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED.
