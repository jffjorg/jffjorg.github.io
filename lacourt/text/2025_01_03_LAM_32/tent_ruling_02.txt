[1] Defendants argue that a revised
declaration, executed after Sinclair requested smaller urns, indicates an 80/20
split. (See Doty Supp. Decl., Ex. 1.) Even if this reply evidence could be
considered, it would simply raise a factual dispute as to the operative
declaration. This particular issue has no bearing on the Courtâ€™s ruling
because, as discussed herein, the declaration is not an enforceable contract to
begin with.
