And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff had requested the defendant to provide further responses to requests for production, but the defendant had already provided a compliant response stating that he was unable to comply with the requests because the requested documents were never in his possession, custody, or control. The judge found that the defendant's response was proper and that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses was denied. The judge also noted that the defendant was entitled to assert objections to preserve them while providing a substantive response, and that the plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the answer was not a reason to compel a further response.
