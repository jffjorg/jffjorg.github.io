            v.
 
UHC OF CALIFORNIA, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV18404
  Hearing Date:  January 3, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses (CRS# 9304) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff Heather
Toomes filed this action against Defendant UHC of California, asserting causes
of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing. The complaint alleges that Defendant wrongfully refused
to authorize a needed surgery for Plaintiff based on surgery guidelines that
were biased and financially-driven. 
            On March 27, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production.
Among other things, the Court ordered Defendant to produce documents pertaining
to the development of the medical policy related to Plaintiff’s surgery
request. However, the Court limited production to the time period beginning
January 2019 because the relevant policy was adopted in 2022. 
            On November 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to compel further responses on the grounds that the
relevant policy was actually developed in 2018 and therefore Defendant’s
production should go back further than January 2019. Defendant filed its
opposition on December 19, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on December 26,
2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
Additionally, “the trial court retains the
inherent authority to change its decision at any time prior to the entry of
judgment.” (Darling v. Kritt (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1156.) “[S]ection
1008 does not govern the court's ability, on its own motion, to reevaluate
its own interim rulings.” (Ibid.) “[T]he only requirement of the court
is that it exercise ‘due consideration’ before modifying, amending, or revoking
its prior orders.” (Id. at p. 1157.) 
DISCUSSION
            While framed as a motion to compel
further responses, Plaintiff’s motion is really one for reconsideration of the
Court’s March 27 order. Plaintiff requests the Court to amend its order to
broaden the timeframe of production. Although this motion was filed more than
10 days after the March 27 order, the Court has inherent discretion to amend
its orders outside of the statutory framework. (See Darling, supra, 75
Cal.App.4th at p. 1156.) Plaintiff did not discover the basis for
reconsideration until deposing Defendant’s PMQs in September and October 2024.
(See Davis Decl., Ex. 3, 4.) 
            These depositions revealed that the
pertinent language and coverage position at issue were adopted in 2018. In
opposition, Defendant contends that the specific version of the policy at issue
was adopted in 2022 and that in any case, Defendant has produced information from
2018 regarding the changes in 2018. (Appleby Decl. ¶¶ 18, 22.) Plaintiff argues
that information from 2018 itself is insufficient because Plaintiff is entitled
to information regarding the history and development of the policy, dating back
to the beginning of 2017.      
            The changes in 2018 are relevant because
they are the ones affecting Plaintiff’s specific surgery request. While the
most recent version of the policy may have been adopted in 2022, the change
that affected Plaintiff’s coverage occurred in 2018. Thus, information on that
change is relevant. And as the Court has held previously, Plaintiff is entitled
to information on the history and development of the policy. Thus, the
pertinent time period extends beyond 2018. Plaintiff may obtain documents
relating to the 2018 changes beginning January 2017.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel is
GRANTED. Within 20 days of this order, Defendant shall produce all
non-privileged documents from January 2017 onwards relating to the coverage
position change in 2018.
