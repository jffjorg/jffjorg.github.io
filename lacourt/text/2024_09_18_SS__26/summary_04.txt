And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Marianna Melikova's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against her. The motion was filed late and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the delay was due to excusable neglect or mistake. The judge found that the motion did not demonstrate that a reasonably prudent person would have made the same error, and that the lack of understanding by the defendant regarding the need to file a responsive pleading was not sufficient to excuse the delay. The judge also noted that the motion incorrectly cited the time provision set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, and that the proposed answer submitted by the defendant did not support the motion.
