And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Siri Rose Ambe's motion to quash deposition subpoenas served by Defendant Patricia Macias Jaramillo on Plaintiff's current employers, You Can Health Services and Pitney Bowes, Inc. The subpoenas seek 10 years of employment records, despite Plaintiff only working at the companies for 5-7 years. The judge finds that the subpoenas are overbroad, seek information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and violate Plaintiff's right to privacy. The judge also finds that Defendant has not demonstrated a compelling need for the employment records, as they are not directly relevant to the lawsuit. The judge orders that the subpoenas be quashed and that Defendant must use less intrusive methods to obtain the information sought.
