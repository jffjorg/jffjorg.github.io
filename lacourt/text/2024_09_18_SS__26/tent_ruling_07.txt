REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS
(CCP § 2033.280)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Arbat, A Law Corporation’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ERNEST
DARYL WILKERSON IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $410.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL

ANALYSIS:
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff Arbat, A Law Corporation
(“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Ernest Darryl
Wilkerson (“Defendant”). (Motion, Kazachki
Decl., Exh. 1.) To date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on August 21, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive for a straightforward and unopposed motion to
compel initial discovery responses. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $410.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $350.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Kazachki
Decl., ¶5.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Arbat, A Law Corporation’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ERNEST
DARYL WILKERSON IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $410.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
