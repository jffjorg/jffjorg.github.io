ANALYSIS:
 
On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff Christopher Hicks (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Avalon West Hollywood, LP
(“Defendant”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant has not served responses. (Id.
at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on July 26, 2024.
No opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling it to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and
counsel of record in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney time
billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Christopher Hicks’ Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT AVALON WEST HOLLYWOOD, LP IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER. DEFENDANT AVALON WEST HOLLYWOOD, LP AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
