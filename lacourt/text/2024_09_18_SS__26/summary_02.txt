And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Reed et al. v. Gilerman et al., granting Respondents Erina Gilerman and Alexander Gudis' Motion for Post-Judgment Attorney's Fees in the amount of $3,477.50 and costs of $64.22. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.040 and 1033.5, which allow for the recovery of post-judgment attorney's fees when awarded pursuant to contract or "otherwise provided by law." The judge found that Respondents are entitled to post-judgment attorney's fees because the underlying judgment included an award of attorney's fees to the judgment creditor. The judge also denied Respondents' request for an award of $500.00 in attorney's fees paid to Law Offices of Victor Sherman. The ruling is based on the declaration of Respondents' attorney, Jeffrey Nodd, which sets forth the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing the judgment. The judge's objective is to award attorney fees at the fair market value based on the particular action, and the lodestar method was used to calculate the fees.
