ANALYSIS: 
            
On April 26, 2022, Petitioners
Zshonette Reed, Esq. and Law Offices of Lorden & Reed (“Petitioners”) filed
the instant Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award against Respondents Erina
Gilerman (“Respondent Gilerman”) and Alexander Gudis (“Respondent Gudis”).
Respondents filed an opposition on June 1, 2022, then filed an Amended Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award and Opposition to Vacate the Award on August 15,
2022. On February 9, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Respondents
confirming the arbitration award. (Judgment, 02/09/23.) The judgment provided
that costs are to be awarded per memorandum of costs and attorney’s fees are to
be awarded per noticed motion. On June 15, 2023, the Court granted Respondents’
motion for attorney’s fees and costs. (Minute Order, 06/14/23.)
 
On February 28, 2024, the Court
denied Petitioners’ ex parte application to stay enforcement of the judgment.
(Minute Order, 02/28/24.) On April 2, 2024, Petitioners filed a noticed Motion
to Stay Enforcement of Judgment. Following complete briefing, the Court denied
the noticed Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment on June 17, 2024. (Minute
Order, 06/17/24.) 
 
 Respondents now bring the instant Motion for
Post-Judgment Attorney’s Fees. Petitioners filed an opposition on September 5,
2024 and Respondents replied on September 11, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The instant Motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.040 and 685.070. “The judgment creditor may claim
under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a
judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in
costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” Also, the motion must be brought with two years of the incurred costs.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
Respondents have demonstrated that they are entitled to
post-judgment attorney’s fees pursuant to section 685.040, which allows
recovery of post-judgment attorney’s fees when awarded pursuant to contract or “otherwise
provided by law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.) Therefore, where the underlying
judgment included an award of attorney’s fees, post-judgment fees are also
allowed. 
 
Calculation
of Attorney Fees and Costs
 
The Court’s objective is to award
attorney fees at the fair market value
based on the particular action.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.)  The lodestar method is based on the factors, as
relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
Respondents
submit the declaration of their attorney, Jeffrey Nodd (“Nodd”), in support of the
request for attorney fees. Nodd bills at $325.00 an hour, which is reasonable
for an experienced attorney practicing in Los Angeles, California. (Motion, Nodd
Decl., ¶¶5, 8.) During the relevant time, Nodd billed 6.7 hours with respect to
Petitioners’ ex parte application and noticed motion to stay. (Id. at
Exh. C.) With respect to the instant Motion, Nodd expects to bill a total of four
hours. (Id. at ¶11.) This amounts to $3,477.50 in attorney’s fees. The
Motion also mentions $500.00 in attorney’s fees purportedly paid by Respondent
Gilerman to the Law Offices of Victor Sherman. (Id. at Exh. D.) It is
unclear for what service these were paid, or in what case. The letter provided
as an exhibit to the instant Motion does not indicate anything about the fees
paid other than that they were for Respondent Gilerman. The request for the
$500.00 in attorney’s fees paid to Law Offices of Victor Sherman is denied. Finally,
Motion requests an award of costs Respondents incurred post-judgment in the
amount of $64.22. (Id. at ¶¶3, 7 and Exh. D.) 
 
Petitioners’
opposition cites no law that bars the recovery of attorney’s fees by
Respondents. Instead, it reiterates Petitioners’ prior arguments regarding the
garnishment order by the federal government. The Court has already considered
these arguments in connection with Respondent’s noticed Motion to Stay
Proceedings and found them to be without merit. Based on the foregoing,
Respondents are awarded attorney’s fees of $3,477.50 and costs of $64.22.
 
Conclusion
 
Respondents
Erina Gilerman and Alexander Gudis’ Motion for Post-Judgment Attorney’s Fees is
GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,477.50 AND COSTS OF $64.22.
