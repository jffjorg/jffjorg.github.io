ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Alliance United Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants Advance Auto Works Collision, Inc., Jose
Mauricio Guardado, Kevin Giovanni Pleitez, Vilma Isabel Rivas, and Esthefany
Pleitez (“Defendants”) on July 29, 2021. Defendants filed an Answer thought
counsel on September 21, 2021.
 
After Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement on January 20,
2023, the Court set an Order to Show Case Re Dismissal (Settlement) for July
16, 2024.  On March 4, 2024, however, the
Court granted defense counsel’s motion to withdraw. (Minute Order, 03/04/24.) 
 
On January 8, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request to
withdraw the Notice of Settlement and set a Trial Setting Conference for April
15, 2024. Thereafter, trial was set for July 15, 2024. (Minute Order,
04/15/24.) Following Plaintiff’s virtual appearance for trial on July 15, 2024,
the trial date was continued to July 22, 2024. (Minute Order, 07/15/24.) When
Plaintiff did not appear for the Order to Show Cause, on July 16, 2024, the
action was dismissed without prejudice. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Reopen Case/Vacate
Dismissal on August 27, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion was not filed and served at least 16
court days prior to the hearing date, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005. August 27, 2024 was only 15 court days prior to the hearing.
Also, the Motion was served by electronic mail, which adds two court days to
the notice period. (Code Civ. Pro., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(B).) Finally, the
Motion was only served on Defendants Advance Auto Works Collision, Inc. and
Kevin Giovanni Pleitez. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff Alliance United Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is
CONTINUED TO JANUARY 8, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. BY DECEMBER 11, 2024, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE
MOTION AND HEARING DATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.
