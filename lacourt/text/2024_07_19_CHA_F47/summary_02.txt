And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Lori Johnson, is sustained, meaning that the plaintiffs must refile their complaint with additional information to address the issues raised in the demurrer. The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to file a second amended complaint. The demurrer was filed in response to the first amended complaint, which alleged that the defendant breached her oral contract with the plaintiffs, committed financial elder abuse, and failed to provide a declaration of their rights under the alleged oral partnership agreement. The judge found that the plaintiffs had failed to plead sufficient facts to support their claims, particularly with regards to the statute of frauds and the alleged fraud that underlies their financial elder abuse cause of action. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' allegations regarding the oral partnership were unclear and failed to provide sufficient specific facts to support their claims.
