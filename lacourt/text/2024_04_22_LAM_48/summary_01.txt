* Department: 48

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Vincenzo Averaimo
* Defendant: City of Los Angeles

**Facts**

* Plaintiff filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles in August 2021
* Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in August 2023
* Plaintiff objected to the proposed judgment in January 2024
* Plaintiff filed a notice of intent to move for a new trial in February 2024

**Issues**

**Ruling**

* The motion for new trial is denied
* The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a reasoned inference of discrimination or retaliation
* The Court concludes that the Defendant's proffered legitimate and non-discriminatory reasons for its actions were sufficient to justify the adverse employment actions taken against the Plaintiff

**Significant Statements**

* "A judge's comments in oral argument may never be used to impeach the final order, however valuable to illustrate the court's theory they might be under some circumstances." (Jespersen v. Zubiate-Beauchamp (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 624, 633)
* "At the hearing, Plaintiff's Counsel emphasized the legal standard as stated in Light v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 75, 94: ' . . . Thus, citing a legitimate reason for the challenged action will entitle the employer to summary judgment only when the employee's showing, while sufficient to invoke the presumption, is too weak to sustain a reasoned inference in the employee's favor. That, and not 'pretext,' must be the focus of the judicial inquiry.'" (Order at p. 7, some quotation marks omitted)
* "The stronger the employer's showing of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the stronger the plaintiff's evidence must be in order to create a reasonable inference of a discriminatory motive." (Featherstone v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1150, 1159)
