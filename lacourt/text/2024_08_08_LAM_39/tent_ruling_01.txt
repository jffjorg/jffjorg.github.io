MOTION
            In
three separate motions, attorney Steven W. Blake of Blake Law Firm (“Counsel”)
moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants JKV SPV, LLC, JKV Capital LLC,
and Upstart Residential, Inc. (“Defendants”).  Defendants have not opposed the motions.
 ANALYSIS
Counsel has filed
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the court copies of the proposed
orders on form MC-053, as required.  (Cal
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  The basis
for the motions is the professional relationship between Counsel and Defendants
has broken down.  This is a valid reason
for withdrawal.  Accordingly, the motions
are granted.  Counsel should note the
orders will become effective upon the filing of proofs of service of signed copies
of them having been served on Defendants. 
Counsel will remain the attorney of record until Counsel files with the court
such proofs of service.  Counsel is to
serve copies of the signed orders (form MC-053) on Defendants within 10 days
and file proof of service thereof.
As Defendants are
entities, they cannot represent themselves. 
(See Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1276, 1284.)  The court, therefore, sets a hearing on an
order to show cause regarding representation of Defendants on October 15, 2024
at 8:30 a.m. and continues the hearing on the order to show cause why this case
should not be dismissed following arbitration to the same date and time.
Counsel is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
