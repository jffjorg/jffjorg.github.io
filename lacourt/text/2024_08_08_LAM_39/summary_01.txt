In this tentative ruling, Judge [Judge's Name] considers motions to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney Steven W. Blake on behalf of Defendants JKV SPV, LLC, JKV Capital LLC, and Upstart Residential, Inc. The motions were not opposed by the Defendants. The court grants the motions as the professional relationship between Counsel and Defendants has broken down, which is a valid reason for withdrawal. Counsel is required to serve copies of the signed orders on the Defendants within 10 days and file proof of service. As the Defendants are entities, they cannot represent themselves, and the court sets a hearing on October 15, 2024, to consider representation of the Defendants.
