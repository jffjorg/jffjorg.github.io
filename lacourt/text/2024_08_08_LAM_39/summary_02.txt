And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel depositions filed by Plaintiff Yuehua Tuo. The Plaintiff had served deposition notices on Defendants AWA Forged Composites LLC, Bryan Gill, and Tamra Bosson, but the Defendants failed to appear for the depositions despite not objecting to the notices. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendants to appear for depositions and to produce the documents identified in the deposition notices.

The Judge has also imposed sanctions on the Defendants in the amount of $5,334.55, which represents four hours of attorney time to prepare the motions and attend the hearing at $450 per hour, plus $3,534.55 in costs for the attendance of court reporters at depositions for which the Defendants failed to appear. The Judge orders the Defendants to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice of this order.

The motion to compel is granted, and the Defendants are required to appear for depositions within 7 days of notice of this order, unless the Plaintiff stipulates otherwise. The scope of each deposition is as set forth in the notices of depositions attached to the Declarations of Brad S. Kane in support of the motions.
