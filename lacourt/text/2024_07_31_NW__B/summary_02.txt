And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant Contemporary Services Corporation's (CSC) motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed in response to a trip and fall incident that occurred at SoFi Stadium, where the plaintiff Marshall Krupp allegedly tripped over a curb. CSC argues that the curb was not defective and that the plaintiff released them from liability through a signed release agreement. The Judge agrees with CSC, ruling that the curb was trivial and that the plaintiff's deposition testimony regarding the curb height is clear and consistent. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff released CSC from liability, relying on a release agreement signed by the plaintiff. The motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case is effectively ended.
