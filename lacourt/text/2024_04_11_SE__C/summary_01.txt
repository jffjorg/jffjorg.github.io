And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant filed the motion over two years after the default judgment was entered, which is beyond the two-year deadline for filing a motion under CCP §473.5. The court finds that the defendant has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to relief from default. The court also notes that the defendant has not provided any evidence of extrinsic fraud or mistake to support its claim for equitable relief. As a result, the motion is denied.
