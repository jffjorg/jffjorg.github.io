I.       
Defendant KULPATI CHODHA dba LAS VEGAS ICE
CREAM’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections is GRANTED. 
 

    II.       
Defendant KULPATI CHODHA’s Motion for Relief
from Waiver Objections is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This personal injury action stemming from a motor vehicle
accident was filed by Plaintiff LAURA KARINA LOPEZ (“Plaintiff”) against
Defendants JACQUELINE RIVERA; EDUARDO JAVIER DIEGO RIVERA; KULPATI CHODHA;
KULPHADI CHODHA dba Las Vegas Ice Cream; and DOES 1 to 100 on March 24, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff served Defendants KULPATI CHODHA and KULPATI
CHODHA dba Las Vegas Ice Cream (collectively “Defendants”) with Form
Interrogatories (set one); Special Interrogatories (set one); and Request for
Production of Documents (set one) on or around June 8, 2023. 
 
Current Defense Counsel substituted into this case on July
27, 2023. Current defense counsel argues that “prior counsel failed to inform
Defense Counsel about the pending discovery requests….” (Motion 3:23-25.)
Defendant requested an extension of time to respond to August 22, 2023, which
Plaintiff granted on the condition that all objections be deemed waived.
Defense counsel served responses on August 31, 2023, which contains “essential”
objections. 
 
Defendants now move for relief the waiver of objections
under CCP §§2030.290(a) and 2031.300(a). Defendants filed these Motions on
February 14, 2024. 
 
CCP §2030.290(a) provides: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply: (a) The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4… The Court, on motion,
may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance…. (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
CCP §2031.300(a) is substantively identical. 
 
The Motion is GRANTED. Untimely responses were served, and
Defendants have demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect caused
by the substitution of new counsel into this case and by a death in Defendant’s
family.
 
Sanctions are DENIED. Plaintiff is substantially justified
in opposing the Motions.
