 Case Number:  23NWCV03959    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  C Sergio De
La Cruz vs Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al,
Case No. 23NWCV03959
This is an
action arising from a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff’s Counsel Levik Yarian,
Esq. moves ex parte to withdraw her legal representation of Plaintiff Sergio De
La Cruz, or, in the alternative, for an order shortening time to provide notice
of the motion.  Counsel contends his working relationship with Plaintiff
has become so strained that she can no longer successfully prepare this case
for trial.
A motion to be
relieved as counsel is a noticed motion which must be made on a judicial
council form. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a).) Thus, the Court cannot
rule on the motion at this time.  Accordingly, Counsel’s ex parte
application is DENIED.  Alternatively, the Court ADVANCES the Motion from
Thursday, January 2, 2025 to Thursday, May 2, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department
SE-C.  Counsel shall file and serve a properly noticed motion using
judicial council forms.  
Moving party to
give notice.
