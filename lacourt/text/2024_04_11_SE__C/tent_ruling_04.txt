On February 15, 2024,
this Court continued these three matters to April 11, 2024. However,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Discovery Responses (filed on
August 31, 2023) was not continued, and inadvertently taken off-calendar by the
Court. 
To ensure that all
parties have adequate notice of the hearing date and the matters remaining on
calendar, these motions are once again continued as indicated above. 
The parties are
encouraged to meet and confer prior to the continued hearing date.
