  - "The trial court was also justified in declining to rule on the Danko Appellants' anti-SLAPP motion for the purposes of establishing entitlement to a request for fees, as no such request had yet been made."
  - "To conclude otherwise would require the court to have issued an advisory opinion."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Cross-Defendant Dennis Ardi's Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint of McNicholas & McNicholas LLP. Ardi had moved to strike the cross-complaint on the grounds that its claims for interference with Defendant's client relationship arose from protected and privileged litigation-related communications between Ardi and his client. However, Defendant has since dismissed the cross-complaint while the motion was pending, making the motion moot. The judge relies on previous cases to support the conclusion that the motion is moot, including Catlin Ins. Co., Inc. v. Danko Meredith Law Firm, Inc. (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 764, which held that a trial court only has jurisdiction to entertain a subsequent motion for fees, not to decide the merits of the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge also notes that there is no request for fees pending in this case, making the issue of entitlement to attorney fees unripe.
