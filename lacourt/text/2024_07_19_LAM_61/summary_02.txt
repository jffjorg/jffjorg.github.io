And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of attorney Michael A. Lanphere to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Chevalier Harris and Chevalier Harris as a successor in interest for Decedent Freddie Harris. The motion was granted because Lanphere had previously notified his clients of his intention to retire on June 30, 2024, and despite providing them with substitution of attorney forms, no response has been received. The judge's ruling is effective once Lanphere files proof of service of the signed orders with the court, as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(e).
