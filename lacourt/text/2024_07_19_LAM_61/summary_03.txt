And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Brandon C. Murphy's third motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant and cross-complainant David Bogner. The motion states that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and that the client has refused to participate in the litigation. However, the judge found that the motion is defective because it was served by mail on a "Spring Place" social club, without assurance that the service was made upon Bogner's current or last known residence or business address. The judge ordered Murphy to provide a declaration stating that the address is Bogner's current or last known residence or business address in any future motion to be relieved, or to serve Bogner by personal service or email.
