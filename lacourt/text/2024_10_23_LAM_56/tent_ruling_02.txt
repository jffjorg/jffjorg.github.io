MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff BRIAN LOPEZ (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition has been filed.  Any
opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises from the purchase of an allegedly defective 2018 Dodge Ram 1500
vehicle.  The complaint asserts the
following causes of action: (1) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2,
subdivision (d); (2) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b);
(3) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3); (4) breach of
the implied warranty of merchantability; and (5) negligent repair. 
 
On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and
Expenses (the “Motion”) pursuant to a 998 Offer to Compromise, the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act and California Civil Code § 1794(d) for an order awarding
attorney fees, costs, and expenses in the total amount of $88.954.68.  No opposition has been filed.  
            
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of 19 court
orders relating to awards of attorneys’ fees in other unrelated lemon law cases
in both California and federal court.  These
orders are not relevant to the question of whether the award of fees and costs
sought in the instant case is proper.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice are DENIED.  (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
296, 301 [[J]udicial notice … is always confined to those matters which are
relevant to the issue at hand.”].)
 
DISCUSSION
Attorneys’
fees are allowed as costs when authorized by contract, statute or law.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
In
a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, may be
recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly Act.  Civ. Code, § 1794 provides:
 
If
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.
 
The attorney claiming
fees bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).)  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered.  (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)  “Testimony of an attorney
as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to
support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time
records.”  (Id.)  
 
In determining a reasonable attorneys’ fee, the trial
court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the
number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The
lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in order to
fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided.  (Ibid.)  These facts include (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ibid.)
            
Here,
Plaintiff moves for an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $88,954.68,
consisting of (1) $60,704 in attorneys’ fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC;
(2) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorneys’ fees ($21,246.40); (3) $3,504.28
in costs and expenses; and (4) an additional $3,500 in fees for reviewing the
opposition, drafting a reply, and attending
the
hearing on this Motion.
 
A.
Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiff
contends that he is the prevailing party in this action because of a signed 998
offer in which Defendant ultimately agreed to settle this case.  This is undisputed, as Defendant filed no
opposition.  Plaintiff is the prevailing
party in this action and is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorneys’ fees.
 
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
i.
Reasonable Hourly Rate
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [“The experienced trial judge
is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in [her]
court.”].)
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover attorneys’ fees for the different attorneys and a law clerk who
worked on the case.  For each of the
attorneys and law clerk, attorney Payam Shahian attests to their legal
experience and the reasonableness of their rates.  (Shahian Decl. ¶¶ 44-74.)  The Court finds, based on the submitted
evidence of the declaration of Payam Shahian and the Court’s own experience,
that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ requested hourly rates are reasonable for attorneys
with their experience and in this area of the law.
 
ii.
Reasonable Hours Incurred
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute
v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.)  “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within
the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of
such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The court may also consider whether the amount
requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Plaintiff requests a total amount of attorneys’ fees
of $60,704 for 127.30 hours spent. 
(Shahian Decl., ¶ 76; Exh. 20.) 
The Court finds that the hours asserted are well-supported by the
declaration and the accompanying billing records.  (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford, supra, 132
Cal.App.4th at 396; City of Colton
v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785.)
 
The
Court exercises its discretion, however, and reduces the anticipated amount of
$3,500 in attorneys’ fees in connection with reviewing the opposition to this
Motion, preparing a reply and attending the hearing, to the amount of $500.00,
representing 1 hour at a rate of $500/hour, considering that no opposition was
filed.  
 
C.
Multiplier
While
the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community, it may be adjusted based on various factors, including “(1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in
presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award”
and (4) the success achieved.  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Nonetheless,
the court must not consider extraordinary skill and the other Serrano
factors to the extent these are already included with the lodestar.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th
1122, 1138-1139.) “[A] trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional
representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality
of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable
skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar
calculation.  Otherwise, the fee award
will result in unfair double counting and be unreasonable.” (Id. at
1139.)
 
Plaintiff
requests a lodestar multiplier enhancement of 1.35 in the additional amount of $21,246.40
on the ground that the settlement results were excellent, and because the firm
undertook representation of Plaintiff on a contingency basis—if the action
failed and Plaintiff did not recover, neither would his counsel.  (Shahian Decl., ¶ 80.)  Plaintiff argues there was also a delay in
payment.
 
The
Court finds that under the circumstances of this case, a lodestar multiplier is
not appropriate.  This is a
straightforward lemon law case.  Nothing
before the Court indicates that the case presented novel issues or that the
quality of representation far exceeded the quality of representation that would
have been provided by attorneys of comparable skill and experience billing at
the same rates.  While Plaintiff argues
that counsel accepted the case only on a contingency basis and there was a
delay in payment, the Court finds that such consideration and risk is already
included within the lodestar amount.  That is because the substantial hourly rates allowed
for by the Court are hourly rates for lemon law cases done on a contingency
basis.
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court declines to award a lodestar multiplier.
 
D.
Entitlement and Reasonableness of Costs
Allowable
costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) Any
items not specifically mentioned by statute “may be allowed or denied in the
court's discretion.”  (Id., subd.
(c)(4).)
 
The
Song-Beverly Act allows a successful plaintiff to recover both “costs” and
“expenses.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d).)  Courts have held that “it is clear
the Legislature intended the word ‘expenses' to cover items not included in the
detailed statutory definition of ‘costs.”’  (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  The
court in Jensen held that “[t]he legislative history indicates the
Legislature exercised its power to permit the recovery of expert witness fees
by prevailing buyers under the Act … ,” noting that the legislature included
“expenses” in the lemon law act because '“[t]he addition of awards of “costs and
expenses” by the court to the consumer to cover such out-of-pocket expenses as
filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees, etc., should open the
litigation process to everyone.’  [Citation.]”
 
Plaintiffs
request a total of $3,504.28 in costs and expenses.  (Shahian Decl., ¶ 79; Exh. 20.)  The Court likewise gives credence to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration and the schedule of fees and costs attached
to it, and finds the costs reasonably necessary. 
 
RULING
Based
on all the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED in part.  The Court awards in favor of Plaintiff $61,204
in attorneys’ fees and $3,504.28 in costs.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
