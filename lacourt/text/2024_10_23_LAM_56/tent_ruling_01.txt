The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
             On September 9, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
(“Complaint”)
against
Judgment Creditors and other defendants, asserting the following causes of
action: (1) intentional fraudulent transfer; (2) fraudulent transfer; (3)
transfer resulting in debtor’s insolvency; (4) common law fraudulent transfer;
(5) aiding and abetting fraudulent transfer; (6) declaratory relief; and (7)
unjust enrichment.
 
On
May 31, 2023, MLA Defined Benefit Pension Plan filed a cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”)
against Plaintiffs seeking a declaratory judgment.  On the same date, Judgment Creditors filed a
Motion for Summary Judgment relating to the Complaint and relating to the
Cross-Complaint.  
 
On
September 27, 2023, summary judgment was granted in favor of Judgment Creditors
as to the Complaint and in favor of MLA Defined Benefit Pension Plan as to the
Cross-Complaint.  
 
On
November 2, 2023, the Court issued a Judgment in favor of Judgment Creditors
and against Plaintiffs.  On November 3,
2023, a Notice of Judgment was served on counsel for Plaintiffs. 
 
On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
On
April 4, 2024, this Court issued an Amended Judgment amending the original
Judgment to assess attorney’s fees in the amount of $68,835 in favor of
Judgment Creditors.  
 
On
July 26, 2024, Judgment Creditors filed the instant Motion for Order to Require
Posting of Bond Pursuant to CCP § 917.9(a)(3) (the “Motion”).  
On
August 16, 2024, the Court of Appeal (Second District) (“Court of Appeal”) issued
an order dismissing Plaintiff’s appeal due to default.  On September 13, 2024, the Court of Appeal
vacated its August 16, 2024 order of dismissal, reinstated the appeal filed on
February 2, 2024, and required Judgment Debtors to file a Civil Case
Information Statement within 15 days.  
 
On
October 16, 2024, Judgment Debtors filed a late opposition to this Motion, and
Judgment Creditors filed a reply on October 21, 2024.  The Court, in the exercise of its discretion,
considers the late-filed opposition.  The
Court may consider late-filed papers where insufficient prejudice arises from
consideration of the opposition. (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
690, 697; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288.)
 
DISCUSSION
            “Except as provided in Sections
917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order...”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 916(a).)  
 
A
prevailing party's judgment for attorney's fees is automatically stayed pending
any appeal of the judgment when the attorney's fees are a routine or incidental
item of costs, awarded as a matter of right to the prevailing party.  (Chapala
Mgmt. Corp. v Stanton (2010) 186 Cal.App. 4th 1532, 1546–1547.)
 
The
perfecting of an appeal does not stay enforcement, however, if a judge uses the
discretion to require an undertaking and the undertaking is not given, in any
of the following cases: (1) the debtor was found to possess money or other
property belonging to the creditor; (2) the debtor is required to perform an
act for the creditor's benefit under the judgment; and (3) the judgment against
the debtor is solely for costs awarded to the creditor under CCP §§ 1021–1038 (CCP
§ 917.9(a).)  
 
Here,
Judgment Creditors seek an order, pursuant to CCP 917.9(a)(3), to require the
posting of bond by Judgment Debtors as a prerequisite to the stay of enforcement
of the judgment for attorneys’ fees in their favor, pending Judgment Debtors’
appeal.  Judgment Creditors bring this
Motion on the grounds that Judgment Debtors’ appeal is in bad faith and
patently frivolous with respect to Judgment Creditors since the Notice of Appeal
was filed more than 60 days after the Notice of the original Judgment was
served, and a challenge to the attorney’s fees amount assessed in the Amended
Judgment is precluded because Judgment Debtors failed to file any opposition to
the motion for attorney’s fees in the trial court.  Judgment Creditors aver that the appeal was filed
solely in order to delay Judgment Creditors’ ability to collect on their
judgment and allow Judgment Debtors time to dissipate and/or conceal their
assets.
 
In
their opposition, Judgment Debtors offer reasons for their failure to file a
timely opposition to the Motion, and submit declarations in support thereof,
but fail to address the argument regarding their patently frivolous appeal as
well as the late filing of the February 2, 2024 Notice of Appeal.  The opposition instead confusingly asserts
that the Notice of Appeal filed on October 2, 2024 was timely.  The Court also notes that on October 18, 2024,
this Court placed Judgment Debtors’ appeal in default pursuant to California
Rules of Court (CRC), rule 8.140(a) for failing to designate what documents and
oral proceedings, if any, are to be included in the record that will be sent to
the Court of Appeal, pursuant to CRC, rule 8.121.  
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court is persuaded that the grounds for the appeal seem
weak and it appears to have been filed only to delay enforcement.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  
 
Judgment
Debtors are ORDERED to post cash or admitted surety insurer bond in an amount
equal to $103,252.50 (1 ½ times the amount of the $68,835 Amended Judgment) or
a qualifying personal surety bond under CCP §995.510 et seq. in the amount of
$137,670 (double the amount of the $68,835 Amended Judgment), within thirty
(30) days from this Order.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 23rd day of October 2024
