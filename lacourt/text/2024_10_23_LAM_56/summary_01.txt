And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion filed by Judgment Creditors to require the posting of a bond by Judgment Debtors in the amount of $103,252.50 or a qualifying personal surety bond in the amount of $137,670. The Judge finds that the grounds for the appeal seem weak and that the appeal was filed only to delay enforcement of the judgment for attorney's fees. The Judge notes that Judgment Debtors failed to file a timely opposition to the motion and that the appeal was filed more than 60 days after the notice of the original judgment was served. The Judge also notes that Judgment Debtors' appeal was placed in default for failing to designate what documents and oral proceedings, if any, are to be included in the record that will be sent to the Court of Appeal.
