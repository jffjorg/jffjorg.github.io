And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication of issues related to the plaintiff's first cause of action for breach of contract. The case arises from an alleged breach of a loan agreement between the plaintiff, David Alexander, and the defendant, James Dolback. The plaintiff loaned $115,000 to the defendant, who failed to repay the loan as agreed.

The Judge has considered the moving papers and found that the plaintiff has met his burden of showing the existence of each element for the cause of action for breach of loan. The defendant, however, has failed to meet his burden of showing a triable issue of material fact.

As a result, the Judge has granted the motion and finds that there are no triable issues of material fact and the plaintiff is entitled, as a matter of law, to summary adjudication on his first cause of action for breach of contract. The defendant's failure to oppose the motion has also waived his ability to argue against the plaintiff's claims.

The ruling is subject to modification based on any opposition that may be filed and the hearing scheduled for October 23, 2024.
