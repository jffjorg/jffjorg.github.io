And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition to confirm the arbitration award filed by Barry Thompson and Nijole Thompson ("Petitioners") is granted. The arbitration award was issued on December 7, 2023, and confirmed the sale of the property at 10440-10446 Hebron Lane in Los Angeles, California, to Petitioners. The award also included a monetary award of $70,059.38 in damages, prevailing party attorneys' fees of $116,125, and costs of $44,805.82.

The judge has confirmed the arbitration award, but only as against Michael Chu, as Danna Ballard's bankruptcy discharge lifted the automatic stay on the case. The award for specific performance, which is not a claim within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code, is confirmed as against both Respondents.

The judge has ordered judgment to be entered in favor of Petitioners for possession and specific performance against both Respondents, jointly and severally, and in the total amount of $230,990.20 as against Chu.
