And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants National Paving Company, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Next Venture, Inc. d/b/a Sierra Group. The proposed cross-complaint is a compulsory cross-complaint, which means it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action alleged in the complaint. National filed its answer to Sierra's cross-complaint on October 12, 2023, and its motion for leave to file its cross-complaint on February 14, 2024, which is a reasonable delay. The judge finds no evidence of bad faith and notes that the parties have just executed a stipulation to continue the trial date until early next year. The judge also finds that the delay in seeking leave to file a cross-complaint was not undue and did not result in any prejudice or tactical advantage. Therefore, the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint is granted.
