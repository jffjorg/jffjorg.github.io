And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration based on a labor arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and Indu-Electric, Inc. The defendants, TPS Solutions, Inc., TPS Solutions, Inc. dba Coast Personnel, and Hugo Martinez, argue that they are entitled to enforce the agreement as non-signatories based on equitable estoppel. However, the judge finds that the defendants have failed to show that the plaintiff's claims against them are "based on the same facts and are inherently inseparable" from arbitrable claims the plaintiff may assert against Indu-Electric, Inc.

Additionally, the judge has denied the defendants' request to be deemed third-party beneficiaries of the labor arbitration agreement. The defendants argue that the agreement should be read to benefit workers leased to Indu-Electric, Inc., like Martinez, but the judge finds that the defendants have failed to make a cogent argument that they are third-party beneficiaries of the agreement.

The judge also declines to judicially notice a trial court's order granting TPS's motion to compel arbitration in a similar case, Tarin, because individual orders of other trial courts are not authority upon which parties may rely.
