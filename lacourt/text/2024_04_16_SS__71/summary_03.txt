And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Doe, alleges that the Defendant, GREYSTAR MANAGEMENT SERVICES LP, breached a written agreement by providing an uninhabitable apartment. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action because the complaint does not alleged the substance of the relevant terms in the contract and the date of the alleged breach of the agreement. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the Defendant, and therefore the Defendant's demurrer is sustained. The Plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint.
