And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' unopposed motion to compel further responses to their Request for Production of Documents (Set One). The motion was denied because the plaintiffs failed to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before filing their motion, as required by the court's procedures. The court ruled that it may deny a motion to compel further responses if parties fail to schedule and complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on the motion.
