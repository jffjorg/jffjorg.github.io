Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Although a written contract is usually pleaded by alleging its making and attaching a copy which is incorporated by reference, a written contract can also be pleaded by alleging the making and the substance of the relevant terms. (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199; Perry v. Robertson (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 333, 341.) Plaintiff fails to allege the substance of the relevant terms in lieu of attaching a copy of the contract.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc., 29 Cal.4th at pgs. 198-199.)  Plaintiff also fails to allege the date of the alleged breach of the agreement.  (See Complaint ¶BC-2.) Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  Conclusion Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the 1st cause of action. Moving Party to give notice.  Dated:  April _____, 2024   Hon. Daniel M. Crowley Judge of the Superior Court
