  E. DAVIS, et al.,  
  
         vs.

  AMERICA, INC.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV09914
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 16, 2024



 
Plaintiffs
Neldra E. Davis’ and Charles F. Davis Jr.’s unopposed motion to compel
further responses to its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is
denied.

 
Plaintiffs Neldra E. Davis (“Neldra”) and
Charles F. Davis Jr. (“Charles”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move unopposed
to compel further responses from Defendant Kia America, Inc. (“KA”)
(“Defendant”) to its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) Nos.
16-21, and to strike Defendant’s meritless objections.  (Notice Motion, pgs. i-ii; C.C.P. §2031.310.)
The
Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion on the basis Plaintiffs failed to follow the
Information Regarding Procedures in Department 71, which requires that “[p]arties
seeking to compel further responses to discovery, must schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) before the Court will hear their motions. The Court may deny a
motion to compel further responses to discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on the motion.”  (Information Regarding Procedures, pg. 4.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
