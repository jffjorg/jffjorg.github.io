And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem matters admitted against defendants Scott Spicer and Antonette Isham. The motion is DENIED as moot, as responses have been served. However, the judge has awarded sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $1,722.50, payable within 30 days. The judge finds that the motions are fairly duplicative and not complicated, and that the amount of sanctions is reasonable. The defendants' claim that their failure to timely respond was due to medical conditions is not sufficient to justify the lack of response. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the sanctions award.
