And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of plaintiffs Oscar Quintero and Ivan Quintero to add a fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and punitive damages to their lemon law claims. The plaintiffs sought to add this cause of action based on an alleged defect in the 10R80 defect in the subject vehicle. The judge found that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for the proposed amendment and that it will not cause prejudice, as trial in the matter is not set until February 2026. The judge also ordered the proposed First Amended Complaint to be filed within 20 days of the order and for the plaintiffs to give notice within five days. The defendants did not oppose the motion, and as a result, the motion was granted.
