**Significant Statements**

* "The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843)
* "The standard of care against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by their testimony (citations), unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman." (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 399, 410)
* "Loss of consortium is, by its nature, dependent on the existence of a cause of action for tortious injury to a spouse. Without injury to the spouse, the plaintiff has no loss of consortium claim." (Vanhooser v. Superior Court (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 921, 928)
