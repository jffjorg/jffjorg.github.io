 Case Number:  22STCV29029    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  JOSE PRECIADO and ALINE PRECIADO, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  SAN GABRIEL TRANSIT INC., ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 22STCV29029  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTIONS TO COMPEL   Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  October 27, 2023  I. Motions to Compel¿ Plaintiff Jose Preciado (“Jose”) and Plaintiff Aline Preciado (“Aline”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) propounded special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on Defendant San Gabriel Transit Inc. (“Defendant”) on February 6, 2023. Plaintiff Jose also propounded form interrogatories, set one, on Defendant on February 6, 2023. Plaintiffs granted Defendant’s three separate requests for an extension, with responses ultimately due by May 15, 2023. Defendant did not serve any responses by the extended deadline. On May 17, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent correspondence to defense counsel regarding the failure to provide timely responses and waiver of objections. On May 19, 2023, defense counsel responded they needed until June 12, 2023, yet at no time prior to May 15, 2023 did Defendant communicate with Plaintiffs about the status of the discovery responses. On May 22, 2023, the parties met and conferred, in which Plaintiffs’ counsel requested substantive responses without objections. On June 2, 2023, Defendant served unverified responses to the discovery requests, containing a mixture of objections and substantive responses.  As of the filing of the motion, Defendant has not served verifications. Plaintiffs therefore seek an order compelling Defendant to serve verified responses, without objections and without exercising the option to produce writings under Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.230, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  As of October 16, 2023, no opposition was filed. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b), § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a), § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Because the evidence shows Defendant was properly served with discovery and failed to provide timely verified responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests, thereby waiving all objections, Plaintiffs’ motions are GRANTED.  Defendant San Gabriel Transit Inc. is ordered to serve verifications/verified responses to Plaintiff Jose Preciado’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2030.290(a),(b).) Defendant San Gabriel Transit Inc. is ordered to serve verifications/verified responses to Plaintiffs Jose Preciado’s and Aline Preciado’s special interrogatories, set one, and RPDs, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2030.290(a),(b), CCP § 2031.300 (a),(b).)  II. Sanctions¿ Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).) Defendant did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition is filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Plaintiffs seek sanctions in the amount of $1,534.95 for each motion.   A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  Plaintiff is awarded $450 for each motion, which includes the time to appear at the hearing, for a total of $1,350 in attorney fees. Further, Plaintiff is awarded three motion filing fees of $61.65, for a total of $184.95, as costs.  Sanctions are imposed against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally. Defendant A San Gabriel Transit Inc. and/or its counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiffs, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $1,534.95, within fifteen (15) days.  Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 26th day of October 2023      Hon.
