And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Priscilla Ibershoff. The petition was filed by the Plaintiffs, Cherri Carreon, et al., against the Defendants, Peter Tagle, et al. The settlement agreement calls for a total payment of $835,000, with $35,000 allocated to Priscilla. However, the judge denied the petition due to several defects. First, the Petitioner has not been appointed as guardian ad litem for Priscilla, which is a prerequisite for filing the petition. Second, Item 14 on the required form, MC-350, is blank. Third, the Petitioner did not submit a proposed order with the petition, as required by Judicial Council Forms MC-351 and MC-355. The judge ordered the Petitioner to file a new petition once they are properly appointed as guardian ad litem and cure the defects noted above.
