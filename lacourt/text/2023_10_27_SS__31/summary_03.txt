And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Jai Radzik, in this wrongful death action. The petition was filed by Eileen Radzik, who is both the guardian ad litem of Jai Radzik and a plaintiff to the same action. The judge found that the petition contains several defects, including incorrect marking on the MC-350 form and incomplete information regarding the settlement amount offered to Jai Radzik. The judge ordered the petitioner to file a new petition curing all the above-noted defects at her earliest convenience. The petitioner was also ordered to include a copy of the written attorney fee agreement in support of the attorneys' fees claimed.
