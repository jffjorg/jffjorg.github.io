 Case Number:  21STCV18710    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/27/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  21STCV18710 REBEKAH SOLIS vs JULIAN KIM, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  JULIAN KIM  RECOMMENDATION:  DENY  TENTATIVE  On May 18, 2021, Plaintiff Rebekah Solis (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against defendants Julian Kim (“Kim”) and Delta SBOC Corporation d/b/a MAPSSE (“Delta”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for sexual battery, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and sexual harassment.   The request for default judgment submitted on September 25, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Previously, Plaintiff sought default judgment against both Defendants. Here, Plaintiff now seeks default judgment against only Defendant Kim for $7,927 in special damages and $500,000 in general damages. Plaintiff corrected the prior issue regarding the proof of service on Defendant Delta, and obtained a new entry of default thereafter.    Plaintiff’s declaration in support of default judgment, and her counsel’s default prove up brief, both request default judgment in the amount of $507,927 against both Defendants, jointly and severally. However, Plaintiff’s CIV-100 and JUD-100 requests default judgment against only Defendant Kim. The default package must be consistent.  It is currently unclear to the Court whether Plaintiff is still seeking default judgment against both Defendants, or if Plaintiff is now only seeking default judgment against Kim. If Plaintiff is seeking default judgment against both Defendants, as jointly and severally liable for the same amount, then this must be properly reflected on CIV-100 and JUD-100. Plaintiff must bring her request for default judgment against both Defendants simultaneously to avoid duplicative damages, unless Plaintiff is no longer seeking default judgment against Delta.   No later than ________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ______________________.
