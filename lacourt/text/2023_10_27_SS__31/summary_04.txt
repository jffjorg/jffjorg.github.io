Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying the City of Los Angeles' motion to dismiss the amendment to the cross-complaint filed by Gabriel's Cleaning Maintenance and Pressure Washing, LLC. The amendment was filed on July 31, 2023, naming the City as Moe 2 and La Arena Company, LLC as Moe 3. The City argues that Gabriel's Cleaning unduly delayed in filing the amendment and that it has been prejudiced by the amendment. However, the Court finds that the City does not identify any actual prejudice it suffered as a result of the amendment and that Gabriel's Cleaning did not fail to exercise diligence in pursuing discovery or other pretrial proceedings. The Court also notes that trial is currently set for January 24, 2024, and that there is still time prior to trial to complete any outstanding discovery.
