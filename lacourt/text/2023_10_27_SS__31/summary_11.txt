And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by PV Holding Corp. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the second cause of action for unfair/unlawful/fraudulent business practices is defective and cannot be corrected. The motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is granted without leave to amend at this time, meaning that the prayer for punitive damages is improper and cannot be reinstated without additional evidence.

The judge found that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a claim against PV Holding Corp. and that the prayer for punitive damages is defective because it does not plead sufficient facts to demonstrate that PV Holding Corp. acted with conscious disregard or despicable conduct.

The judge also noted that PV Holding Corp. is the owner of the vehicle driven by Defendant Singh, and that there are no allegations that PV Holding Corp. had advance knowledge of Defendant Singh's alleged history or that it acted with conscious disregard, authorization, ratification, or act of oppression, fraud, or malice.

The judge ordered PV Holding Corp. to give notice of the tentative ruling and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
