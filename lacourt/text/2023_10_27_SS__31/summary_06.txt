The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the request for default judgment against Defendant Julian Kim.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's default judgment package is incomplete and inconsistent, and orders the Plaintiff to correct the defects and submit a new package by a certain date. Failure to comply may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The hearing is continued to a later date.
