 Case Number:  22STCV15433    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 10/27/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 22STCV15433 CHERRI CARREON, et al. vs PETER TAGLE, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Priscilla Ibershoff, Age 10 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $835,000, with $35,000 being apportioned to Priscilla Ibershoff (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $5,899.48 will be used for medical expenses, $8,750 for attorneys’ fees, and $500.40 will be used for costs. The net balance of $19,850.12 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The petition is denied for the following reasons: ¿ First, Petitioner has not been appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant. The Court notes that Petitioner’s application for appointment was rejected on May 10, 2022, and no further application was filed. Appointment as a guardian ad litem is a prerequisite to petitioning the Court for the requested relief.   Second, Item 14 on MC-350 is blank. Petitioner must checkmark the applicable box.  Third, Petitioner did not submit with the instant petition a proposed order to approve settlement on Judicial Council Form MC-351 or a proposed order to place funds in a blocked account on Judicial Council Form MC-355. Both forms are required.   After Petitioner is properly appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant, Petitioner must file a new petition curing all the above noted defects.    Moving party is ordered to give notice.
