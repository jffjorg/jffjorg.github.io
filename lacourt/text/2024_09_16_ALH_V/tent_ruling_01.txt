BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Nicholas Slaick filed
the complaint against defendant General Motors, LLC on June 23, 2023 alleging
violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiff alleges he
purchased a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado (subject vehicle) on or about January
2021. And that the subject vehicle has suffered from nonconformities to
warranty to the transmission, valve body, TCM, and other effects within the
applicable express warranty period.
On March 28, 2024, the court
ordered defendant’s Person Most Qualified to appear for deposition with the
production of documents as set forth in plaintiff’s Third Amended Notice of
Deposition within 45 days of the date of notice of the order.
Plaintiff filed the instant
motion on May 22, 2024. No opposition has been filed.
LEGAL STANDARD
If a “party or party-affiliated
deponent . . . fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and
production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that party deponent
or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(h).)
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, misuses of the discovery process that are subject to
sanctions include but are not limited to disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(g).)
“The court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.
. . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(a).)
“The court may impose an issue
sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the
action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030(b).)
“The court may impose an
evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(c).)
“The court may impose a
terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1) An order striking out
the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process. (2) An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed. (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party. (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff moves for an order
for evidence, issue, terminating, and/or monetary sanctions pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, 2023.030(a)-(d), and 2025.450(h).
Plaintiff requests that the
court prevent defendant from calling witnesses at trial whom it refuses to
produce at deposition; or an order that plaintiff’s claims have been proven and
limiting the issues at trial to the question of damages; or striking defendant’s
answer and rendering judgment by default against defendant based upon the
persistent failure to comply with authorized methods of discovery as well as
the court’s March 28, 2024 Order. Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions of
$2,250.00 based on the necessity of the instant motion and an additional
$500/day for which defendant violated the court’s March 28, 2024 Order.
Plaintiff states that on April
4, 2024, pursuant to the court’s March 28, 2024 Order (Order), plaintiff served
defendant a Notice of Ruling via email with an attached copy of the Order
granting plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of defendant’s PMQ. (Decl.
of Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 7; Exh. 3.) According to the Plaintiff noticed the
deposition for April 24, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Defendant objected to the fourth
amended notice of deposition of defendant’s PMQ with production of documents
because, among other things, it was unilaterally noticed without consulting
with opposing counsel for deponent’s availability. (Decl. of Christopher R.
Hunt, ¶ 8; Exh. 4.) Defendant stated it would produce a witness at a mutually
convenient time and place in compliance with the court’s Order. (Decl. of
Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 8; Exh. 4.) On April 17, 2024, plaintiff requested that
defendant confirm a deposition date within the court-ordered deadline. (Decl.
of Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 9; Exh. 5.) Plaintiff served a fifth amended
notice of defendant’s
deposition on April 22, 2024, after defendant did not respond. (Decl. of
Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 10; Exh. 6.) On May 3, 2024, defendant served objections
to the fifth amended notice and once again objected to it because it was unilaterally
noticed without consulting opposing counsel for deponent to determine
availability but stated it would produce a witness at a mutually convenient
time and place in compliance with the Order. (Decl. of Christopher R. Hunt, ¶
11; Exh. 7.) On May 3, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel called defendant’s counsel,
left a message, and wrote to defendant’s counsel asking them to confirm a
deposition date in compliance with the court ordered deadline. (Decl. of
Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 12; Exh. 8.) Plaintiff contends that defendant violated
the court’s Order by failing to appear for a PMQ deposition by the May 21,
2024, deadline. (Decl. of Christopher R. Hunt, ¶ 13.)
Plaintiff argues that the PMQ
testimony is necessary to show that defendant’s conduct was willful in refusing
his request to repurchase the subject vehicle. The PMQ testimony would allow
plaintiff to determine why defendant refused to repurchase or replace the
subject vehicle.
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, misuses of the discovery process that are subject to
sanctions include but are not limited to disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(g).) While it is understandable that
defendant would object to the dates that were unilaterally noticed without
input as to availability of the PMQ witness, defendant’s refusal to provide
available dates after the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel is not.
Defendant failed to produce its PMQ for deposition and to produce the documents
ordered per the March 28, 2024 Order. The court finds good cause to grant
plaintiff’s request that defendant be precluded from calling its PMQ at trial
since it refused to produce the witness at a deposition.
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, the court may also impose a monetary sanction for the misuse
of the discovery process and order the party to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone because of that party’s
misconduct. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).) The court finds defendant’s
misconduct warrants monetary
sanctions for the cost of
bringing the instant motion are warranted. The court orders defendant General
Motors, LLC to pay sanctions of $1,125.00 (3 hours at $375/hr.) payable to
plaintiff by September 26, 2024.
Plaintiff also seeks $500/day
for each day that defendant violated the Order and argues that such sanctions
have been awarded against defendant in a different case with similar
circumstances. At this time the court declines to award additional sanctions.
The court also declines to
order issue or terminating sanctions because it finds that the evidence and
monetary sanctions are sufficient to address defendant’s misconduct and
plaintiff has not shown that defendant’s misconduct in this case warrants more severe
sanctions. Terminating sanctions are to be used “sparingly because of the
drastic effect of their application.” (Department of Forestry & Fire
Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191.) The imposition of
terminating sanctions may be imposed “as a first measure in extreme cases, or
where the record shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Id. at
191–192.) Here, plaintiff has not shown that the lesser sanctions of the
evidence sanctions would be ineffective.
Based on the foregoing, the
court GRANTS the plaintiff’s motion for monetary and evidentiary sanctions.
The court awards sanctions
against defendant in the amount of $1,125.00, payable to plaintiff by September
26, 2024.
