```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration as to the claims for sexual harassment and discrimination, but grants the motion as to the remaining claims. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish any defenses to enforcement. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to its adhesion contract nature, but this does not render the agreement unconscionable. The court also finds that the agreement is enforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFASASHA), as the claims for sexual harassment and discrimination arose prior to the effective date of the Act.
