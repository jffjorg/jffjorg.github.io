  Case Number:  23PSCV00469    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Arvest Bank dba Arvest Equipment Finance’s Request for Entry of Default
Judgment 
Defendants: Little Fat Trucking, Xing Wang 
COURT RULING
The Court DENIES the request for
entry of default judgment without prejudice. 
BACKGROUND
This is
a breach of contract case. On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff Arvest Bank dba
Arvest Equipment Finance (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Little
Fat Trucking and Xing Wang (collectively, Defendants), alleging causes of
action for breach of contract x 2, claim and delivery, conversion, breach of guaranty
x 2, and money lent x 2. Default was entered against Little Fat Trucking on
April 19, 2023 and against Xing Wang on June 30, 2023. Following the Court’s
denial of Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment without prejudice
on October 18, 2023, Plaintiff resubmitted a request for entry of default
judgment on March 11, 2024.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has filed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $232,051.83,
including $203,030.34 in damages, $24,492.69 in interest, $3,920.30 in attorney
fees, and $608.50 in costs. The Court still finds Plaintiff’s request for entry
of default judgment contains some issues that need to be addressed. First, Plaintiff’s
damage calculations do not properly account for the $84,100.00 credit
acknowledgment derived from Plaintiff’s sale of the various items of collateral
under the subject loan agreements. $251,766.10, i.e., the principal amount of
damages demanded in the complaint, less the $84,100.00 credit acknowledgment
equals $167,666.10, not the $203,030.34 that Plaintiff lists on item 2,
subdivision (a), of Form CIV-100. (Request for Entry of Default, ¶ 2, subd.
(a).) Plaintiff has therefore overstated its damage request by $48,735.76. This
also means Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees is overstated. (See Silverman
Decl., ¶ 4; Local Rule 3.214.) 
Second, the
Court also notes that Plaintiff’s principal damage demand in the complaint
should have been lower, given that Plaintiff sold one of the items of
collateral on January 17, 2023 for $31,000.00, i.e., one month before Plaintiff
filed the complaint on February 16, 2023. (Dorsey Decl., ¶ 17.) While Plaintiff
appears to have accounted for this difference with the $84,100.00 credit
acknowledgment, the collateral sale should have been included in the complaint. 
Third, as noted
before, the subject loan agreements are governed by the laws of the State of
Arkansas. (Dorsey Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 15; Id., Ex. G, ¶ 15.) It is unclear
if the contractual interest rate in the applicable loan agreements, i.e., 7.74%
and 7.23%, comply with Arkansas usury laws. (See Dorsey Decl., Exs. A, G.) If
they are, the Court requests Plaintiff to provide the relevant legal
authorities. 
Finally, the
default judgment package still does not comply with Rule 3.1806, as Plaintiff did
not provide the original loan agreements or a declaration explaining why the
originals could not be produced. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda’s
Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1123.) 
CONCLUSION 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment
without prejudice.
