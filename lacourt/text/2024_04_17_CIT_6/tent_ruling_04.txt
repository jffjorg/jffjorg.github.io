PNC Bank’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants:  Household
Consulting Group Inc., Denise G. Gallego 
TENTATIVE RULING
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an action for breach of contract and common counts in connection with a bank
loan. On November 30, 2023, plaintiff PNC Bank, National Association, successor
by merger from Compass Bank (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants
Householding Consulting Group Inc. (Household), Denise G. Gallego (Gallego)
(collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action
for breach of loan agreement, breach of guaranty, money lent, and account
stated. 
            On
January 31, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. On April 3, 2024,
Plaintiff submitted a request for entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits
as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by
the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $231,210.97,
including $200,000 in damages, $1,410.69 in late charges, $25,302.78 in
interest, $3,890.00 in attorney fees, and $607.50 in costs. The Court finds a
few problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. First, Plaintiff’s
late charges do not match the amount alleged in the complaint. The complaint
alleges a late charge of $1,010.69, (Compl., ¶¶ 20-21; Id., Prayer for
Relief, ¶ 3), but Plaintiff requests $1,410.69 in the default judgment package,
(CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (b)(1); JUD-100, ¶ 6, subd. (a)(2).) Plaintiff’s default
judgment request exceeds the amount of damages demanded in the complaint, which
the Court cannot grant. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (a).) 
Second,
Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation is lacking in detail, as it does
not provide the start date of the calculation. (See Summary of Case, p. 5, ¶ 2;
Mascia Decl., p. 5, ¶ 2.) The Court also notes that the laws of the State of
Delaware govern the underlying loan agreement and guaranty. (Compl., Ex. 1, p.
24 of pdf, ¶ 10.16; Id., Ex. 1, p. 34 of pdf, ¶ 17; Id., Ex. 2, p.
48 of pdf, ¶ 20.) This means the laws of the State of Delaware govern the
prejudgment interest determination here. (Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data
Recovery Technologies Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1014.)[1] Alternatively, if this were
under California law, there would be a problem with the 16.8% default interest
rate exceeding the maximum legal interest rate of 10%. (See Civ. Code § 3289,
subd. (b).) Either way, Plaintiff needs to provide greater detail regarding the
prejudgment interest rate it seeks here for the Court to properly assess the
amount requested. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) 
Third,
it is unclear to the Court if Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney’s fees here
as to Defendant Household. The Court could not find an attorney’s fees
provision in the original loan agreement or reinstated loan agreement between
Plaintiff and Defendant Household. (See Compl., Ex. 1.) The guaranties on the
other hand do contain attorney’s fees clauses. (See Compl., Ex. 2, p. 41 of
pdf; Id., p. 43 of pdf, ¶ 1, subd. (a).) It also appears to the Court
that the maximum Plaintiff would be entitled to recover in attorney’s fees here
would be $1200.00. Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (b), provides that
the attorney’s fees recoverable in connection with a claim for common counts is
the lesser of $1200.00 or the amount available under a local fee schedule,
which would be Local Rule 3.214 in this case. (Civ. Code, § 1717.5, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff’s calculation under Local Rule 3.214 exceeds the $1200.00 permitted
under Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (b). (Mascia Decl., 5:4-14.) 
CONCLUSION
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
