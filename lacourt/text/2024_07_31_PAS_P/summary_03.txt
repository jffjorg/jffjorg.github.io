And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admission admitted because the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests. The judge orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant $802.50 in sanctions for the defendant's time spent drafting the unopposed motion and attending the hearing. The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests is a serious issue and that the court must impose sanctions to deter such behavior. The judge also reminds the parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.
