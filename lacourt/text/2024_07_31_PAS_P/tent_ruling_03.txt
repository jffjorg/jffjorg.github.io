 Case Number:  23AHCV02873    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDERI.
INTRODUCTION
           On December 12,
2023, Plaintiff Collean Taylor-Drennen filed the complaint against Defendants HSR
San Pasqual, LP; Joseph Penner; Bob Daignault; and DOES 1 to 50. The complaint
alleges negligence and premises liability. 
          On July 5, 2024, Defendant HSR San Pasqual, LP filed the
instant motion. As of July 26, 2024, no opposition has been filed. However, counsel
for Plaintiff, Erik Harper, filed a declaration on July 26, 2024, in which he
indicated that discovery responses have now been provided.  However, the Court must confess some
confusion regarding that declaration and the attached exhibits.  Plaintiff attached a document entitled “Supplemental
Responses to Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One” as evidence of Plaintiff’s
compliance.  However, that document is
from a different case involving Defendant Robert B. Whitehill with case number
23AHCV01807 (also premises liability, dismissed October 2023).  The Court assumes, and hopes, that this conundrum
will be cleared up at oral argument.  Given
this uncertainty, the Court issues this tentative granting Defendant’s motion.
 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
If a
party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). (b) The requesting party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) provides: “It is mandatory that the
court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” Additionally,
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 authorizes the imposition
of sanctions where a party misused the discovery process, which includes
“(f)ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d). It also authorizes sanctions where a party fails
to meet and confer. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(i).
III. DISCUSSION
A. Requests for Admission 
On
February 4, 2024, Defendants served on Plaintiff four sets of written discovery,
including a set of Requests for Admissions. The requests were calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and direct evidence, relating to
the claims in this lawsuit, including liability and damages. (Safarian Decl., ¶
2). On June 13, 2024, Defendants’ Counsel attempted to meet and confer through
email regarding Plaintiff’s responses to the first set of written discovery and
proposed a deadline of June 20, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel
responded seeking a further deadline of July 11, 2024, and the deadline was
extended to the end of June 2024. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-5.) To date, Plaintiff
has not provided any responses. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Therefore, the Court
grants the motion. Requests for Admission, Set One are deemed admitted.  
 
B. Monetary Sanctions
Defendant
requests the Court order sanctions in the amount of $3,960 against Plaintiff,
to be paid to Defendant HSR San Pasqual, LP, within 20 days.
          The Court finds sanctions are warranted. Nevertheless, the
amount sought is excessive because the motion is simple and unopposed.
Therefore, the Court reduces the amount to $802.50 for 1.0 hour drafting the
unopposed motion and 0.5 hour attending the hearing, at a rate of $495.00 plus
the $60.00 filing fee. 
           The Court reminds
parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal
judicial intervention. (See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.
Superior Ct. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 331; Clement v. Alegre
(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1291-1292.) 
IV.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
          The Court grants the motion. Requests for Admission, Set
One are deemed admitted. Plaintiff is ordered to pay Defendant HSR San Pasqual,
LP the amount of $802.50 within 30 days of this order.
