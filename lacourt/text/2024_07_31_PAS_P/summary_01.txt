And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to have the plaintiff, Hong Gan, declared a vexatious litigant. The court finds that Hong Gan has filed multiple lawsuits in propria persona that have been determined adversely to her, and has repeatedly attempted to litigate the same claims against the defendant. The court agrees with the defendant that Hong Gan meets the criteria for being declared a vexatious litigant under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 391 and 391.7. As a result, the court grants the defendant's request to enter a prefiling order, which prohibits Hong Gan from filing any new litigation in the courts of California in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.
