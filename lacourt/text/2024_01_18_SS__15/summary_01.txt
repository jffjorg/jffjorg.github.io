And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion for summary adjudication of the ninth and twenty-ninth affirmative defenses alleged by the Defendant, Squires-Belt Material Company. The Judge finds that the ninth affirmative defense, alleging alteration or misuse of products, is vague and impossible to understand due to the lack of specific information provided by the Defendant. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's discovery responses are factually devoid and do not meet the burden of providing evidence to support the affirmative defense.

Regarding the twenty-ninth affirmative defense, alleging intervening or superseding causes, the Judge finds that the Defendant's arguments are vague and not supported by the evidence. The Judge concludes that the Defendant did not submit evidence showing a disputed issue concerning the affirmative defense and grants the motion.

The Judge also denies the Defendant's request for a continuance and additional discovery, as the Defendant failed to provide an affidavit explaining the facts essential to justify opposition.
