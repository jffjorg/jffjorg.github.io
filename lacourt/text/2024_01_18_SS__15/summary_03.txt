And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions regarding the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. The court finds that Defendant is not subject to California's general jurisdiction, as it is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Connecticut.

The court also finds that Plaintiff has not yet demonstrated that Defendant's talc was in the specific product, Sherwin-Williams paint, to which Plaintiff was exposed. However, Plaintiff has requested jurisdictional discovery to obtain evidence to support this allegation, and Defendant does not oppose this request.

Therefore, the motion is continued to April 17, 2024, for discovery on the contents of the type of Sherwin-Williams paint to which Plaintiff was exposed during the period of his exposure. The parties are permitted to file supplemental opposition and reply briefs based on regular notice.
