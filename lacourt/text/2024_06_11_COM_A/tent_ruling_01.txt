[TENTATIVE] ORDER
CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
            On April 23,
2024, the court initially considered the Petition filed on February
 29, 2024 by Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey, by and through Keonee Young, to
change name to Jovan Kiro Young-Lambey to add his father’s surname. Proof
of publication of the order to show cause was filed April 11, 2024. 
            The court
continued the hearing since only one parent consented to the name change. Petitioner
was ordered to serve the other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30
days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The record does not
reflect that service on the non-consenting parent of the Order to Show Cause
was accomplished. 
Accordingly, the Court continues
the hearing for a second time to July 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with the court’s order of
April 23, 2024. the foregoing requirements prior to the hearing.
