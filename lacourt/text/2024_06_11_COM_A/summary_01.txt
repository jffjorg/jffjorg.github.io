And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the petition for change of name from Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey to Jovan Kiro Young-Lambey to add his father's surname. The court initially considered the petition on April 23, 2024, but continued the hearing since only one parent consented to the name change and the non-consenting parent was not served with the Order to Show Cause. The court orders the petitioner to serve the non-consenting parent at least 30 days before the hearing and to comply with the court's order prior to the rescheduled hearing on July 16, 2024.
