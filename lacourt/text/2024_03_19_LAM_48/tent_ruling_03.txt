[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  FOR FINANCIAL DISCOVERY 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 19, 2024



 
On December 3, 2020, Plaintiff
Maria Luisa Barajas Gascon filed this action against Defendants Angela Yolanda Diaz
and Angela Diaz.  Trial is scheduled for April
22, 2024, bifurcated into two phases: Phase One for liability and Phase Two for
punitive damages.
On
February 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to allow discovery of Defendants’ financial
conditions to support punitive damages.  
“An award of punitive damages hinges on three factors:
the reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct; the reasonableness of the relationship
between the award and the plaintiff’s harm; and, in view of the defendant’s financial
condition, the amount necessary to punish him or her and discourage future wrongful
conduct.”  (Kelly v. Haag (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 910, 914.)
A plaintiff may not conduct pretrial financial discovery
without a court order.  (Civ. Code, § 3295.)  The court may issue an order permitting pretrial
financial discovery if the plaintiff has established, based on supporting and opposing
affidavits, that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail
on the claim.  (Civ. Code, § 3295, subd. (c).)  “[A] ‘substantial probability’ of prevailing on
a claim for punitive damages means that it is ‘very likely’ that the plaintiff will
prevail on such a claim or there is ‘a strong likelihood’ that the plaintiff will
prevail on such a claim.”  (Kerner v. Superior
Court (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 84, 120.)
The
Complaint alleges fraud and financial elder abuse in connection with the transfer
of property and the deprivation of Plaintiff’s life estate.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 21-35.)  The parties provide the same declarations that
were provided for Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  The Court similarly refers to its order on that
motion to find that Plaintiff has shown a substantial probability of prevailing on her claims for which punitive
damages may be awarded.  (See 06/12/2023
Order at pp. 4-6)
Moreover,
the Court may order a defendant to produce evidence of his or her financial condition
following a determination of liability for punitive damages even if the plaintiff
has not attempted to obtain that information prior to trial.  (StreetScenes v. ITC Entertainment Group, Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 233, 243-244.)  Should
the jury find Defendants liable on Plaintiff’s claims in Phase One, the Court would
inevitably order Defendants to produce financial evidence for Phase Two.
The
motion for financial discovery is GRANTED.
Plaintiff
provides copies of the proposed discovery requests.  (Motion, Exs. P-Q.)  Plaintiff is ordered to immediately serve these
requests on Defendants.  Defendants are ordered
to provide complete responses within 14 days of receipt.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
