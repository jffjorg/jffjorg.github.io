[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 19, 2024



 
On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff
Jose Octavio Diaz Munoz filed this action against Defendant General Motors LLC arising
from Plaintiff’s purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
November 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses.
MOTION DEFICIENCIES
For
a motion to compel further, Plaintiff must meet and confer with Defendant and file
a Separate Statement or follow the Court’s alternative method of outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b); California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department
requires the parties to follow the procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department
48’s Courtroom Information (available on the Court’s website) and file a joint statement.
The
parties did not follow Department 48’s procedures for a joint statement.
DISCUSSION
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
Plaintiff
seeks further responses to RFP Nos. 13-16 and 34-35.  These RFPs request documents involving Defendant’s
repurchases of the same vehicle with the same defects, owner complaints about the
same defects in the same vehicle, technical service bulletins issued for the same
vehicle, and recalls issued for the same vehicle.  These requests are limited to the same defects
and vehicle alleged by Plaintiff, and they are relevant to Defendant’s knowledge
and willfulness.  
For
some RFPs, Defendant provided only objections. 
For other RFPs, Defendant stated that it would “comply in part” and produce
selected documents.  Defendant’s objections
are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
The
motion is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to
provide verified, supplemental responses within 30 days.
The
requests for sanctions are DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
