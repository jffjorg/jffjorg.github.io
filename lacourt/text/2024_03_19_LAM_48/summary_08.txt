Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant's motion to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of similar PAGA actions. The Judge agrees that litigating the representative claims while arbitrating individual claims could lead to inconsistent rulings and duplicative discovery. The three cases allege the same violations, and the two earlier cases cover the same time period as this case. The witnesses and evidence are likely to be substantially the same. Therefore, a stay is appropriate to minimize the risk of inconsistent verdicts and in the interests of judicial economy.
