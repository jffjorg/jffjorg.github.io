And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Court has ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses to certain interrogatories, including Special Rog No. 2, which asks for a description of the actions taken by each individual during the surgery, and Special Rog Nos. 4-18, which ask for various pieces of information about the medical care and surgery provided to the plaintiff. The Court has also ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses to certain interrogatories, including Special Rog No. 2, which asks for a description of the actions taken by each individual during the surgery, and Special Rog Nos. 4-18, which ask for various pieces of information about the medical care and surgery provided to the plaintiff.

The Court has denied the motion for Special Rog No. 7, which asks for the date and location of every parathyroidectomy performed by the defendant within the past 20 years, and Special Rog No. 14, which asks for the duration of the surgery. The Court has also denied the motion in respect to Request for Admissions – Set One, which is duplicative of a previous motion filed by the plaintiff.

The Court has warned the parties that future failures to comply with the court's procedures may result in motions being denied and/or monetary or other sanctions. The parties are ordered to file separate motions for each discovery request and to comply with the court's electronic filing requirements.
