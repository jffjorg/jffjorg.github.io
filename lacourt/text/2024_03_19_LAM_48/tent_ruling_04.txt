  CASE NO.: 21STCV05853
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
  TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S COMPLIANCE WITH DISCOVERY ORDER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 19, 2024



 
On February 16, 2021, Plaintiffs
Jose Carranza and Suzette Carranza filed this action against Defendant General Motors
LLC for breach of warranties arising from the purchase of an allegedly defective
vehicle.
On
September 7, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition
of Defendant’s PMK, requiring compliance within 14 days.
On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Defendant’s compliance with
the Court’s September 7, 2023 order.  Defendant
did not oppose the motion.
Plaintiffs
“request that this Court compel GM to fully comply with the Discovery Order within
five calendar days of the Court’s compliance order,” and they request prospective
monetary sanctions of $500 per day until Defendant complies.  (Motion at pp. 1-2; Stoliker Decl. ¶ 8.)
The
Court has already ordered Defendant to produce its PMK and documents for deposition
and sees no need to repeat its order.  The
Court also does not believe that daily monetary sanctions are appropriate.  Disobedience of discovery orders can and should
result in monetary sanctions sufficient to put the other party where they would
have been if they did not have to bring discovery motions.  To the extent Defendant is shown to still be out
of compliance with the Court’s discovery orders at the Final Status Conference or
at the commencement of trial, the Court would be inclined to impose evidentiary
preclusion or issue sanctions on Defendants. 
Alternatively, Plaintiffs may move for other non-monetary discovery sanctions
before trial.
The
motion is DENIED without prejudice to Plaintiffs bringing a different motion seeking
appropriate sanctions.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
