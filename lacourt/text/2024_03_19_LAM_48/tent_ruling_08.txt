[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR STAY
  OF PROCEEDINGS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 19, 2024



 
On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff Joshua Relles filed this
representative action against Defendant MHC Property Management, L.P. for civil
penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”).  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to correctly
and timely pay employees, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay
premiums for meal and rest periods, failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements,
failed to reimburse expenses, and failed to maintain accurate records.
On February 26, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion for a stay of proceedings pending the resolution of two other similar
PAGA actions.
Defendant’s requests for judicial notice
are granted.

When
nearly identical actions are in courts of different jurisdictions, the court in
the second action may, in its discretion and as a matter of comity, stay that action
pending decision in the first action.  (Thomson
v. Continental Ins. Co. (1967) 66 Cal.2d 738, 746 (Thomson); Mave Enterprises, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity
Co. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1408, 1423; Gregg v. Superior Court (1987)
194 Cal.App.3d 134, 136; Simmons v. Superior Court (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 119,
123-124.)  In doing so, the court should consider
“‘the importance of discouraging multiple litigation designed solely to harass an
adverse party, and of avoiding unseemly conflicts with the courts of other jurisdictions.  It should also consider whether the rights of
the parties can best be determined by the court of the other jurisdiction because
of the nature of the subject matter, the availability of witnesses, or the stage
to which the proceedings in the other court have already advanced.’  [Citation.]” 
(Thomson, supra, 66 Cal.2d 738, 746-747.)
“Under
the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when two California superior courts
have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved in
litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction
over the subject matter and all parties involved until such time as all necessarily
related matters have been resolved.  The rule
is based upon the public policies of avoiding conflicts that might arise between
courts if they were free to make contradictory decisions or awards relating to the
same controversy, and preventing vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.”  (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan,
Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-770 (Garamendi).)
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant has waived the issue of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction
because it did not demur or raise the issue in its answer.  (Opposition at pp. 8-9.)  However, Defendant may request a stay “by demurrer
or answer or by motion to dismiss, stay or transfer.”  (Garamendi, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at p.
774.)
On
May 26, 2022, Kristin Strawbuck, filed a class action complaint against Defendant’s
parent company Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc (“ELS”) and “Doe Defendants” in
Santa Clara County, and on August 3, 2022, she filed an amended complaint for PAGA
penalties (Case No. 22CV398628).  (Motion
at pp. 6-7; Itter Decl. ¶ 4; Lawson Decl., Ex. 1.)  The applicable statutory period governing Strawbuck’s
PAGA action is May 30, 2021, through the present.  (Motion at p. 7.)
On
September 29, 2023, Allisia Glenn filed a class action and PAGA action against Defendant
in Sonoma County (Case No. 23CV00790).  (Motion
at pp. 7-8; Lawson Decl., Ex. 4.)  The applicable
statutory period governing Glenn’s PAGA action is July 26, 2022, through the present.  (Motion at p. 8.)
Both
the Strawbuck and Glenn actions cover the same applicable statutory
period as Plaintiff’s PAGA action.  They allege
the same Labor Code violations premised on the same conduct.  (See Motion at pp. 11-12.)  Plaintiff argues that Defendant is not a defendant
in the Strawbuck action.  However,
Strawbuck was actually an employee of Defendant, and that action alleges a joint
employer.  (Motion at p. 7, fn. 1; Itter Decl.
¶ 6; Reply at pp. 5-6.)
Additionally,
Plaintiff is arbitrating his individual claims. 
The Court agrees that litigating the representative claims while arbitrating
individual claims could lead to inconsistent rulings and duplicative discovery.  (See Motion at pp. 12-13.)
These
three cases allege the same violations, and the two earlier cases cover the same
time period as this case.  The witnesses and
evidence are likely to be substantially the same.  Therefore, a stay is appropriate, whether as a
matter of abatement or under the Court’s discretion to minimize the risk of inconsistent
verdicts and in the interests of judicial economy.
The
motion is GRANTED.  This action is STAYED pending completion of the
Strawbuck and Glenn actions, and pending the completion of Plaintiff’s
individual arbitration.
A
Status Conference Re: Other PAGA Litigation/Arbitration is scheduled for 03/20/2025
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
