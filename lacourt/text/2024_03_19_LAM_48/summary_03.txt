The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for financial discovery, allowing the plaintiff to discover the defendants' financial condition to support punitive damages. The plaintiff has shown a substantial probability of prevailing on her claims for which punitive damages may be awarded. The defendants' financial condition is relevant to determining the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded. The court notes that the parties have previously submitted declarations in support of the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and that the plaintiff has shown a substantial probability of prevailing on her claims. The court has granted the motion for financial discovery and ordered the plaintiff to serve the proposed discovery requests on the defendants within 14 days.
