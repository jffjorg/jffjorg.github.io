And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court is considering a motion to dismiss representative PAGA claims brought by Lincoln Training Center and Rehabilitation Workshop. The motion is based on a declaration from Ellis Cooper, the representative for the Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), stating that he no longer wishes to pursue representative PAGA claims and has reached a resolution on his individual claims against the Defendant. The Court notes that while Cooper may no longer wish to pursue these claims, notice to the LWDA would still be necessary. The Court is inclined to continue the motion for a period of two months and order the Defendant to serve the motion and the Court's tentative ruling on the LWDA. If the LWDA takes no action in response to notice, the Court is inclined to grant the motion and dismiss the action. The Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is also continued to April 12, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
