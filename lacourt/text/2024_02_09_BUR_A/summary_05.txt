Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff Abimelec Burgos' motion to compel compliance with GM's supplemental production of documents. The Court finds that GM's production was sufficient and that Plaintiff's arguments do not speak to the grounds on which it claims to have brought the motion. The Court also notes that motions to compel further responses must be served within 45 days after service of a verified response, and that Plaintiff's motion was served well after that deadline. The Court encourages the parties to stipulate to the appointment of a discovery referee to more quickly and efficiently address their needs.
