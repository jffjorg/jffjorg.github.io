And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motions to compel initial responses to its Request for Production (RFPD) Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One are denied as moot. The judge has previously granted two motions to compel further responses regarding these discovery demands, and it stands to reason that the motions to compel initial responses are no longer necessary. The judge orders the defendant to give notice to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff to give notice to all other parties.
