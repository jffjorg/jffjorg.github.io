ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Yuqin Liu
(“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Beverly
Hills New Life Medical Group, LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant negligently administered derma filler injections which resulted in
personal injury. 
 
Before the Court are two
motions brought by Defendant. Defendant moves to compel initial responses to its
Request for Production (RFPD) Set One and
Special Interrogatories Set One. Defendant filed
these motions on October 2, 2023. Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to these
motions. 
 
On
January 5, 2024, the Court heard a motion brought by Defendant to compel further
responses to its RFPD Set One. The motion was unopposed, and the Court granted
the motion. As part of this motion, Defendant
submitted a declaration which stated that Plaintiff
served her responses to RFPD Set One on November 16, 2023.
 
On
January 26, 2024, the Court a motion brought by Defendant to compel further
responses to its Special
Interrogatories Set One. The motion was unopposed,
and the Court granted the motion. As part of this motion, Defendant
submitted a declaration which stated that Plaintiff
served her responses to Special Interrogatories Set One on October 23, 2023.
 
As the
Court has already granted two motions to compel further responses
regarding RFPD Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One, it stands to reason
that the motions to compel initial responses to those same discovery demands
are moot. Accordingly, Defendants motions are denied as MOOT.
