Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Art & Son Construction, Inc. (A&SC), has brought a motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached in mediation. The plaintiff, BMBG Investments, LLC, had accepted the mediator's proposal via email, but later declined to sign the settlement agreement. A&SC argues that the email acceptance of the mediator's proposal constitutes a binding agreement under California Civil Procedure Code §664.6. The plaintiff argues that the agreement is contingent on the drafting of a written settlement agreement, which was not completed.

The court finds that the plaintiff's email acceptance of the mediator's proposal constitutes an electronic signature and a binding agreement. The court also finds that there is no evidence that any critical terms were omitted from the mediator's proposal. The court grants the defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders the defendant to give notice to the plaintiff.
