TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
“The initial complaint alleged causes of action for declaratory relief,
violation of the Unfair Competition Law (‘UCL’), and violation of the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act (‘CLRA’).”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 12/10/20, Judge Ann Jones granted Plaintiff’s first motion for class
certification as to all three causes of action.”  (Ibid.) 

 
“On 4/27/21, Judge Jones denied Cedars-Sinai’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings.”  (Ibid.)
 
“Then Cedars-Sinai filed a petition for writ of mandate, which the Court
of Appeal denied.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 4/18/22, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file the
first amended complaint (‘FAC’), adding a cause of action for breach of
contract.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 5/20/22, Cedars-Sinai demurred to the FAC.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 6/16/22, the Court overruled the demurrer as to [the] breach of
contract and declaratory relief causes of action and sustained it with leave to
amend as to the UCL and the CLRA causes of action.”  (Id. at p. 2.) 
 
“On 6/22/22, Plaintiff filed the [second amended complaint
(‘SAC’)].”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 7/22/22, Cedars-Sinai filed a demurrer to the SAC, challenging the
UCL and CLRA causes of action.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 8/16/22, the Court overruled the demurrer.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 9/30/22, Plaintiff filed a motion to certify the breach of contract
cause of action.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 2/14/23, the Court heard the second motion for class
certification.”  (11/30/23 Ruling Re:
Motion for Protective Order, p. 2.)  “The
Court tentatively granted the motion but continued the hearing for supplemental
briefing on ‘the feasibility of applying Plaintiff’s damages formula to
all putative class members.’”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 3/10/23 and 3/17/23, the parties filed their supplemental briefs.”
(5/30/23 Ruling Re: Supplemental Briefs Re: Second Motion for Class
Certification, p. 2.)
 
“On 5/30/23, the Court
‘certif[ied] the contract class as an issue class as to liability’ but denied
certification of a damages class.” 
(2/9/24 Order Re: Transcript and Supplemental Briefing Re: Motion to
Amend or Modify, p. 1.)  “The Court found . . . that Plaintiff’s
damages formula works but that she failed to show that it could be utilized on
a class-wide basis in a feasible and manageable manner.”  (Ibid.) 
“The Court made the ruling ‘without prejudice[,]’ granting Plaintiff
leave to file ‘a renewed motion to certify the damages class’ in the
future.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 9/11/23, Cedars-Sinai served Plaintiff’s counsel with deposition
notices and subpoenas for 57 absent class members.”  (11/30/23 Ruling Re: Motion for Protective
Order, p. 2.)
 
“On 9/13/23, the Court held a discovery conference regarding
Cedars-Sinai’s deposition notices and subpoenas.”  (Ibid.) 
“In part, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request to file a motion for
protective order.”  (Ibid., footnote omitted.)
 
“On 10/4/23, Plaintiff filed her motion.” 
(Ibid.)
 
“On 11/30/23, the
Court heard Plaintiff’s motion and granted it without prejudice.”  (8/26/24 Ruling Re: Motion Re: Permissible
Scope of Discovery, p. 2.)  “Notably, the
Court indicated that Defendant would be provided an opportunity to re-request
the depositions after the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to amend or modify the
5/30/23 certification order, which Plaintiff filed in February 2024.”
 
“On 2/8/24, Plaintiff’s motion to
amend or modify . . . came on for hearing.” 
(2/9/24 Order Re: Transcript and Supplemental Briefing Re: Motion to
Amend or Modify, p. 1.)  “Plaintiff
argued that the denial of certification of a damages class should be reversed
because ‘Defendant’s recent discovery
responses demonstrate that it is feasible and manageable to apply the damages
formula on a class-wide basis[.]’” (Ibid.) 
The Court continued the matter for supplemental briefing.  (See id. at p. 2.)
 
“On 3/26/24, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion without prejudice[,]” finding that Plaintiff failed to establish a basis for changing the
contract class from an issue class to a normal, damages-included class.  (8/26/24 Ruling Re: Motion Re: Permissible Scope of Discovery,
p. 3; see also 3/26/24 Minute
Order, pp. 1-2.)
 
Now, Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication of the contract claim.
 
LAW
 
When a plaintiff moves for
summary adjudication, “the burden is to produce admissible evidence of each
element of a ‘cause of action’ entitling him or her to judgment.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 10:233,
emphasis added.)  “This means that plaintiffs who bear the burden of
proof at trial by a preponderance of evidence must produce evidence
that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material
fact more likely
than not.”  (Ibid., emphasis in
original.)  “[O]therwise, he would not be entitled
to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Ibid., emphasis in original.) 
 
“Defendant has no evidentiary burden until
plaintiff produces admissible (and undisputed) evidence on each element of
a cause of action.”  (Id. at ¶ 10:238,
emphasis in original.)  “Until that time,
plaintiff has not met its burden of producing evidence [citation], and
defendant therefore has no burden to oppose.” 
(Ibid.)  
 
Once the initial burden is met, “the burden shifts to
defendant . . . ‘to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.’”  (Id. at ¶ 10:233.)
 
Importantly, “[a] motion for
summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause
of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
 
Plaintiff contends summary adjudication should be granted because:
 
* Plaintiff and all members of the contract class entered into Conditions
of Admission (“COA”) contracts (see Motion, pp. 11-12);
 
* the COAs are contracts of adhesion and contain the same language (see
id. at p. 12);
 
* “[t]he COA[s] . . . only allow[] Defendant to charge . . . for services
actually rendered” (ibid.; see also id. at pp. 13-15);
 
* instead of covering services rendered, ER Visitation fees “cover the
operational, overhead, and administrative costs of running an emergency room”
(id. at p. 15; see also id. at pp. 16-17);
 
* “Defendant had a contractual duty not to charge ER Visitation Fees”
(id. at p. 17);
 
* charging the ER Visitation Fees breached the COAs (see id. at p. 18);
 
* overbilling is a recognized type of breach (see id. at pp. 18-19);
 
* Plaintiff and the contract class “were excused from performance as a
result of Defendant’s breach[es]” (id. at p. 19; see also id. at pp. 20-22);
and
 
* they suffered actual damages. 
(See id. at pp. 22-24.)
 
Defendant
 
Defendant claims:
 
* Plaintiff’s motion is procedurally flawed (see Opposition, pp. 8-10
[arguing that (1) the motion seeks “to adjudicate only the elements of duty and
breach, while leaving damages for another day[,]” and (2) it is “improper to grant
summary adjudication on an interpretation of a contractual ‘issue of duty’ that does not otherwise resolve the
entire contract claim”],
emphasis in original);
 
* triable issues exist (see id. at pp. 11-17 [contending (1) the
ambiguousness of the COAs creates a triable issue, (2) whether ER Visitation
Fees “are tied directly to services rendered” is a triable issue, and (3)
Defendant did not admit that ER Visitation Fees “are [] untethered to ‘services
rendered’”]);
 
* Plaintiff fails to show that she and the contract class were excused
from performance (see id. at pp. 17-18);
 
* the breach issue cannot be adjudicated (see id. at pp. 18-19); and
 
* Plaintiff does not establish damages. 
(Id. at p. 19.)
 
Alternatively, Defendant requests denial or a discovery continuance
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(h).  (See id. at pp. 19-21.)
 
Reply
 
In reply, Plaintiff asserts:
 
* the duty issue can be summarily adjudicated (see Reply, pp. 5-6 [citing
Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th
508 (“Linden”)]);
 
* the COA is unambiguous and can be interpreted as a matter of law (see
id. at pp. 6-8 [also claiming Defendant’s extrinsic evidence fails to support
Defendant’s interpretation]);
 
* “ER Visitation Fees are not fees for services rendered to individual
patients” (id. at p. 8; see also id. at p. 9);
 
* “Defendant’s ‘expert’ declaration . . . is incompetent and
inadmissible” (id. at p. 10; see also id. at p. 9);
 
* Defendant’s interpretation of “services rendered” fails to create a
triable issue (see id. at pp. 10-11);
 
* Plaintiff’s moving papers demonstrate that Plaintiff and the class were
excused from performance (see id. at pp. 11-12);
 
* if liability is bifurcated, the moving party does not need to show the
amount of damages (see id. at pp. 12-13); and
 
* the Court should deny Defendant’s section 437c(h) request.  (See id. at p. 13.)   
 
Analysis
 
The first issue is whether Plaintiff’s motion is procedurally
improper.  The answer is yes in part.  Plaintiff’s motion is made on two
grounds.  One, “there is no defense to
the . . . contract cause of action.” 
(Notice of Motion, p. 2; see also Plaintiff’s Sep. Statement, p. 2 [“no
defense” section].)  Two, “Defendant had
a contractual ‘duty’ not to charge ER Visitation Fees.”  (Notice of Motion, p. 2; see also Plaintiff’s
Sep. Statement, p. 10 [“duty” section].) 
The first ground cannot be utilized to procure summary adjudication
here.  
 
For the “no defense” ground, Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior
Court (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226 (“Paramount”) is
controlling.  A manufacturer of roofing
shingles brought a “no defense” motion against an asphalt supplier on the issue
of liability “but not on the issue of damages.” 
(Paramount, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 229.)  The burden of proof on a “no defense” motion
is to “prove[] each element of the cause of action[.]”  (Id. at 241.) 
Since “damages are an element of a breach of contract cause of action
[citation],” the Second District Court of Appeal held that the manufacturer
could not “obtain judgment on a breach of contract cause of action in an amount
of damages to be determined later.” 
(Ibid. [holding that a plaintiff cannot “seek summary adjudication of
liability only, leaving the resolution of damages to a later trial”]; see also
Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 10:33 [advising that, “when the damages amount
is disputed, [a] plaintiff cannot obtain summary adjudication on the liability
issue and leave the damages issue for resolution at trial”].)  In the instant case, similarly, liability has
been bifurcated (see 3/26/24 Minute Order, pp. 1-2 [denying certification as to
damages, bifurcating liability, and agreeing to try liability first], and
Plaintiff fails to prove the class members’ damages amounts, whether actual
damages or nominal damages.  (See Motion,
pp. 22-24; see also Plaintiff’s Sep. Statement, Undisputed Material Fact
(“UMF”) 16 [merely citing the 5/31/23 Notice of Ruling drafted by Plaintiff’s
counsel].)[1]  These rules and facts render the “no defense”
ground defective.
 
Plaintiff claims Paramount authorizes courts to bifurcate and
adjudicate liability.  (See Reply, p. 5.)
 
The Court disagrees.  The
bifurcation quote comes from a case called Department of Industrial
Relations v. UI Video Stores, Inc. (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1084:
 
The correct procedure below would have been a
motion to bifurcate the issue of liability, which the parties could have tried
upon the undisputed facts. [Citation.] A decision on the issue of liability
against the party on whom liability is sought to be imposed does not result in
a judgment until the issue of damages is resolved.
 
(Dept. of Industrial Relations, supra, 55 Cal.App.4th
at 1097.)  Paramount quotes Department
of Industrial Relations with approval. 
There, “[t]he trial court had [] ordered [plaintiff] to move for summary
judgment on the issue of [defendant]’s liability, with damages to be determined
in a later accounting proceeding.” 
(Ibid.)  On appeal, the First
District pointed out that “section 437c makes no provision for a partial
summary judgment as to liability” and that “[e]ven summary adjudication may be
granted only in limited instances.” 
(Ibid.)  The decision cites the
Rutter Guide, noting that “summary judgment or adjudication [is] improper where
[the] amount of damages raises [a] factual issue[.]”  (Ibid.) 
Importantly, Paramount clarifies that the First District’s
reference to bifurcating liability concerns trial, not summary adjudication,
because a “no defense” motion requires proof of the damages amount:
 
. . . there is no such creature as “partial
summary judgment” in California; the proper term is “summary adjudication.” [Citation.]
With this clarification, it is apparent that the court’s language is a
well-reasoned holding. The court was specifically requested to enter partial
summary judgment – summary adjudication – on the issue of liability, leaving
damages to be tried. The court rejected the request, because there was no
statutory basis for such an order. As we have explained, the governing statute
provides that a plaintiff can only obtain summary adjudication of a cause of
action if the plaintiff establishes each element of the cause of action
entitling it to judgment on that cause of action. The court specifically held
that “[a] decision on the issue of liability against the party on whom
liability is sought to be imposed does not result in a judgment until the issue
of damages is resolved.” [Citation.] Therefore, such a summary
adjudication would be improper. We fully agree with the court’s reasoning.
 
(Paramount, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 243.)
 
For the “duty” ground, case law is split. 
Regan Roofing Co. v. Superior Court (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
425 (“Regan”) instructs that, “[a]lthough a trial court is authorized to
interpret a contractual provision as a matter of law [citation], where such
interpretation of contractual duties does not fully dispose of any portion of
the action, it is not a proper subject of summary adjudication.”  (Regan, supra, 24 Cal.App.4th
at 437.)  A newer case, Linden,
supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 508, allows summary adjudication of “an issue
of [contractual] duty ‘without regard for the dispositive effect of such
ruing on other issues in the litigation.’” 
(Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 10:44.2 [quoting Linden, supra,
62 Cal.App.4th at 522], emphasis in original.)  
 
The Court is inclined to follow Linden because it is a Second
District decision.
 
Nevertheless, Plaintiff’s motion is denied and Defendant’s section
437c(h) request is moot because: 
 
* Plaintiff fails to shift the burden; and/or 
 
* triable issues exist.
 
For example, Plaintiff’s assertion – that she and all class members
“entered into COAs with Defendant” (Plaintiff’s Sep. Statement, UMF 3; see also
id. at UMF 2) – is unestablished and disputed. 
(See Defendant’s Opposition Sep. Statement, UMF 3.)  It is unestablished in that Plaintiff’s own
declaration states that she “do[es] not believe [she] received a copy of
Defendant’s Conditions of Admission contract during [her] emergency room visit”
(Fleschert Decl., ¶ 3), and her purported COA is unsigned.  (See Plaintiff’s Appx. of Evidence, Ex. 3,
pp. 4-5.)  It is disputed in that,
according to Defendant, “a portion of the class did not sign the COA at
all.”  (Defendant’s Opposition Sep.
Statement, UMF 3.)  If nothing else, the
Court would favor a continuance to give Defendant a chance to conduct discovery
on this issue.
 
Plaintiff’s interpretation of the COAs is another unestablished
assertion.  Plaintiff contends the COAs
only permit charges for services rendered. 
(See Motion, pp. 12-14.)  The
contention is based on the COAs’ plain language (see ibid.; see also Reply, pp.
6-8), yet this Court already found the plain language ambiguous and held that
“[e]vidence is needed to determine the parties’ intent and the correct construction.”  (6/21/22 Notice of Ruling Re: Demurrer to
FAC, Ex. A, p. 8 [attaching 6/16/22 Tentative Ruling Re: Demurrer]; see also
8/26/24 Ruling Re: Motion Re: Permissible Scope of Discovery, p. 6 [reiterating
that “the ‘services rendered’ language is ambiguous”].)  Rehashing the plain-language argument does
not suffice to satisfy the initial burden.
 
The same is true of Plaintiff’s next assertion.  She argues that, even if the plain language
is ambiguous, the COAs should be interpreted against Defendant because
Defendant drafted them.  (See Motion, pp.
14-15.)  In August 2024, she made an
identical argument in opposition to Defendant’s motion to set the permissible
scope of discovery.  The Court disagreed:
 
. . . Even though
the COAs are form contracts, it is not sufficient – at this point in the
litigation – to simply construe the words against Defendant as the
drafter.  That rule controls “only when
there is no extrinsic evidence available . . . or where the uncertainty cannot
be remedied by other rules of interpretation.” 
(Rainier Credit Co. v. Western Alliance Corp. (1985) 171
Cal.App.3d 255, 263.)  The other rules
that Defendant cites allow for extrinsic “evidence of conduct of the parties in
performing the contract, custom and usage in the industry, and the
circumstances surrounding formation of the agreements.”  (Southern Pacific Transportation Co. v.
Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1242; see
also, e.g., Motion Re:
Permissible Scope of Discovery, pp. 8-9 [analogizing Fletcher v. Security
Pacific National Bank (1979) 23 Cal.3d 442 and Hamwi v.
Citinational-Buckeye Investment Co. (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 462], 12 [citing
Civil Code sections 1647 and 1649 and McCray v. Carlstrom (1964) 226
Cal.App.2d 272]; Reply Re: Motion Re: Permissible Scope of Discovery, pp. 3-4
[citing Lemm v. Stillwater Land & Cattle Co. (1933) 217 Cal. 474 and
Oceanside 84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1441],
5, 7.)  Given the ambiguity, given that
this is a post-certification discovery motion, and assuming arguendo that
Defendant’s representation is true, Defendant arguably should be permitted to
ask questions about these matters, namely, whether class members were made
aware of the ER Visitation Fees, how they were made aware, the type of notice
provided, and whether they agreed to be charged.
 
(8/26/24 Ruling Re: Motion Re:
Permissible Scope of Discovery, p. 6.) 
Nothing has changed since then. 
The interpretation issue is still an issue that necessitates discovery,
so the “construe against the drafter” argument is premature and does not shift
the burden.
 
Plaintiff’s attempt to define ER
Visitation Fee does not change the result. 
She cites an expert declaration, comments by the Centers for Medicine
and Medicaid Services, and medical websites for the proposition that ER
Visitation Fees constitute “fees designed to cover the operational, overhead,
and administrative costs of running an emergency room[.]”  (Motion, p. 15; see also id. at pp. 16-17;
Plaintiff’s Sep. Statement, UMFs 9, 10; Reply, pp. 8-9.)  However, Defendant’s expert proffers a
different definition.  (See Gustafson
Decl., Ex. D, ¶¶ 10, 35-38 [opining that ER Visitation Fees cover “costs that
even Plaintiff cannot plausibly argue are not services rendered” – e.g., “costs
associated with the triage nurse that first evaluates patients in the ER”]; see
also Defendant’s Opposition Sep. Statement, UMF 9.)  This creates a battling-experts scenario and
a triable issue.[2]
 And, regardless, the definition of ER
Visitation Fees is a separate issue from whether the COAs allow ER Visitation
Fees to be charged.     
 
The Court turns to Plaintiff’s
UMF 5.  Plaintiff states that Defendant
did not disclose the ER Visitation Fees to patients in writing.  (See Plaintiff’s Sep. Statement, UMF 5.)  The cited evidence does not support the
statement and raises a triable issue of fact. 
Indeed, Defendant’s interrogatory responses identify alleged sources of
written disclosures.  (See Defendant’s
Opposition Sep. Statement, UMF 5; see also Plaintiff’s Appx. of Evidence, Ex.
6, pp. 6-8, 25-26 [attaching responses to special interrogatories 6 and 35].) 
 
Plaintiff’s “overbilling” theory
is an individualized, fact-intensive theory, and it is unproven on the current
record.  The premise of the theory is
that every charge of an ER Visitation Fee was an overcharge.    (See Motion, pp. 18-19)  Again, discovery is needed to determine the
definition of ER Visitation Fee and whether the COAs authorize them to be
charged.  In addition, charging is
different than requiring to pay. 
Plaintiff fails to show the damages amounts, let alone that all class
members paid ER Visitation Fees.  (See
Opposition, pp. 20-21; see also Defendant’s Opposition Sep. Statement, UMFs 12,
16.)      
 
Finally, Plaintiff fails to prove
the “excused from performance” element. 
Plaintiff contends each charging of an ER Visitation Fee, “itself, [was]
a material breach that completely excuse[d] [the] class members’ requirement to
pay their bill[s].”  (Opposition, p. 17;
see also Motion, pp. 19-21; Reply, pp. 11-12.) 
Not only is the contention predicated on Plaintiff’s unestablished
interpretation of the COAs, but it also is a factual issue, and the Court has
held that Defendant is entitled to discovery. 
(See Opposition, pp. 10, 11, 17-18, 20; see also 8/26/24 Ruling Re:
Motion Re: Permissible Scope of Discovery, p. 7.)
