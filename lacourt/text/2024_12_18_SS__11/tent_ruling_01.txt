TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to seal is denied without prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)[1]
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai moves to seal certain exhibits filed by Plaintiff in
support of her motion for summary adjudication.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records, protecting
the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made. Such an arrangement ‘is
entirely inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551
and the constitutional values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
seeks to seal Exhibits 8 and 14. 
According to Defendant, “Exhibit 8 is a confidential internal hospital
record (policy and procedure)” (Motion, p. 1), and “Exhibit 14 reflects the
names of patients and certain financial information associated with their
encounters in the Emergency Department (‘ED’).” 
(Ibid.)
 
The
Court finds that the motion should be denied without prejudice due to
insufficient notice.  Defendant e-served
the moving papers on 12/4/24, less than 16 court days plus two court days
before the hearing.
 
The
motion also is denied without prejudice because Defendant failed to file a
supporting declaration as required by rule 2.551(b)(1).
 
Plaintiff
contends the motion is additionally untimely under rule 2.551(b)(3)(B).  (See Opposition, pp. 2-3.)
 
The
Court tends to disagree.  Rule
2.551(b)(3)(B) requires lodged documents to be placed in the public file if the
party that produced the documents in discovery fails to move to seal them
within 10 days after receiving notice of lodgment.  It is undisputed that Defendant did not move
to seal within 10 days.  However,
Plaintiff fails to cite authority prohibiting the producing party from moving
to seal the documents once they are, or should have been, placed in the public
file.  The plain language of rule 2.551(b)(3)(B)
does not prohibit such a motion.  
 
As a
matter of guidance, the Court agrees with Defendant as to Exhibit 8.  It appears to be a proprietary,
trade-secret-type policy document.  The
Court would be inclined to seal it.
 
The
Court agrees with Defendant in part as to Exhibit 14.  The discovery responses are already heavily
redacted, but the class-member declarations, which are attached, reveal patient
names (all declarations), the names of the patients’ insurance providers
(first, second, third, fourth, and fifth declarations), and, in some instances,
the specific medical reasons why the declarants went to Defendant’s ED (second
and fourth declarations).  The Court believes
these portions of the declarations should be redacted and sealed, but the
remaining portions do not need to be.
 
As
modified, if it were appropriate to reach the merits, the Court would favor
granting the motion to seal as to both documents because:
 
*
Exhibits 8 and 14 disclose proprietary, trade-secret-type information and/or
patient names, insurer names, and medical information;
 
* an
overriding interest exists in keeping the proprietary, trade-secret-type
information and/or patient names, insurer names, and medical information
confidential;
 
* the
overriding interest supports the sealing request;
 
*
there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the motion is denied;
 
*
with the modifications, the sealing request is narrowly tailored given that it
only redacts and seals the portions that disclose the proprietary,
trade-secret-type information and/or patient names, insurer names, and medical
information; and
 
*
sealing is the least restrictive means to protect the overriding interest.
