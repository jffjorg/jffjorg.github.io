And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for leave to amend the answer filed by Cambridge Farms Kosher, Inc. (Defendant) in a wage-and-hour class action lawsuit. The Defendant is seeking to add 19 affirmative defenses to its answer. The Court has considered the Defendant's arguments that California policy favors leave to amend, that Plaintiff will not suffer prejudice, and that the motion is timely. The Court has also considered Plaintiff's arguments that the Defendant waived the right to amend and that the motion will prejudice Plaintiff.

The Court has ruled that the motion for leave to amend should be granted. The Court finds that California's amendment policy is very liberal and that the Defendant will be "deprived of defense[s]" if the motion is not granted. The Court also finds that the case is at the pre-certification stage, and there is no trial date set, which means that any prejudice to the Plaintiff will be minimal.

The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the arbitration agreement and that the motion should be denied on that basis. The Court finds that the assertion of knowledge does not bear on whether the motion should be granted as to the other new defenses.

The Court's ruling is based on California law and case citations, including Edmon & Karnow, Howard v. County of San Diego, Morgan v. Superior Court, Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc., and Record v. Reason.
