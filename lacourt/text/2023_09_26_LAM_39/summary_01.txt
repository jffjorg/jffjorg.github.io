The Judge found Caputo engaged in deliberate attempts to hide evidence during discovery, including failing to disclose crucial text messages and Facebook communications that contradicted her allegations. As a result, the Judge granted Costco's motions to exclude all evidence of harassment by Dias and Weissman.

The Judge also continued motions seeking to compel further discovery responses from Caputo and to inspect her mobile devices. This means the case will proceed with further hearings on these motions.
