The Judge in this case is granting a motion for a protective order filed by the City of Los Angeles. This means Plaintiff's attorney will not be allowed to ask certain questions to Jamie Brown (Chief Brown) during her deposition. 

The Judge's reasoning is based on a previous ruling that certain written communications between Los Angeles and Riverside are not discoverable.  The Court finds that Plaintiff's attorney's proposed questions would violate this previous ruling by seeking information related to privileged documents and communications. 

The Judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
