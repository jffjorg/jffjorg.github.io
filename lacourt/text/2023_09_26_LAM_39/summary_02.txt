## English Summary

The Judge in this case is granting a motion for a protective order filed by the City of Los Angeles. This means Plaintiff's attorney will not be allowed to ask certain questions to Jamie Brown (Chief Brown) during her deposition. 

The Judge's reasoning is based on a previous ruling that certain written communications between Los Angeles and Riverside are not discoverable.  The Court finds that Plaintiff's attorney's proposed questions would violate this previous ruling by seeking information related to privileged documents and communications. 

The Judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.

### English Summary
The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Camarillo vs. City of Los Angeles, et al. The plaintiff, Joseph Camarillo, was terminated from his employment as a Los Angeles Fire Department officer and alleges that the City of Riverside intentionally interfered with his employment. The City of Los Angeles has moved for a protective order to prevent the plaintiff's counsel from examining certain topics during a deposition. The court has granted the motion, citing Evidence Code section 1040(a) and Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420. The plaintiff's counsel had argued that the court had no authority to grant the motion, but the court found this argument to be unpersuasive. The court has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions. The City of Los Angeles' counsel is ordered to provide notice and file proof of such with the court. The protective order prevents the plaintiff's counsel from examining Chief Brown regarding certain topics, including the subject matter of privileged documents and communications between Chief Brown and the City of Riverside.

**Places:** City of Los Angeles, City of Riverside

**Dates:** October 23, 2018 (execution of waiver), June 29, 2023 (previous court order), September 26, 2023 (future court hearing)

**Events:** Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles and City of Riverside after being terminated from his employment as a Los Angeles Fire Department officer. Plaintiff alleges that Riverside's employees intentionally interfered with his employment by communicating false information. Plaintiff signed a waiver allowing Los Angeles to obtain any information pertaining to his employment history.

**Laws:** Evidence Code section 1040(a), Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420

**Case Citations:** Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261

**Ruling:**

The court grants the City of Los Angeles' motion for a protective order to prevent Plaintiff's counsel from examining Jamie Brown regarding privileged documents or her communications with Riverside. The court has the authority to make this order under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420. Plaintiff's counsel did not oppose the motion on the merits or explain how potential questions would not violate Evidence Code section 1040(a).

The court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions and the City's request for sanctions, as the City did not previously rule on this issue and the City's counsel did not attach proposed stipulations to her declaration. The court notes that the City still has not made Chief Brown available for a deposition.

**Order:**

1. The City's motion for a protective order is granted.
2. Plaintiff's counsel may not examine Chief Brown regarding specific topics.
3. Both parties' requests for sanctions are denied.
4. Counsel for the City of Los Angeles shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
