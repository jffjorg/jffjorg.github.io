And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's special motion to strike the defendant's cross-complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The plaintiff had argued that the cross-complaint was filed in response to the plaintiff's complaint and was therefore subject to an anti-SLAPP motion. However, the judge found that the cross-complaint was based on the defendant's alleged breach of contract, not the plaintiff's lawsuit, and therefore was not subject to an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees in the amount of $1,400.
