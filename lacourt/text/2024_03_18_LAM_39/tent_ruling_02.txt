23STCV27461
Motion to Strike
Case Management
Conference
 
            Plaintiff
Megan Ozurovich (“Plaintiff”) filed this habitability case against Defendants
McGowan Properties, LLC and Dolan & Knight Property Management, Inc.
(collectively, “Defendants”).  Now,
Defendants move to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related
allegations.  
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole
pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that she
repeatedly complained about a cockroach infestation.  Plaintiff complained on January 24, 2023; May
1, 2023; and July 21, 2023, to no avail. 
This may be sufficient to establish more that mere negligence, i.e.,
oppression or malice.  A cockroach
infestation that goes unabated could pose a serious threat to a tenant’s health.  However, the defendants in this case are
entities.  “[T]he imposition of punitive
damages upon a corporation is based upon its own fault.  It is not imposed vicariously by virtue of the
fault of others.” (City Products Corp. v. Globe Indemnity Co. (1979) 88
Cal. App. 3d 31, 36.) “Corporations are legal entities which do not have minds
capable of recklessness, wickedness, or intent to injure or deceive. An award
of punitive damages against a corporation therefore must rest on the malice of
the corporation’s employees.  But the law
does not impute every employee’s malice to the corporation. Instead, the
punitive damages statute requires proof of malice among corporate leaders: the
officers, directors, or managing agents.” (Cruz v. Home Base (2000) 83
Cal. App. 4th 160, 167, internal quotations and citation omitted.)  Plaintiff does not satisfy this pleading
standard.  Plaintiff does not identify to
whom she complained.  In other words, Plaintiff
does not allege that Defendants’ officers, directors, or managing agents were
aware of her complaints about the unit and failed to take action.  Plaintiff alleges only that Jonathony Dolan,
who is Defendants’ “owner, manager, employee, and/or agent” initiated an
eviction.  Plaintiff does not clearly
allege that he was an officer, director, managing agent, or owner.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
1.         The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to strike.
 
2.         The
Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend. 
Plaintiff may file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days.
 
3.         If
Plaintiff fails to do so, Defendants shall file an answer within thirty (30)
days of Plaintiff’s deadline.
 
4.         The
Court sets the following dates:
 
            Final
Status Conference:        September 25,
2024, at 9:00 a.m.
 
            Trial:                                       October
7, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
 
The parties shall comply with all pretrial procedures for
Department #39.  The parties shall
prepare and file joint trial documents on or before September 18, 2025.  The parties shall identify all witnesses they
intend to call in their respective cases-in-chief, and identify and produce all
exhibits they intend to introduce in their respective cases-in-chief, on or
before September 18, 2025.
 
            5.         Jury fees shall be posted within ten
(10) days or the parties shall waive jury. 

 
            6.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
