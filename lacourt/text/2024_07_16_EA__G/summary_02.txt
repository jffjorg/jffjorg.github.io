And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Pomona against Hillview MHC, LLC. Hillview MHC, LLC is challenging the City's failure to consider its subdivision conversion application. The City argues that Hillview MHC, LLC failed to exhaust administrative remedies because it did not submit a formal application, pay the application fee, and apply for a variance and conditional use permit. The judge is seeking additional briefing from the parties on whether the exhaustion of remedies doctrine applies in this case. The doctrine requires a plaintiff to seek a variance and conditional use permit before challenging the City's ability to impose those requirements. The judge is also considering whether the City is required to deem the application complete under Government Code section 65943, which requires the City to deem a development project application complete if it fails to timely notify the applicant of any deficiencies. The judge intends to set a briefing schedule and a new hearing date to address these issues.
