And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Wex Inc.'s application for default judgment against Little Fat Trucking in the reduced amount of $285,786.65. This is a collections action arising from a fuel card account that Little Fat Trucking allegedly failed to pay. Wex filed a complaint against Little Fat Trucking and others in May 2023, and served Little Fat Trucking through the California Secretary of State in May 2024. When Little Fat Trucking failed to file a timely answer, the court entered default against them. Wex then submitted an application for default judgment, which the court has granted, subject to some modification. The court found that Wex's calculation of interest was incorrect and reduced the amount of interest awarded from $102,386.57 to $47,254.85. The total judgment is therefore $285,786.65, consisting of damages of $237,576.05, interest of $47,254.85, and costs of $955.75.
