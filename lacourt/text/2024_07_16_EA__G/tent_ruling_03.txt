Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Wex Inc.’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $285,786.65.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. From May 2022 to July 2022, Plaintiff Wex Inc. (Wex)
alleges Defendant Little Fat Trucking became indebted to Wex for a fuel card
account in the total amount of $237,576.05.
On May
8, 2023, Wex filed a complaint against Little Fat Trucking and Does 1-10, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) open book account and (2) account stated.
On May 9, 2024, Wex’s process server served Little Fat Trucking through the
California Secretary of State.
On June
20, 2024, the Court entered default against Little Fat Trucking after they
failed to timely file an answer. On the same day, Wex submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for July 16, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Wex
seeks default judgment against Little Fat Trucking in the total amount of $340,918.37,
including $237,576.05 in damages, $102,386.57 in interest, and $955.75 in costs.
Because the Court finds Wex submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their
application for default judgment with the following modification: While Wex
requests $102,386.57 in interest, the Court finds this amount was calculated
incorrectly and deems the correct amount of awardable interest to be $47,254.85
(10% of $237,576.05 divided by 365 = $65.0893287671 per diem multiplied by 726
days (07/21/2022 – 07/16/2024). Accordingly, the total judgment is reduced to $285,786.65.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Wex’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $285,786.65 (Damages of $237,576.05 +
Interest of $47,254.85 + Costs of 955.75).
