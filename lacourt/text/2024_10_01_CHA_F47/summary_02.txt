And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons on herself, Ana Maria Velarde. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the purported substituted service of the summons and complaint on defendant was deficient. Specifically, the proof of service did not include a declaration of diligence, and the relationship of the person served to the defendant was not set forth in the proof of service. Additionally, the address where the summons and complaint were delivered to the person served was not the defendant's home or business address. As a result, the judge finds that the service of the summons and complaint on defendant was not valid, and the motion to quash is granted.
