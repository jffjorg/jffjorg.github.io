MOTION TO QUASH
SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Motion filed on 2/27/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Ana Maria Velarde
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Esperanza Ramos
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order quashing the service of
summons on Defendant Ana Maria Velarde in this case.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 12/12/23, Plaintiff Esperanza Ramos (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendant Ana Maria Velarde (Defendant) for: (1) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability, (2) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (3)
Nuisance, (4) Civil Code 1942.4, (5) Negligence and (6) Anti-Harassment
Ordinance.  
 
On 2/6/24, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons
which indicates that Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on
1/25/24 by substituted service on Sal Maldonado at 8919 Woodman Ave, Arleta, CA
91331 and mailing to the same address on 1/25/24.  (See Proof of Service filed on 2/6/24).
 
On 2/27/24, Defendant filed (served on 2/26/24) the
instant motion seeking an order quashing the service of the summons on
Defendant.  Plaintiff has not opposed or
otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
On or before the last day to plead, or within a further
time the court allows for good cause, a defendant may serve and file a motion
to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over the defendant.  See CCP
418.10(a)(1).  
 
CCP 415.20(b) provides: 
 
“If a copy of the summons and complaint
cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be
served, as specified in Section
416.60, 416.70, 416.80,
or 416.90,
a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing.”  
 
The purported substituted service of the summons and
complaint on Defendant is deficient. 
First, the proof of service is not accompanied by a declaration of
diligence.  As such there is no evidence
before the Court that the summons and complaint could not with reasonable
diligence be personally delivered to Defendant, an individual, as required
before serving Defendant via substituted service.  CCP 415.20(b).  Second, the relationship of the person served
to Defendant is not set forth in the proof of service.  (See Proof of Service filed 2/6/24,
No.5.b.).  Defendant states that Solomon
Maldonado (Sal) is the listing broker for Defendant and not an agent for
service of process on behalf of Defendant. 
(See Velarde Decl.).  The
motion also seems to indicate that the address where the summons and complaint
were delivered to Mr. Maldonado and thereafter mailed is not Defendant’s home or
business address address.  (See
Motion, p.5:16-17; Velarde Decl.).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
