Case #23CHCV02717 (consolidated with 24CHCV00881)
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL DEPOSITION
 
Motion filed on 7/26/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Vardan Arakelian
RESPONDING PARTY: Non-Party Esther Linares
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
non-party witness Esther Linares to appear at deposition.  

 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
These consolidated actions arise out of a motor vehicle
accident that occurred on 6/4/22.
 
On 5/14/24, Defendant Vardan Arakelian served a
Deposition Subpoena on non-party witness Esther Linares (Linares) to appear for
deposition on 6/17/24.  (Rickett Decl. ¶2,
Ex.A).  Linares failed to appear for her
deposition.  (Rickett Decl. ¶2).  Linares also failed to respond to Arakelian’s
meet and confer efforts.  (Rickett Decl.
¶¶3-4, Ex.B).  
 
Therefore, on 7/26/24, Arakelian filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling non-party witness Esther Linares to
appear at deposition.  No opposition or
other response to the motion has been filed. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
The proofs of service attached to the moving papers do
not show that the motion was served on Linares, a non-party deponent, as
required.  See CRC 3.1346.  Rather, the proofs of service show that the
motion papers were only served on counsel for the parties in these consolidated
cases.  As noted above, there is no
response to the motion from Linares to cure the defect in notice.  
 
Additionally, the Memorandum of Points and Authorities
filed in support of the motion does not include any authority – i.e., there are
no citations to any statutes, cases and/or court rules.  (See Memorandum of Points &
Authorities, generally); CRC 3.1113(b).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is placed off calendar.
