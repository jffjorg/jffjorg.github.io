And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to compel non-party witness Esther Linares to appear at deposition off calendar. The motion was filed by defendant Vardan Arakelian on July 26, 2024, after Linares failed to appear for her deposition and did not respond to meet and confer efforts. However, the judge notes that the proofs of service attached to the motion papers do not show that the motion was served on Linares, as required by California Rule of Court 3.1346. Additionally, the memorandum of points and authorities filed in support of the motion did not include any citations to statutes, cases, or court rules, as required by California Rule of Court 3.1113(b). As a result, the judge has chosen not to rule on the motion at this time.
