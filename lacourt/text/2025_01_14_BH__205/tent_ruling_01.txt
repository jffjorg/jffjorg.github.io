 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DEFAULT



 
Background
Plaintiff is a medical and administration
consulting firm that works with home health companies, hospice groups, assisted
living companies, board and care homes and skilled nursing facilities to help
them with placement, compliance, billing, and recertification mostly as it
relates to Medicare and Medi-Cal issues. (Compl., ¶ 7.) 
Defendants Independence HCM Inc. and Dov Jacobs
provide in-home care for patients who are given a prescription by their
physician for nurse visits, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social
worker visits and similar services that are then billed (when coded correctly)
to Medicare or other insurance. (Id., ¶ 8.) 
From May 2017 through August 2018, Plaintiff entered
into four (4) service agreements with Legacy Plus Unlimited d/b/a Alta Vista
Health Services (“Legacy”), Defendants’ alleged alter ego, and Defendants,
whereby Plaintiff agreed to provide various services to Legacy and Defendants.
(Id., ¶ 9.)
On or about September 12, 2019, after receiving no
payment from Defendants, Plaintiff notified Defendants that Plaintiff had
temporarily suspended services to Legacy and Defendants due to non-payment.
(Id., ¶ 15.)
On or about December 21, 2020, an Arbitrator issued
an award in favor of Plaintiff and against Legacy in the amount of $192,424.21.
(Id., ¶ 19.) On June 8, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion and
confirmed the Arbitration Award of $192,424.21 against Legacy. (Id., ¶ 21.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Jacobs and
Independence, acting in concert with Legacy, engaged in fraudulent activities
to avoid their contractual and legal obligations. Specifically, they
intentionally misrepresented their authority and contractual obligations,
leading Plaintiff to believe that they were responsible for the services
rendered and would be held liable for them. (Id., ¶ 25.)
The complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) negligent misrepresentation; (2) breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) unjust enrichment; (4)
intentional misrepresentation; (5) fraudulent inducement; (6) violation of Cal.
Bus. & Prof. Code section 17200; (7) false promise; (8) civil conspiracy;
(9) breach of contract; (10) common count: account stated; (11) common count:
open book account; (12) concealment; and (13) alter ego liability.
This hearing is on Defendants’ motion to set
aside/vacate default. Defendants argue that entry of default is void for
defective service.
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 473(d) provides that
“[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct
clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the
judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to
the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”   
 
            A defendant
may move to set aside a default and default judgment based on improper service
and lack of personal jurisdiction under Code Civ. Proc. §473(d).  (Strathvale
Holdings v. E.B.H. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1250.) 
 
            A “default judgment entered against
a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by
statute is void. Under § 473(d), the court may set aside a default judgment
which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due to improper
service.”  (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.) 
Where service is challenged, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts
requisite to an effective service.  (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) 
 
Analysis
On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff
filed two proofs of service. As to Defendant Jacobs, the proof of service
indicates that he was served with the summons and complaint by substituted
service through Valerie Hanson, Social Service Director, on October 3, 2023, at
11620 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90066. As to Defendant Independence
HCM Inc., the proof of service indicates that it was served with the summons
and complaint by personal service through Valerie Hanson, Social Service
Director, on October 3, 2023, at 11620 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90066.
CCP section 415.20
provides that “[i]f a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with
reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served  .
. . a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at
the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member. . . at least 18 years of age, who
shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of
the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail . . . .”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.20(b).) 
To effectuate service on a corporation,
the summons may be delivered to the agent for service of process or to the
president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice
president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant
treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a
person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10(a), (b).) 
Defendant Jacobs has submitted
evidence showing that the address where he was purportedly served was not his
usual place of business. Further, Independence HCM, Inc. has submitted evidence
showing that service was not effected upon its agent, or other person as set
forth in Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10(a)-(b). The address at 11620 W. Washington
Blvd., is an assisted living facility called Vista Del Sol Care Center. (Jacobs
Decl., at ¶ 2.) Valerie Hanson does not work for Independence. (Jacobs Decl.,
at ¶ 3.) She does not handle mail for Independence. (Jacobs Decl., at ¶ 4.) She
is not an agent of Independence nor is she an agent of Dov Jacobs. (Jacobs
Decl., at ¶ 5.) The registered agent for service of process for Independence is
Dov Jacobs. (Jacobs Decl., at ¶ 6.) Valerie Hanson is not authorized to accept
service on behalf of either Defendant. (Jacobs Decl., at ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff has the burden
of proving otherwise. It is
always the plaintiff’s burden to establish the existence of jurisdiction. 
(Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1439-1440.)  Thus, even though defendant is the moving party on a motion
to set aside a void judgment under CCP §473(d), the burden is on plaintiff to
establish proper service.  (Dill, 24 Cal.App.4th at 1439-1440.) Plaintiff has
failed to file an opposition to meet its burden.
Conclusion
Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to set aside default.
