Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant CANON LUXURY BUILDINGS, LLC to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff CHOTTO MATTE (BEVERLY HILLS) LLC.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action for declaratory relief, finding that only past wrongs are involved and that declaratory relief is not necessary. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraudulent inducement, finding that the FAC fails to adequately allege justifiable reliance and damages.

However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the FAC adequately alleges performance and damages.

The judge concludes that the demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part, and that Defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is denied.
