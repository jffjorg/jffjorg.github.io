  Case Number:  24LBCV01263    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  S25 Factual BackgroundOn June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Tarzana Treatment Centers, Inc. and Does 1 to 10, alleging claims for medical negligence, negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff alleges that on May 17, 2023, Plaintiff was a patient and an invitee at Defendant’s premises and, while entering the bathroom, slipped and fell on a wet and slipper floor. (Compl., ¶¶ 9, 10.)Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds], § 430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be taken], and § 430.50, subd. (a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of action within]. Specifically, a demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. Per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a), a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. Furthermore, a demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)Tentative RulingThe demurrer to the 1st cause of action (Medical Negligence) is sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff “concedes dismissal of Count 1 is proper” and stipulates” to its dismissal. (Opposition, p. 3:17)To plead a cause of action for negligence, one must allege (1) a legal duty owed to plaintiffs to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) In California, negligence may be pleaded in general terms. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 407-408.) “Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action, and… the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare statement that the defendant's negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.) However, there is no requirement that plaintiff identify and allege the precise moment of the injury or the exact nature of the wrongful act. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) The court finds that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support a negligence cause of action. (Complaint, ¶¶ 8-9, 26, 28, 30, 37.) The demurrer to the 2nd cause of action (Negligence) is overruled.Premises liability is a form of negligence, and the familiar elements of a negligence claim—duty, breach, causation and damages—apply. (Brooks v. Eugene Burger Mgmt. Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.) A court may sustain a demurrer for “duplicative pleading which adds nothing to the complaint by way of fact or theory.” (Award Metals, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.) Both causes of action in the Complaint allege a breach of a single duty and the same facts/allegations. Plaintiff offers no significant distinction between the “Negligence” cause of action and “Premises Liability” cause of action. As leave to amend is liberally granted, the court sustains with 15 days leave to amend from the date of this ruling the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action (Premises Liability).
