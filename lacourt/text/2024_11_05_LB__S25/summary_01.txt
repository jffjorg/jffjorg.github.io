And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Tarzana Treatment Centers, Inc. and Does 1 to 10, against the plaintiff's complaint. The demurrer challenged the legal sufficiency of the complaint, alleging that the plaintiff had not stated a valid cause of action for medical negligence, negligence, and premises liability.

The judge found that the demurrer to the 1st cause of action (Medical Negligence) was sustained without leave to amend because the plaintiff had not pled sufficient facts to support a negligence claim. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action (Premises Liability) with 15 days leave to amend, finding that the allegations in the two causes of action were duplicative and added nothing new to the complaint.

However, the judge overruled the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action (Negligence), finding that the plaintiff had pled sufficient facts to support a negligence claim. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had conceded dismissal of the 1st cause of action and stipulated to its dismissal.
