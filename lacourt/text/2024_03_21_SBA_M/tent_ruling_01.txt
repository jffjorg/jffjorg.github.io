El Segundo
Unified School District’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
El Segundo Unified School District’s Demurrer to First
Amended Complaint is overruled.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on July 13, 2023, and
the First Amended Complaint was filed on July 21, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. While a student at El Segundo Middle School, Plaintiff was
groomed and sexually abused by a teacher beginning in 2001 through 2003. Plaintiff
alleges the following causes of action: 1. Negligence; 2. Negligent Supervision
and Retention; 3. Sexual Battery; 4. Sexual Harassment. 
 
Meet and Confer
             
Defendant set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. 
(Decl. Rebecca L. Gerome.)   
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is granted
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(a) and (c).
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to the first through second causes of
action for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and uncertainty. CCP § 430.10(e)(f). Specifically, the demurrer is made “on the
grounds that, to the extent that Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218"), which was
enacted in 2019, purports to retroactively strip statutory government immunity
from public entities, it violates Article XVI, section 6 of the California
Constitution, which prohibits gifts of public funds.”  (Notice, page 2, lines 3-6.) Defendant also
presents Perez v. Roe I (2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 171 for the
proposition that the constitutionality of a statute may be properly raised on
demurrer. 
 
Preliminarily, the Court notes that nothing in CCP §
430.10 specifically mentions the constitutionality of a statute as grounds for
demurrer.  In addition, the Court notes
that in Perez there had already been a final judgment previously
rendered against the plaintiffs.  Thus, the
specific grounds raised by the demurrer was failure to state sufficient facts
based on res judicata principles.  The
reasoning provided was that the attempt to plead a new claim (which had
previously been dismissed) based on a newly enacted statute was improper. The Court of Appeal held that the pleading
failed to state sufficient facts because the new claim based on the new statute
was an improper attempt to unravel a final judgment, and, to that extent, the
statute was unconstitutional.  On the
other hand, in this case, there is no final judgment upon which the instant
Court can analyze the pleading pursuant to res judicata principles.  The causes of action pled here have not been
previously alleged as far as this Court is aware.  In any event, as Plaintiff did not oppose the
demurrer on this basis, the Court will proceed to analyze the substance of the
arguments.
 
“Before suing a public entity, the plaintiff must
present a timely written claim for damages to the entity. [. . .] Timely claim
presentation is not merely a procedural requirement, but is, as this court long
ago concluded, a condition precedent to plaintiff's maintaining an action
against defendant[,] and thus an element of the plaintiff's cause of action.
Complaints that do not allege facts demonstrating either that a claim was
timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is excused are subject
to a general demurrer for not stating facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201,
208–209 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
Relevant exceptions to the requirement are provided in
Gov. Code § 905 as follows: “(m) Claims made pursuant to Section 340.1 of the
Code of Civil Procedure for the recovery of damages suffered as a result of
childhood sexual assault. (p) The changes made to this section by the act that
added this subdivision1 are retroactive and apply to any action commenced on or
after the date of enactment of that act, and to any action filed before the
date of enactment and still pending on that date, including any action or
causes of action that would have been barred by the laws in effect before the
date of enactment.”  Gov. Code § 905.  Thus, AB 218 was passed in 2018 eliminating
the exemption for claims occurring after 2009 and stating that the changes are
retroactive.
 
Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 6 states, in relevant part:
“The Legislature shall have no power to give or to
lend, or to authorize the giving or lending, of the credit of the State, or of
any county, city and county, city, township or other political corporation or
subdivision of the State now existing, or that may be hereafter established, in
aid of or to any person, association, or corporation, whether municipal or
otherwise, or to pledge the credit thereof, in any manner whatever, for the
payment of the liabilities of any individual, association, municipal or other
corporation whatever nor shall it have power to
make any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing
of value to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever[.]”
 
“It is well settled that the primary question to be
considered in determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be
considered a gift is whether the funds are to be used for a public or private
purpose. If they are to be used for a public purpose, they are not a gift
within the meaning of this constitutional prohibition.”  Jordan v. California Dept. of Motor
Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450.
 
“It is no small matter for one branch of the
government to annul the formal exercise by another and coordinate branch of
power committed to the latter, and the courts should not and must not annul, as
contrary to the constitution, a statute passed by the Legislature, unless it
can be said of the statute that it positively and certainly is opposed to the
constitution.”  Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. v. Padilla (2016) 62 Cal. 4th 486, 520 (quoting Methodist
Hosp. of Sacramento v. Saylor (1971) 5 Cal. 3d 685, 692).)  “If there is any doubt as to the Legislature’s
power to act in any given case, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the
Legislature’s action.” (Id. at
521.)

            Defendant argues that the
legislature “cannot pass a law attempting to impose liability on a public
entity for a past occurrence where there is no enforceable claim.” (Demurrer,
page 7, lines 21-23.)  See, Heron v.
Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507; See, also, Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138
Cal. 271; See, also, Conlin v. Bd. of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17; See
also Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321.  Defendant contends that it cannot be disputed
that prior to the passage of AB 218, Plaintiff did not have an enforceable
claim because Plaintiff’s claim was based on conduct occurring prior to 2009.
 
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled. 
 
Plaintiff’s claim was revived by AB 218. “Once a claim
has lapsed (under the formerly applicable statute of limitations), revival of
the claim is seen as a retroactive application of the law under an enlarged
statute of limitations.  Lapsed claims
will not be considered revived without express language of revival.”  Quarry v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945,
957. 
 
The following passage in Coats v. New Haven Unified
School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 428 is instructive:
 
“The present case, of course, involves revival of a
cause of action barred by a claim presentation requirement, not a statute of
limitations. But we are aware of no reason the Legislature should be any less
able to revive claims in this context, as it expressly did in Assembly Bill
218: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim for damages
described in paragraphs (1) through (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a) that has
not been litigated to finality and that would otherwise be barred as of January
1, 2020, because the applicable statute of limitations, claim presentation
deadline, or any other time limit had expired, is revived, and these claims
may be commenced within three years of January 1, 2020.” (§ 340.1, subd. (q),
italics added.) [¶] The express inclusion of “claim presentation deadline[s]”
in Assembly Bill 218 distinguishes it from the 2002 amendment to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1, which revived claims “that would otherwise be barred
as of January 1, 2003, solely because the applicable statute of limitations has
or had expired....” (Stats. 2002, ch. 149, § 1, p. 752) That revival provision,
our Supreme Court held, did not alter the bar imposed by a plaintiff's failure
to file a claim with the public entity defendant: “‘[T]he government claim
presentation deadline is not a statute of limitations. Had the Legislature
intended to also revive in subdivision (c) the claim presentation deadline
under the government claims statute, it could have easily said so. It did
not.’” (Rubenstein, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 907, 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 761, 400
P.3d 372, quoting Shirk, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 213, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d
210, 164 P.3d 630.) In Assembly Bill 218, the Legislature made clear its intent
to revive causes of action previously barred by government claims presentation
requirements.”  Id. (emphasis in
original).  
 
Thus, AB 218 does not constitute an unconstitutional
gift of public funds because AB 218 does not necessarily impose liability for a
past occurrence when there was no enforceable claim for that occurrence. Instead, AB 218 specifically provided for a
revival of enforceable claims. “It is equally well settled that legislation
reviving the statute of limitations on civil law claims does not violate
constitutional principles.” Roman
Catholic Bishop of Oakland v. Superior Court (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1155,
1161.
 
The following passage in Bickerdike v. State
(1904)144 Cal. 681, 692 is instructive:
 
“This construction, it is urged, would render the law
obnoxious to the provisions of section 31 of article IV of the constitution,
prohibiting the legislature from making any gift of public money or thing of
value, the contention being that a waiver of the defense of limitations is a
gift within the meaning of such provisions. [¶] The statute of limitations does
not, however, go to the substance of the right, but only to the remedy. When
the statute has made the defense available to the debtor, his debt has not been
extinguished. It still exists, and may be enforced against him unless he
chooses to avail himself of the defense afforded by the statute and specially
plead it. The payment of such a debt by the debtor is not a "gift,"
in any proper sense of the word, and there is nothing in the constitutional
provision invoked that can be held to prohibit the legislature from paying
these claims.”
 
In addition, the cases referred to by Defendant are
unavailing. 

            In Heron v. Riley
(1930) 209 Cal. 507, the Court analyzed now repealed Civ. Code § 1714 1/2 which
authorized the issuance of liability insurance to cover vehicles used by
government employees.  The state
controller declined to authorize payment for insurance premiums believing the
statute to be unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. IV § 24.  The California Supreme Court held that the
statute was, in fact, constitutional. However,
Defendant attempts to rely on the following dicta: “The legislature has not
attempted to create a liability against the state for any past acts of
negligence on the part of its officers, agents or employees -- something it
could not do, and the doing of which would, in effect, be the making of a gift
-- but has provided that 'hereafter' it shall be liable for certain things done
which cause damage to its citizens, its liability to be first determined by an
appropriate action at law.”  Id.
at 517.  Again, as noted above, however, AB
218 does not create liability for past acts of negligence.  Instead, it specifically provided for a
revival of existing claims.
 
In Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271,
Defendants, a city and county mayor and others, appealed a judgment granting a
juror a writ of mandate to compel payment for his jury duty services.  The Court analyzed the Act of March, 1901,
allowing for the payment of such services for those who had served since
1895.  The court ruled that the Act of
March, 1901 violated Cal. Const. art. IV, § 31, which prohibited the
legislature from making or authorizing gifts of public money. 
 
In Conlin v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99
Cal. 17, Defendant appealed a judgment mandating payment to a contractor
pursuant to 1891 Cal. Stat. 513 which allowed for a contractor to obtain
payment for work performed for the city.  The statute allowed payment when payment had
not been made due to errors made by officials.  The Court held that Cal. Const. art. IV, § 31
prohibited the legislature from making gifts of public money. The Court held
that the Act was a "gift" to the contractor, as defined in Civ. Code
§ 1146.
 
In Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, a state
employee sought a writ of mandamus directing defendant members of the state
board of examiners to allow the employee's claim against the state pursuant to
a statute allowing for appropriation of funds to pay for a claim for personal
injuries suffered while in the course and scope of employment.  The board demurred to the petition, arguing
that the appropriation was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. IV, §§ 31,
32, which provided that the legislature had no power to make any gift of public
money to any individual or to grant any extra compensation to a public officer
or servant of the state after service had been performed.  The court sustained the board's demurrer and
entered judgment in favor of the board.
 
Each of those cases did involve payment of funds, as a
gift, based on claims that were previously not existent and unenforceable. Here,
however, AB 218 does not operate in that manner but instead, as noted above,
acts as a revival of such claims which the legislature is fully authorized to
do.
 
Further, even assuming arguendo that any payment made
to a plaintiff based on the amendments made by AB 218 is considered a “gift,” AB
218 would still be found to be constitutional.  “It is likewise settled that if a public
purpose is served by the expenditure of public funds, the constitutional
prohibition is not violated even though there may be incidental benefits to
private persons.”  Schettler v. County
of Santa Clara (1977) 74 Cal. App. 3d 990, 1003.  “The determination of what constitutes a
public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature and will not be
disturbed as long as it has a reasonable basis.” San Diego County Dept. of
Soc. Servs. v. Superior Court (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 761, 766. 
 
Here, while, of course, an ultimate payment of funds
to the Plaintiff would constitute a benefit to Plaintiff, a significant public
purpose was served by AB 218.  “In
Assembly Bill 218, the Legislature has again attempted to balance the competing
concerns of protecting public entities from stale claims and allowing victims
of childhood sexual abuse to seek compensation. This time, the Legislature came
to a different conclusion, with an express revival provision for claims against
public entities as well as those against private defendants.” Coats v. New Haven Unified School District
(2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 429.  The
legislature has determined that a public purpose was served by allowing for the
revival of previously stale claims because of the policy of protecting minors
regarding their rights especially considering the serious impact of sexual
abuse.  The legislature has deemed it
appropriate to ensure that all victims of sexual abuse can have the ability to
pursue their claims.  The instant Court
cannot second guess this public policy since there is certainly a reasonable
basis for this decision. 
 
Thus, Defendant’s demurrer is overruled.  Defendant is ordered to file and serve an
Answer within 10 days of this date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
