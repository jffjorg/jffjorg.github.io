And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by the El Segundo Unified School District to the first amended complaint filed by John Doe. The demurrer was based on the argument that the school district is immune from liability due to the passage of Assembly Bill 218, which retroactively revived claims for childhood sexual abuse that would have been barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that AB 218 does not create liability for past acts of negligence, but instead revives existing claims that were previously barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also determined that the revival of these claims serves a public purpose, namely to protect minors from sexual abuse and to ensure that all victims of sexual abuse can have the ability to pursue their claims.

The judge has ordered the school district to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the date of the ruling, and has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
