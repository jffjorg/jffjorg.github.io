  Case Number:  23STCV06489    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  01 TENTATIVE RULINGDefendant Independent Living Systems, LLC (Defendant) moves
to stay this action on the ground that nineteen other overlapping class actions
are pending in the Southern District of Florida as one consolidated proceeding,
In re Independent Living Systems Data Breach Litigation (1:23-cv-21060). 
The motion is unopposed.  Having considered the motion, the Court finds
that in the interest of substantial justice this action should be heard in the
Southern District of Florida.  However, the Court is not yet convinced
that the appropriate course is to stay this action pursuant to Code Civ. Proc.
§ 410.30(a), rather than to dismiss it pursuant to that section.  The
Court intends to do one or the other.  Both parties are ordered to appear
at the September 18, 2023 hearing and discuss why the Court should not dismiss
this case.
