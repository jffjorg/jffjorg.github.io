And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to stay the action. The defendant argues that the case should be stayed because nineteen other overlapping class actions are pending in the Southern District of Florida as part of a consolidated proceeding. The motion is unopposed, and the judge agrees that the case should be heard in the Southern District of Florida. However, the judge is not yet convinced that the appropriate course is to stay the action, and instead plans to consider dismissing it. Both parties are ordered to appear at the hearing on September 18, 2023, to discuss why the court should not dismiss the case.
