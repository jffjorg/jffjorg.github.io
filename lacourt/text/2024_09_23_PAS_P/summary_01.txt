And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has denied the defendants' motion to compel further responses to discovery requests, as well as their motion to strike general objections to discovery responses. The Court has also denied their motion for sanctions. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests were inadequate and that the plaintiff had made frivolous objections to discovery. However, the Court found that the defendants had failed to properly file their motion to compel further responses and that the motion was untimely. The Court also found that the defendants had improperly combined several requests into one motion. As a result, the Court denied the motion for sanctions.
