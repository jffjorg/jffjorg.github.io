SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Taylor Peacock and
Austen Smith’s (Plaintiffs) ownership of a 2020 Ford Expedition (the Vehicle)
which was manufactured by Defendant Ford Motor Company (Ford).  Plaintiffs allege that on or about 12/19/20,
they entered into a warranty contract with Ford regarding the Vehicle.  (First Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶¶10-11).  Plaintiffs allege that defects and
nonconformities in the Vehicle, including a Transmission Defect, manifested
themselves within the warranty period.  (FAC
¶15).  Plaintiffs allege that Ford failed
to repair the Vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts and then failed to
repurchase or replace the Vehicle as required under the Song-Beverly Act.  (FAC ¶¶18-21).  Plaintiffs allege that Ford was aware of the
Transmission Defect and concealed same from Plaintiffs at the time of purchase,
repair and thereafter.  (FAC¶¶31-41).  
 
On 1/31/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Ford and
Autonation Ford Valencia for: 
(1) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of
Civil Code 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of
Implied Warranty of Merchantability; (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment;
(6) Negligent Repair and (7) Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civil
Code 1750, et seq.).  The 1st-5th
and 7th causes of action are alleged against Ford.  The 6th cause of action is alleged
against Autonation Ford Valencia.  On
5/26/23, this Court sustained Ford’s demurrer to the 3rd and 5th
causes of action in Plaintiffs’ original Complaint with leave to amend.  (See 5/26/23 Minute Order).  On 6/23/23, Plaintiffs filed their First
Amended Complaint alleging the same seven causes of action.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues Ford had with the First Amended Complaint, on 7/21/23, Ford
filed and served the instant demurrer to the 3rd and 5th
causes of action in the First Amended Complaint on the ground that they fail to
allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.  (Geraghty 
Decl.); CCP 430.10(e).  Plaintiffs
have opposed the demurrer and Ford has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
3rd Cause of Action – Violation of Civil
Code 1793.2(a)(3)
 
Generally, statutory causes of action must be pleaded
with factual particularity.  See Carter
(2011) 198 CA4th 396, 410 citing Zumbrun (1972) 25 CA3d 1, 8; Covenant
Care, Inc. (2004) 32 C4th 771, 790 citing Lopez (1985) 40 C3d 780,
795.
 
Civil Code 1793.2(a) provides, in relevant part, that
“[e]very manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the
manufacturer has made an express warranty shall: … (3) Make available to
authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and
replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period.” 
 
As in the original complaint, Plaintiffs, again, merely
conclude that Ford “failed to make available to its authorized service and
repair facilities sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect
repairs” as required by the Song Beverly Act without alleging facts as to what
service literature and/or replacement parts were purportedly not made available.  (See 
Complaint ¶¶46-47; FAC ¶¶53-54). 
Despite the Court’s prior ruling that Plaintiffs’ argument that this
claim may be based on “inferences” Plaintiffs contend can be drawn from such
allegations was without merit, in opposition to the instant demurrer,
Plaintiffs, again, rely on the “inference” argument.  (See 5/26/23 Minute Order, pp.2-3;
Opposition, p.1:4-7, p.4:10-16).
 
Also, as with the original Complaint, the First Amended
Complaint admits that certain “literature” was provided to repair facilities
and the public through Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) issued by Ford.  (See Complaint ¶¶28-32; FAC ¶¶33-39).  As in the original Complaint, in the First
Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs still fail to allege sufficient facts to
establish how such information was insufficient and/or what additional
literature should have been provided. 
Plaintiffs merely speculate/infer that Ford had additional information
which it failed to provide.  Plaintiffs
allege no facts to support their conclusion that additional facts exist and/or
that Ford had such facts in its possession and failed to provide same.  (See Opposition, p.4:17-24).  
 
The First Amended Complaint, like the original Complaint,
also fails to allege sufficient facts to establish how Plaintiffs were damaged
by the purported violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3).  (See Complaint ¶¶47-48; FAC ¶¶54-55).
 
5th Cause of Action – Fraudulent Inducement
– Concealment
 
Each element of a fraud cause of action must be pled with
specificity.  Lazar (1996) 12 C4th
631, 645.  Concealment of a material fact
is actionable when there is a duty of disclosure, which may arise from a
relationship between the parties, such as a buyer-seller relationship.  Dhital (2022) 84 CA5th 828, 843-844,
review granted, citing Hoffman (2014) 228 CA4th 1178, 1186-1187.
 
Plaintiffs allege that they purchased the Vehicle from
Ford’s authorized dealership and entered into a warranty contract with Ford.  (See FAC ¶¶10-11).  The “warranty contract” attached to the First
Amended Complaint is titled “2020 Model Year Ford Warranty Guide” and is not
signed by either party.  (See FAC
¶11, Ex.A).  In Dhital, relied on
by Plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had alleged that they bought the vehicle at issue
from a Nissan dealership, that Nissan backed the vehicle with an express
warranty, and that Nissan’s authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes
of the sale of the Nissan vehicles to consumers.  See Dhital, supra at
844.  While Plaintiffs’ now allege that
they purchased the vehicle from “Defendant’s authorized dealership, Chino Hills
Ford,” the First Amended Complaint does not specifically allege that Ford’s
authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the sale Ford vehicles to
consumers.  (See FAC ¶10 and
generally).  Even if the facts alleged
are deemed sufficient to impose a duty of disclosure on Ford, the claim fails
for other reasons.     
 
The First Amended Complaint, like the original Complaint,
concedes that Ford issued publicly available TSBs regarding the alleged
Transmission Defect.  (Complaint ¶¶28-32;
FAC ¶¶33-39).  As such, it is still not
clear what additional information regarding the transmission was purportedly
concealed from the dealerships and/or Plaintiffs with whom it appears Ford had
no direct interaction.  As noted above in
relation to the 3rd cause of action, Plaintiffs’ speculation and
inferences are insufficient to support a statutory and fraud claim which
require specific fact pleading.  The
claim also appears to be based, in part, on concealment that allegedly occurred
after Plaintiffs purchased the Vehicle. 
(FAC ¶67).  Information allegedly
concealed after the purchase could not have fraudulently induced Plaintiffs to
purchase the vehicle.  
 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have still failed to allege
sufficient facts to establish that their fraud claim is not barred by the
“economic loss rule.”  “[T]he economic
loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover in strict products liability in tort
when a product defect causes damage to ‘other property,’ that is, property
other than the product itself.  The law
of contractual warranty governs damage to the product itself.”  Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. (2004) 34
C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez (2002) 29 C4th 473, 482-483.  Based on the allegations in the First Amended
Complaint, it still appears that the only duty allegedly breached was that
created by the terms of the warranty and the only harm which resulted from
Ford’s alleged concealment was that Plaintiffs would not have purchased/leased
the Vehicle.  (See Complaint ¶68;
FAC ¶¶75-76 (which are duplicative of one another)).     
 
As noted in the Court’s ruling on Ford’s demurrer to the
original complaint, the holding in Robinson Helicopter was narrowly
limited to “a defendant’s affirmative misrepresentations on which a plaintiff
relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal damages
independent of the Plaintiffs’ economic loss.” 
Robinson Helicopter, supra at 993; In re Ford Motor Co.
(C.D. Cal. 2020) 483 F.Supp.3d 838, 848. 
Here, the fraud claim is based on purported concealment, not affirmative
misrepresentations.
 
Plaintiffs’ reliance on Dhital, supra, for
the proposition that their fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss
rule” is still unpersuasive.  First, Dhital
is under review by the Supreme Court of California as to the economic loss
rule; therefore, it is not citable.  Second,
the Court of Appeal has recently held that unless there is a specific assertion
of agency in the complaint, there is no showing of agency between Ford and the
authorized dealerships.  See Ochoa
(2023) 89 CA5th 1324 (review granted 7/9/23). 
As noted above, while Plaintiffs alleged that they purchased the Vehicle
from an authorized Ford dealership, they have not made sufficient agency
allegations.  
 
Further, Plaintiffs argue that the fraud claim is not
barred by the economic loss rule because “it has long been the rule that where
a contract is secured by fraudulent representations, the injured party may
elect to affirm the contract and sue for fraud.”  (See Opposition, p.3:8-11 citing Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645; Freeman & Mills, Inc. (1995) 11 C4th 85,
108).  Presuming that concealment equates
to affirmative misrepresentations, the foregoing rule still does not seem to
apply in this case as Plaintiffs allege that they seek to revoke acceptance of
the vehicle and/or cancel, not affirm, the purchase from which the warranty
arises.  (See FAC ¶¶9, 13, 51).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained.  While Plaintiffs have requested leave to
amend, if the demurrer is sustained, they do not give any indication as to how
they can cure the defects in their First Amended Complaint as is their burden.  See Blank (1985) 39 C3d 311,
318.  Additionally, Plaintiffs were
already given an opportunity to cure the same defects and failed to do so.  Therefore, leave to amend is denied.  See Titus (2004) 118 CA4th 906,
918; Green (1986) 185 CA3d 544, 556.
