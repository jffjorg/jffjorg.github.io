Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company should be sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed against the 3rd and 5th causes of action in the First Amended Complaint, which alleged violations of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3) and fraudulent inducement-concealment. The judge found that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action for the 3rd cause of action, and that the 5th cause of action was also defective. The judge noted that the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to establish how Ford's alleged failure to make available sufficient service literature and replacement parts caused harm to the plaintiffs, and that the complaint also failed to allege sufficient facts to establish that Ford's alleged concealment of information about the transmission defect was actionable. The judge also found that the complaint's reliance on the case of Dhital was unpersuasive, and that the economic loss rule barred the plaintiffs' claims. The judge denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that they had already been given an opportunity to cure the defects in their complaint and had failed to do so.
