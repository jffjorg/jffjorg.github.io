Theresa Burrows and Mike Allen Bushaw
NOTICE: ok

staying discovery as to Defendant Joshua John Dumas pending resolution of
criminal proceedings against Dumas in Los Angeles Superior Court  (ATPMA082728-01).

 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 3/6/21 between a vehicle driven by Decedent Eileen Morales
(Decedent) and a vehicle driven by Defendant Joshua John Dumas (Dumas).  Decedent died as a result of injuries
sustained in the collision.  On 3/8/22,
criminal charges for vehicular manslaughter were filed in Los Angeles County
against Dumas in case number ATPMA082728-01.  (T. Park Decl., Ex.A).  
 
On 2/16/23, Decedent’s spouse, Alfredo Morales, and
children, Leslie Theresa Burrows and Mike Allen Bushaw (collectively,
Plaintiffs), filed this action for: (1) wrongful death – negligence against
Dumas, (2) wrongful death – negligence against Reman Giroin dba R&H Auto,
(3) loss of consortium against all defendants and (4) survival claims against
all defendants.  On 7/31/23, Plaintiffs
filed a request for dismissal of the complaint as to Reman Giroin dba R&H
Auto.
 
After the parties stipulated to have his default set
aside, Dumas answered the complaint on 8/7/23. 
(See 8/4/23 Stipulation & Order; Dumas Answer filed
8/7/23).  On 8/14/23, Dumas filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order staying discovery as to Dumas
pending resolution of criminal proceedings against Dumas in Los Angeles
Superior Court  (ATPMA082728-01).  Plaintiffs have opposed the motion and Dumas
has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
Defendant is currently awaiting his criminal trial to
begin.  (T. Park Decl. ¶5).
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under the Fifth Amendment of the United States
Constitution “[n]o person shall…be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself.”  Similarly,
under Article I,  Section 15 of the
California Constitution, “[p]ersons may not…be compelled in a criminal case to
be a witness against themselves.”  See
also Fuller (2001) 87 CA4th 299, 302, fn.3.  California Evidence Code 940 provides “[t]o
the extent that such privilege exists under the Constitution of the United
States or the State of California, a person has a privilege to refuse to
disclose any matter that may tend to incriminate him.”  As such, it has been held that the privilege
against self-incrimination may be asserted in civil as well as criminal proceedings.  Fuller, supra at 305 citing Pacers,
Inc. (1984) 162 CA3d 686, 688; See also Lefkowitz (1973) 414
U.S. 70, 77.
 
Dumas is not required to conclusively establish that
answers to discovery will subject him to prosecution or conviction in order to
obtain a stay of discovery.  Zonver
(1969) 270 CA2d 613, 621.  Dumas is
currently facing criminal charges arising out of the same facts and
circumstances as this action wherein Plaintiffs are pursuing punitive damages
against him.  As such, it is reasonable
to conclude that without a stay of discovery as against Dumas in this action,
Dumas’ right against self-incrimination will be compromised as he will be
forced to choose between exercising his right to remain silent and his right to
defend against Plaintiffs’ claims.  See
Fuller, supra at 306 citing Avant! Corporation (2000) 79
CA4th 876, 882; Warford (1984) 160 CA3d 1035, 1044.  One of the accepted ways to accommodate such
a dilemma is to stay the civil proceeding until disposition of the related
criminal prosecution.  Fuller, supra
at 307-308 citing Avant! Corporation, supra at 882; People v.
Coleman (1975) 13 C3d 867, 885; Pacers, Inc., supra at
689-690.
 
The Court finds that it is in the interests of justice
and judicial economy to stay discovery as to Dumas in this action rather than
address each of the likely many future discovery disputes individually or to
require Dumas to seek a protective order/immunity in the criminal case with
regard discovery requests which implicate his right against self-incrimination
as they arise.  
 
Further, contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, Dumas does
not seek to stay all discovery in this action. 
(See Opposition, p.2:2). 
Rather, Dumas only seeks to stay discovery as against himself.  As such, Plaintiffs can proceed with
obtaining testimony of witnesses to the incident, and testimony of those who
knew Decedent and can testify regarding Plaintiffs’ wrongful death damages.  (See Opposition, p.5:7-11).  Therefore, Plaintiffs will not be unduly
prejudiced by granting the relief requested. 
On the other hand, Dumas is likely to suffer severe prejudice if he is
required to participate in civil discovery while the criminal case against him
is pending.  Any inconvenience to
Plaintiffs’ is outweighed by Dumas’ constitutional right against
self-incrimination.  See Pacers,
supra at 690-691.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Discovery is stayed as to all discovery directed to Defendant Joshua
John Dumas until the resolution of the pending criminal case (ATPMA082728-01)
against him arising out of the same facts and circumstances as this civil
case.
