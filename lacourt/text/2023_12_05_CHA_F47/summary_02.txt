And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to stay discovery as to Defendant Joshua John Dumas pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings against him. The Judge finds that the Defendant's right against self-incrimination will be compromised if he is required to participate in civil discovery while the criminal case is pending. The Judge concludes that staying discovery as to the Defendant is in the interests of justice and judicial economy, and that the Plaintiffs will not be unduly prejudiced by this decision. The Judge orders that discovery is stayed as to all discovery directed to the Defendant until the resolution of the pending criminal case.
