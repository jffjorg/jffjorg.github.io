A tentative ruling has been issued in the case of Hunter v. Burris, Case No. 23SMCV02140. The plaintiff, James Hunter, moves for an order compelling the defendant, Darren Burris, to serve verified answers to Form Interrogatories (FROGs). The FROGs were served on June 28, 2023, and responses were due on August 2, 2023. Despite this, the defendant failed to respond. The court has granted the motion to compel, citing the defendant's unexplained failure to respond. The court also requests clarification on the service of the FROGs on Burris, noting that he was represented by the same counsel when he answered the complaint on June 14, 2023.
