And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Breanna C. Webb's motion for leave to amend the Second Amended Complaint to add a new statutory cause of action under FEHA Government Code § 12940(h) for failure to prevent discrimination/retaliation. The Court finds that the proposed amendments are in the interest of justice, as they rely on the same exact sets of facts as the prior alleged facts and do not expand the scope of discovery such that Defendant Pepperdine University would be unduly prejudiced. The Court also notes that the amendment is necessary to cure the defect of the operative SAC not having a proper prayer. However, the Court does not grant sanctions for the claimed 22 hours spent in relation to the motion, as it finds the claim to be unreasonable in time and scope.
