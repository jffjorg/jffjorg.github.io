And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ralitsa Malcheva vs. Armando Jimenez, et al. (Case Number 23STCV16129). The Defendants, The Agent and Company and Liliana Barajas, filed a Demurrer to the Complaint, which the Plaintiff, Ralitsa Malcheva, opposes. The Judge has agreed with the Plaintiff that a continuance of the hearing on the Demurrer is appropriate, as not all parties have had a chance to prepare and there is potential for expedited settlement. The hearing on the Demurrer has been continued to a later date. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings, and that it can only be used to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. The Judge has also considered the case law, including Blank v. Kirwan and Khoury v. Maly's of Cal., Inc., in making the ruling.
