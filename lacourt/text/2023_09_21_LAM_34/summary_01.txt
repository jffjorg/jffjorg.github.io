And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the Demurrer to a later date. The Demurrer was filed by the Defendants, The Agent and Company, and Liliana Barajas, against the Plaintiff, Ralitsa Malcheva. The Plaintiff alleges breach of contract and violations of Civil Code sections 1102, et seq. The Defendants demur to the Plaintiff's first and seventh causes of action.

The Court agrees with the Plaintiff that a continuance of the hearing on the Demurrer would be appropriate, as not all parties have had a chance to prepare, there is potential discussion of expedited settlement, and it was also requested by the Defendants Armando Jimenez and Jimenez Enterprises, LLC. The Court will continue the hearing to a later date, which is to be determined.
