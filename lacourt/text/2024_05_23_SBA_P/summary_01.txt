And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied without prejudice the applications for admission pro hac vice filed by Jeffrey P. Allen and Donald P. Gentile. The applications were filed on April 17, 2024, and sought permission for the attorneys to appear in the case. The court found that the applications were compliant with the necessary requirements, except that neither attorney indicated that the $50 fee was paid to the State Bar of California as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40(e). As a result, the court cannot grant the applications at this time.
