And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, despite the motion being made late in the litigation. The Court finds that the delay in bringing the motion does not constitute bad faith, and that the Defendant's actions were taken in good faith. The cross-claims arise out of the same transaction as the cause of action, and the Defendant's failure to bring the cross-claims may result in forfeiture. The Court is required to grant the motion under Code of Civil Procedure Section 426.50, unless bad faith is demonstrated. The Court finds that the Defendant's motion does not manifest bad faith, and therefore grants the motion. The Defendant shall file and serve the proposed cross-complaint by June 3, 2024.
