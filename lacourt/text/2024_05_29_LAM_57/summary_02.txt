The records in question relate to the selection of two officers over Hoskins for a position on the LAPD SWAT team. The court finds that the plaintiff has a plausible factual foundation for the materiality of the records to his retaliation claim. The court grants the plaintiff's motion for an order requiring the City to disclose the records.
