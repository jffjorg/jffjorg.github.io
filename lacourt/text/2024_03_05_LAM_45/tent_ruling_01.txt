20STCV04820
 
Hearing
date:              March 5, 2024
Moving
Party:             Plaintiff Crystal
Gonzalez
Responding
Party:      Defendants Sculptor Body
Molding, Inc.
 
Motion
to Compel Responses from Defendant Sculptor Body Molding, Inc. to Request for
Production of Documents (Set Three) and Monetary Sanctions
 
            The
court considered the moving papers. 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses from defendant Sculptor Body Molding, Inc. to
Request for Production of Documents (Set Three) is MOOT. Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$768.91.
Where
there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents,
the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response.¿ (C.C.P. § 2031.300(b).)¿
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product.¿ (C.C.P. § 2031.300, (a).)¿ Thus, unless the party to whom the demand
was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to
the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses.¿The
moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing
the motion.¿The Court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging
in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct,
or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. (C.C.P. § 2023.030(a).)  
Plaintiff
propounded the Subject Discovery on May 18, 2023, via electronic service.
(Panosian Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. 2.) Defendant’s responses were therefore due on June
20, 2023. (Ibid.) Defendant failed to respond by that date, necessitating this
motion. (Ibid.) 
However,
on December 6, 2023, Defendant served responses to the subject discovery
requests. As a result, the instant motion is moot. 
Regarding
monetary sanctions, given that Defendant did not serve responses until being
prompted by the filing of this motion, the Court awards monetary sanctions in
favor of moving Defendant in the reduced amount of $768.91, representing one
hour at counsel’s hourly rate plus the filing fee.
 
It
is so ordered.
