The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Crystal Gonzalez vs. Ronald Chao Medical Corporation, et al. The Plaintiff, Crystal Gonzalez, filed a motion to compel responses from the Defendant, Sculptor Body Molding, Inc., to a request for production of documents (Set Three) and to award monetary sanctions. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses is moot since the Defendant served responses to the subject discovery requests on December 6, 2023. However, the Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $768.91, representing one hour at counsel's hourly rate plus the filing fee. The Judge based its decision on California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) sections 2031.300(b) and 2031.300(a), which provide that a party that fails to timely respond to a demand for production of documents waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The Judge also cited C.C.P. section 2023.030(a), which allows for the imposition of monetary sanctions for the misuse of the discovery process.
