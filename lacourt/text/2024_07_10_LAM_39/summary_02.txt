And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV31558, in which the defendants, Choice Hotels International, Inc., Paladin Equity Capital LLC, Philip Powers, and Hotel Management and Consulting HMC, have moved to declare the plaintiff, Gregory Langadinos, a vexatious litigant and require him to post a bond to continue pursuing the action.

The Judge finds that Langadinos has an extensive history of filing unmeritorious actions as a self-represented litigant in California and elsewhere, and that most of his lawsuits were dismissed or remained pending without justification. The Judge notes that Langadinos has filed multiple lawsuits against the same defendants, including Langadinos v. Trustees of Touro College, et al., Langadinos v. Southern New England School of Law, Inc., et al., and Langadinos v. W.R. Berkley Corporation, et al., among others.

The Judge concludes that Langadinos' claims in this action fail, as alleged, and are internally contradictory and incoherent. Therefore, the Judge grants the motion and directs Langadinos to post a bond in the amount of $150,000. The case will be stayed in its entirety until ten days after Langadinos posts the bond, and the Judge will schedule an order to show cause regarding dismissal of the action for failure to furnish security under Code of Civil Procedure section 391.4.
