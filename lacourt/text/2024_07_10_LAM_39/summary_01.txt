The Defendant sought an award of $50,000 in attorney fees, but failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the requested amount, including billing records or a detailed accounting of the time spent on the case. The judge notes that the Defendant's attorney, Navi Signh Dhillon, did not provide evidence of the number of hours worked, the specific nature of the services provided, or the specific tasks that were completed. The judge also notes that Dhillon's declaration did not establish a reasonable hourly rate for the attorney's services. The motion for attorney fees is denied without prejudice, and Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
