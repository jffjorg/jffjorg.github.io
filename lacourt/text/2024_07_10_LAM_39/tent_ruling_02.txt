MOTIONS
            Specially
Appearing Defendants Choice Hotels International, Inc., Paladin Equity Capital
LLC, Philip Powers, and Hotel Management and Consulting HMC (“Defendants”) move
for an order declaring Plaintiff Gregory Langadinos (“Plaintiff”) is a
vexatious litigant and requiring Plaintiff to post a bond to continue pursuing
this action against Defendants. 
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. 
ANALYSIS
A vexatious
litigant is defined, in part, as a person who has, within the last seven years,
“commenced, prosecuted, or maintained” at least five court actions, other than in
small claims court, as a self-represented litigant, where the final
determination of the action was adverse to that person, or where the actions
have remained pending, without justification, for at least two years without
having been brought to trial or hearing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 391, subd. (b)(1).) 
A defendant may move to declare a plaintiff a vexatious litigant and to
require that plaintiff to “furnish security.” 
The court shall grant the requested relief, if the defendant advances
evidence that there is no reasonable probability the plaintiff will prevail in
the litigation against the moving defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 391.1, 391.2, 391.3.)
The court grants
Defendants’ request for judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452
and 453.  
Based on the information Defendants have
placed before the court, it appears Plaintiff has an extensive history of
filing unmeritorious actions as a self-represented litigant in California and
elsewhere.  A representative set of the
cases include filings in Langadinos v. Trustees of Touro College, et al.
(E.D.N.Y, 1999, No. CV-99-4211), which the court dismissed in its entirety in
its order of May 31, 2022 (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibits A, B); Langadinos v. Southern New England School of
Law, Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. Suffolk County
Mass., 2008, Case  No. 2008-2064),
dismissed in a May 3, 2012 order and including an enjoinment order an order concerning
attorney fees and costs (id., Exhibit C, E, F, G);  Langadinos
v. Southern New England School of Law, Inc., et al.
(Super. Ct. Middlesex County Mass., 2012, No. 2011-2357), dismissed in a July
19, 2011 order (id.,
Exhibits D(1), E); Lagadinos v. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Massachusetts,
Case No. CIV.A. 1:12-11159-GAO (id., Exhibit D, I, J); and Langadinos v. W.R. Berkley Corporation, et
al. (D.Mass., 2012, No. 12-CV-11159-GAO), in
which Plaintiff was enjoined from making any further filings in that case, or
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts without
leave of Court (id., H,). 
 
Within the last seven years, Plaintiff filed Langadinos v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals
Board. (B288996), which the Court of Appeal
summarily denied in its order of May 13, 2018 (Request for Judicial Notice, supra, Exhibit L);  Langadinos
v. Servicemaster Terminix, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, 2018, No. SC129102), dismissed in a February 26, 2021 order (id., Exhibit M); Langadinos v. Oliver, et al. (Super. Ct.
L.A. County, 2019, No. 19STCV32656) dismissed (id., Exhibit N);
Langadinos v. Hamideh, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2020, No. 20LBCV00156) (id.,
P, P(1), P(2); Langadinos v. The
RMR Group Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. Orange County,
2022, No. 30-2022-01251700-CU-PO-NJC) (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibits N, P, R).  Plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of the
last set of cases is an adverse determination for purposes of determining
whether Plaintiff is a vexatious litigant. 
(Tokerud v. Capitol Bank Sacramento (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 775,
779.)  
Plaintiff also filed
Langadinos v. MacDonald, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2019, No. 19STCV45414),
which has been pending since December 16, 2019.  (Request for Judicial Notice, supra, Exhibit
O.)  Counsel initially represented
Plaintiff, but Plaintiff has been self-represented in that matter since February
17, 2022.  Aside from the pendency of Plaintiff’s
appeal, which was pending from December 15, 2023 to April 19, 2024, the case has
been pending for four years and 82 days, without proceeding to trial.  It, thus, has remained pending, without
justification, for more than two years. 
Plaintiff also filed Langadinos v.
Life Time Inc., et al. (C.D.Cal., 2023, No. 5:23-CV-00940),
which the court dismissed in its order of September 6, 2023.  (Id., Exhibit S.)   As such, Plaintiff
has filed or maintained more than five actions in the last five years, which
were determined adversely to Plaintiff, or have remained pending for more than
two years without justification.  
Through a chronicle of various cases and several
others not noted, Defendants have demonstrated Plaintiff is a vexatious
litigant not just because of the sheer volume of filings, but also because the
vast majority of the cases involved multiple filings against the same
defendants and appear to lack merit.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 391(b)(2), (3).) .  Plaintiff must post a bond if “there is not a
reasonable probability that [Plaintiff] will prevail in the litigation against”
Defendants.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.1,
subd. (a).)  
The Court finds Plaintiff’s claims in this
action fail, as alleged. They are internally contradictory and incoherent.  For example, Plaintiff alleges both that he
was falsely imprisoned in his hotel room and locked out of his hotel room
within one cause of action.  (See, e.g., Complaint,
¶¶ 44-46.)  As such, Plaintiff fails to
allege any cognizable claims against Defendants.  
The motion is granted.  The court directs Plaintiff to file a bond in
the amount of $150,000.  This case will
be stayed in its entirety until ten days after Plaintiff posts the bond.  The court will schedule an order to show
cause regarding dismissal of this action for failure to furnish security under
Code of Civil Procedure section 391.4.  
Defendants are to give notice of this order
and to file proof of service of same.
