And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel. The motion was filed due to an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court accepted the necessity of client confidentiality and offered to meet with counsel in chambers if requested. The motion complied with all procedural requirements. The trial remains set for September 3, 2024.
