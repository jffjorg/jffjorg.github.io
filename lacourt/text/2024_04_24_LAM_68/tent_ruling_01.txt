RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
MOVING
ATTORNEY: Jonathan Gerber
CLIENT:
Defendant,
Malvina Ghawai
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Craig Graces alleges an agreement to lend
Defendant Malvina
Ghawai and The Ghauoui Group, LLC $100,000 based on a purported representation
that Ghawai was in process of importing $5,000,000 in personal protective
equipment from South Korea, and therefore needed a 120 day bridge loan to
complete the transaction. Plaintiff was promised a 35% return on investment.
The loan was funded in two separate $50,000 wire transfers on March 3 and 5,
2021. Defendants defaulted on the loans. 
 
On November 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Breach of Contract, Fraud—Promise Made without an Intent to Perform, and
Conversion. Defendants answered on July 13, 2023. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for Defendant Malvina Ghawai moves to be relieved as
counsel of record, due to an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney client
relationship. 
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the necessity of client confidentiality, and will meet counsel in
chambers, if requested. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves
v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion
otherwise complies with all procedural requirements. The motion is therefore
granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client.
 
Trial remains set for September 3, 2024.
 
Moving
attorney to provide notice.
