   INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO
 
Dept.

8:30
  a.m.
April 29,
  2023



 
On December 22, 2023, defendants
Geronimo Rodriguez, M.D. and Medical Offices of Geronimo Rodriguez
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed this motion for an order compelling
plaintiff Rocio Macias (“Plaintiff”) to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set
Two. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections
to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff did not oppose the Motion and
it is undisputed responses were not served. Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses without objections to Form
Interrogatories (Set Two) within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
 
Dated
this 29th
day of April 2024
