Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion filed by Plaintiff Violeta Martin to compel Defendant Donald Rance Welch to serve responses to discovery requests. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses, and the Plaintiff filed a motion for an order establishing admissions of fact by the Defendant. The Judge granted the motion, ordering the Defendant to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days. However, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $143.91, as the notice of motion did not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure.
