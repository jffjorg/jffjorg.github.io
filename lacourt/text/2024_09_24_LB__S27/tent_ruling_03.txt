 Case Number:  23LBCV01728    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  S27 The Court was scheduled to hear
Plaintiff’s MTCF re: RPDs, Set Two on 9/10/24. 
The Court continued the hearing to 9/24/24, to be heard concurrently
with Plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition of PMK.  The Court ordered:
If the parties are able to resolve
the remaining issues, they must take the motions off calendar.  If they are unable to do so, they must file a
joint statement of items in dispute at least seven court days prior to the
continued hearing date.  The joint
statement must list each discovery item in dispute, the most current response
to that item, and each party’s statement of why a further response should or
should not be ordered.  The joint
statement must make arguments relevant only to the item in dispute, not to the
other items, so the Court can easily and quickly rule on each item.  
 
If the parties are unable to
resolve all outstanding issues, the Court will consider appointment of a
discovery referee at the 9/24/24 hearing. 
The Court sets an OSC re: appointment of a discovery referee for 9/24/24
at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  
 
The parties failed to file a joint
statement of items in dispute.  Instead
Plaintiff filed a document referred to as a joint statement, but it is merely
Plaintiff’s recitation of her position that further responses to RPDs are
necessary and a PMK deposition is necessary. 
Defendant filed opposition to the motion to compel PMK deposition, and
filed nothing further in connection with the MTCF.  
 
The Court will not do the parties’
work for them.  The Court will hear from
the parties, at the hearing, about appointment of a discovery referee.  The Court will also discuss any necessary
continuance of the FSC and trial date in light of the parties’ ongoing failure
to resolve their discovery dispute.
