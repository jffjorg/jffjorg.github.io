 Case Number:  23LBCV01318    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff filed this motion on
9/04/24, setting it for hearing on 9/24/24. 
9/24/24 is fourteen court days after 9/04/24, rendering the motion
untimely filed per CCP §1005(b), which requires papers to be filed at least
sixteen court days prior to the hearing. 
Sixteen court days prior to 9/24/24 fell on Friday, 8/30/24 (because
Monday, 9/02/24 was a court holiday).  
 
Plaintiff filed proof of service of
the moving papers on Defendants and Deponent, showing service by regular mail
and email on Sunday, 9/01/24.  CCP
§1013(a) extends time for mail service by an additional five calendar
days.  §1010.6(a)(3)(B) extends time for
email service by an additional two calendar days.  Thus, mail service was required no later than
8/25/24 and email service was required no later than 8/28/24.  
 
Compounding the issue, pursuant to
CRC 3.1346, all moving papers filed in connection with a motion to compel
deposition of non-party must be personally served on a non-party deponent.  Plaintiff filed proof of service of the
moving papers on the non-party deponent via email and regular mail, but not
personal service.  
 
The motion to compel is denied due
to lack of sufficient notice of the hearing on the motion.    
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.    
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on this matter.
