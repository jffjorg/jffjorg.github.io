And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate default and default judgment filed by the defendant, Michael Hollinghurst and Network Financial Service. The motion was filed on September 3, 2024, but was untimely filed as it was filed only 15 court days prior to the hearing date of September 24, 2024. The court's rules require at least 16 court days' notice prior to the hearing. The defendant also failed to serve the moving papers on the plaintiff, Heather Szafranski, in a timely manner. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court, and if no one submits on the tentative, the motion may be placed off calendar.
