And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition of a non-party due to lack of sufficient notice of the hearing on the motion. The plaintiff filed the motion 14 court days before the hearing, which is untimely under CCP §1005(b) requiring 16 court days notice. Additionally, the plaintiff did not serve the papers personally on the non-party deponent, as required by CRC 3.1346. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice to the defendant and deponent. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court and make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing if necessary.
