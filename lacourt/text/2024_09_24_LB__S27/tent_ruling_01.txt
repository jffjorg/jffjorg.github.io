  Case Number:  21LBCV00160    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Heather Szafranski filed
this action against Defendants, Michael Hollinghurst and his company, Network
Financial Service, for quiet title, fraud, cancellation of instruments,
rescission of contracts, and declaratory relief.  The crux of the complaint is that Plaintiff
signed a promissory note with Defendant, but believed the transaction was
canceled; Defendant, in violation of the parties’ agreement, filed the deed of
trust on the property.  
 
Plaintiff filed the complaint on
3/26/21.  The Clerk, at Plaintiff’s
request, entered Defendant’s default on 11/04/21.  On 11/17/21, after a default judgment
prove-up hearing, the Court issued judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant.  The judgment makes clear that
Plaintiff owns the subject property and Defendants have no interest in the
subject property.  It also makes clear
that the promissory note upon which Defendants base their claim is null and
void.  The judgment provides, “Defendants
are to cancel the promissory note and Improper Deed of Trust (document number
8-0719664) and to deliver it to the Plaintiff or to the clerk of this Court for
cancellation.”
 
2.     Motion
to Vacate Default and Default Judgment
Defendant filed this motion on
9/03/24, setting it for hearing on 9/24/24. 
9/24/24 is fifteen court days after 9/03/24, rendering the motion
untimely filed per CCP §1005(b), which requires papers to be filed at least
sixteen court days prior to the hearing. 
Sixteen court days prior to 9/24/24 fell on Friday, 8/30/24 (because
Monday, 9/02/24 was a court holiday).  
 
Defendant filed proof of service of
the moving papers on Plaintiff, showing service by email on Sunday,
9/01/24.  §1010.6(a)(3)(B) extends time
for email service by an additional two calendar days.  Thus, email service was required no later
than 8/28/24.  
 
The motion is denied due to failure
to timely file and serve the moving papers. 

 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
