And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections filed by Plaintiff Stephanie Hernandez. The motion was filed in response to Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc.'s discovery propounded on May 20, 2024. The Plaintiff attempted to serve responses on June 21, 2024, but due to an automated folder service issue, the responses were served by zip file and Plaintiff did not realize that they did not go through until Defendant filed motions to compel on July 1, 2024. The Judge notes that the parties have discovery disputes and has scheduled an OSC re: appointment of a discovery referee for September 24, 2024.

The Judge is hopeful that the parties have resolved their issues and will avoid the appointment of a discovery referee. If the parties submit on this ruling, the Court will presume that they have resolved their issues, discharge the OSC, and take the motion off calendar. If the parties have not resolved their discovery issues, they must appear and be ready to discuss the remaining issues and the possibility of appointment of a referee.

The parties are ordered to give notice and those who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If the department does not receive an email indicating that the parties are submitting on the tentative, the motion may be placed off calendar.
