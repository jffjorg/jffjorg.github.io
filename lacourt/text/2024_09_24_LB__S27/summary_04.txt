And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Tony Huy Lim and Margaret Chung, have filed a demurrer to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Kenyeta Thompson, et al. The demurrer is sustained in its entirety on the grounds that the first, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action are defective. The demurrer is sustained because the plaintiffs have not attached a copy of the contract and have not pled which term of the contract was breached. Additionally, the plaintiffs have not pled a claim for wrongful termination, and they have not pled that the termination was illegal.

The defendants also move to strike the prayer for punitive damages, which is granted. The motion to strike is granted because the complaint lacks facts supporting the claims of fraud, malice, and/or oppression. The defendants also move to strike the prayer for attorneys' fees, which is moot in light of the ruling on the demurrer.

The court orders the defendants to file an answer to the complaint, with the subject causes of action and prayers for damages deemed stricken, within twenty days. The parties are reminded that there is a Case Management Conference on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike.
