And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2024. The hearing was originally set for September 10, 2024, but was continued to allow the parties to resolve their outstanding discovery issues. The judge ordered the parties to file a joint statement listing each discovery item in dispute, the most recent response to each item, and each party's statement on why further responses should or should not be ordered. The judge also warned that if the parties are unable to resolve their disputes, the court may consider appointing a discovery referee to help resolve the issues. However, the parties failed to file the required joint statement, instead submitting a document from the plaintiff and an opposition from the defendant. The judge will not do the parties' work for them and will instead hear from them at the hearing about the appointment of a discovery referee. The judge may also discuss continuing the FSC and trial date due to the parties' ongoing failure to resolve their discovery disputes.
