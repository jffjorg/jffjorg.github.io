Vehicle”) to Plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and
developed other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty.

PLAINTIFF’S EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
1. Declaration of Erin Tallent: OVERRULED
2. Declaration of Chris Lewis: OVERRULED
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
The propounding party may bring a motion to compel further responses
to a demand for production if the propounding party deems that production
is deficient, incomplete, or contains meritless objections. (CCP §
2031.310(a)).  The legal burden to justify refusing or failing to
provide discovery lies with the objecting party. (Coy v. Superior
Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220). A motion to compel further
response to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a good-faith meet-and-confer declaration.
(CCP § 2031.310(b)). “A determination of whether an attempt at informal
resolution is adequate . . . involves the exercise of discretion.” (Stewart
v. Colonial W. Agency (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016). 
“The history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel,
the nature of the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the
prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant.  Judges
have broad powers and responsibility to determine what measure and procedures
are appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Id.) 
 
Meet and Confer: 
 
Here, Plaintiff submitted discovery on propounded Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, on Defendant Volkswagen World Group of America Inc.,
seeking documents relating to: (1) Plaintiff’s own vehicle; (2) Defendant’s
warranty and repurchase policies, procedures, and practices; and (3)
Defendant’s knowledge of the same or similar defects in other vehicles of the
same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle on June 27, 2023. (Dec.
Sogoyan, ¶19). Defendant served its responses on July 31, 2023. (Id. at
¶20.)
 
Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter on August 7, 2023, with
supplemental responses due on August 14, 2023. (Id. at ¶22; Exhibit 5.) On
August 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel followed up on the meet and confer letter
and requested availability for a telephonic meet and confer. On August 15,
2023, Defendant’s Counsel replied to Plaintiff’s email to schedule a telephonic
meet and confer. (Dec. Tallent ¶10,12,14; Exhibit C.) Later that day, Plaintiff
sent another meet and confer letter after Defendant Volkswagen Group of
America, Inc. failed to provide supplemental responses. (Id. at ¶27;
Exhibit 6.) The meet and confer letter indicated that the responses were due on
August 22, 2023. (Id. at ¶28; Exhibit 6.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s Counsel
satisfied the CCP § 2031.310(b) meet and confer requirements because counsel
sent two meet and confer letters and tried to set up a telephonic meeting. 
 
Separate Statement
 
Under Rule 3.1345, a Separate Statement must include the request, the
response, and reason that a further response is needed. Here, the Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement has the required information. (Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement p. 3-205.)
 
Timeliness
 
Under CCP § 2030.300, a party has 45 days after receipt of the verified
responses to file a motion to compel further. Here, the verified responses were
provided on July 31, 2023. (Dec. Sogoyan ¶20). Forty-five business days after July
31, 2023 is October 3, 2023. Thus, the motion is timely. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set One on the grounds that Defendant
waived its objections and failed to provide adequate responses. Defendant
argues that the (1) Plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith, (2)
VWGoA has served appropriate objections/responses and produced all documents
that Plaintiff needs to determine issues of liability under the Song-Beverly
Act, including relevant repair orders, technical communications, the technical
service bulletin performed on the vehicle, pre-litigation contact logs, and
VWGoA’s policy and procedure materials, and (3) Plaintiff fails to establish
good cause for any additional responses or documents.
 
The Code of Civil Procedure contemplates three forms of proper responses to
a request for production: a statement of compliance in full or in part (CCP §
2031.220); a statement of inability to comply (CCP § 2031.230);
and a partial objection coupled with a statement of compliance or representation
of inability to comply (CCP § 2031.240). 
 
Here, Defendant objected to Nos. 1-37. (Defendant Volkswagen Group of
America Inc.’s Responses). For instance, Defendant responded with a statement
of inability to comply to Nos. 1-5, 7-23, 25-28, but still produced responsive
documents. (Defendant’s Separate Statement Nos.1-5, 7-23, 25-28; Dec. Lewis ¶7).
With respect to Nos. 6, 24, and 29, Defendant responded that no documents exist
in its custody/possession/control which is also a statement of inability to
comply. (Defendant’s Separate Statement Nos. 6,24,29). Moreover, Defendant also
properly objected to Nos. 30-37 because it said that the demand was overbroad
and burdensome. (Defendant’s Separate Statement Nos. 30-37; Dec. Lewis ¶8-15).
Plaintiff replies that the Defendant’s argument fails because it is unfounded
and fails to conform to the Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff’s reliance on Coriell
v. Superior Court is instructive. In Coriell, the court reasoned
that “although asserting that answers to some of the designated interrogatories
will be oppressive because of the expenditure of time and money to compile data
from records, [defendant] omits any showing of why those interrogatories cannot
be answered as permitted in Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030 (c).” However,
here, Defendants did provide additional information, such as Plaintiff’s
failure to “reasonably particularize each category of item” requested. (Coriell
v. Superior Court (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 487, 493 [114 Cal.Rptr. 310].)
 
Therefore, Requests for Further Responses as to Production of Documents
Nos. 1-37 is DENIED.  
 
Conclusion: 
Moving party is to give notice.
