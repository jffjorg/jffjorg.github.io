Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is sustained with leave to amend for the First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract, the Second Cause of Action for Common Counts, and the Third Cause of Action for Invasion of Privacy. The Court has denied leave to amend for the Fourth Cause of Action for Defamation. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint fails to provide sufficient facts to support the claims of Breach of Contract, Common Counts, and Invasion of Privacy, and that the Fourth Cause of Action for Defamation is not supported by the facts alleged in the Complaint.
