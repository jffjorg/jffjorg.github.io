BURT,         Plaintiff,     Case No.:     23TRCV04190       vs.         [Tentative]    Sustained         US BANK,    CLARISA ESPINOZA, et al.,                 Defendants.                                Hearing  Date:              October  18, 2024   Moving Parties:          Defendants US Bank and Clarisa  Espinoza   Responding Party:      Plaintiff Colin J. Burt   HEARING: Demurrer to the Second  Amended Complaint               The Court considered the moving papers.   RULING                          The Court  sustains the Demurrer without leave to amend.   BACKGROUND              On December  21, 2023, Plaintiff Colin J. Burt filed the initial Complaint alleging causes  of action common counts, grand larceny, and negligence  against Defendants US  Bank and Clarisa Espinoza. Plaintiff sought compensatory damages and punitive  damages in the amount of $100,000.               On January 22, 2024, Defendants US  Bank and Clarisa Espinoza filed the Demurrer to the initial Complaint.                          On January 31, 2024, Defendants  filed the Amended Demurrer to the Initial Complaint.              On  February 8, 2024, the Court sustained Defendants’ Demurrer with leave to amend.   On  May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint.   On  June 20, 2024, Defendants Filed the Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.               On July 19, 2024, the  Court sustained  Defendants’ Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with leave to amend.               On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the operative “Amended Amended Complaint” (Second Amended Complaint) alleging  causes of action for breach of contract, common counts, invasion of privacy,  and defamation.               On August 26, 2024, Defendants filed  the Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint.   LEGAL STANDARD               A demurrer can be  used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under  attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank  v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint  need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary  fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be  alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)  53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of  the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts  properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th  962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or  conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d  695, 713.)    A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or  unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §  430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the  failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing  defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to. (Williams v.  Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However,  “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is  in some respects uncertain because ambiguities can be clarified under modern  discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14  Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)      DISCUSSION    Meet and Confer    Before filing a  demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by  telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer  for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would  resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added, Code  Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)                On August 2, 2024, Defendants attempted to meet and  confer with Plaintiff via phone and email. However, Plaintiff did not respond  prior to the filing of this Demurrer. (Howe Declaration ¶ 16; Exhibit M.) The Court  finds this is sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement.   Cause  of Action 1 – Breach of Contract               “To establish a cause of action  for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of  the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)  the defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Maxwell  v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98 [internal citation omitted].) For  a written contract, the plaintiff may “plead the legal effect of the contract  rather than the price language.” (Ibid.) To “plead a contract by its  legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms. This  is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,  comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.’” (McKell  v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)                 Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint fails to establish sufficient facts to support the first cause of  action for Breach of Contract. (Opposition p. 6.) For a breach of contract  claim to be valid, Plaintiff must demonstrate that a contract existed between  him and Defendants, that he fulfilled his contractual obligations, that the  conditions for Defendants’ performance were met, and that US Bank failed to  perform its required duties, causing harm to Plaintiff. (Opposition p. 7.) However,  Plaintiff did not allege that a contract was ever formed with US Bank, nor did  he provide facts showing that any contract conditions were unmet or that US  Bank breached any terms. (Opposition 7.)               Plaintiff submitted no opposition to this motion.               In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that an oral contract  was created, under which Plaintiff agreed to pay back 100,000$ over an  uncertain amount of time at an uncertain interest rate. (SAC p. 6.)  Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants have  not made the agreed upon principal payments. (SAC p. 6.)    When ruling on a  demurrer, the Court “does not admit contentions, deductions or  conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar, supra, 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) A  demurrer to a breach of contract claim may be sustained when the terms are  objectively uncertain. (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American Homes of  California, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 659, 671.)     Here, Plaintiff has pleaded no facts that show  the essential terms of the purported contract, including the interest rate or  duration of the loan. Instead, he merely concludes that a contract was created  for a $100,000 loan without any defined interest rate or duration. (See, Daar,  supra, 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Performance Plastering, 153  Cal.App.4th 659, 671.) Therefore, the demurrer to the first cause of action for  breach of contract is sustained with leave to amend.               Cause  of Action 2 – Common Counts               “Recovery in quantum meruit does not require a  contract.” (Maglica v. Maglica (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 442, 449.) Instead,  the party must show “the circumstances were such that ‘the services were  rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties that  compensation therefor was to be made.” (Chodos v. Borman (2014) 227  Cal.App.4th 76, 96.)  “The underlying idea behind quantum meruit is the  law's distaste for unjust enrichment. If one has received a benefit which one  may not justly retain, one should restore the aggrieved party to his or her  former position by return of the thing or its equivalent in money.” (Maglica,  supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 449.)               Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint fails to provide any facts or reasonable inferences suggesting  that Plaintiff was expressly or impliedly requested to perform services for  Defendants. (Opposition p. 8.)               Plaintiff submitted no opposition to this  motion.               The Complaint states that Defendants became indebted to  Plaintiff for money had and received by Defendants for the use and benefit of  Plaintiff. (SAC p. 6.)               Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts suggesting Plaintiff  rendered any service for Defendants, for which he expected to be paid. (See, Chodos, supra,  227  Cal.App.4th 76, 96.) Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer to the second  cause of action with leave to amend.   Cause  of Action 3 – Invasion of Privacy               “It is well settled that there are three elements of a  cause of action predicated on tortious invasion of privacy. First, the  disclosure of the private facts must be a public disclosure. Second, the facts  disclosed must be private facts and not public ones. Third, the matter made  public must be one which would be offensive and objectionable to a reasonable  person of ordinary sensibilities.” (Sipple v. Chron. Publ’g Co. (1984)  154 Cal.App.3d 1040, 1045 [internal citations omitted].)               Defendants argue that Plaintiff's complaint fails to  provide any facts supporting a claim for invasion of privacy. (Opposition p. 8.) Plaintiff  does not allege any facts suggesting he had a reasonable expectation of privacy  in the information he voluntarily provided to the bank when applying for a  loan. There is no claim of intrusion or disclosure of personal information nor  any allegation of harm resulting from such an invasion. (Opposition p.  8-9.)               Plaintiff submitted no opposition to this motion.                The Complaint states that Plaintiff entered one of  Defendant’s branches, requesting a loan to purchase a Tesla. He then was asked  basic questions by Defendants about the loan.               Therefore, because Plaintiff has alleged no facts that  show Defendants disclosed any fact about Plaintiff, nor that Defendants  intruded in any way on Plaintiff's privacy, the Court sustains the Demurrer to  the third cause of action with leave to amend. (See, Sipple, supra, 154  Cal.App.3d 1040, 1045.)   Cause  of Action 4 – Defamation                          The elements of a defamation claim are (1) a  publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged, and (5) has a  natural tendency to injure or causes special damage. (John Doe 2 v. Superior  Ct. (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1300, 1312 [internal citations and quotations  omitted].) The defamatory statement must specifically refer to, or be of and  concerning, the plaintiff.” (Ibid.)                          Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint fails to provide any facts supporting a defamation claim.  (Opposition p. 9-10.) Plaintiff  does not allege that US Bank made any statements to a third party or that  anyone interpreted a statement as defamatory. (Opposition p. 9-10.)               Plaintiff submitted no opposition to this  motion.               The Complaint states that Plaintiff entered  one of Defendant’s branches, requesting a loan to purchase a Tesla. He was then  asked basic questions by the Defendants about the loan. The Complaint  further alleges that Plaintiff made a physical advance toward Defendant and put  her under citizen’s arrest.               Plaintiff has pleaded no facts that show Defendants made  any false publication about him. (See, John Doe 2, supra,  1 Cal.App.5th 1300, 1312.) Therefore, the  Court sustains the Demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to  amend. In deciding not to grant leave to amend, the Count notes that Plaintiff  failed to correct the same deficiencies from the two prior complaints.
