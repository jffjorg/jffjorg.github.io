[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



            
            Plaintiff Brandi Rothans (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant July 5th LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff seeks judgment
in the total amount of $27,762.26, comprising $21,720.00 in damages, $202.52 in interest, $2,555.59 in costs, and $3,284.15
in attorney’s fees. 
            The Court notes several defects with the
submitted default judgment package.¿
First, Plaintiff
seeks $21,720.00 in damages. However, Plaintiff does not appear to provide
evidence substantiating this amount of requested damages. Plaintiff asserts
that she is owed $5,320 in unpaid minimum wages and overtime wages, and $5,760
in unpaid business expenses. (Rothans Decl., ¶¶ 13, 19.) These amounts add up
to $11,080.00. Moreover, as discussed below, the Court finds that there are
issues with the damages amounts requested. 

In her supporting declaration, Plaintiff asserts that she is “owed
approximately $5,320 in unpaid minimum wages and overtime wages…This amount was
calculated by adding the total amount of unpaid minimum wages that Defendant
failed to pay me from the date of my termination (February 2022) up to the date
I began my current employment (June 2022), which was a span of approximately
four months…plus unpaid overtime wages that Defendant failed to pay me…” (Rothans
Decl., ¶ 13.) However, Plaintiff
does not appear to explain why she is purportedly entitled to minimum and
overtime wages for a period in which she was not working for Defendant.
Plaintiff does not appear to cite to any legal authority supporting this
proposition. 
Plaintiff also asserts that “Defendant Debt Resolution Centers owes me
$5,760 in unpaid business expenses from June 2019 through February 2022 for
business expenses which I incurred in the performance of my job duties.”
(Rothans Decl., ¶ 19.) The Court notes that “Debt Resolution Centers” is not a
defendant in this action, and Plaintiff seeks default judgment against July 5th
LLC. 
Second, Item 7 of the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) is
blank. 
Third, Plaintiff’s request for $3,284.15 in attorney’s fees exceeds
the permissible amount under Los Angeles Superior Court Local ¿¿Rule 3.214¿¿. It appears that Plaintiff determined
the requested amount based on calculations for a default case over $100,000. (See
LASC Local Rules 3.214; Karsik Decl., ¶ 32.)
However, Plaintiff seeks $21,720.00 in damages here.  
Fourth, Plaintiff’s proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) should check the
box for “By Court” under “JUDGMENT.”
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice. The Court
will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment
package.
