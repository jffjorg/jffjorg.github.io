And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wesco Insurance Company vs. Native Creations Inc. and dba Creative Innovations. The case involves a motion for an assignment order, which would allow Wesco to take control of Native Creations' rights to payment of money due or to become due from its activities as a contractor. The motion was previously unopposed, but the court continued the hearing to November 8, 2024, to allow for further explanation of Wesco's calculation of the total sum due. However, Wesco failed to file a declaration addressing the court's request for additional information by the deadline, and the hearing has been continued to a date to be determined. Wesco is ordered to file and serve a declaration addressing the request for additional information and to provide notice of this ruling.
