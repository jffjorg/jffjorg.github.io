[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
MOTION FOR ASSIGNMENT ORDER RE: RIGHTS TO PAYMENT OF MONEY DUE OR TO
  BECOME DUE [PROCEEDS GENERATED BY CSLB LICENSE NO. 380415]



 
On May 11, 2020, Plaintiff Wesco Insurance
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Native Creations Inc.
and dba Creative Innovations (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges six causes of
action for breach of contract.  
Plaintiff previously moved for an
order assigning to Plaintiff the interest, if any, of Defendant in its rights
to payment of money due or to become due from its activities as a contractor or
generated through the use of California Contractors State License Board License
No. 380415, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment entered in this
action. The motion was unopposed. 
On October 17, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing
on the instant motion to November 8, 2024. The Court’s October 17, 2024 Order
noted that “a further explanation appears to be necessary regarding Plaintiff’s
calculation of $82,271.81 as the total sum due.” (October 17, 2024 Order at p.
5:2-3.) The Court noted that “Plaintiff is to file and serve a declaration
addressing the foregoing request for additional information by 11/1, 2024, with
a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50.” (Id. at p. 5:7-9.)  
It does not appear that Plaintiff has filed any declaration in
accordance with the Court’s October 17, 2024 Order. Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to _______________,
2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50. Plaintiff is to file and serve a declaration
addressing the request for additional information discussed in the October 17,
2024 Order by _______________, 2024, with a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50.

Plaintiff is ordered to provide
notice of this ruling.
