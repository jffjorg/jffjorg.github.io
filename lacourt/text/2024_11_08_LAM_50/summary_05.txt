And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the request for default judgment submitted by Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta, Salvador Gomez, Marcos Ochoa, and Xiomara Sanchez against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and John Greenwood. The Plaintiffs are seeking a total of $32,735.31, comprising damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. However, the Court notes that the submitted default judgment package lacks evidence to support the attorney's fees requested. Specifically, the supporting declaration from Plaintiffs' counsel only discusses the calculation of attorney's fees under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214, but does not provide evidence of the work performed or hourly rate. Therefore, the Court denies the request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with Plaintiffs a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
