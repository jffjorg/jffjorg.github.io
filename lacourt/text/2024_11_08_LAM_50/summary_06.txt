And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer and a motion to strike in a case involving a plaintiff who was allegedly assaulted and injured by a train operator, Defendant John Doe, while attempting to board a train. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against a public entity for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately states a cause of action under Government Code section 815.2. The motion to strike was also filed by the defendant, seeking to strike the fourth cause of action alleging negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations are relevant and properly pleaded.
