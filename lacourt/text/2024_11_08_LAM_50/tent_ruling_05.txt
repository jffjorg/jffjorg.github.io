[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta, Salvador Gomez, Marcos Ochoa, and Xiomara Sanchez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) request entry of default
judgment against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and John Greenwood. Plaintiffs
seek judgment in the total amount of $32,735.31, comprising $26,480.00 in damages, $4,026.58 in
interest, $923.53 in costs, and $1,305.20 in attorney’s fees.  
The Court notes one remaining defect with the submitted
default judgment package. The Court’s June 26,
2024 Order on Plaintiffs’ prior request for default
judgment provides, inter alia, that “[i]n the April 16, 2024 Order on
Plaintiffs’ prior request, the Court noted that ‘Plaintiffs do not appear to
provide a supporting declaration from their counsel substantiating the
attorney’s fees requested.’”
(June 26, 2024 Order at p. 3:4-7.) Plaintiffs still do not appear to provide evidence
supporting the attorney’s fees requested (e.g., work performed, hourly
rate, etc.). Plaintiffs’ counsel’s supporting declaration solely discusses the
calculation of attorney’s fees under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule
3.214. (Idrees Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiffs a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
