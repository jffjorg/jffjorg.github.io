And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving and opposing papers in this case, which involves a petition for court review of a state hearing filed by Barbara Friedman against Margaret Boyd, Chief ALJ for the Director of CDSS, and the California Department of Social Services. Friedman is seeking to overturn a decision regarding her Los Angeles County EBT benefits. The court finds that the petition is a petition for writ of mandate, which should be filed in the Central District, but since the defendant does not function wholly within the Southwest District, the court will continue the demurrer to November 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and send the case to Department 1 for reassignment to writs and receivers.
