Demurrer
to Petition for Court Review of State Hearing
 
            The Court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.
            On March 11, 2024, plaintiff Barbara
Friedman (self-represented) filed a petition for court review of state hearing
against Margaret Boyd, Chief ALJ for Director of CDSS, and California
Department of Social Services pursuant to CCP §1094.5, as to her Los Angeles
County EBT benefits.
            Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(A) states, in
part:  “Every proceeding seeking a writ
of prohibition or mandate (except as provided in subsection (B) below) must be
filed in the Central District.”  As
relevant here, Subsection B provides an optional filing in a district other
than the Central District in a mandate case, where the defendant functions
wholly therein.  
            The Court finds that the petition is
a petition for writ of mandate, in an unlimited civil case, and defendant/respondent
does not function wholly within the Southwest District.  Thus, the Court CONTINUES the demurrer to November
20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and sends the case to Dept. 1 for reassignment to writs
and receivers.
