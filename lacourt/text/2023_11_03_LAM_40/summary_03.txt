Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings against the Defendant's Answer. The Plaintiff, Marcus Webster, is seeking judgment on the pleadings against the Defendant's 30 affirmative defenses, arguing that the defenses are pleaded without sufficient facts. The Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, argues that the Answer is sufficient and can be amended if necessary. The Court finds that, at a minimum, one of the defenses stands on its own and can survive a sufficiency challenge. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and instead finds that discovery is the proper mechanism by which to obtain further information relating to the Answer and its defenses and/or denials.
