Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Ahmad Chiha's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The ruling grants the motion, in part, in the amount of $58,231.60 in reasonable attorneys' fees as the prevailing plaintiff in this SBA action. The fees are broken down by attorney, with a 30% reduction in reasonable hours across the board.

The judge finds that the skill displayed by Plaintiff's counsel in this action and their years of experience practicing law support the requested fee rates. However, the judge agrees that Plaintiff's counsel overlitigated the case, meriting a reduction in hours. The judge also agrees that fees relating to travel were unnecessary and that the time spent on generating, reviewing, and responding to discovery was excessive.

The judge defers a determination on the propriety of costs to November 27, 2023, and will seek a response as to the issue of timeliness at the next hearing.
