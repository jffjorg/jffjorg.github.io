 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Marcus
  Webster’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.



 
Background
Plaintiff Marcus Webster sues
Defendants the Regents of the University of California (the Regents)—as owner,
operators, and/or entity controlling medical clinics and hospitals that are
part of the UCLA health system, including the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
(UCLA Reagan)—and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to a June 22, 2023 Second Amended
Complaint alleging claims of (1) Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA [Fair
Employment and Housing Act], (2) Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, (3)
Harassment in Violation of the FEHA, (4) Failure to Take Steps to Prevent
Discrimination, and Harassment in Violation of FEHA, (5) Retaliation Under Cal.
Health & Safety Code § 1278.5, (6) Declaratory Relief, and (7) Retaliation
under Labor Code § 1102.5.
(The Court is unclear from the
SAC’s summary of “Parties and their Agents” whether Sasha Young, Jasmine
Briones, Scott Karas, and Brenda Quiroga remain active Defendants in this
action.)
On July 21, 2023, the Regents filed
an Answer to the SAC.
On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) against the Answer based on
sufficiency of pleading.
On October 23, 2023, the Regents
opposed the motion.
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff
replied to the opposition.
Plaintiff’s MJOP is now before the
Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Per Plaintiff Webster’s request,
the Court takes judicial notice of Plaintiff’s SAC and the Regents’ Answer to
the SAC in this action. (MJOP, RJN; see Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d), 453.)
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings

Legal Standard
Either prior to trial or at the
trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the plaintiff or the
Defendants may move for judgment on the pleadings where the appropriate ground
for such a motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the
failure to state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister
(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to challenge a pleading
in the same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the challenged pleading (1)
establishes that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction or (2)
does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action or defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v. Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San
Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
As with a demurrer, the grounds for
a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the pleading
or be based on facts capable of judicial notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202, disapproved on other grounds in Noel v.
Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only
significant difference between the two motions is that a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is brought after the time to file a general demurrer has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f); Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ.
of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 338, 350; International Assn of
Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra, at p. 1196.)
Order Granting Judgment on the
Pleadings: DENIED.
In his MJOP, Plaintiff Webster argues
that judgment on the pleadings is appropriate against the Answer’s 30
affirmative defenses because the defenses are pleaded without any facts to
support the defenses alleged. (MJOP, pp. 3-8.)
In opposition, the Regents argue
that answers are liberally construed like complaints alleged on demurrer and
that the Answer need only and does allege ultimate facts that support the
affirmative defenses. The Regents also argue that the Answer pleads some
defenses that involve information presumptively in Plaintiff’s possession and
that the Answer can be amended to adequately plead its defenses if necessary.
(Opp’n, pp. 2-9.)
In reply, Plaintiff Webster
reiterates his sufficiency argument. Plaintiff Webster also advances points
against the Regents’ argument that certain affirmative defenses are
sufficiently alleged where Plaintiff is in possession of the facts supporting
them. (Reply, pp. 3-8.)
The Court finds in favor of the
Regents.
A party against whom an answer has
been filed may object thereto by demurrer within 10 days of the answer’s filing
where the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 430.20, subds. (a)-(b), 430.40, subd. (b).) A demurrer to an
answer may be taken to the whole answer or to any one or more of the several
defenses set up in the answer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (b).) The
plaintiff may not demur to part of a defense. (Reed v. Drais (1885) 67
Cal. 491, 491.) Instead, in order to determine the sufficiency of a defense,
such a defense must be considered as a whole. (Ferrier v. Ferrier (1883)
64 Cal. 23, 23.)
The general demurrer to an answer
admits all facts well pleaded in the answer, including denials. (Warren v.
Harootunian (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 546, 548.) For purposes of a demurrer (or
MJOP), each defense in the answer must be considered separately without regard
to any other defense; thus, a separately stated defense that is sufficient in
form and substance when viewed in isolation does not become insufficient when,
on looking at the answer as a whole, that defense appears inconsistent with
other parts of the answer. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226
Cal.App.2d 725, 733-734 (South Shore).) If one of the defenses or
counterclaims is free from the objections urged by demurrer, then a demurrer to
the entire answer must be overruled. (Id. at p. 734.)
Here, the Court finds that, at a
minimum, the defense for failure to exhaust administrative remedies stands on its
own and can survive a sufficiency challenge. (See MJOP, RJN, Ex. 2, Sixteenth
Affirmative Defenses, p. 5.) As a result, to the extent the MJOP challenges the
Answer as a whole, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s MJOP. (South Shore, supra,
226 Cal.App.2d at pp. 733-734.)
To the extent that each individual
defense is challenged, the Court finds that sufficient ultimate facts are
pleaded to survive a sufficiency challenge (Committee on Children’s
Television v. General Foods Corp., 35 Cal.3d 197, 212) and that discovery
is the proper mechanism by which to obtain further information relating to the
Answer and its defenses and/or denials. (See DISC-001, Form Interrogatories – General,
at ¶ 15.1.)
Plaintiff Webster’s MJOP is thus
DENIED. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Marcus Webster’s Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
