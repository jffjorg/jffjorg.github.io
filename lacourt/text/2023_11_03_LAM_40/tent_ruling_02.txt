 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Ahmad
  Chiha’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.



 
Background
Plaintiff Ahmad Chiha sued
Defendants Aston Martin Lagonda of North America, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1
through 100 pursuant to an August 31, 2021 Complaint alleging three lemon law
claims: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty; (2) Breach of Express Warranty; and (3)
Violation of the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act [Failure to Refund or
Replace After Reasonable Number of Attempts].
The claims arose from allegations
that Plaintiff Chiha purchased a new 2021 Aston Martin DB 11 (Vehicle) subject
to an express warranty from Defendant Aston Martin Lagonda but that at the time
the Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff, it was not in merchantable condition,
was not safe, and did not conform to the quality and safety guidelines for a
new motor vehicle—i.e., had multiple manufacturer defects, defects in assembly,
design defects, and other defects—and that, despite a reasonable number of
attempts, Aston Martin Lagonda was unable to conform the Vehicle to express
warranty.
On July 25, 2023, the court held a
jury trial, at which time counsel represented that the case was settled and
that the settlement agreement was signed. The Court advanced the trial and
other hearings, vacated them, and scheduled an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re:
Dismissal (Settlement) for August 23, 2023.
On August 23, 2023, the Court held
the OSC and was informed that the only issues remaining are fees and costs, which
counsel jointly requested be continued to resolve these issues, with the OSC continued
by stipulation to October 27, 2023.
On October 10, 1023, Plaintiff
brought a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. The motion was set for hearing
on November 3, 2023.
On October 23, 2023, the Court
signed a joint stipulation by the parties to continue the OSC hearing from
October 27, 2023 to November 3, 2023.
Later that day, Defendant opposed
the motion.
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff replied
to the opposition.
Later that day, Plaintiff filed a
nearly identical copy of the opposition, which for the most part changes lower
case lettering to upper case lettering and changes the word attorneys to
counsel.
The motion for attorney fees and
costs and the OSC are now before the Court.
 
Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Legal
Standard 

A prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4),
(b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A
prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action is entitled to recover their
attorney’s fees and costs under the Act’s express terms. (Civ. Code, § 1794,
subd. (d); see Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
462, 464, 471.)
The Court begins this inquiry “with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a
multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of factors specific to the case,
in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”
(Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are required; the record need only
show that the attorney’s fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or
“touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d
1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In re Marriage of Demblewski
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7 [disagreement as to statement of decision
requirements].) The Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a
reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order Granting Fees and Costs:
GRANTED, in Part, as to fees [no determination of costs].
Plaintiff Chiha seeks $86,001.20 in
fees and costs as the prevailing plaintiff in this SBA action, a figure
comprised of $82,804.50 in attorneys’ fees and $3,196.70 in costs. (Mot., p.
2.)
I. Reasonable Fees
and Costs, Multiplier
Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees on
the grounds that recovery from Defendant went from none, to $23,610.30 with
fees and costs to be determined by the Court, and then, to an offer to settle
the case in exchange for agreeing (1) to pay Plaintiff $25,000 without
Plaintiff being in possession of the Vehicle, (2) that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party, and (3) to pay the attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses
incurred by Plaintiff pursuant to Civil Code Section 1794, subdivision (d) in
an amount determine by the Court. Plaintiff otherwise argues in favor of the requested
fee recovery regardless of the settlement amount recovered by Plaintiff, the
reasonable hours expended by Plaintiff’s senior and junior counsel on this
litigation as well as their hourly rates, and other arguments in favor of
reasonability in fee and hours sought. (Mot., pp. 4-12.) 
Declarations from Plaintiff’s
counsel and one from a practitioner opining on reasonable rates support the fee
rates for counsel here and/or provide the academic and/or professional
backgrounds for counsel. (Mot., Barry Decl., ¶¶ 18-27 [David Barry, Erik
Whitman, Anna Galaviz, Elisabeth Quinn, Debora Rabieian, and Logan Pascal], Exs.
5 [verified time records], 6 [United States Consumer Law Attorney Fee Survey
Report, 2017-2018]; Quinn Decl., ¶¶ 4-11 [academic and professional background];
Galaviz Decl., ¶¶ 2-7 [same]; Mot; Rabieian Decl., ¶¶ 3-6 [same]; Mot., Pascal
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5 [same]; Mot., Rosner Decl., ¶¶ 1-11 [opinion declaration].)
The attorneys’ fees Plaintiff
requests seek compensation for:
(1) 30 hours expended by David N.
Barry, Esq. at a rate of $600 per hour prior to April 2023 and $625 per hour
thereafter for 79.6 hours, with 23 years of experience as a legal practitioner;
(2) 4.7 hours expended by former
associate Erik Whitman, Esq., a nine-year practitioner, at a rate of $550 per
hour;
(3) 12.8 hours expended by Anna H.
Galaviz, Esq., a nearly ten-year practitioner, at a rate of $515 per hour;
(4) 4.5 hours expended by Elisabeth
Quinn, Esq., a more than 20-year practitioner, at a rate of $475 per hour;
(5) 6.1 hours expended by Debora
Rabieian, Esq., a seven-year practitioner, at a rate of $435 per hour; and 
(6) 4.2 hours expended by Logan
Pascal, Esq., a four-year practitioner, at a rate of $350 per hour.
In opposition, Defendant argues that
a flat fee rate of $350 per hour should be applied and that the reasonable
number of hours should be reduced to 98.5 hours, for a total fee recovery of
$34,475. Defendant otherwise argues that specific verified billing record
entries involved excessive hours, makes various arguments for why the fees
sought are not proper, and advances other reasons why the fees sought are
unreasonable and excessive. (Opp’n, pp. 1-10.)
In reply, Plaintiff argues reasons
for why certain billing entries are compensable, justifying hours expended on
discovery, litigating this motion, and travel time. Plaintiff also contends
that Defendant makes arguments about excessiveness or unreasonableness without
support, that the cited declarations and national fee surveys support the
requested fee rates, and that costs are justified. (Reply, pp. 1-6.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiffs, but for a reduced amount.
As to reasonable fee rates, the Court
is satisfied that the skill displayed by Plaintiff’s counsel in this action and
their years of experience practicing law support the requested fee rates, as
does the Attorney Fee Survey Report (p. 229). The increase in rate from $600 to
$625 per hour for David N. Barry seems reasonable to the Court for a more than
23-year practitioner like Mr. Barry. Plaintiff’s counsel also displayed skill
in securing a settlement from Defendants where no liability was initially
admitted. The Court also does not find that the fee rates are unreasonable
based on excessive time or slight modification of boilerplate responses as to
merit a wholesale reduction of fee rates to $350 per hour. 
However, as to reasonable hours,
the Court agrees that Plaintiffs’ counsel overlitigated this case, meriting a
reduction in hours. (Karton v. Ari Design & Construction, Inc.
(2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744 [“A trial court is not required to state each
charge it finds reasonable or unreasonable. A reduced award might be fully
justified by a general observation that an attorney overlitigated a case”].)
The Court concludes that a recovery
for 141.9 hours expended by counsel in litigating this action is excessive, as
are the number of hours expended on different stages in the litigation cycle.
(See Opp’n, pp. 3-6.) The Court agrees that fees relating to travel were
unnecessary in the modern-day remote litigation setting. The time spent on
generating, reviewing, and responding to discovery, including depositions, was
also excessive based on the needs of the case and ability to recycle templates
for these purposes. Moreover, the hours expended on motion work and attending
hearings in this case involved more hours than reasonably should have been
required from the nature of the tasks performed, e.g., nearly ten hours of
preparation for the final status conference and for an order to show cause
hearing regarding dismissal.
Moreover, the excessiveness of
these hours is also supported by the number of attorneys that were involved in
litigating this action. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris) [“Just as there can be too many cooks in the
kitchen, there can be too many lawyers on a case”].) Though five of the six
attorneys for whose work Plaintiff seeks fees only expended between four and 13
hours on this action, the need to bring in new counsel, familiarize them with
the subject matter, and produce work product prosecuting the action needlessly added
to the number of hours it took to prosecute this action.
Based on these conclusions, and
because the verified time records confront this Court with a 46-page voluminous
record for billing, the Court makes an across-the-board percentage cut of 30%
from the reasonable hours sought by Plaintiff. (Morris, supra, 41
Cal.App.5th at p. 40 [“‘[W]hen a voluminous fee application is made, the court
may make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed
or in the final lodestar figure” quoting Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 41 (Warren), internal quotation marks and
ellipses omitted]; see Warren, supra, at p. 41 [“[T]he court must
clearly explain its reasons for choosing the particular negative multiplier
that it chose; otherwise, the reviewing court is unable to determine that the
court had valid, specific reasons for its across-the-board percentage reduction”].)
No multiplier enhancement award is requested
by Plaintiff Chiha.
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion, in part, in the amount of $58,231.60 in reasonable attorneys’ fees as
the prevailing plaintiff in this SBA action. The fees are broken down as
follows, with a 30% reduction in reasonable hours across the board:
(1) 21 hours reasonably expended by
David N. Barry, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $600 per hour prior to April 2023
($12,600) and $625 per hour thereafter for 55.72 hours ($34,825), for a local
total of $47,425;
(2) 3.29 hours reasonably expended
by former associate Erik Whitman, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $550 per hour,
for a local total of $1,809.50;
(3) 8.96 hours reasonably expended
by Anna H. Galaviz, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $515 per hour, for a local
total of $4,614.40;
(4) 3.15 hours reasonably expended
by Elisabeth Quinn, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $475 per hour, for a local
total of $1,496.25;
(5) 4.27 hours reasonably expended
by Debora Rabieian, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $435 per hour, for a local
total of $1,857.45; and 
(6) 2.94 hours reasonably expended
by Logan Pascal, Esq. at a reasonable rate of $350 per hour, for a local total
of $1,029.
II. Costs
Because a motion to strike or tax
costs in the October 10, 2023 memorandum of costs is set for hearing on
November 27, 2023, the Court defers a determination on costs to that date, at
which time the Court will consider arguments related to that relief.
However, the Court will seek
argument on the issue of timeliness. A motion to strike or tax costs “must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) Here, the memo of costs was served and filed
on October 10, 2023. (Mot., POS [service on paralegal at Plaintiff’s counsel’s
firm].) Defendants’ motion to strike was served on Friday, October 27, 2023,
seventeen days later, and filed with the Court on Monday, October 30, 2023, twenty
days later. The motion thus appears untimely.
A declaration from defense counsel
dated October 30, 2023 explains that the final date for filing the memo was
October 27, 2023. (10/30/23 Haroutunian Decl., ¶ 3.) However, the declaration
is unclear as to the basis for this representation, e.g., extension of time to
file motion based on service by particular means (mail, overnight delivery,
fax, email).
It thus appears that the motion
could be denied on that ground and costs granted here pursuant to the Rules of
Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subds. (b)(1) [15-day requirement to
file notice of motion from time of service of the costs memorandum], (b)(4)
[requirement that clerk enter costs on the judgment immediately after the
15-day timeframe to serve notice of motion to strike or tax costs has passed].)
However, the Court will seek a response as to the issue of timeliness at the
next hearing. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Ahmad Chiha’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED, in Part, as to an award of $58,231.60 in
reasonable attorneys’ fees.
The Court defers a determination on
the propriety of costs to November 27, 2023.
