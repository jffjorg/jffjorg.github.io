 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Jose Garcia’s Motion to Compel Deposition of
  Defendant Fabricio Bustos.



 
 
Background
Plaintiff Jose Garcia sues Defendants
Bustos Auto Body (his former employer), Fabricio Busto (Bustos Auto Body’s
owner and operator, and, according to prior papers filed by Defendants,
erroneously sued as Fabrico Raul Bustos), and Does 1 through 20 pursuant a July
21, 2021 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Misclassification of Employee Status,
(2) Failure to Pay All Wages Owed, (3) Failure to Pay All Minimum Wages Owed,
(4) Failure to Provie All Required Rest Periods, (5) Failure to Provide All
Reasonable Meal Periods, (6) Failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statements, (7)
Failure to Pay Wages in a Timely Manner, (8) Unfair Competition, (9) Failure to
Pay All Wages Due Upon Separation from Employment, (10) Waiting Time Penalties,
(11) Failure to Produce Employment File, and (12) Failure to Produce Wage
Records.
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served a notice of deposition on Defendant Busto’s counsel, with the
deposition to take place on July 27, 2023. The deposition notice was served on
Mr. Eliel Chemerinski, whom the Court relieved of representation on March 30,
2023, and on Defendant Busto at his 1345 San Fernando Road, San Fernando, CA
91340 business address.
Between July 20 and 26, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant Busto at the email provided by Mr.
Chemerinski. Defendant Busto did not respond to those communications.
On July 27, 2023, Defendant Busto
called Plaintiff’s counsel’s office and the parties discussed the deposition, some
material issues in this action, the credibility of Defendant Busto’s
representations, and Defendant Busto’s desire for service at a different email address
and a different physical address yet failure to provide more than a telephone
number. Plaintiff’s counsel thereafter texted Defendant Busto, noting a failure
to produce discovery.
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed this motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Busto.
Defendant Busto has not opposed
this motion, which is now before the Court.
Neither has Defendant Busto made
any filings or appearances since July 7, 2023. 
 
Motion to Compel Deposition
Legal
Standard
If,
[1] after service of a deposition notice, [2] a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, [3] without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, [4] fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, [5] the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a) [Arabic numerals added for clarity]; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.220
[contents required in deposition notice].)
The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
The
motion shall also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).)
If
the proposed deponent made some response to the deposition notice, then a
separate statement must accompany any motion to compel deposition attendance or
production. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (b).)
Order
Compelling Deposition(s): GRANTED.
Here,
Plaintiff Garcia shows that Defendant Fabricio Busto was served with a
deposition notice on June 28, 2023, that Defendant Busto failed to serve valid
objections to that deposition notice, and that Defendant Busto failed to appear
at the July 27, 2023 deposition. (Mot., Danelon Decl., ¶¶ 4-13, Exs. A-F
[deposition notice and proof of service, proof of confirmation of address where
Defendant Busto was served, emails to Defendant Busto re: attendance at
deposition, phone log printout for July 27, 2023, State of California profile
for Defendant Bustos Auto Body, and text message printout for the July 27,
2023].) Plaintiff thus shows statutory standing to bring a motion pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a)(1).
Moreover,
the motion shows that the deposition notice complied with the requirements set
out in Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.220 involving the required contents
of a deposition notice, i.e., address, date and time, name of deponent and
number if known, documents to be produced, intention to record, intention to
use recordings in relation to physician or expert, form of production, and
disclosure as to contracts with third parties financing deposition. (See Mot.,
Danelon Decl., Ex. A, pp. 1-3.)
Plaintiff
Garcia’s notice of deposition does not request the production of any documents,
for which reason no further discussion of Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (b)(1) is necessary. (See Mot., Danelon Decl., Ex. A, pp.
1-3.)
Plaintiff
Garcia shows a follow up with Defendant Busto on July 27, 2023 via text after
Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant Busto’s telephone call ended. (Mot., Danelon
Decl., ¶¶ 8-13, Ex. F.) Plaintiff thus satisfies the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)(2).
 The Court notes that the failure to submit a
separate statement, to the extent that it was necessary based on Defendant
Busto’s July 27, 2023 phone call, does not constitute a ground to deny this
motion where the call was made at the last minute and did not involve any sort
of appearance at the deposition. (Mot., Danelon Decl., ¶¶ 4-13, Ex. F.)
The
Court also notes that relief is available as to discovery here because the
discovery and discovery motion cutoffs are well in the future, i.e.,
respectively 30 and 15 days prior to February 6, 2024, the date initially set
for trial in this action on August 15, 2022. (See 8/15/22 Minutes; see also
Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.)
Sanctions:
GRANTED, in Part.
If
a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(g)(1).)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The
Court finds that sanctions are merited here based on a failure to comply with a
proper method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030,
subd. (a); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a); see also discussion
supra re: compelling deposition].)
However,
the Court finds that the time expended on bringing this motion exceeds the
necessary time. The Court permits reasonable recovery for four out of the six
hours seemingly expended by counsel drafting this motion, at a reasonable rate
of $500 per hour, plus $61.65 in costs related to filing this motion. (Mot., p.
7 [dollar amount requested]; Mot., Danelon Decl., ¶ 14 [fee rate and hours]; Mot.,
Reservation [$61.65 in costs to set hearing on motion].)
Sanctions
are thus GRANTED, in Part, in the amount of $2,061.65. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Jose Garcia’s Motion to
Compel Deposition of Defendant Fabricio Bustos is GRANTED.
The parties are ORDERED to meet and
confer regarding the details for a deposition of Defendant Busto and are
ORDERED to appear before the Court on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. If the
parties have not set a deposition by that time, the Court will unilaterally set
the deposition after conferring with the parties at that time.
The corresponding sanctions request
is GRANTED, in Part, in the amount of $2,061.65.
Defendant Fabricio Busto is ORDERED
to remit sanctions in this amount to Plaintiff Jose Garcia within 30 calendar days
of notice of this ruling.
Moving party to give notice.
