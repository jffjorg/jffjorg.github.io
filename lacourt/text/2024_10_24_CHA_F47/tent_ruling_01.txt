SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Arelis Lopez and
Gene Lopez’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2019 Kia Forte (the Vehicle)
manufactured and/or distributed and warranted by Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant).  Plaintiffs contend that the
Vehicle was/is defective and unsafe as it has recurring and unpredictable transmission,
electrical and other defects.  Plaintiffs
allege that despite frequent repair visits and Defendant’s inability to fix the
problems after a reasonable number of attempts, Defendant failed to replace the
Vehicle in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.
 
On 3/30/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2.  On 5/8/23, Defendant answered the complaint.
 
On 12/28/23, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Special
Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Thomas Decl.,
Ex.A).  Defendant served verified
responses on 2/13/24.  (Thomas Decl.,
Ex.B).  In response to Special
Interrogatories 21-23, 30, 35, 37-38, 41-42, 44 and 59-60, Defendant asserted
only objections.  Id.  On 4/1/24, Plaintiffs sent a meet and confer
letter regarding the deficiencies in certain of the responses.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.C).  Defendant responded indicating that it would
be supplementing its responses to Special Interrogatories 21-23, 30, 35, 37-38, 41-42, 44 and 59-60  by 5/10/24.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.D).  On 4/30/24, Defendant agreed to extend the
deadline for a motion to compel further responses to 5/24/24.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.E).  On 5/13/24, Plaintiffs sent an email regarding
the overdue supplemental responses to which Defendant did not respond.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.F).  
 
On 5/24/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Defendant 
to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set
1.  Additionally, Plaintiffs requests an
order imposing sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record,
Lehrman, Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the amount of $2,310.00.  Defendant has opposed the motion and
Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The  opposition
contends that by the time of the hearing on the motion, Defendant will have
provided supplemental responses to the Special Interrogatories at issue
rendering the motion moot.  (See
Opposition, p.2:2-7).  From the
declaration submitted in support of the opposition, it is not clear if
Defendant is contending that supplemental responses to the subject interrogatories
 have already been served or will be
served.  (See Chang Decl.
¶¶3-4).  The opposition goes on to argue
that sanctions are not warranted because there was never any misuse/abuse of
the discovery process by Defendant.  
 
The reply to the opposition states that as of the time of
the filing of the reply on 10/17/24, Defendant has not provided proper further
responses to the subject Special Interrogatories.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
 
The opposition essentially concedes that further
responses to Special Interrogatories 21-23, 30, 35,
37-38, 41-42, 44 and 59-60 are warranted as Defendant indicates that such
have been or will be provided before the hearing.  Since Defendant has not provided any evidence
that proper, verified further responses to the subject Special Interrogatories have
been served and has failed to justify its objections, Defendant is ordered to
provide further responses to Special Interrogatories 21-23, 30, 35, 37-38, 41-42,
44 and 59-60 within 30 days.
 
The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to
an award of sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record, Lehrman,
Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the amount of $2,310.00 (2 hours to
prepare motion + 2 hours to review opposition and draft reply +1 hour to
prepare for and appear at hearing multiplied by $450/hour + $60 filing fee),
for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  (See Thomas Decl. ¶¶11-13).  Defendant fails to provide an adequate
explanation as to why proper responses to the discovery requests have not been
provided in the more than 9 months since the discovery requests were served on
Defendant.  Sanctions are payable within
30 days.
