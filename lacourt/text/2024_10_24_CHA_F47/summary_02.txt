And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for compromise without prejudice due to several defects in the petition. The defects include:

* Failure to set forth the name of the petitioner and mark the parent box in addition to the guardian ad litem box.
* Incorrect indication that a judgment has been or will be entered in the amount of $100,000.00.
* Lack of medical records/reports attached to the petition.
* Incorrect indication that the defendant has offered to pay $100,000.00 to persons other than the minor.
* Excessive attorney fees.
* Incorrect calculations for medical expenses and attorney fees.
* Failure to provide a copy of the attorney fee agreement in English.
* Incorrect amount to be paid to the minor.

The judge has requested that the attorney provide a copy of the attorney fee agreement in English and that the petitioner file an amended petition to address these defects. The judge has also noted that the amount to be paid to the minor is incorrect and that the proposed Order to Deposit Funds In Blocked Account has an incorrect amount.
