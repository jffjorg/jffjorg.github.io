And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maricio Murga Rios v. General Motors LLC. The case involves a dispute over a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 that was purchased by Plaintiff from an authorized dealership. Plaintiff alleged that the vehicle had a transmission defect that was not disclosed at the time of sale, and that Defendant and its agents concealed the information.

Defendant filed a demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleged fraudulent inducement, and a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The judge ruled that the demurrer was overruled and the motion to strike was denied.

The judge found that Plaintiff had sufficiently alleged his fraud claim, and that the First Amended Complaint sufficiently alleged a basis for the claim for punitive damages. The judge also found that Defendant's argument regarding the economic loss rule was improperly raised for the first time in the reply, and therefore was not considered.

The judge ordered that the answer be filed within 30 days.
