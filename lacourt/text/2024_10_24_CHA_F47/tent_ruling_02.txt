Case #23CHCV03819
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 9/26/24.
 
MINOR: Kathaleya Quintero
GAL: Liliana Ibarra (parent)
DEFENDANT: David Marquez
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of a dog
attack.  On 5/22/22, a dog owned and
controlled by Defendant David Marquez attacked the minor.  Minor received care at Valley Presbyterian
Hospital after the bite and consultation from Brand Surgical Institute.  Minor has not completely recovered from the
injuries as she had residual scarring from the bite.
 
SETTLEMENT: David Marquez to pay $100,000.00.
 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $2,382.00 (total); $4.75 (paid);
$1,882.00 (reduction), $1,893.25 (to be paid from
settlement) $11.25 (statutory or contractual lien)
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $45,000.00
 
COSTS: $2,351.45
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $52,648.55 to be
deposited in a blocked account – THIS AMOUNT IS INCORRECT BASED ON THE ABOVE
DEDUCTIONS.
 
RULING: The petition is denied without prejudice.
 
The petition contains the following defects which
preclude approval at this time:
 
(1) No.1 in the petition does not set forth the name of
the petitioner and does not mark the parent box in addition to the guardian ad
litem box.  The application and order for
appointment of guardian ad litem indicates that the guardian ad litem, Liliana
Ibarra is the minor’s parent.  
 
(2) No.3.c. in the petition incorrectly indicates that a
judgment has or will be entered in the action in the amount of
$100,000.00.   
 
(3) No medical records/reports are attached to the
petition as required in No.8 of the petition.
 
(4) No.11.b. in the petition incorrectly indicates that
Defendant has offered to pay $100,000.00 to persons other than minor.  The minor is the only plaintiff in the action
and seemingly the only person injured in the dog attack.
 
(5) The amount of attorney’s fees (45%) seems excessive.  Based on the minimal court filings and 90
hours claimed to have been spent on this case, the attorney is receiving $1111.11
per hour in compensation.  (See
Attachment 17(a) (should be titled as Attachment 13a) - Danshard Decl. ¶¶3, 14
– pdf 16-17).  Additionally, pursuant to
the attorney fee agreement, it appears that the attorney may only be entitled
to 33.3% if the matter settles before trial. 
(See Attachment  17a -
Legal Services Agreement – Contingency Fee p.2, ¶8, pdf 19).  The copy of the agreement attached to the
petition is only in Spanish.  Counsel
must provide a copy of the agreement in English so that the Court can determine
the terms of same.  
 
(6) No.15 and No.16.f. incorrectly indicate that the
amount to be paid to the minor is $52,648.55. 
However, after the medical expenses of $1,893.25, attorney fees of
$45,000.00 and other costs of $2,351.45 are deducted from the $100,000.00
settlement, only $50,755.30 is left to be paid to the minor.
 
(7) No.18.a. indicates that there is a guardianship of
the estate of the minor and incorrectly indicates that the guardianship of the
estate of the minor was appointed in this case. 
The appointment of a guardian ad litem is not the appointment of the guardianship
of the estate of the minor.  Such
appointment would have to occur in a separate proceeding in the Probate
Department.  It appears that No.18.b.(2)
would be the appropriate box to mark, unless a guardianship of the estate of
the minor was appointed in a separate proceeding.  In such case, that information must be
provided in No.18.a.
 
(8) The parent box is not marked in No.2 of the proposed
Order approving the compromise (proposed Order).
 
(9) No.6. in the proposed Order is not completed.
 
(10) No.8.a.(1) in the proposed Order does not set forth
to whom the attorney’s fees are payable. 

 
(11) No. 8.a.(3) in the proposed Order lists the amount
of medical expenses to be paid from the settlement as $1,182.00 when it is
actually $1,893.25.
 
(12) No.8.b.(1) in the proposed Order also has the
incorrect amount to be paid to the minor as noted above. 
 
(13) The proposed Order to Deposit Funds In Blocked
Account has the incorrect amount after the noted deductions.
