SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Maricio Murga Rios’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (the Vehicle) on or
about 1/3/20.  (First Amended Complaint
(FAC) ¶4).  On 3/19/24, Plaintiff filed
this action against Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant) and Does 1-10
for: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Breach of
Express Warranty; (2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act –
Breach of Implied Warranty and (3) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment.   
 
After this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the 3rd
cause of action for Fraudulent – Concealment and granted Defendant’s motion to
strike the prayer for punitive damages, both with leave to amend, on 7/8/24,
Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended Complaint alleging the same three
causes of action as alleged in the original complaint.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendant had with the First Amended Complaint, on 8/7/24, Defendant filed
and served the instant demurrer to the 3rd cause of action for
Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment on the ground that the pleading fails to
state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent
inducement based on concealment.  CCP
430.10(e).  Additionally, Defendant filed
and served the instant motion to strike seeking an order striking the prayer
for punitive damages.  Plaintiff has
opposed the demurrer and motion to strike and Defendant has filed replies to
the oppositions.  
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
DEMURRER
 
A complaint that does not allege sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action is subject to demurrer.  CCP 430.10(e).  A demurrer challenges defects that appear on
the face of the complaint or matters outside the pleadings that are subject to judicial
notice.  Blank (1985) 39 C3d 311,
318; Donabedian (2004) 116 CA4th 968, 994.  In ruling on a demurrer, all properly pled
material facts are deemed true, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.   Kamen (2001) 94 CA4th 197, 201; Moore
(1990) 51 C3d 120, 125.
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s fraudulent inducement
– concealment cause of action fails to state a claim because: (1) it is barred
by the applicable statute of limitations, (2) it is not pled with the requisite
specificity and (3) it does not plead a transactional relationship giving rise
to a duty to disclose.  
 
Statute of Limitations
 
In order to sustain a demurrer based on the ground that a
claim is time-barred, the statute of limitations defense must be shown on the
face of the complaint or from matters of which the court may take judicial
notice.  See Union Carbide
Corp. (1984) 36 C3d 15, 25; E-Fab, Inc. (2007) 153 CA4th 1308,
1315-16; Arroyo (2014) 225 CA4th 279, 289.
 
The three-year statute of limitations set forth in CCP
338 governs a fraud cause of action.  CCP
338(d) provides: 
 
“An action for relief on the ground
of fraud or mistake. The cause of action in that case is not deemed to have
accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting
the fraud or mistake.”  
 
Defendant has failed to establish that Plaintiff’s
fraudulent inducement – concealment claim is time-barred on the face of the First
Amended Complaint.  Defendant argues that
because Plaintiff has alleged that he purchased the vehicle on or about 1/3/20
and the defect existed at the time of purchase, Plaintiff had to file the fraud
claim no later than January 2023.  (See
FAC ¶¶4, 10).  
 
The delayed discovery rule tolls the applicable statute
of limitations if the plaintiff is unable to discover the cause of action with
reasonable diligence.  Hobart
(1945) 26 C2d 412, 437; Johnson (1934) 1 C2d 136, 137; Jolly
(1988) 44 C3d 1103, 1110; Fox (2005) 35 C4th 797, 807; Glue-Fold,
Inc. (2000) 82 CA4th 1018, 1029. 
Plaintiff’s allegations that: (1) he did not know about the transmission
defect at the time of sale/lease; (2) he did not know of the irreparable nature
of the problems at the time of the repair attempts because Defendant and its
agents represented that it was able to fix the vehicle, and/or that there was
not issue and (3) Defendant and its agents concealed the known transmission
defect are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to toll the statute of
limitations based on delayed discovery. 
(FAC ¶¶36-42); See Aryeh (2013) 55 C4th 1185, 1192; Karoutas
(1991) 232 CA3d 767, 771.    
 
Additionally, when a plaintiff reasonably should have
discovered facts for the purposes of the accrual of a cause of action is
generally a question of fact and can only be decided as question of law (i.e.,
on demurrer) if the allegations in the complaint and facts subject to judicial
notice can support only one reasonable conclusion.  Broberg (2009) 171 CA4th 912, 921.  Based on the allegations in the First Amended
Complaint, it cannot be determined as a matter of law that Plaintiff’s
fraudulent inducement – concealment claim is time-barred.  
 
Specificity
 
The elements of a cause of action for fraud based on
concealment are: (1) the defendant 
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant had a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant intentionally concealed
or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the
plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he/she/they did
if he/she/they had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a
result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff sustained
damage.  Jones (2011) 198 CA4th
1187, 1198, quoting Kaldenbach (2009) 178 CA4th 830, 850.  Since concealment is a species of fraud, it
must be pled with specificity.  Blickman
Turkus LP (2008) 162 CA4th 858, 878. 
However, the specificity requirement is “relaxed when it is apparent
from the allegations that the defendant necessarily possesses knowledge of the
facts.”  Quelimane Co. (1998) 19
C4th 26, 27; See also Pointe Sand Diego Residential Community, L.P.
(2011) 195 CA4th 265, 278, citing Okun (1981) 29 C3d 442, 458.  Similarly, actions for fraud based on
omission or concealment do not have the same specificity requirement.  Alfaro (2009) 171 CA4th 1356, 1384. 
 
There are four circumstances where nondisclosure or
concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the
defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts.  Bigler-Engler (2017) 7
CA5th 276, 311-312.  The last three
require evidence of some transaction (i.e. direct dealings between the plaintiff
and the defendant).  Id.; Dhital
(2022) 84 CA5th 828, 843-844 (review granted on the issue of economic loss
rule) citing Hoffman (2014) 228 CA4th 1178, 1186-1187.
 
Under the relaxed requirements for a fraud claim based on
concealment, the Court finds that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state
the claim.  See (FAC ¶¶13-14, 37-45);
Alfaro, supra at 1384. 
Similarly, based on the circumstances of the purchase/lease of the
Vehicle, Plaintiff’s reliance on the alleged misconduct could have been
reasonably expected which is sufficient to satisfy the intent to induce
reliance element of the claim.  See
Lovejoy (2001) 92 CA4th 85, 93, 96.
 
In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has now sufficiently
alleged the necessary transactional relationship with Defendant which is
required since Defendant was not in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff.  The First Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff
purchased the Vehicle from one of Defendant’s authorized dealerships whose
employees were the agents of Defendant for purposes of the sale which resulted
in a “transaction” between Plaintiff and Defendant.  (See FAC ¶4); Dhital (2022) 84
CA5th 828, 844; Ibrahim (1989) 214 CA3d 878, 889.  
 
The Court notes that Defendant’s reply to Plaintiff’s
opposition includes an argument regarding Plaintiff’s motion to strike the Defendant’s
prior demurrer to the original complaint which has been moot since the Court’s
ruling on the demurrer to the original complaint on 6/27/24.  (See Reply, p.1:3-14).  Additionally, the reply includes an argument
regarding the fraud cause of action being barred by the economic loss rule.  Such argument was improperly raised for the
first time in the reply.  Since Plaintiff
did not have the opportunity to respond to the argument, it was not considered
by the Court.     
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Punitive damages may be recovered where it is proven by
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of fraud, oppression
or malice.  See Civil Code
3294(a), (c)(3).  Since Plaintiff has
sufficiently alleged his fraud claim, the First Amended Complaint sufficiently
alleges a basis for the claim for punitive damages.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is
denied.  Answer is due within 30
days.
