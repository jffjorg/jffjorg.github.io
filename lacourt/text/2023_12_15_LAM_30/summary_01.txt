Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendant's second amended answer. The court has found that the defendant's affirmative defenses for unclean hands, laches, failure to mitigate, and statute of frauds are sufficient to support the claims. The court has also found that the defendant's affirmative defenses for public entity immunity from common law torts and promissory fraud are applicable to the facts pled.

The court has overruled the demurrer as to the fourth through seventh, ninth, thirteenth, and eighteenth affirmative defenses, and has sustained the demurrer as to the third, fifth, eighth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth affirmative defenses.

The court has found that the defendant's affirmative defenses for estoppel and ratification are legally insufficient or inapplicable to the facts pled. The court has also found that the defendant's affirmative defenses for discharge of duty/full performance, C.C.P. ยง 128.7 violation, failure of conditions precedent, The Ralph M. Brown Act, and City of Compton Charter and City Municipal Code are improper because they are not affirmative defenses.

The court has set a hearing date of December 15, 2023, to consider the tentative ruling.
