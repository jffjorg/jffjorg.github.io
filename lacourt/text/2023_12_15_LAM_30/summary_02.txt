And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Antoinette Lima-Washington's motion for reconsideration of the court's November 8, 2023 order denying her leave to file the Third Amended Complaint. The motion sought to add a claim under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) to the complaint. The court found that the evidence presented by Plaintiff does not show "new or different facts" warranting reconsideration, and that the proposed CFRA claim is based on facts already pled in prior complaints. The court also noted that Plaintiff's failure to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3.1324, subd. (b) of the Rules of Court, including identifying newly discovered facts and explaining why the amendment was necessary, was not addressed in the motion. As a result, the court denied the motion for reconsideration.
