And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a hearing scheduled for January 29, 2024, regarding plaintiff's motions to compel further discovery responses from defendants Boardwalk West Financial Services, LLC and Alhambra Healthcare & Wellness Centre, LP. The plaintiff, represented by Socorro Cabral, filed four discovery motions, including requests for further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendants, represented by the same counsel, opposed the motions and argued that the discovery requests were premature.

The court finds that the defendants' objections are unpersuasive and that they have failed to provide complete and cooperative responses to the discovery requests. As a result, the court imposes monetary sanctions on the defendants in the amounts of $700 against Boardwalk West and $2,100 against Alhambra Healthcare. The sanctions are to be paid within 20 days of the date of this order.

The court also notes that the defendants' counsel failed to execute a stipulation agreeing to accept service of deposition notices and subpoenas on behalf of their current employees, and that they failed to produce documents in response to the plaintiff's requests. The court finds that these actions were uncooperative and unjustified, and that sanctions are warranted.
