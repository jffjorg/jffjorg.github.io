      CASE NO.: 22AHCV00939
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES; REQUEST
   FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept.

On October 27,
 2022, plaintiff Ray Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against defendant Benjamin Pena (“Defendant”) arising from a motor
 vehicle collision that occurred on November 12, 2021. On July 6,
 2023 Defendant served Form Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiff.
No responses were received.  On August 31
 and October 31, 2023, defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s
 counsel a letter requesting verified responses, but Plaintiff did not
serve any responses. Defendant filed this motion on December 15, 2023.  
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) A party that fails to serve timely
responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff
did not oppose the Motion and it is undisputed responses were not served. Defendant’s
motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses
without objections to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) within 20
days of the date of this Order. 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).) The Court finds evidence of neither. Accordingly, Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Plaintiff
in the reduced amount of $235 consisting of 1 hour
at defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $175 and $60 in filing fees, to be paid
within 20 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 29th
day of January 2024
