And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and grants the motion to compel arbitration of certain claims against Passmore and Martini LLP. However, the court denies the motion to compel arbitration of derivative claims brought on behalf of MTC, and stays the court action pending arbitration. The court also denies the motion to compel arbitration of claims against Withum and Martini, as they are not parties to the operating agreement. The court sets a status conference for June 28, 2024, to review the status of arbitration.
