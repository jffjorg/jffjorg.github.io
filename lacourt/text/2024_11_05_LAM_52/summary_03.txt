And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Willie House's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The court finds that allowing the plaintiff to amend their complaint serves the interest of justice and is in line with the policy favoring amendment. The court exercises its discretion "liberally to permit amendment" and notes that denial of leave to amend is rare and only justified in exceptional cases. Since no defendant opposed the motion, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file the first amended complaint, which is attached as exhibit 1 to the declaration of Julio Soto-Kim, forthwith.
