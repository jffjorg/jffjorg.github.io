Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion by plaintiff Andrew Rodriguez to file a second amended complaint and to amend the complaint to conform to proof. The plaintiff seeks to add causes of action for "violation of CFRA rights" and "CFRA - retaliation". The court has granted the motion in part, allowing the plaintiff to add a fourth cause of action for CFRA retaliation, but has denied the motion as to the proposed third cause of action for violation of CFRA rights. The court has also struck certain portions of the proposed second amended complaint.

The court's decision is based on its discretion to allow or deny a motion to amend a pleading. The court has considered the policy favoring amendment and the fact that the plaintiff's delay in bringing the proposed amendment is unjustified. However, the court has also considered the potential prejudice to the defendant from allowing the amendment and has denied the motion as to the proposed third cause of action.

The court's decision is also based on its consideration of the facts and the law. The court has considered the plaintiff's counsel's declaration and has found that the plaintiff did not discover any new facts giving rise to the amendment. The court has also considered the defendant's opposition to the motion and has found that the defendant has shown no prejudice from allowing the plaintiff to add the proposed fourth cause of action.

Overall, the court's decision is based on its discretion to balance the interests of the parties and to ensure that the court's decision is fair and just.
