Judge's Tentative Ruling:

In the matter of Memory Buss's appeal of the Labor Commissioner's award, Respondent Theo Fram moves to dismiss the appeal and request attorney's fees. The court has determined that Fram is entitled to dismissal of the appeal. Memory Buss, as the employer, failed to post an undertaking with the court as required by Labor Code section 98.2, subdivision (b). As a result, the court has no jurisdiction to consider Buss's appeal, and the Commissioner's order becomes final. Additionally, Fram is entitled to attorney fees, as Buss's appeal was unsuccessful. The court hereby grants Fram's motion to dismiss the appeal with prejudice and orders Buss to pay Fram $2,200 in expenses.
