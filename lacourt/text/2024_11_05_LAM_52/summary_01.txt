And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motions filed by Plaintiff Sara Simms and Defendant Simon Ourian. The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for a protective order regarding her deposition, finding that the motion is moot and that the Civil Discovery Act does not require mutual scheduling of a deposition. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request to prohibit defendants from taking her deposition in person, finding that there is no good cause to do so.

The judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Simon Ourian, finding that Plaintiff shows good cause for the order. The judge has ordered Defendant Ourian to testify at deposition no later than December 8, and has directed Defendant to propose three dates between November 11 and December 8 for the deposition. Plaintiff will choose one of the three dates proposed by Defendant.

The judge has also denied both parties' motions for monetary sanctions, finding that all parties acted with substantial justification and made reasonable arguments in support of their positions.
