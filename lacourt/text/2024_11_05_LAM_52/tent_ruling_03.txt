 Case Number:  24STCV10611    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Willie House’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint 
Plaintiff
Willie House, individually and as trustee of the House Revocable Living Trust,
moves for leave to file a first amended complaint.  Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1)
provides, “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.” 
Courts
exercise their discretion “liberally to permit amendment,” and “[t]he policy
favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave
to amend can be justified.”  (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)  
Neither
defendant opposed this motion.  Permitting plaintiff to file a first amended
complaint serves the interest of justice. 

Disposition
            Plaintiff Willie House’s motion for
leave to file a first amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff shall file the first amended
complaint, which is attached as exhibit 1 to the declaration of Julio Soto-Kim,
forthwith.
