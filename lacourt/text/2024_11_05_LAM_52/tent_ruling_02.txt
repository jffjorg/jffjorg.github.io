 Case Number:  24STCP01133    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Respondent Theo Fram’s Motion to
Dismiss Appellant’s Appeal and Request for Attorney’s Fees 
Dismissal of Appeal
            Respondent
Theo Fram moves to dismiss appellant Memory Buss’s appeal of the Labor
Commissioner’s award in matter No. WC-CM-804011.
            Fram
is entitled to dismissal of this appeal. 
Labor Code section 98.2, subdivision (b) provides, “As a condition to
filing an appeal pursuant to this section, an employer shall first post an
undertaking with the reviewing court in the amount of the order, decision, or
award.”  If the employer fails to do so,
the “consequence of not posting the undertaking is that a notice of appeal
cannot be filed, the court never obtains jurisdiction, and the Commissioner’s
order becomes final.”  (Palagin v.
Paniagua Construction, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 124, 138.)  Buss was the employer in the proceeding
before the Labor Commissioner.  Buss did
not post an undertaking with this court. 
(King Decl., ¶ 3.)  The court
therefore has no jurisdiction to consider Buss’s appeal.
            Fram
is also entitled to attorney fees.  Labor
Code section 98.2, subdivision (c) provides, “If the party seeking review by
filing an appeal to the superior court is unsuccessful in the appeal, the court
shall determine the costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the other
parties to the appeal, and assess that amount as a cost upon the party filing
the appeal.”  Buss filed an unsuccessful
appeal.  Fram reasonably incurred $2,200
in expenses as a result of the appeal. 
(King Decl., ¶ 6.)
            Respondent
Theo Fram’s motion to dismiss appellant Memory Buss’s appeal of the Labor
Commissioner’s award is granted.  The court
hereby dismisses Buss’s appeal with prejudice.  Fram shall recover $2,200 in expenses from
Buss.
