And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the Defendant City of Los Angeles to the Plaintiff Mordchai Brafman's complaint for negligence. The Plaintiff alleges that the City issued an Order to Comply based on a false inspection report, and that the City refused to re-examine the report. The City claims that the conduct related to the inspection and issuance of the order for compliance categorically constitutes immune conduct. The court has ruled that the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff is given 30 days to amend the complaint to potentially address the actual immunity provisions before the court considers whether the Plaintiff can state any non-immune cause of action as a matter of law. The Plaintiff may not add any new causes of action, damages claims or parties. The court will concurrently conduct a case management conference.
