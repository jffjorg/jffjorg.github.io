Summary:

The Judge denies the motion for summary judgment filed by Ashley Kim, the plaintiff, in this labor law case. The motion was filed to bar the claims by James Ha, the defendant, based on the doctrine of claim splitting and waiver. The Judge finds that the claims by Ha are barred under the doctrine of claim splitting and waiver, as Ha failed to raise the claims in the prior action and the claims arise from the same transaction. The Judge also finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to the claims by Ha, as the prior action determined the employment relationship between Ashley Kim and I Park, Inc. and the entitlement to sales commissions. The Judge denies the motion for summary judgment in its entirety, and the trial remains set for December 9, 2024.
