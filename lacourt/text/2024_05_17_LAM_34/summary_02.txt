And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed by Specially-Appearing Defendants Maimouna Ndao, Adam Breuer, and Jutta Ndao. The dispute revolves around whether the summons and complaint were properly served. The Plaintiff, La Park La Brea A, LLC, filed a complaint for unlawful detainer and obtained an order to serve the defendants by posting a copy of the summons and complaint on the premises. The Specially-Appearing Defendants argue that the service was not properly served. However, the Plaintiff provided certified mail receipts from the United States Postal Service, which suggests that the service was indeed proper. The Judge concludes that the service appears to have been proper and therefore denies the Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
