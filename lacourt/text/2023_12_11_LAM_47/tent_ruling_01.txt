CASE:                         Angelica Munoz Cabanillas v. Quickbites Inc.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV38542
 
            




















 
MOTION
FOR ORDER COMPELLING PRODUTCION OF PHONE RECORDS



 
MOVING PARTY:                           Plaintiff Angelica Munoz Cabanillas 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S):            Defendant
Quickbites Inc (Non-Opposition)
 
STATEMENT OF
MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
This is an employment
discrimination action filed on December 12, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that she
was denied medical leave and terminated after contracting COVID-19. 
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling T-Mobile/Metro PCS to produce phone records
pursuant to a subpoena. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling T-Mobile/Metro PCS to produce her own cell-phone
records pursuant to a subpoena. 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 1985.3 provides in relevant part that “[a] subpoena
duces tecum for personal records maintained by a telephone corporation which is
a public utility, as defined in Section 216 of the Public Utilities Code, shall
not be valid or effective unless it includes a consent to release, signed by
the consumer whose records are requested, as required by Section 2891 of the
Public Utilities Code.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1985.3(f).) 
 
            Both
Plaintiff and the primary account holder, Plaintiff’s brother, Ariel Munoz,
have provided their written consents for release of the sought-after records to
the public utility company here, T-Mobile/Metro PCS.  The company is unable to provide the phone
records that are the subject of the subpoena if the telephone number is
associated with a prepaid account, as it is here, even with the account
holder’s consent, absent a Court order to do so. (See Declaration of Jacob
Nalbandyan ISO Mot. Exh. F) Therefore, a Court order is necessary. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Court Order Compelling
Production of T-Mobile/Metro PCS Phone Records is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.   
            
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by
no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.  All interested
parties must be copied on the email.  It should be noted that if you
submit on a tentative ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any
party appears. By submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your
right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may
not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative
ruling in whole or in part.
