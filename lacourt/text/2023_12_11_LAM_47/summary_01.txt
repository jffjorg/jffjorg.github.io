And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a motion filed by Plaintiff Angelica Munoz Cabanillas to compel T-Mobile/Metro PCS to produce her own cell-phone records. The motion is granted because the records are necessary to prove Plaintiff's employment discrimination case, and both Plaintiff and her brother have provided written consents for release of the records. The court notes that T-Mobile/Metro PCS requires a court order to release phone records for prepaid accounts, and the company is unable to provide the records even with the account holder's consent. The hearing is set for December 11, 2023, and any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email.
