And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for appointment of Petrona Brooks as James Brooks' successor in interest without prejudice. The motion was filed by Petrona Brooks, who declares that she is James Brooks' surviving daughter and that he passed away on September 6, 2024. The judge found that the opposition brief filed by Walmart, Inc. raised valid points that Petrona Brooks did not address in her declaration, specifically the possibility that James Brooks' widow, Patricia, may have a superior right to be substituted for James Brooks. The judge construed Petrona Brooks' failure to submit a reply brief as a concession that the opposition's arguments have merit.
