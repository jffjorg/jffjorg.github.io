And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to discovery requests by the plaintiff, William Zhang. The plaintiff had served requests for production on the defendant, Nick Chui, in March 2024, but the defendant failed to serve timely responses. Despite communications with the defendant's attorney, no responses were received. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses, which the defendant opposed. The judge denied the motion as moot because the defendant eventually served responses after the motion was filed. However, the judge granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $560 for the delay in serving responses.
