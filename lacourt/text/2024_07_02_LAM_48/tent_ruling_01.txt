[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  FOR ATTORNEY FEES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 2, 2024



 
On October 26, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff
Aaron Meyerson and against Defendant Verb Technology Company Inc.
After the Court granted an extension of time, Plaintiff filed a motion
for attorney fees and costs on April 30, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
California
courts apply the “lodestar” approach to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This
inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” 
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s
Objection No. 1 is sustained for lack of foundation and personal knowledge.
Defendant’s
Objection No. 2 is sustained as hearsay.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s
Notice of Motion does not state the amount of attorney fees sought.  Only in the conclusion does the motion request
attorney fees of $797,526.00, consisting of 486.0 hours at $820.50/hour ($398,763.00),
with a 2.0 multiplier.  (Motion at p. 13;
see Todd Decl. ¶ 27.)  Alternatively, Plaintiff
requests attorney fees of $413,000.00, consisting of 486.0 hours at $425/hour ($206,550.00),
with a 2.0 multiplier.  (Motion at pp. 13-14.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that his hourly rate as set forth in the Fee Agreement was $425.00
per hour, but he requests fees at an hourly rate of $820.50 as “a fair
hourly Lodestar blended rate using the Laffey Matrix.”  (Todd Decl. ¶¶ 24, 27; Motion at p. 8.)  The Court finds that the requested rate of $820.50
is excessive and unsupported, and counsel’s actual rate of $425/hour is a reasonable
rate for this case.
Plaintiff’s
counsel provides a two-page spreadsheet showing the time spent on “various tasks,
hearings, and other events.”  (Todd Decl.
¶ 23 & Ex. B.)  Defendant argues that
these records are insufficient to provide a foundation for determining how much
time was spent on each task.  (Opposition
at p. 3.)
Plaintiff
bears the burden of proof for establishing his reasonable attorney fees.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).)  “[T]he court may require defendants to produce
records sufficient to provide ‘ “a proper basis for determining how much time was
spent on particular claims.” ’  [Citation.]  The court also may properly reduce compensation
on account of any failure to maintain appropriate time records.  [Citation.]” 
(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020 [citing
Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 437-438, fns. 12, 13].)
Plaintiff’s
counsel explains that for this case, he “created a spreadsheet at the inception
of the matter where [he] logged, on a contemporaneous basis, [his] time spent on
various tasks, hearings, and other events.” 
(Todd Decl. ¶ 23.)  But he admits,
“Sometimes I estimate how much time I spent on various tasks,” and “the time records
are in part based upon my time estimates.” 
(Todd Decl. ¶ 23.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
also states that he is “not accustomed to billing by the hour on contingency fee
cases,” but he does “bill by increments of an hour and invoice clients on a regular
basis” in other cases.  (Todd Decl. ¶ 23;
see Todd Decl. ¶ 24.)
“Contemporaneous
time records surely are a bother to keep. 
But people paying those bills are entitled to care about accuracy.  At hundreds of dollars an hour, minutes here and
minutes there add up.  Accuracy is a professional
virtue and a systemic concern.  The public
is entitled to confidence the justice system is just as careful about getting legal
bills right as it is about getting everything else right.  And exact clocks and timekeeping software have
made it rather easy to be accurate—extremely accurate.”  (Taylor v. County of Los Angeles (2020)
50 Cal.App.5th 205, 214 (Taylor).)
Counsel’s
declaration and spreadsheet cast extreme doubt on the accuracy of these records.  Nearly every entry is logged in hour increments.  Only eight entries are not in full hour increments;
instead, they are in half-hour increments. 
A sequence of round billing numbers “could be merely a curious coincidence.  Or it could create an inference of reverse engineering:
the author chose a target in round numbers, and then came up with detailed inputs
to sum to the target.”  (Taylor, supra,
50 Cal.App.5th at p. 211.)
Defendant
argues that “only 42 out of 486 hours of Plaintiff counsel’s entries are not
block billed.”  (Opposition at p. 7.)  Block-billing is not objectionable per se, but
counsel may be penalized for this practice when it obscures the nature of the work
and results in a vague fee request.  (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325.)  “[C]ounsel may not submit a plethora of noncompensable,
vague, blockbilled attorney time entries and expect particularized, individual deletions
as the only consequence.”  (Id. at
p. 1329.)  “It is the obligation of the party
(and attorney) seeking the fee award ‘to prune the fee request to comply with the
law,’ and the party (and attorney) cannot ‘transfer that responsibility onto the
trial court.’’  (Mountjoy v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 280.)
Not
only are the time entries block-billed in substance, making it difficult (if not
impossible) to determine how much time was spent on each task, but they are also
block-billed in time.  For example, in “April
and May 2019 and February 2020,” counsel billed 7.0 hours for “Draft and negotiate
2 Tolling Agreements and Stipulated Order Waiving Arbitration and Changing Venue
to Los Angeles County.”  From “11/17/20 to
2/23/21,” counsel billed 12.0 hours for “Review and respond to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories Set One Nos. 1-11; and Second Set of Form Interrogatories, Request
for Production Nos. 36-47, and Request for Admissions 10-26; production of BATES
MEYERSON0195 - MEYERSON0388.”  Counsel billed
50.0 hours in “Jan to Feb 2021” for “Draft Motion for Summary Judgment / Summary
Adjudication; Declarations in Support; Separate Statement; research.”  For this motion, counsel billed 12.5 hours in
“September 2023 to January 2024” for “Preparation and filing of Motion for attorney’s
fees; declaration in support; research; Prepare and file Cost Memorandum; cost memorandum
worksheet, attachments and receipts.”
Plaintiff’s
counsel implicitly acknowledges the vagueness of his billing entries and the difficulty
in ascertaining the reasonableness of the time spent: “Defendant vaguely asserts
that 6 hours spent on converting the Complaint to the First Amended Complaint is
excessive (it wouldn’t be) but Defendant leaves out the other tasks described in
the 6.0 entry.”  (Reply at p. 9.)  Those other tasks are “Review Defendant’s meet
and confer letter; negotiations with Defense counsel,” and the combined entry is
dated “Sept to October 2020.”  Neither Defendant
nor the Court can determine how much of those 6.0 hours were spent on each task.
Some
block-billed items are not dated at all. 
For example, counsel documented 12.0 hours for “Draft multiple settlement
offers to Defendant; multiple calls with client re settlement strategy; calls and
correspondence re Plaintiff's settlement demands on Defendant.”  There are 10.0 hours logged for “Draft Form Interrogatorries
[sic], First and Second Set of Request for Production of Documents, First Set of
Special Interrogatories, and First, Second and Third Request for Admissions.”  Five hours were recorded for “Review Responses
to Discovery.”  Counsel billed 6.0 hours for
“Draft 5 meet and confer letters between 9/30/20 and 11/30/20 and draft Motion to
Compel Further Discovery.”  Counsel spent
45.0 hours on “Correspondence and calls with client including over 250 emails” and
25.0 hours on “Correspondence and calls with opposing counsel including over 400
emails.”  Counsel also billed 24.0 hours for
“Prepare Trial Documents: 3 meet and confers, document preparation (amending trial
documents (trial brief, 1st amended trial brief, second amended trial brief; witness
list and amendments, exhibit list and amendments, draft fact stipulations, exhibit
binder, trial binder),” and he billed another 32.0 hours for “Trial Preparation:
preparation of client; research; witness outlines, order of proof; Attorney trial
notebook preparation; draft opening statement; draft closing statement; draft outline
for direct exam of Plaintiff; draft outline for direct exam of Defendant representative
Rory Cutaia; meet and confer regarding joint trial documents; draft multiple witness
lists; draft multiple exhibit lists.”  None
of these time entries indicate the dates on which the work was performed, and they
suggest that the total time was estimated after the fact, not logged “on a contemporaneous
basis.”  (See Todd Decl. ¶ 23.)
This
practice of block billing can also invite errors.  In “Sept to October 2020,” counsel documented
6.0 hours for “Review Defendant’s meet and confer letter; negotiations with Defense
counsel, and drafting First Amended Complaint (43 paragraphs, 8 pages, 1 count)
based on 2nd Arbitration Demand.”  These are
three very different tasks—and one of those tasks is inaccurate.  The First Amended Complaint was already filed
on February 21, 2020.  “Unexplained discrepancies
entitle a fact finder entirely to reject a witness’s evidence as unreliable.  (Cf. CACI No. 5003 [once you decide a witness
was untruthful about something important, you may disbelieve that witness entirely].)”  (Taylor, supra, 50 Cal.App.5th at p. 212.)  Plaintiff’s counsel admits this discrepancy, but
his explanation is only, “This is a clerical error, but the work was done all the
same.  The record should have reflected ‘January
to February 2020.’”  (Reply at p. 8; Todd
Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.)  This explanation is barely
an explanation at all.  And an admission of
such an extreme “clerical error” again calls into question the accuracy of counsel’s
estimated time and round billing increments.
Counsel
recorded 40.0 hours in “June 2018 to March 2019” as an estimate of time spent by
Plaintiff’s prior counsel for “Initial consult, review client documents including
correspondence with Defendant and Executive Employment Agreement, Meyerson Equity
Agreement, Independent Contractor Agreement, CMG Employment Agreement, Stock Repurchase
Agreement, research, and Drafting First Arbitration Demand.”  (See Todd Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  That time was not this counsel’s time, and he
has no personal knowledge or foundation for this speculative entry.
Considering
the combined effect of the rounded billing numbers, block-billed tasks, ranges of
billing dates (or complete lack of dates), provably false entries, and counsel’s
admission that some records are mere estimates (Todd Decl. ¶ 23), the Court concludes
that most of the billing records are not trustworthy and are unsupported.
Accordingly,
the Court will award attorney fees for only the 42 specific, dated, and not block-billed
hours identified by Defendant.  (See Opposition
at p. 7.)  These are the only hours that are
appropriately documented and proven. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).)  The Court awards Plaintiff $17,850.00 in attorney
fees (42 hours at $425/hour).
Plaintiff
did not file a verified memorandum of costs, but he includes one as an exhibit to
the motion.  (Todd Decl., Exs. C-D.)  Plaintiff requests $4,886.55 in costs.  Defendant did not challenge these costs.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. 
The Court awards Plaintiff $17,850.00 in attorney fees and $4,886.55 in costs.
Moving
party to give notice.
