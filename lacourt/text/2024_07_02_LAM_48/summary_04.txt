And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Gursey's motion to compel a second session of deposition without prejudice. Gursey took the deposition of Stacey Summers on April 5, 2024, which lasted seven hours and ten minutes. Gursey claims it needs additional time to fairly examine Summers due to the complexity of the case, which involves 15 complex tax returns and over 3,000 documents produced. However, the judge has found that Gursey has not shown good cause to take a subsequent deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610, and has not demonstrated that it requires additional time to fairly examine the deponent. The judge has discretion to allow additional time to depose a witness, but Gursey has not met the burden to demonstrate the need for more time.
