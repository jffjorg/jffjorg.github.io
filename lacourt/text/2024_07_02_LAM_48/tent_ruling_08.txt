[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 2, 2024



 
In May 2024, Plaintiff Sindy Amado entered into a settlement
with Defendants Workforce Personnel Inc. and Le Pafe Inc.  On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce
the settlement.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
In
the settlement agreement, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff a total of $95,000.00,
with $57,000.00 paid by Workforce Personnel Inc. and $38,000.00 paid by Le Pafe
Inc. within one week of the effective date of the settlement.  (Ebrahimian Decl., Ex. 3, ¶ 4.1.)  Le Pafe Inc. make its payment, but Workforce Personnel
Inc. did not.
Plaintiff
seeks entry of judgment against both Workforce Personnel Inc. and Le Pafe Inc.  It is undisputed that Le Pafe Inc. made its $38,000.00
payment.  (Ebrahimian Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex.
5; see Le Pafe Opposition.)  Because Le Pafe
Inc. fulfilled its responsibilities under the settlement agreement, the Court will
not enter judgment against it.
Defense
counsel explains that on May 9, 2024, he received an email purportedly from Plaintiff’s
counsel and forwarded it to the company’s accounting department.  (Strange Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.)  The email requested that the settlement funds
be sent directly into Plaintiff’s counsel’s trust account, and it included instructions
for the transfer.  (Strange Decl., Ex. A.)  However, the email was sent from arie@ebrarlavi.com,
and Plaintiff’s counsel’s actual email address is arie@ebralavi.com—a difference
in spelling by one letter.  The email also
included a nearly identical duplication of Plaintiff’s counsel’s signature block.  (Compare Strange Decl., Ex. A with Ebrahimian
Decl., Ex. 6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel never
actually asked for a wire transfer and did not provide the firm’s banking information.  (Ebrahimian Decl. ¶ 27.)  The Court takes judicial notice of the ICANN and
the WHOIS database information for “ebrarlavi.com,” the domain associated with
the email at issue.  The registration information
reflects a domain registration date of May 9, 2024 (the same day as the email to
defense counsel) and a registrant contact in Reykjavik, Iceland.  The registration information does not show any
connection to Plaintiff’s counsel.
Pursuant
to the instructions in the fraudulent email, defense counsel wired its $57,000.00
payment.  (Strange Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)  Counsel later discovered that the wire
transfer information was false and is in the process of having the $57,000.00 returned,
at which time it will pay Plaintiff with a physical check in compliance with the
settlement agreement.  (Strange Decl. ¶¶ 10-13.)
Despite
the unfortunate circumstances described by defense counsel, Workforce Personnel
Inc. is nevertheless in breach of its payment obligations under the settlement agreement,
and Plaintiff is entitled to seek entry of judgment in accordance with the
settlement terms.
The
motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED IN PART.  The motion is granted for the balance owed by
Workforce Personnel Inc.  The motion is denied
as to Le Pafe Inc.
The
proposed judgment improperly seeks judgment against both Defendants jointly and
severally when Le Pafe Inc. is not in breach of the settlement agreement.  Plaintiff is ordered to file a revised proposed
judgment within 30 days.  The revised proposed
judgment should be against Workforce Personnel Inc. only, for the principal amount
of $57,000.00 and attorney fees of $4,500.00, for a total judgment of $61,500.00.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
August 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of Defendant Le Pafe Inc. (Settlement) is scheduled
for August 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
