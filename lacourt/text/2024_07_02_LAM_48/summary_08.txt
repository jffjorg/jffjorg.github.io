And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Plaintiff Sindy Amado and Defendants Workforce Personnel, Inc. and Le Pafe Inc. The settlement agreement was signed by the parties in May 2024, and it provides for the payment of $95,000.00, with $57,000.00 to be paid by Workforce Personnel Inc. and $38,000.00 to be paid by Le Pafe Inc. within one week of the effective date of the settlement.

The Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement on June 6, 2024, after Le Pafe Inc. made its payment but Workforce Personnel Inc. did not. The Court finds that Le Pafe Inc. fulfilled its obligations under the settlement agreement and will not enter judgment against it.

Workforce Personnel Inc., on the other hand, is in breach of its payment obligations under the settlement agreement. The Court grants the motion to enforce settlement in part, ordering Workforce Personnel Inc. to pay the balance owed, which is $57,000.00. The Court also orders the Plaintiff to file a revised proposed judgment within 30 days, which should be against Workforce Personnel Inc. only.

The Court schedules a Non-Appearance Case Review for August 2, 2024, and an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of Defendant Le Pafe Inc. (Settlement) for the same date.
