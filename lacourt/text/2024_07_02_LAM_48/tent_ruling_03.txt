  CASE NO.: 21STCV26919
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 2, 2024



 
On July 21, 2021, Plaintiff Westchester
Fire Insurance Company filed this action against Defendants Michael Schrage and
Leonard Schrage.
On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.
LEGAL
STANDARD
A
plaintiff moving for summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by proving each element of a cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
That includes damages when damages are an element.  (Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241.)  Then the
burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to the cause of action or a defense.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  To establish
a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162-163.)
DISCUSSION
The
Complaint alleges (1) breach of contract, (2) money paid, and (3) express indemnity,
arising from Defendants’ breach of an Indemnity Agreement after Plaintiff issued
surety bonds.
All
of the facts and evidence are undisputed.
On
May 29, 2012, Michael executed a written Indemnity Agreement in favor of Plaintiff.  (Undisputed Material Fact “UMF” 1; see UMF 4.)  On October 16, 2014, Leonard
executed a written addendum to the Indemnity Agreement, whereby he requested to
be added to the Indemnity Agreement and agreed to be bound by all the terms and
conditions of the Indemnity Agreement, which otherwise remained unchanged and in
full force and effect.  (UMF 2.)
Plaintiff
issued certain Dealer Surety Bonds on behalf of car dealerships that were covered
by the Indemnity Agreement.  (UMF 3.)  Plaintiff later received claims against the bonds,
and it incurred losses, legal expenses, and costs in the total amount of $187,390.60.  (UMF 5-11.) 
Under the Indemnity Agreement, Defendants are obligated to indemnify Plaintiff
for this amount.  (UMF 11; see UMF 4.)
Defendants
did not file any oppositions to the motion, so there are no triable issues of material
fact about Plaintiff’s claims or Defendants’ defenses.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  Plaintiff
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
July 10, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
