And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Chantly Banayan's motion for attorney fees and expenses. The Court granted the motion in part, awarding Plaintiff $81,274.50 in attorney fees and $5,339.42 in costs and expenses. The Court found that Plaintiff's counsel billed for reasonable hours and expenses, but reduced the amount of attorney fees due to unreasonably high hourly rates and inefficiencies in billing. The Court also declined to add a multiplier to the attorney fees, finding that the quality of representation was not exceptional. The Court's tentative ruling is based on the case law and the facts of the case, including the settlement between the parties and the billing records submitted by Plaintiff's counsel.
