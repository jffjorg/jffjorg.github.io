Here is a summary of the judge's intentions:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's Motion for Protective Order, denying the request to depose Mr. Nijjar. The judge found that the defendant has shown good cause that Mr. Nijjar does not have personal knowledge of the case and that less intrusive discovery methods are available. The judge also denied the plaintiff's Motion to Compel Deposition, finding that the defendant has designated an agent to testify at deposition on its behalf. The judge granted the defendant's Motion for Protective Order and denied the plaintiff's requests for sanctions.
