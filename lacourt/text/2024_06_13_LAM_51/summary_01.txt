And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that the allegations are conclusory and lack specificity. The judge also noted that there are no specific facts alleged indicating the deliberate nature of the failure to accommodate and terminate the plaintiff. The judge granted the motion to strike with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the complaint and include more specific allegations.
