And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made some tentative decisions. Although the plaintiff did not file their opposition in a timely manner, the court will still consider the case. The defendant served the motion by mail on November 4, 2024, which means they should have done so by October 31, 2024. The plaintiff requested an evidentiary hearing to call the deputies who completed proof of service, but this request is denied as it is now moot. Instead, the plaintiff is directed to file the proof of service and declarations of diligence along with the required Judicial Council form in the future. Additionally, if the plaintiff wishes to serve the defendant by registered agent, they must do so by personal service or comply with the statute governing service by mail.
