DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS



 
MOVING PARTY:              Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Jose Angel Manaiza, Jr.
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
            
Plaintiff Jose Angel Manaiza, Jr. initiated this action on
May 20, 2022, and filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) on April
10, 2024 against Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club for (1)
Breach of Contract– Failure to Fulfill Obligations Under Insurance Policy, (2) Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Failure to Investigate
Claim, and (4) Insurance Bad Faith. 
Plaintiff is self-represented.
 
On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Substituted Service
indicating that “Erin Nguyen, Esq (Corporate Counsel) for Interinsurance
Exchange of The Automobile Club” was purportedly served with the summons and
amended complaint on April 19, 2024 at 3333 Fairview Road, A-451, Costa Mesa,
CA, 92626-1698 (the “Costa Mesa address”). 
The person who served the papers is not a registered California process
server.  
 
On the same day (May 10, 2024), Plaintiff filed a Proof of
Service
 
            On May 31,
2024, Defendant filed a Motion to Quash Service of Process.  The court granted the motion on August 12,
2024.
 
            On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of the summons and FAC.  The proof of service attached a declaration
of due diligence signed by Thierry Ete. The declaration stated that service was
attempted by mailing, on May 13, 2024, copies of the summons, complaint and
amendment to the complaint to the defendant's corporate counsel, Erin Nguyen,
at the defendant's corporate address.
 
On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant via certified
mail copies of the summons and amended complaint.
 
On November 4, 2024, Defendant this Motion to Quash Service
of Process.
 
On November 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.[1]
 
No reply was filed.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
            A summons
may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint: (1) to the person designated as agent for service of process (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 416.10, subd. (a)); (2) to the president, chief executive
officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or
assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief
financial officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation
to receive service of process (Code of Civ. Proc., § 416.10, subd. (b)); or (3)
a method authorized by California Corporations Code sections 1701, 1702, 2110,
or 2111 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 416.10, subd. (c)). 
 
A summons may be served on an unincorporated association
(including a partnership) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the
complaint:
 
(a) If the association is a general or limited
partnership, to the person designated as agent for service of process in a
statement filed with the Secretary of State or to a general partner or the
general manager of the partnership;
 
(b) If the association is not a general or limited
partnership, to the person designated as agent for service of process in a
statement filed with the Secretary of State or to the president or other head
of the association, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a
treasurer or assistant treasurer, a general manager, or a person authorized by
the association to receive service of process.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 416.40, subd. (a), (b).)¿
 
A defendant must file a motion to quash service of summons
on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead unless the time is
extended by stipulation or by a judge’s order for good case.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)¿ Although the notice of motion must designate a
hearing date not more than 30 days after the notice is filed, scheduling a
hearing date beyond the 30-day time period does not deprive the court of
jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.¿ (Olinick v. BMB Entertainment
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1295-96.)¿ Further, a parties’ failure to
object to the timeliness of the motion to quash pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 418.10(a) likewise does not deprive the court of jurisdiction
to consider the merits of the motion. 
(See Marriage of Obrecht (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1, 16-17.)
¿ 
Filing a proof of service by a registered process server
creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.¿ (American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code, § 647
[“The return of a process server registered pursuant to ... the Business and
Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption, affecting
the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return”].)¿
However, the presumption only arises if the proof of service complies with the
statutory requirements regarding such proofs.¿ (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-42.)¿ Proof of service of
summons may be impeached by evidence that contradicts it.  (City of Los
Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.)¿¿ 
¿ 
When a defendant moves to quash service of summons, the
plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”¿  (Coulston
v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)¿ 
            
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Defendant moves for an order quashing service of the summons
and complaint on the grounds that (1) Ms. Nguyen is not Defendant’s agent for
service of process and (2) service by certified mail is not proper service of
process for Defendant.  The court agrees
in part.
 
First, Ms. Nguyen is not Defendant’s agent for service of
process.  In support, Defendant submits a
copy of the California Department of Insurance’s online profile which reflects
that Defendant’s registered agent for service of process is Melissa DeKoven,
c/o Corporation Service Company at 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento,
CA 95833.  (See Nguyen Decl., Ex. C.)  
 
Second, although service of process may be effectuated by
certified mail (see Code Civ. Proc., § 415.30, subd. (b)), Plaintiff did not
comply with the statute.  Specifically,
Plaintiff did not provide a notice or an acknowledgement of receipt of summons
which complies with Section 415.30(b). 
(See Manaiza Decl., Exs. A and B.) 
The court cannot tell from Plaintiff’s submission what documents were
sent to Defendant’s agent (Ms. DeKoven) or Defendant’s new counsel (Mr.
Castronovo), or whether they were sent to these individuals in their capacity
as Defendant’s agents for service. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues (1) the motion to quash was
filed late, (2) Plaintiff properly served Defendant on May 20, 2024, and
subsequently served Defendant’s new counsel, and (3) the court already ruled on
the sufficiency of service by discharging the Order to Show Cause Re: Service
of Summons on September 9, 2024.  These
arguments are unavailing.
 
First, the court exercised its discretion to consider
Plaintiff’s late filed opposition.[2]  The court likewise exercises that discretion
to consider Defendant’s motion.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)
 
Second, Plaintiff did not properly serve Defendant on May
20, 2024.  As Plaintiff indicates, the
Orange County Sherriff and Plaintiff’s process server Thierry Ete served
Defendant’s general counsel, Ms. Nguyen. 
(Manaiza Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.)  As
discussed, Ms. Nguyen is not Defendant’s agent for service of process.  Further, Mr. Castronovo is not Defendant’s
agent for service of process. 
 
Third, the court did not rule on the sufficiency of service
of process.  On September 9, 2024, the
court merely discharged the Order to Show Cause.  No rulings were made.  (See Minute Order, 9/09/24.) 
 
Accordingly, the court finds Plaintiff did not properly
serve the summons and amended complaint on Defendant.  Plaintiff does not offer any argument or
evidence directing a different result.[3]
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.[4]  The court sets an OSC re: Service of Summons
for January 17, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
            Defendant
to give notice.
 
 
Dated:   December 3,
