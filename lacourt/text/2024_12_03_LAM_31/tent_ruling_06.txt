            The Willows Community School (The Willows or Defendant) is a
private school in Culver City.  Tuition costs
between $32,525 and $45,000 per year. Dee and Paul Barshon (the Barshons) son
and Shira Aflalo (Aflalo) and Yotam Shochat’s (Schochat) daughter (collectively,
Individual Plaintiffs) were students at The Willows.  
 
In 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic began.  Like other schools, The Willows transitioned
from in-person to remote instruction.  For
the 2021-2022 school year, The Willows returned to in-person instruction.  Individual Plaintiffs signed enrollment
contracts prior to the start of the 2021-2022 school year.  During the fall of 2021, The Willows issued a
policy requiring students (ages 5 to 11) to take the Covid-19 vaccine series to
attend school in person.  Students were
required to have taken or at least begun the vaccine series by February 1,
2022.  Further, the policy required
parents to release The Willows from liability for any claims associated with
exposure to Covid-19, and to agree to testing, screening, and quarantine
requirements, as well as other safety precautions.  All exemption requests were denied.  The 2021-2022 enrollment contract did not
contain a Covid vaccine policy.
 
             As of February 1, 2022, the Barshons’ son was
effectively kicked out of The Willows because he had not received or started
the Coivd vaccine series, and The Willows refused to offer the independent
study program through Zoom.  (The Willows
had been providing children who did not receive the Covid shot with the
program.)
 
            During the
2021 winter break, Aflalo and Shochat’s daughter became sick with Covid-19 and
was prohibited from taking the Covid shot. 
Despite furnishing a doctor’s note stating she was medically unable to
take the Covid shot for ninety days, The Willows refused to allow Aflalo and
Shochat’s daughter to attend in person after April 22, 2022.  Aflalo and Shochat’s daughter finished the
school year remotely and were effectively excluded from of The Willows due to
the Covid policy.  Individual Plaintiffs’
children are no longer students at The Willows.
 
On January 12, 2024, Individual Plaintiffs and nonprofit corporation
Protection of the Educational Rights of Kids (PERK) (collectively, Plaintiffs)
commenced this action against The Willows. 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint
(SAC) for (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Declaratory Relief re Enrollment
Contract.  The first cause of action is
asserted by Individual Plaintiffs only. 
The enrollment contract is attached as an exhibit to the SAC.
 
On October 7, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion Petitioning
the Court for an Order Compelling Arbitration and for a Stay Pending
Arbitration. 
 
On November 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition, stating they will not oppose the motion to compel arbitration in
order to serve the interests of efficiency and judicial economy.  Plaintiffs have asked Defendant to propose a
forum and an arbitrator with the hopes of having the arbitration scheduled for
the fall of 2025.  Plaintiffs requests
the court to retain jurisdiction to ensure that process is followed.
 
Given the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Plaintiffs’
claims, the motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED.  The court sets a Status Conference re:
Arbitration for May 2, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. 
The proceedings are stayed pending arbitration.
            
            Defendant
to give notice.
