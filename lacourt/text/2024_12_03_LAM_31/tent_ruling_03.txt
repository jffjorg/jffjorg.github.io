I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a lemon law case.  On September 10, 2024, defendant Ford Motor
Company (FMC) filed this motion to compel plaintiff Darrell C. Davis
(Plaintiff) to appear for deposition.  FMC
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff. 
 
            On November
18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
            On November
22, 2024, FMC filed a reply.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
In any case brought by an employee
or applicant for employment against an employer for acts or omissions arising
out of or relating to the employment relationship, the length of the deposition
examination is not limited to seven hours of total testimony. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.290, subd. (b)(4).)
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification
making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            FMC seeks
an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition. In support, FMC states
having served Plaintiff with four deposition notices.  The first notice was served on October 26,
2023.  Plaintiff objected due to
unavailability.  No alternative dates
were provided.  The second (amended) notice
was served on May 9, 2024.  Plaintiff’s
deposition was noticed for August 23, 2024. 
However, given that trial was scheduled for December 2, 2024, FMC attempted
to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding an agreeable date to
complete the deposition sooner. 
Plaintiff’s counsel indicated a date would be provided soon but did not
provide a date.  
 
FMC withdrew the amended notice and served a second amended
notice on June 25, 2024.  Plaintiff’s
deposition was noticed for July 8, 2024. 
FMC again requested that Plaintiff provide alternative dates.  Plaintiff’s counsel provided July 23, 2024 as
an agreeable date.  Accordingly, FMC
withdrew the second amended notice and served the third amended notice reflecting
the July 23, 2024 date.  However, despite
providing the July 23, 2024 date, Plaintiff objected to the third amended
notice due to a scheduling conflict.   (See Amin Decl., ¶¶ 2-7, Exs. A-I.)  Plaintiff has not appeared for
deposition.  This motion followed.
 
Plaintiff opposes the motion on the grounds because (1) FMC
did not meet and confer prior to filing this motion, and (2) to date, FMC has
not produced its personal most qualified (PMQ) for deposition or provided a
date for the same.  Plaintiff further
represents the motion is unnecessary because he has always been willing to be
deposed.
 
Plaintiff’s arguments are not well-taken.  As detailed in defense counsel’s declaration,
FMC has attempted to schedule Plaintiff’s deposition since October of
2023.  In that time period, FMC met and
conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel about mutually agreeable dates.  Plaintiff eventually provided a date only to
object to the deposition based on a scheduling conflict.  Given this background, a motion to compel is
necessary.  As to FMC’s alleged unwillingness
to produce its PMQ for deposition, that is not grounds to oppose a motion to
compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition.   
 
            Given
FMC’s undisputed efforts to take Plaintiff’s deposition, the court finds good
cause to compel Plaintiff to appear for his
deposition.  
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            FMC request
sanctions against Plaintiff.  In the
context of a motion to compel a party’s deposition, sanctions are mandatory,
unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿
 
Here, the court finds imposition
of sanctions is warranted.  FMC noticed
Plaintiff’s deposition on four occasions, dating back to October of 2023.  To date, Plaintiff has not appeared for
deposition.  Accordingly, the court
imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the requested sum of $560.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The motion
is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Darrell C. Davis is
ordered to appear for deposition prior to March 3, 2025.
 
            The request
for sanctions is GRANTED.  Sanctions are
imposed against Plaintiff in the sum of $560, to be paid to Defendant prior to
March 3, 2025.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
