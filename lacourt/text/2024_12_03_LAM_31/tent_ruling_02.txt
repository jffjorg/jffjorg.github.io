[1] Plaintiff did not timely file his
opposition.  Nevertheless, the court
exercises its discretion to consider the filing.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)  


[2] Defendant served this motion by
mail on November 4, 2024.  Accordingly,
Defendant should have served the motion by mail no later than October 31, 2024.
 (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1013, subd.
(a).)
 


[3] Plaintiff requests an evidentiary
hearing to call the deputies from the OC Sheriff and Los Angeles Sheriff who
completed proof of service on the defendant. 
The request is denied.  Given the
ruling herein, the request is moot.  Alternatively,
and in the future, Plaintiff is directed to file the proofs of service and
deputies’ declaration of diligence along with the requisite Judicial Council
form for Service of Summons (POS-010) which is approved for mandatory use.  
 


[4] If Plaintiff wishes to pursue service
by way of registered agent, Plaintiff must do so by personal service (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.10) or, if by mail, Plaintiff must comply with the statute
governing service by mail (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.30, subd. (b).)
