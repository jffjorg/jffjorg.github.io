And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff, Darrell C. Davis, to appear for deposition. The plaintiff has not appeared for deposition despite four deposition notices being served on him. The parties have met and conferred regarding mutually agreeable dates for the deposition, but the plaintiff has objected to each notice. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear for deposition is unreasonable and that sanctions are warranted. The judge imposes sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $560. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition prior to March 3, 2025.
