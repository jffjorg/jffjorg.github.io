And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling in the case of Charles Wilder v. General Motors, LLC (Case No. 23STCV05995). The case involves a Song-Beverly action relating to a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado that was not repaired by General Motors, LLC, despite a warranty claim by Charles Wilder. Wilder filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs, which was opposed by General Motors, LLC.

The judge found that Wilder is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees as the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge reduced the award by $5,000 due to discrepancies in the billing rates of Wilder's attorneys. The judge also reduced certain entries in the billing records, finding that some of the time quoted was excessive or unreasonable.

The judge awarded Wilder attorneys' fees in the sum of $34,702.50 and costs in the sum of $2,217.86, for a total award of $39,625.36. The judge found that the costs were incurred, or will be reasonably incurred, in the prosecution of this litigation.
