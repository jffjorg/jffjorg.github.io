And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and has determined that the matter should be continued to allow the Plaintiff to file a new default packet. The Court notes that the Defendant has reserved a date for a motion to vacate default, and that the Plaintiff's original complaint does not set forth the amount sought in damages. The Court will not award default judgment in an amount greater than $25,000, as this is the maximum amount set forth in the complaint. The Plaintiff must file a first amended complaint, setting forth the amount sought, and the Court will then strike the entry of default on the original complaint. The Plaintiff may then seek re-entry of default on the amended complaint. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: dismissal or entry of default judgment on December 27, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., and the Plaintiff is required to give notice.
