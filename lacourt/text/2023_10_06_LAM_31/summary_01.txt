And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denied Petitioner's motion to strike Respondent's response to the petition to correct arbitration award. The Judge also denied Petitioner's petition to correct arbitration award without prejudice to Petitioner bringing a motion to confirm arbitration award.

The Judge found that Respondent was not properly served with the petition, and that the petition was not served within the 10-day deadline. The Judge also found that the petition was not timely served, and that it failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1286.8 and 1288.

The Judge noted that the petition was based on a purported error in the arbitration award, but that the error did not meet the standards for correcting an arbitration award under Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.6. The Judge also noted that the petition did not seek relief available under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1286.6, and that it failed to cite any authority that would allow the court to "correct" an arbitration award in the manner requested.

The Judge's ruling was based on the court's findings that the petition was improperly and untimely served, and that it failed to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285-1288. The Judge's ruling did not address the merits of the arbitration award or the disputes between the parties.
