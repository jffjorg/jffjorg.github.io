And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Kristen Robertson, Candice Robertson, and NGX3, LLC, et al. The case involves a demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The demurrer argues that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200 and that the claim fails to state a cause of action. The judge finds that the allegations underlying the unfair competition claim are insufficient and that the plaintiffs failed to plead specific facts showing a violation of the law. The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend.
