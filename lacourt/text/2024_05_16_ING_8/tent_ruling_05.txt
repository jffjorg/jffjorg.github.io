I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            On
February 14, 2017, Plaintiff, Jacob DeWitt (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants, David Joseph Burton, Sandee Burton, husband and wife as
Trustees of the 2008 Burton Family Trust, and DOES 1 through 20. On September
18, 2019, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of
action: (1) Ejectment; (2) Trespass; (3) Declaratory Relief; and (4) Slander. 
 
            Plaintiff
notes in his moving papers that on July 17 through July 19, and on July 21,
2023, this Court conducted a bench trial in this matter. Plaintiff notes that
Defendants requested, and the Court granted leave to file a supplemental trial
brief by Monday, July 24, 2024, at which point the case was deemed under
submission for decision. The Court issued a tentative decision on the matter.
On October 4, 2023, this Court issued a tentative decision after the bench
trial, in favor of Plaintiff on the declaratory relief and trespass causes of
action, that the ejectment cause of action was mooted by the parties’
stipulation, and in favor of Defendants on the slander of title cause of action.

 
            Plaintiff
filed an objection to the tentative decision which was never set or calendared
for ruling until Plaintiff’s ex parte application to do so. 
 
B. Procedural¿
 
On October 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an Objection to the Tentative Decision. Because of internal clerical
error at the court, the objections were not calendared, set for hearing, or
ruled upon in timely fashion.  On April
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order to set a hearing
on Plaintiff’s objections and proposals to the Court’s tentative decision, or
alternatively, for a court ruling on Plaintiff’s objections and proposals to
the Court’s tentative decision. On April 29, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition brief to the ex parte motion.
 
On April 30, 2024, this Court
set the hearing for May 16, 2024. 
 
On  May 9, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion. On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿                                                                                 
Here,
Plaintiff has filed an Objection to Tentative Decision after Bench Trial and
Proposed Statement of Decision. Plaintiff notes that he takes issue with this
Court’s determination that the cause of action for ejectment had been mooted by
virtue of the parties’ stipulation as to the fences, stairs, and handrail.
Plaintiff contends that on page 29, lines 15-18, the Court made it clear that
as a condition of determining that the ejectment claim is mooted, the Burtons
shall remove the encroachments prior to the end of the year. However, Plaintiff
noted that his concern is that if a Judgment had been entered prior to December
31, 2023, and the Burtons failed to remove the encroachments, Plaintiff was
concerned the Court may be barred from “modifying” the judgment already
entered. 
 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1590(g), “[a]ny party may, within 15 days
after the proposed statement of decision and judgment have been served, serve
and file objections to the proposed statement of decision or judgment.” The
PSOD was filed and served by mail on October 4, 2023.  The Plaintiff’s objections were filed on
October 20, 2023, within the 15-day period as extended by service of the PSOD
by mail.  Because of a clerical error,
the objections were not addressed in 2023, which raises the Burtons’ concern
that the Court imposed a year-end deadline for performance of the stipulated encroachment
removal that has long since passed. 
Neither side brought the clerical issue to the Court’s attention until months
later, so the Court set a hearing to address each of the sides’ issues with the
PSOD and the December 31, 2023 compliance date. 
The Court will take oral argument on these issues, but tentatively would
rule as follows:
 
1.    
Mr.
Dewitt’s objection to the mistaken reference to Colt Road as a public rather than
a private road should be corrected in a final SOD, the Burtons having not quarreled
with that reference in their opposition;
2.    
Mr.
Dewitt’s objection to the mistaken reference to his pro rata share of
maintenance expenses should be corrected in the final SOD to 1/9 rather than
1/8; and
3.    
The
PSOD’s reference to December 31, 2023 as a deadline for removal of the encroachments
should be amended to June 30, 2024 in light of the passage of time, and a
proviso should be added to the final SOD that if the Burtons fail to remove the
encroachments from Mr. Dewitt’s property by that date – unless a stay of enforcement
of that condition is entered by this Court or the appellate court – then Mr.
Dewitt shall be entitled to arrange for the encroachment removal himself at a
cost not to exceed $1,000 which would then be chargeable against the
Burtons.
