I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
On May 10,
2023, Plaintiffs, Kristen Robertson and Candice Robertson (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants, NGX3, LLC, Coastline Real
Estate Advisors, Inc., and DOES 1 through 50. On September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for: (1)
Failure to Provide Habitable Dwelling; (2) Unfair Competition (Business and
Professions Code § 17200); and (3) Negligence. 
 
Now,
Defendants, NGX3, LLC and Coastline Real Estate Advisors, Inc. (“Demurring
Defendants”) file a Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ FAC. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
 
On December 12, 2023,
Demurring Defendants filed this demurrer to the FAC. On February 5, 2024, the
parties filed a stipulation to continue the hearing on demurrer. Further, on
April 16, 2024, the parties filed another application to continue the demurrer.
Moreover, again on Mary 7, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to continue
the hearing to May 16, 2024, which was granted. On May 9, 2024, Demurring
Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition.
 
 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard
 
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co.
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A
pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label
the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell
what he or she is supposed to respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition
Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.)¿¿ 
 
B.   
Discussion

 
Demurring Defendants demur to
the FAC on the grounds that they argue Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their
Second Cause of Action for Unfair Competition under California Business and
Professions Code section 17200, et seq., and also that this cause of action
fails to state a cause of action against Demurring Defendants. 
 
California Business and Professions Code, Section 17200, et seq.
 
First,
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are not in possession of any units owned by
Defendants, and thus, do not have standing to bring this motion.  Further, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails
to state sufficient fact to state a claim against Defendant.
To set forth a claim for a violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200 (“UCL”), Plaintiff must establish Defendant was engaged in an
“unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive,
untrue or misleading advertising” and certain specific acts. (Bus. & Prof.
Code, § 17200.) A cause of action for unfair competition “is not an all-purpose
substitute for a tort or contract action.” (Cortez
v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs plead that Defendants transact business, or have transacted
business, by owning, operating, managing, and allowing residential occupancy
and use and collecting rental income from property within the State of
California. (FAC, ¶ 44.) Plaintiffs assert, in a conclusory way, that
Defendant’s actions are in violation of the laws and public policies of the
State of California and are inimical to the rights and interests of the public.
(FAC, ¶ 44.) Further, Plaintiffs further contends that Defendants have engaged
in one or more unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices, as
prohibited under California Business and Professions Code section 17200, et
seq., through the following conduct: (1) By maintaining unsafe conditions in violation
of State of California and the Los Angeles County//Municipal Code; and (2) By
maintaining an unsafe building in violation of State of California and the Los
Angeles County//Municipal Code. (FAC, ¶ 45.)
 
Plaintiffs
further allege that as a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and
practices, Defendants have received and will receive income and other benefits,
which they would not have received if they had not engaged in the unlawful,
unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices, and that Plaintiffs are
entitled to restitution from Defendants, including, but not limited to,
disgorgement of an ill-gotten gains. (FAC, ¶ 46.)
 
Putting
aside the standing issue for now, this Court finds that the
allegations underlying Plaintiff’s unfair competition claim are insufficient to
state a claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200 because they
are conclusory.  Plaintiff fails to identify any specific provision of the
Municipal Code that Defendant violated. Although in other portions of the FAC,
Plaintiffs note that they are alleging violations of Civil Code 1941 and Health
and Safety Code § 17920.3, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts specifying what
Defendant’s violations are or showing that Defendant’s conduct amount to a business
practice rather than a violation that has affected Plaintiffs
alone. 
 
This Court notes that it need not
reach the standing issue in this demurrer as it finds Plaintiffs failed to
sufficiently plead a cause of action for Violation of Business &
Professions Code section 17200. As such, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with twenty
(20) days leave to amend. 
 

IV.
CONCLUSION¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend. 
¿¿¿ 
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
