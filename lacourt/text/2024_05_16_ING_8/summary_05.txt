And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court will tentatively rule as follows:

1. Correct Mr. Dewitt's objection to the mistaken reference to Colt Road as a public rather than a private road.
2. Correct Mr. Dewitt's objection to the mistaken reference to his pro rata share of maintenance expenses to 1/9 rather than 1/8.
3. Amend the PSOD's reference to December 31, 2023 as a deadline for removal of the encroachments to June 30, 2024.
4. Add a proviso to the final SOD stating that if the Burtons fail to remove the encroachments from Mr. Dewitt's property by June 30, 2024, Mr. Dewitt shall be entitled to arrange for the encroachment removal himself at a cost not to exceed $1,000, which would then be chargeable against the Burtons."
