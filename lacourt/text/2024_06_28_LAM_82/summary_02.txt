And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Petitioner Harlem Chadwick's petition for relief from the late claim requirement. Petitioner seeks to file a late tort claim against the City of Compton, City of Los Angeles, and County of Los Angeles, alleging that the intersection where his mother was killed in an automobile collision was dangerous due to the lack of a controlled left turn device. The court finds that Petitioner's petition is untimely, as it was filed over two years after the expiration of the six-month period to file a claim. Petitioner had previously filed applications for permission to file a late claim, which were denied by the respective entities. The court also denies Petitioner's argument that the petition should "relate back" to petitions filed by his siblings.
