And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for relief from the late claim requirement. The petitioner, Raymond T. Grimes, mistakenly filed an administrative complaint and grievance with the Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center and submitted a claim to LA Care, rather than the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The Board denied the claim as untimely, and the petitioner then applied for leave to file a late claim. The judge found that the application for late claim was filed two days after the deadline had passed and that the petitioner did not establish good cause for failing to present the claim within six months of the accrual of the cause of action. The judge also found that the petitioner did not satisfy his burden of establishing that his mistake was "reasonable" and his neglect was "excusable." The judge denied the petition and ordered that the court's clerk provide notice.
