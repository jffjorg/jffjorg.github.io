Solutions for Hope v. California Department of Social Services, Case No.
23STCP00243
 THIS HEARING IS BEING CONTINUED
The
court will be unexpectedly dark on Friday, June 28, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Because
the petition is fully briefed and the trial date is not until July 26, 2024,,
the court advances and continues the hearing on the ex parte application to
permit supplemental briefing and continue the trial date from June 28, 2024, to
July 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  If the court grants the ex parte application,
it will set a new trial date on July 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The court’s
clerk shall provide notice via email.
