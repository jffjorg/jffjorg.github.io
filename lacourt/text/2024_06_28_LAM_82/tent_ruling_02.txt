[Tentative] Order
Denying Petition for Relief from Late Claim
 
 
NOTICE: The court will be unexpectedly dark on Friday,
June 28, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.  Therefore,
this matter will be called at 1:30 p.m. instead of 9:30 a.m.  
 
            Petitioner Harlem Chadwick, a minor, by and through his
Guardian Ad Litem, Wonda L. Hale, (“Petitioner”) seeks leave
to file a late tort claim against governmental entity pursuant to Government
Code § 946.6 and Code of Civil Procedure section 946.6.  On or about May 30, 2020, Petitioner’s mother
was killed during an automobile collision at an intersection that Petitioner
alleges was dangerous due to the lack of a controlled left turn device.  Government Code section 911.2(a) states that
“a claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to
personal property . . . shall be presented . . . not later than six months
after the accrual of the cause of action.” 
If written notice of the board’s action or inaction (which amounts to a
rejection) on the claim is tendered pursuant to section 913, the claimant has
six months from the time the written notice is personally delivered or
deposited in the mail to file suit against the public entity.  (Gov. Code § 945.6(a)(1).)  This six-month period expired on November 30,
2021.
 
            Petitioner
retained counsel on January 7, 2021.  If
a claimant fails to make a claim within six months, the claimant may make a
written application to the board of the public entity for permission to present
a late claim within a reasonable time but not to exceed one year from the
accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov.
Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  Petitioner filed
applications for permission to file a late claim on May 24, 2021.  The County of Los Angeles denied the
application on June 14, 2021.  The City
of Los Angeles denied the application on June 30, 2021.  The City of Compton denied the application on
July 6, 2021. 
 
If the board denies the
application to present a late claim, the claimant may then petition the Court
for relief.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).)  The petitioner must demonstrate each of the
following: (1) that the late claim application made to the board was denied or
deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present the claim within six
months of the accrual of the cause of action; and (3) the contents of the claim
as required by Government Code section 910. 
“The petition shall be filed within six months after the application to
the board is denied . . . .”  (Gov. Code
§ 946.6(b).)  
 
In the instant case, the board
denied the claims on June 14, June 30, and July 6, 2021.  The petition was filed over two years later,
on July 13, 2023.  Petitioner did not
file a reply brief or address the timeliness of the petition.  (See Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor
Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure to
address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  Instead, Petitioner suggests in her petition
that this petition should “relate back” to petitions for relief from late
claim, which were filed be her siblings in Case Numbers 21STCP04249,
21STCP04250, and 21STCP04251.  The court
grants Respondents’ request for judicial notice of the orders in these cases.  Petitioner cites no authority for the
proposition that a petition for late claim may relate back to petitions by
different petitioners.  Regardless, the
court (Beckloff, J.) denied each of the petitions.  (See Request for Judicial Notice, Exhs. C
& D.) 
 
Petitioner suggests that this
petition is timely because she was a minor. 
Under Government Code section 946.6, a minor need not present the
application to the board until “six months of the person turning 18 years old
or a year after the claim accrues, whichever occurs first.”  (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(3).)  The statute states that the minor still must
file the petition within six months of the denial of the application.  (See Gov. Code § 946.6(b).)  
 
Based upon the foregoing, the
court orders as follows:
 
1.         Petitioner’s petition for relief from the claims requirement
is denied.
 
2.         The court’s clerk shall provide notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
