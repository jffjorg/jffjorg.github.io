And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the defendants' motions to compel responses from the plaintiffs until August 1, 2023. The motions were filed on April 24, 2023, and the plaintiffs have failed to respond to the discovery requests. The judge notes that the plaintiffs have also filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, which has not been opposed. The judge intends to grant the motions to compel responses if the plaintiffs do not provide verified, code-compliant responses before the continued hearing.
