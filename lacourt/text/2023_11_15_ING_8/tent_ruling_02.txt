I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
 
            On November
10, 2022, Plaintiff, Elsy Rojas and Marlin Marroquin (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against Defendant, Rebecca Lynn Lachance (“Defendant”). The Complaint
alleges causes of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General
Negligence, concerning a motor vehicle collision on Sepurlveda Boulevard on
November 24, 2020.  
 
            On January 12, 2023, Defendant notes
that it propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff. Defendants note that Plaintiff’s
verified responses were due on or before February 14, 2023. Defendant notes
that on March 9, 2023, having not received any discovery responses nor a
request for an extension of time to respond, Defendant sent a meet and confer
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, Kelly Lawrence Casado, Esq., requesting verified
responses without objection to the outstanding discovery by March 23, 2023.
Defendant also noted that a second meet and confer correspondence was sent on
April 6, 2023. 
 
As such, Defendant has filed these Motions to Compel. 
 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
            On
April 24, 2023, Defendant filed her Motions to Compel. To date, no opposition
has been filed.  On June 6, 2023
Plaintiffs’ counsel Kelly Casado filed a motion to be relieved as their
attorney.  
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Motion to Compel Responses  
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)¿ ¿ 
 
Further, “A party may demand that any other party produce . . . a
document that is in the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom
the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010(b).) The demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete,
(2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).) “The motion shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand,” and “[t]he
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b).) 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).)
 
Lastly, “Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action
admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters
of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (CCP
§ 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ (CCP § 2033.250(a).)
 
Here, based on the court file, there is some confusion
about how many motions are pending. On the Court’s end, there are six (6) motions
to be heard on Tuesday, June 13, 2023, four of which are against Plaintiff
Marlin Marroquin, and two of which are against Elsy Marroquin.  On Friday afternoon, the Court attempted to
get into contact with counsel for Defendant to discuss what appear to be the
duplicate filings, and to discuss the impact of the pending motion by counsel
for both Plaintiffs to withdraw from the representation.  However, the Court’s staff was unsuccessful
in raising anyone at the defense firm and has not received a response as of the
time this Tentative Ruling is being posted. 
Given the lack of any responses to the pending discovery and the pending
motion to be relieved as counsel, the Court’s tentative ruling is to CONTINUE
the hearings until August 1, 2023 on what appear to be four unique motions but
with an indication that all four motions would be granted if Plaintiffs fail to
provide verified, Code-compliant responses before the continued hearing.
