And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case between Ocean Recovery, LLC (plaintiff) and Sullivan Curtis Monroe Insurance Services, LLC, Scottsdale Indemnity Company, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, and Scottsdale Insurance Company (defendants). The case involves a dispute over the sufficiency of the plaintiff's causes of action and the validity of the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for professional negligence, finding that the plaintiff has failed to adequately plead the necessary facts to support this claim.

The judge has also granted the motion to strike the August 7, 2023 TAC, finding that the document was filed without leave of court and is therefore not a proper pleading.

Finally, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend for the defendants Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Scottsdale Insurance Company, finding that the plaintiff has failed to adequately plead the necessary facts to support their liability.

The judge's ruling is based on the pleadings filed in the case, including the complaints, amended complaints, demurrers, and motions to strike. The judge has considered the applicable laws and statutes, including the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Civil Code.
