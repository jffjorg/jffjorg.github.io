And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the defendants, Antonio Trujillo and Lucila Parra, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Juanita Canche Pech. The plaintiff has alleged causes of action for Quiet Title, Financial Elder Abuse, Fraud, Violation of Penal Code § 496, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.

The Judge sustains Defendant Trujillo's demurrer to the Quiet Title cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a basis of title to the property. The Judge also sustains Defendant Parra's demurrer to the Fraud cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to plead the required elements of fraud.

The Judge overrules Defendant Parra's demurrer to the Financial Elder Abuse cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to maintain a cause of action for financial elder abuse against Defendant Parra.

The Judge sustains Defendant Parra's demurrer to the Violation of Penal Code § 496 cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to plead the required elements of the claim.

The Judge sustains Defendant Parra's demurrer to the Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to plead extreme or outrageous conduct.

The Judge grants the defendants 20 days to amend their demurrers and allows the plaintiff to amend her complaint to cure any pleading defects. The Judge sets the matter for a final ruling on November 15, 2023.
