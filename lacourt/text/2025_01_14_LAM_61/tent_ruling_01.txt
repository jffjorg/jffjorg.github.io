  Case Number:  21STCV06691    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  61 TentativePlaintiff Sylvia Santiago’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 212–214, 223, 230, 235, 240, and 246, with individual names produced limited to that individual’s initials. The motion is also GRANTED as to No. 243, 244, 249, and 250. The motion is DENIED as to Interrogatories No. 206–211, 220–222, 227–229, 232–234, 237, 251, and 252.Defendant to provide notice.AnalysisI. MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER – INTERROGATORIES“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) The propounding party must demonstrate that the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)Plaintiff Sylvia Santiago (Plaintiff) moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories 206–214, 220–223, 227–230, 232–235, 237–240, 243–244, 246, and 248–252 from Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Defendant). The interrogatories fall into the following broad categories:· Interrogatories No. 206–214, 220–223, 227–230, 232–235, 237, 240, 246, 248, 251, and 252, which ask Defendant to identify contact and other information for every person it hired or promoted from 2017 onward in its Inpatient Quality Department, the Family Care Center, Utilization Management, Neurology Department, any department for which Plaintiff sought a transfer or position, or any nurse position at Defendant’s Baldwin Park Facility in general, as well as the dates of hire and employment, disciplinary records, and their collective bargaining units for those so identified.· Interrogatories No. 243, 244, 249, and 250, which sought information as to why Plaintiff’s applications for transfer were denied, and who made the decision.Defendant provided objections to all interrogatories, and responded to Interrogatories No. 212–214, 223, 230, 235, 240, and 246, limiting its responsive information only to the Neurology Department (to which Plaintiff had applied for a position) or else those specific positions to which Plaintiff had applied. Defendant also provided some responsive information to Interrogatories No. 244, which sought the reasoning for the denial of Plaintiff’s transfer requests. But Defendant responded to the other interrogatories only with objections, reasoning that they sought private personnel information about other employees in positions and departments to which Plaintiff had not applied.Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to the full scope of the information sought — i.e. the names, contact information, dates of employment, disciplinary records, and collective bargaining units of every nurse hired or transferred at the Baldwin Park facility from 2017 to the present — because Plaintiff sought a transfer out of her position as a reasonable accommodation, and thus she has an interest in locating potentially vacant nursing positions that Defendant allowed to be filled by others rather than open to Plaintiff. (Motion at p. 7, citing Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc. (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1376, 1389 [“Courts have made it clear that “an employer has a duty to reassign a disabled employee if an already funded, vacant position at the same level exists.”].) And because Defendant has cited both the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement and Plaintiff’s involvement in a personal improvement plan as reasons for the denial of her requests for transfer, Plaintiff argues that the disciplinary actions against other employees and bargaining units for each employee are relevant to the subject matter of this action. (Motion at pp. 11–12.)Defendant in opposition contends that Plaintiff failed to adequately meet and confer as to Special Interrogatories, Sets 8–10, which comprise all interrogatories at issue except for Interrogatories No. 206–214. (Motion at pp. 7–8.) However, the evidence reveals that Plaintiff attempted to confer with Defendant, and sought extensions of the motion deadline in order to confer when Defendant failed to timely respond. (Soholov Decl. Exh. M.) Defendant delayed responding until the motion deadline was imminent, and despite sending assurances of its willingness to confer, it pointedly omitted any mention of extending the motion deadline. (Ibid.) Thus while the parties arguably did not adequately meet and confer on the issues of this motion, the blame for this fact rests largely with Defendant.Defendant also argues that the motion is largely moot because it is preparing supplemental responses to most of the interrogatories at issue. (Opposition at p. 8.) But Defendant only proposes supplemental responses; it does not present them to the court or contend that they have been served. Per Plaintiff’s reply papers, none have been. (Reply at p. 4.) Thus the hypothetical provision of supplemental responses has no bearing on the present motion.But there is merit to Defendant’s substantive position as regards Plaintiff’s request for information concerning departments and positions to which she never applied. Plaintiff seeks much personnel information about a large number of Defendant’s employees, including their contact information, dates of birth, dates of employment, and disciplinary records. These employees possess privacy rights for this kind of personnel information. (Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1252.) The intrusion that Plaintiff asks is all the more intrusive because the individuals whose information is requested are not percipient witnesses to any of the incidents alleged in the complaint. And although Plaintiff has argued that the information sought possesses some relevance to the case, given they represent positions that Plaintiff might have filled, this limited probative value must be balanced against the privacy interest possessed by these many individuals, as well as the sheer scope of the requested information in relation to Plaintiff’s claims. (Puerto, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.)An appropriate balance is struck by denying the motion as to interrogatories that seek information for employees in departments other than those occupied or applied to by Plaintiff. This requires denying the motion as to Interrogatories 206–211, 220–222, 227–229, 232–234, 237, 251, and 252.By the same token, the motion is properly granted in part as to Interrogatories No. 212–214, 223, 230, 235, 240, 246, and 248, which relate to departments and positions to which Plaintiff applied. Defendant responded to Interrogatories No. 212, 213, 223, 230, 235, and 240, which concerned the neurology department, with information only as to those particular positions towhich Plaintiff applied, which typically worked out to providing information concerning only one employee. Given Plaintiff’s authority concerning the relevance of other open positions, Plaintiff may properly seek information concerning other employees in nurse positions in the same department hired or transferred in, if they are identified by their initials rather than their names to protect their privacy, a limiting proposition to which Plaintiff has already agreed. (Motion at p. 11.) A further response is also required as to Interrogatory No. 246, as this interrogatory sought the dates of employment for the responsive employees, and Defendant provided only their dates of hire (among other information). (Separate Statement at pp. 120–126.)Further response is also required for Interrogatories No. 243, 244, 249, and 250. These interrogatories sought information particularly concerning the employees who decided to deny Plaintiff’s requests for transfer, and the reasons why her transfers were denied. As such, these interrogatories sought information concerning percipient witnesses to the events of this litigation. Additionally, a further response is required as to Interrogatories No. 244, which sought the reasons for the denials of Plaintiff’s applications, to which Defendant responded with terse conclusions, often stating the reasons were “unknown.” (Separate Statement at pp. 113–118.) This was insufficient, as responses must be made after “a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (c)), and the response must be as “complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (a).)Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 212–214, 223, 230, 235, 240, and 246, limited to nurse positions, with individual names to be limited to that individual’s initials. The motion is also GRANTED as to No. 243, 244, 249, and 250. The motion is DENIED as to Interrogatories No. 206–211, 220–222, 227–229, 232–234, 237, 251, and 252.II. SANCTIONSStatute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $12,540.00, representing 19.2 hours of attorney work at $650 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (Mohrsaz Decl. ¶21.) No sanctions are awarded, as Plaintiff has only obtained partial relief.
