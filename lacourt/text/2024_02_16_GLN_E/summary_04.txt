And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to produce the subject vehicle for inspection. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's demand for inspection and has not produced the vehicle despite the defendant's efforts to schedule the inspection. The judge finds that the inspection is relevant to the defendant's defense against the plaintiff's claims and that the plaintiff's failure to produce the vehicle waives any objections to the demand. The judge orders the plaintiff to produce the subject vehicle for inspection within 30 days of the date of the order.
