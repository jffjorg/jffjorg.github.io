And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively granted the defendant's motion to compel inspection of the subject vehicle. The defendant has moved for an order compelling inspection of the vehicle within 30 days of the order, on the grounds that the plaintiffs have failed to produce the vehicle for inspection and have failed to meet and confer on this issue in good faith. The court finds that the inspection is relevant for the defendant to defend itself against the plaintiffs' claims in the instant action. The motion is unopposed, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. Therefore, the court orders the plaintiffs to produce the subject vehicle for inspection within 30 days of the date of this order.
