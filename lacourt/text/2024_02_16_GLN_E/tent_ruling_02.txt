ANALYSIS
Legal Standard
– Compel Mental Examination
Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, a party that seeks to require another
party to submit to a mental examination must obtain leave of court. The court
must grant the motion if the moving party shows good cause for the mental
examination.  (Code Civ. Proc., §2032.320, subd. (a).)  A showing of good
cause generally requires “that the party produce specific facts justifying
discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action
or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson
v. Super. Ct. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) The examination
will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).) “An order granting
a physical or mental examination shall specify the person
or persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place,
manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions,
scope and nature of the examination.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.320, subd. (d).) The order must specify and list by name the
diagnostic tests and procedures to be used in the examination. (Carpenter v. Super. Ct. (Yamaha Motor Corp.) (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)
 
Declarations must
state facts showing that “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to arrange the
examination by stipulation was unsuccessful. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310,
subd. (b).)
Discussion
The court grants the motion. 
Here, defendants have stated
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to arrange the examination by
stipulation. (Decl. Boiadjian, ¶¶ 6,9.) 
Defendants have specified
the time, place, scope, as well as the identity and specialty of the person who
will perform the examination, and the manner, conditions, and nature of the
examination. The exam will occur on March 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. at 5363 Balboa
Blvd., Suite 437, Encino, California 91316. (Mot, pg. 2.) The person who will
perform the examination is Ted Evans, a neuropsychologist. (Mot, pg. 2.) The
scope of the examination is to determine, evaluate, and assess the plaintiff’s mental
condition and claims of mental injury in controversy. (Mot, pg. 2.) It will
include claims of continuing and permanent problems. (Mot, pg. 2.) The manner,
conditions, and nature of the examination will include the taking of an oral
and written history and an interview of the plaintiff. (Mot, pg. 2.) The
specific tests will be drawn from the following: Green’s Word Memory Test; Dot
Counting Test; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition;
Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition; Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth
Edition; Grooved Pegboard; TOMM; Finger Tapping Test; Stroop Color-Word Test;
Controlled Oral Word Association Test; Boston Naming Test; Trailmaking Test;
Auditory Consonant Trigrams; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; Rey Complex
Figure Test; California Verbal Learning Test-2; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test;
Trauma Symptom Inventory-2; Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-A; Beck
Depression Inventory-2; and Beck Anxiety Inventory. (Mot, pgs. 2 - 3.) The exam
will take approximately seven hours. (Mot, pg. 3.) 
The court finds good cause.
Defendants assert that at deposition on March 21, 2023, the plaintiff testified
that she experienced headaches, dizziness, and memory issues. (Decl. Boiadjian,
¶ 3.) Defendants further assert that plaintiff claims ongoing symptoms to
various types of injuries including a traumatic brain injury. (Decl. Boiadjian,
¶ 5.) The court finds that plaintiff has placed a possible brain injury in
controversy; thus, there is good cause. 
The court grants the motion.

RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Defendants move this
Court to take an additional physical examination of the plaintiff by Dr. Barry
Ludwig, a neurologist. 
 
Defendants’
motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310,
subdivision (a). 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Haptouhi Markarian, filed a Complaint on 01/12/2024 against defendants,
Pluma, LLC and Jonathan Gerber (erroneously sued as Jonathan Graber).
Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges negligence. Plaintiff alleges that she slipped
and fell at the defendants’ property. On February 7, 2023, the plaintiff filed
an amendment to the complaint to add Ratner Property Management, Inc. as a
defendant. 
ANALYSIS
Legal Standard
– Compel Mental Examination
As
a preliminary matter, because the defendants move this court for a neurologist
to examine the plaintiff, the exam would be a mental, not physical exam. Thus,
the court will adjudicate this motion as such. 
 
Per Code of
Civil Procedure section 2032.310, a party that seeks to require another party
to submit to a mental examination must obtain leave of court. The court must
grant the motion if the moving party shows good cause for the mental
examination. (Code Civ. Proc., §2032.320, subd. (a).)  A showing of good
cause generally requires “that the party produce specific facts justifying
discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action
or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson
v. Super. Ct. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) The examination will
be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).) “An order granting
a physical or mental examination shall specify the person
or persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place,
manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions,
scope and nature of the examination.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.320, subd. (d).) The order must specify and list by name the
diagnostic tests and procedures to be used in the examination. (Carpenter v. Super. Ct. (Yamaha Motor Corp.) (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)
 
Declarations must
state facts showing that “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to arrange the
examination by stipulation was unsuccessful. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310,
subd. (b).)
Discussion
The court grants the motion. 
Here, defendants have stated
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to arrange the examination by
stipulation. (Decl. Boiadjian, ¶¶ 6,9.) 
Defendants have specified
the time, place, scope, as well as the identity and specialty of the person who
will perform the examination, but have not specified the manner, conditions,
and nature of the examination. The manner, conditions, and nature of the
examination may consist of taking of an oral history, X-rays, CT scans, and/or
MRI studies. (Mot, pg. 2.) It will include procedures and tests routinely used
by physicians examining patients for conditions such as those alleged by the
plaintiff. (Mot, pg. 2.) The exam will occur on February 29, 2024, at 10:30
a.m. at 2811 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 508, Santa Monica, California 90403. (Mot,
pg. 2.) The scope of the examination is to determine, evaluate, and assess the
plaintiff’s physical condition and claims of injury in controversy. (Mot, pg.
2.) The person who will perform the examination is Barry Ludwig, a neurologist.
(Mot, pg. 2.)
However, the court finds
good cause. Defendants assert that at deposition on March 21, 2023, the
plaintiff testified that she experienced headaches, dizziness, and memory
issues. (Decl. Boiadjian, ¶ 3.) Defendants further assert that plaintiff claims
ongoing symptoms to various types of injuries including a traumatic brain
injury. (Decl. Boiadjian, ¶ 5.) The court finds that plaintiff has placed a
possible brain injury in controversy; thus, there is good cause. 
The court grants the motion.
