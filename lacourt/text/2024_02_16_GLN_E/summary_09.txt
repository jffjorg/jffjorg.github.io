And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Mark G. McNelis and Mark G. McNelis & Associates, CPA, Inc. The demurrer was filed without a motion to strike and was unopposed. The demurrer challenged the complaint on the grounds that the alleged agreement did not comply with the Statute of Frauds and that the causes of action failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge noted that the plaintiff, John Wood, filed a complaint on October 30, 2023, and that the defendants filed their demurrer on December 11, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a First Amended Complaint on February 5, 2024, which rendered the demurrer moot.

Therefore, the judge denied the demurrer as moot, concluding that the defendants' demurrer without motion to strike was rendered unnecessary by the filing of the First Amended Complaint.
