And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Torosian v. Madatyan, et al. The defendants, Glendale French Bakery and Liana Gyozalyan, filed a demurrer to certain causes of action in the plaintiffs' complaint, alleging that these causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has denied the demurrer as moot, as the plaintiffs have filed an operative first amended complaint that addresses the issues raised in the demurrer. The case will proceed to a hearing on February 16, 2024, but the demurrer with motion to strike is denied.
