And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel a physical and mental examination of the plaintiff, Haptouhi Markarian. The defendants are seeking to have Dr. Ted Evans, a neuropsychologist, examine the plaintiff on March 18, 2024, to determine her mental condition and claims of mental injury. The judge finds that there is good cause for the examination based on the plaintiff's testimony and claims of ongoing symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and memory issues. The examination will include a seven-hour evaluation of the plaintiff's mental and physical condition, including tests and procedures to determine the extent of her injuries.

Separately, the judge has also granted the defendants' motion to compel a physical examination of the plaintiff by Dr. Barry Ludwig, a neurologist, on February 29, 2024. This examination will also be conducted to determine the plaintiff's physical condition and claims of injury. The judge finds that there is good cause for this examination based on the same reasons as above.
