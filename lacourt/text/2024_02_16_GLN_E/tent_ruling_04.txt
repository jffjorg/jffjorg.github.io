BACKGROUND
This action arises from an allegedly defective 2018
Kia Soul (the “Subject Vehicle”). On December 23, 2022, Plaintiff Andrea
Yannone (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for
(1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of the
Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b). 
On January 30, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the
Complaint. 
On October 11, 2023, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion to compel Plaintiff to produce the Subject Vehicle for
inspection within 15 days of the Court’s order. 
Defendant’s motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the
motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
RECOMMENDED RULING
The Court tentatively GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel inspection of the Subject Vehicle and orders Plaintiff to produce the
Subject Vehicle for Inspection within 30 days of the date of this order. 
ANALYSIS
Legal Standard
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery
“may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of
any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . .
. by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land
or other property, and electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010, subd. (a).)  “Within 30 days
after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of the response
to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response on all other
parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the party making
the demand, the court has shortened the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).)
 
Where a party fails to timely respond
to demand for inspection, copying, testing or sampling “[t]he party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(b) provides that “[t]he party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand.” Where a party fails to permit a vehicle
inspection, the party seeking the vehicle inspection may move for an order compelling
compliance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).) 
 

 
Discussion 
Counsel
for Defendant, Jeck Dizon (“Dizon”), provides a declaration in support of the
motion. Dizon declares that on April 17, 2023, Defendant served a Demand for
Vehicle Inspection Notice on Plaintiff for May 24, 2023. (Dizon Decl., ¶ 3;
Exhibit A.) Plaintiff’s counsel objected to the vehicle inspection. (Id.,
¶ 4; Exhibit B.) Dizon sets forth correspondence and telephonic discussions
with Plaintiff’s counsel to schedule the Subject Vehicle inspection. (Id.,
¶¶ 5-14; Exhibits C, D, E, F, and G.)  
The Demand for Vehicle Inspection
requests that Plaintiff produce “a 2018 Kia Soul Vehicle Identification Number:
KNDJN2A22J7903647.” (Dizon Decl., ¶ 3; Exhibit A at 1:22-24.) The Demand for
Vehicle Inspection states that “[t]he subject vehicle, all contents, and/or
component parts will be inspected which may include visual inspection, taking
photographic images, videotaping, measuring, test drive, testing of fluids,
examining any diagnostic trouble codes, and any other method if inspection
necessary to evaluate the past and present condition of the vehicle. This
activity will not permanently alter, modify, or in any way destroy the subject
vehicle, its contents, or its component parts.” (Id., ¶ 3; Exhibit A at
2:3-5.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that the
Subject Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to, transmission,
emission, suspension, structural, electrical, and engine system defects.
(Complaint, ¶ 10.) Based on the declaration of Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff
has failed to produce the Subject Vehicle for inspection. The Court finds that
such an inspection is relevant for Defendant to be able to defend itself
against Plaintiff’s claims in the instant action. Also, the motion is unopposed
which “creates an inference that the motion is meritorious.” (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff to produce the Subject Vehicle for Inspection.
Plaintiff is ordered to produce the Subject Vehicle for Inspection within 30
days of the date of this order.
