Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion filed by Plaintiffs Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 to compel the Glendale Police Department (GPD) to comply with a subpoena issued by Plaintiffs related to the investigation of Defendant Denis Wilson Alcazar for sexually abusing minors. The Court finds that discovery of reports, audio and/or video recordings, and evidence involving Alcazar is relevant to the claims at issue in this action. The Court orders GPD to submit all documents and evidence responsive to the subpoena to the Court for an in camera review, and determines that the documents should be used to determine what should be produced. The Court also finds that the motion is unopposed, and therefore, there is an inference that it has merit.
