RELIEF REQUESTED:

Mark G. McNelis & Associates, CPA, Inc. demurs to Plaintiff’s entire

state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain.
 
BACKGROUND:
 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff John
Wood filed a Complaint against Defendants Mark G. McNelis, Mark G. McNelis
& Associates, CPA, Inc., and DOES 1 to 20, inclusive. The Complaint alleged
causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Common Counts; and (3)
Accounting. 
 
On December 11, 2023, Defendants
Mark G. McNelis and Mark G. McNelis & Associates, CPA, Inc. filed the
instant Demurrer without Motion to Strike. The demurrer is unopposed. 
 
On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the same causes of
action. Provided that Plaintiff filed the operative FAC, Defendants Mark G.
McNelis and Mark G. McNelis & Associates, CPA, Inc.’s Demurrer without
Motion to Strike is rendered moot. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants Mark G.
McNelis and Mark G. McNelis & Associates, CPA, Inc.’s Demurrer without
Motion to Strike is DENIED as MOOT.
