BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision that occurred at
or near the intersection of Lark Ellen Avenue and Merced Avenue in West Covina
on March 8, 2021.
On March
1, 2023, Plaintiffs Romeo B. Adavan, Rita O. Ratilla, Maria Lea Amata
Rodrigueza, and Alejandro Bercian filed a complaint against Defendants Zhicong
Jin, Mingxuan Yang, and Does 1-50, alleging a single cause of action for
negligence.
On
January 30, 2024, Jin and Yang filed the present motions. A hearing on the
present motions is set for April 16 along with a case management conference and
OSC Re: Sanctions. A post-mediation status conference/trial setting conference is
also set for August 12.
ANALYSIS
Jin
and Yang move to compel Adavan and Bercian to provide verified responses to their
discovery requests. They also seek an award of sanctions for the present
motions.
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to requests for production if a
response has not been received. Similarly, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (b), the propounding party may file a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories if a response has not been received. In
both cases, a response must be provided within 30 days of service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a).) The court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes such orders to compel absent substantial justification or other
circumstances that make imposition of sanctions unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).) While the imposition of sanctions is
mandatory, the court “has discretion to reduce the amount of fees and costs requested
as a discovery sanction in order to reach a reasonable award.” (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791 (Cornerstone).)
Discussion
On June
29, 2023, Jin and Yang’s counsel served form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and requests for production on Adavan and Bercian. (Matteis
Decl., ¶ 2.) After no verified responses were provided, Jin and Yang’s counsel
sent a meet and confer letter to Adavan and Bercian’s counsel on August 8. (Matteis
Decl., ¶ 3.) On August 10, Jin and Yang’s counsel granted Adavan and Bercian’s
counsel’s request to extend the deadline to September 1. (Matteis Decl., ¶ 3.) After
Adavan and Bercian failed to respond, the court held an informal discovery
conference on December 6 and ordered Adavan and Bercian to provide verified responses
to Jin and Yang’s discovery requests by December 22. (12/06/2023 Minute Order)
On
January 30, 2024, the court admonished Adavan and Bercian’s counsel during a
case management conference for failing to comply with the court’s discovery
order. (1/30/2024 Minute Order) The court then ordered Adavan and Bercian’s
counsel to provide the required responses without objection by February 9.
(1/30/2024 Minute Order) Adavan and Bercian’s counsel failed to provide the
discovery responses by the court’s second ordered deadline and also failed to
appear for a case management conference on February 27. (2/27/2024 Minute
Order; Matteis Decl., ¶ 8.) Accordingly, the court GRANTS Jin and Yang’s
motions to compel.
Jin and Yang also request $572
in sanctions against Adavan, Bercian, and their counsel for each of the present
motions to compel. Accordingly, utilizing a lodestar approach and in view of the
totality of the circumstances, the court awards sanctions against Adavan,
Bercian, and their counsel and finds reasonable attorney fees and costs in the
total of amount of $119.80 for each motion to compel ($79.80 for 0.5 hours
drafting the present motion and 0.1 hours attending the hearing at an hourly
rate of $133 plus $40 in filing fees), for a total of .
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide verified responses,
without objections, to the above enumerated discovery in ten (10) days.  The attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount
of $718.80 are due and payable to Defendants in thirty (30) days.
Should Plaintiffs fail to comply timely with the
court’s order, Defendants may file the appropriate motion for terminating
sanctions.
