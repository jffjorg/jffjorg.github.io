First Amended Complaint
 
Respondent: Plaintiff Adam Dolce
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant The Internet Auto Group, Inc.’s Demurrer to
First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED IN
PART with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the First, Second, Third, and
Fourth Causes of Action, and OVERRULED IN PART as to the Fifth and Sixth Causes
of Action.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a contractual fraud action. In October 2023,
Defendant The Internet Auto Group, Inc. (IAG) advertised a 2021 Polestar 2
Launch Edition for sale online at a price of $31,930. Plaintiff Adam Dolce saw
the advertisement for the vehicle and visited IAG. At IAG, a representative
told Dolce that the cost of the vehicle would be $35,600 after sales tax,
official fees, and document processing charges. After agreeing to purchase the
vehicle for that price in cash, Dolce alleges IAG then informed Dolce that the
total price was over $41,000 based on two mandatory add-ons, including a
theft-deterrent device priced at $1,995 and paint protection priced at $1,995.
When Dolce objected to the add-ons, IAG offered to reduce the price to $37,000
and Dolce declined their offer.
 
On October 5, 2023, Dolce filed a complaint against
Defendants Plug-In Auto and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action:
(1) specific performance, (2) breach of contract, (3) intentional
misrepresentation, (4) violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA),
(5) declaratory relief, and (6) civil conspiracy.
 
On November 20, 2023, Dolce filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC) against IAG and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
violation of the CLRA, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) concealment, (4)
negligent misrepresentation, (5) breach of contract, and (6) violation of
Unfair Competition Law.
 
On March 1, 2024, IAG filed the present demurrer. On March
20, the court continued the hearing on the demurrer for parties to further meet
and confer.
 
A hearing on the demurrer is set for April
16, 2024, along with a case management conference.
 
ANALYSIS

IAG demurs to Dolce’s entire FAC. For the
following reasons, the court SUSTAINS
IAG’s demurrer to Dolce’s first,
second, third, and ­­fourth causes of action with leave to amend and OVERRULES IAG’s demurrer to Dolce’s fifth and sixth causes of action.
 
Legal Standard


A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Violation of the CLRA (First Cause of
Action)
 
IAG argues Dolce’s first cause of action for violation
of the CLRA fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
The purpose of the CLRA is to protect
consumers from injury caused by false representations made by merchants as part
of a transaction for the sale of consumer goods or services. (Nelson v.
Pearson Ford Co. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 983, 1021, disapproved on other
grounds by Raceway Ford Cases (2016) 2 Cal.5th 161.) Pursuant to the
CLRA, “[a]ny consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or
employment by any person of a method, act, or practice declared to be unlawful
by Section 1770 may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain”
actual damages, injunctive relief, restitution, punitive damages, and “[a]ny
other relief that the court deems proper.” (Civ. Code, § 1780, subd. (a).) The
CLRA defines a consumer as “an individual who seeks or acquires, by purchase or
lease, any goods or services for personal, family, or household purposes.”
(Civ. Code, § 1761, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The FAC alleges IAG violated the CLRA by (1)
advertising a vehicle at a price that IAG did not intend to sell the vehicle
at, (2) failing to disclose that the advertised price was contingent upon the
purchase of separate add-ons, (3) representing that the purchase of the vehicle
came with obligation to pay for the separate add-ons, and (4) including a
provision requiring the purchase of the add-ons in the sales contract. (FAC, ¶
21.)
 
IAG first argues the FAC fails to state a
claim for violation of the CLRA because it does not allege Dolce purchased the
vehicle and paid for the add-ons. (Demurrer, p. 8:11-14, 9:8-11.) But standing to
bring a CLRA action is not limited to those who have only suffered actual
damage. (Meyer v. Sprint Spectrum L.P. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 634, 640.) Instead,
standing is conveyed on consumers who suffer “any damage” as a result of the
alleged violation which includes “harms other than pecuniary damages, such as
certain types of transaction costs and opportunity costs.” (Ibid.) While
the FAC does not allege Dolce suffered a pecuniary loss because of IAG’s
alleged violations, the FAC does allege Dolce relied on IAG’s advertisement in
visiting IAG to purchase the vehicle on October 2, 2023. (FAC, ¶ 7.) Thus,
Dolce’s alleged damages are the time Dolce spent visiting IAG and the lost
opportunity to purchase the vehicle at the advertised price. (FAC, ¶ 7, 12.)
 
IAG next argues the FAC’s allegation that IAG
failed to disclose that the advertised price for the vehicle was contingent
upon the purchase of separate add-ons is contradicted by the allegations in the
original Complaint. (Demurrer, p. 7:13-17, 8:16-19.) “If a party files an
amended complaint and attempts to avoid the defects of the original complaint
by either omitting facts which made the previous complaint defective or by
adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings, the court may take
judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent
allegations.” (Colapinto v. County of Riverside (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d
147, 151.)
 
The original Complaint alleges the
advertisement included a disclaimer that stated the listed price did not
include “registration, taxes, finance charges, dealer document preparation
charges, electronic filing charge, dealer accessories, and any emission
testing charge.” (Complaint, ¶ 7 (emphasis added).) This allegation contradicts
the FAC’s claim that the advertisement failed to disclose that it was not the
final price. (FAC, ¶ 21.) Because the advertisement as alleged in the original
Complaint did not conceal or misrepresent the final price of the vehicle and instead
put Dolce on notice that the price was not final, the FAC fails to allege a
violation of the CLRA. And to the extent Dolce may argue that the disclosure in
the advertisement was insufficient, Dolce’s opposition has failed to make any
such argument or even address the existence of this provision. (See Suppl.
Opp., p. 3:9-4:7.)
 
Accordingly, IAG’s demurrer to this cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Fraud Claims (Second, Third, and Fourth
Causes of Action)
 
IAG contends Dolce’s second cause of action
for intentional misrepresentation, third cause of action for concealment, and
fourth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation fail to plead sufficient
facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The elements of fraud, which give rise to
the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 (Lazar),
quoting 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, § 676, p. 778.) “The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are ‘(1) the misrepresentation of a
past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it
to be true, (3) with intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact
misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5)
resulting damage.’” (National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, PA v.
Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 (National
Union), quoting Apollo Capital Fund LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007)
158 Cal.App.4th 226, 243.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be
alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy
of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar,
supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)
 
Discussion
 
The FAC alleges IAG misrepresented the price
of the vehicle by advertising that it was available for the price of $31,930.
(FAC, ¶ 28, 51.) The FAC also alleges IAG misrepresented or concealed the fact
that purchasing the vehicle included the obligation to pay for add-ons. (FAC, ¶
28, 39, 51.) IAG contends that these allegations are contradicted by the
allegations in Dolce’s original Complaint. (Demurrer, p. 10:17-18, 11:15-19, 12:14-17.)
As noted above, the original Complaint alleged that the advertisement at issue
specifically noted the listing price did not include dealer accessories. (Complaint,
¶ 7.) Thus, it does not appear IAG misrepresented or concealed the vehicle’s
price.
 
Accordingly, IAG’s demurrer to this cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Breach of Contract (Fifth Cause of
Action)
 
IAG maintains Dolce’s fifth cause of action
for breach of contract fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The
court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of
contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms
must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written
agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances,
a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty
Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.) “[T]he vital elements of a cause
of action based on contract are mutual assent (usually accomplished through the
medium of an offer and acceptance) and consideration.” (Division of Labor
Law Enforcement v. Transpacific Transportation Co. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d
268, 275.)
 
Discussion
 
The FAC alleges that after Dolce visited IAG
to purchase a vehicle, IAG represented to Dolce that the vehicle’s cost would
be $35,600 which included sales tax, official fees, and a document processing
charge. (FAC, ¶ 8.) The FAC then alleges that Dolce “agreed to purchase” that
vehicle for that price in cash. (FAC, ¶ 8.) Before Dolce signed a contract to
purchase the vehicle, the FAC alleges that IAG informed Dolce of the cost of
the add-ons and that Dolce refused to purchase the vehicle for the additional
cost of $37,000. (FAC, ¶ 9-11.)
 
IAG maintains the FAC fails to allege the creation
of a contract between IAG and Dolce as the FAC alleges Dolce refused IAG’s
offer of $37,000. (Demurrer, p. 13:23-14:12.) In opposition, Dolce maintains an
oral contract was created when Dolce agreed to purchase the vehicle for $35,600
in cash. (Suppl. Opp., p. 5:7-13.) In cases where parties enter into oral
agreements before executing contract, “whether they intended their oral
agreement to be immediately effective or only to become binding on the
execution of the writing, is ordinarily a question of fact to be resolved by
the trial court or jury in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.” (McKeon
v. Giusto (1955) 44 Cal.2d 152, 158.) Thus, at the pleading stage, the FAC’s
allegation that parties entered into an oral contract when Dolce accepted IAG’s
offer to sell the vehicle for $35,600 is sufficient to plead the existence of a
contract.
 
Accordingly, IAG’s demurrer to this cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
Violation of Unfair Competition Law (Sixth
Cause of Action)
 
IAG argues Dolce’s sixth cause of action for violation
of the Unfair Competition Law fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim.
The court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
To state a cause of action for unfair
business practices, a plaintiff must establish defendant engaged in “unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) This section
establishes three types of unfair competition, prohibiting “practices that are
either ‘unfair,’ or ‘unlawful,’ or ‘fraudulent.’” (Pastoria v. Nationwide
Ins. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1496.) Thus, “An act or practice may be
actionable as “unfair” under the unfair competition law even if it is not
‘unlawful.’” (Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.)
However, despite the broad scope of Business and Professions Code section
17200, its remedies are limited to equitable relief and damages are not
recoverable. (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29
Cal.4th 1134, 1144.) A plaintiff has standing to bring an action for unfair
business practices if they “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or
property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury,
and (2) show that that economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by,
the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the gravamen of the
claim.” (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)
 
Discussion
 
The FAC alleges IAG committed unfair business
acts and practices by (1) advertising a vehicle at a price that IAG did not
intend to sell the vehicle at, (2) failing to disclose that the advertised
price was contingent upon the purchase of separate add-ons, (3) representing
that the purchase of the vehicle came with obligation to pay for the separate
add-ons, (4) including a provision requiring the purchase of the add-ons in the
sales contract, (5) breaching the parties’ contract, (6) failing to sell the
vehicle at the advertised price in violation of Vehicle Code section 11713.1,
subdivision (e), and (7) adding additional charges to the sale contract in
violation of Vehicle Code section 11713.19, subdivision (a)(1). (FAC, ¶ 69.)
 
IAG argues this cause of action fails because
it turns on the viability of Dolce’s other causes of action. (Demurrer, p.
14:17-19.) But this argument ignores the fact that the FAC has also alleged IAG
violated specific provisions of the Vehicle Code. Because IAG’s demurrer does
not address these other grounds, it fails as a demurrer may not “lie to a part
of a cause of action.” (Cornejo v. Lightbourne (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
932, 944.)
 
Accordingly, IAG’s demurrer to this cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, IAG’s demurrer to Dolce’s FAC is SUSTAINED IN PART with
twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the first, second, third, and fourth
causes of action, and OVERRULED IN PART as to the fifth and sixth causes
of action.
