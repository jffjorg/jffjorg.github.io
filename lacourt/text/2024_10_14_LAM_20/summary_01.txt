And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Drew H. Sherman, counsel for plaintiff Jeffrey Marduce, to be relieved as counsel. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but such a motion should be granted only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. In this case, the court finds that Counsel's withdrawal at this time would prejudice his client, as the lawsuit has been ongoing for three years and a jury trial is set in approximately three months. The dispositive factor is the pending motion for sanctions against Counsel's client, which the court will not permit Counsel to withdraw from while his client is exposed to monetary or dispositive sanctions shortly before his trial begins.
