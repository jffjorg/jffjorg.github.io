Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on April 4, 2024, and he filed his operative second amended complaint (“SAC”) on August 13, 2024. The SAC recasts Plaintiff’s seven causes of action as “Cause 1”, for violation of Civil Code section 1708, and “Cause 2”, for “violat[ing] CCC [sic] 1708 by attempting to murder me, thereby intentionally inflicting emotional distress upon me.” (SAC, 3:5-6.)            Defendant demurred to and moved to strike portions of Plaintiff’s SAC on September 13, 2024. Plaintiff filed oppositions on September 18 and September 30, 2024. Defendant replied on October 3, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD            Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10; Young v. Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 209, 220.) When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court treats all facts alleged – but only the facts alleged – in the complaint as true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  MEETING AND CONFERENCE“Before filing a demurrer ... , the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) Defendant’s counsel submitted a declaration that satisfies section 430.41. (Moulin Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) DISCUSSION            Defendant demurs on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred, because they are for medical malpractice no matter how he captions them; (2) Civil Code section 1708 does not create a private right of action; and (3) Plaintiff’s complaint is uncertain.            The Court takes up these arguments in reverse order.1.  UncertaintyThe complaint is not uncertain. Uncertainty is a disfavored ground for demurrer. (Chen v. Benjamin (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.) In order to satisfy fact pleading standards, a plaintiff need only set forth the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action. (See Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719.)Plaintiff’s SAC contains improper legal argument, superfluous rhetorical questions, and unnecessary evidentiary material. But the details of his claim can be ascertained sufficiently for Defendant to prepare a defense. This ground for demurrer fails.2. Private Right of Action (Civil Code Section 1708)            Civil Code section 1708 states: “Every person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person or property of another, or infringing upon any of his or her rights.” Section 1708 “ ‘states a general principle of law, but it hardly provides support for … a direct cause of action for damages outside the parameters of recognized tort law . . . .’ [Citation.] ” (Katzberg v. Regents of University of California (2002) 29 Cal.4th 300, 327-328.) The section simply restates a common-law duty of care.            Plaintiff’s causes of action both rely on Civil Code section 1708. There is no cause of action based solely on section 1708. The demurrer may be sustained on this independent sufficient ground./ / /            3. Statute of Limitations            Plaintiff’s claims are also time-barred. This is grounds not only to sustain Defendant’s demurrer, but to sustain it without leave to amend.                        Plaintiff’s causes of action rely on a professional negligence theory (here, medical malpractice). “[W]hen a plaintiff asserts a claim against a health care provider on a legal theory other than professional negligence, courts must determine whether the claim is nonetheless based on the health care provider’s professional negligence[.]” Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336, 347, citing Smith v. Ben Bennett, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1507, 1515, emphasis in original.) Plaintiffs commonly plead intentional torts in addition to medical malpractice to evade limitations the legislature has placed on malpractice claims. (Unruh-Haxton v. Regents of University of California (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 343, 354, quoting Perry v. Shaw (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 658, 666.) Whether or not he intended to do so, Plaintiff has done so here. He bases his claims entirely on services Defendant allegedly provided as a doctor. Regardless of how Plaintiff captions his causes of action, all rely on a theory of professional negligence.            Because Plaintiff’s complaint is for professional negligence, his causes of action are time-barred. The statute of limitations for a medical malpractice action is three years or one year “after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury . . . .” (CCP § 340.5.) On the face of the SAC, more than one year elapsed between when Plaintiff discovered his injury and when he filed his lawsuit.            Plaintiff alleges his “journey began … in February of 2022” when he sought medical treatment for a leg condition. (SAC, Att. 1 [“Complaint (Story of events)], 3:1.) Plaintiff met Defendant on May 3, 2022. (Id., Att. 1, 5:7.) Defendant performed surgery on Plaintiff on July 18, 2022. (Id., Att. 1, 5:10.) Plaintiff remained under Defendant’s care for the ensuing five months. (See id., Att. 1, 5:16.) He alleges he experienced increasingly severe complications in his leg; he “fought the pain for as long as [he] could, and by November 2nd [he] was in the Emergency Room.” (Id., Att. 1, 15:6.) Plaintiff communicated with Defendant’s office through November but was unable to schedule a surgery before December 5, 2022. (Id., Att. 1, 24:20-21.) Eventually, a different doctor performed an “emergency surgery” on November 26, 2022 to correct or mitigate Plaintiff’s condition. (Id., Att. 1, 25:7-8.)            As of November 26, 2022, if not before, Plaintiff was aware he was injured. As alleged in the SAC, he also attributed his alleged injury to Defendant’s negligence as of at least October 27, 2022. (See id., Att. 1, 13:1 [text from Plaintiff to Defendant: “I don’t think you can fathom the misery you have caused me.”].) The statute of limitations began to run no later than November 26, 2022, which means it expired on November 26, 2023, at the latest. Plaintiff filed his action three months later. His suit is time-barred.            The Court sustains the demurrer. The complaint reveals on its face that it cannot be cured by amendment. Plaintiff has already amended his pleading twice, and he does not demonstrate in his opposition that he can cure the defect. (See Opp., 3:16-17 [requesting opportunity to amend to “more clearly communicate [the] causes of action”].)            Leave to amend is denied.            CONCLUSIONDefendant’s demurrer is sustained in its entirety, without leave to amend.Defendant’s motion to strike is moot.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
