  Case Number:  21STLC06411    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  20 Tentative RulingJudge Kevin C. BrazileDepartment 20Hearing Date:                         Monday, October 14, 2024Case Name:                             Krouch et al. v. PR2020, LLCCase No.:                                21STLC06411Motion:                                  Motion to be Relieved as CounselMoving Party:                         Drew H. Sherman, Counsel for Plaintiff Jeff MarduceResponding Party:                  Plaintiff Jeff MarduceNotice:                                    OK  Ruling:                                   Counsel’s motion to be relieved is denied. If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  BACKGROUND            Plaintiff Jeffrey Marduce (“Plaintiff”) and six (6) other individuals sued defendant PR2020, LLC (“Defendant”) on September 1, 2021 and filed their operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) on November 17, 2021. Their FAC asserts claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.            Plaintiff Marduce’s counsel Drew H. Sherman (“Counsel”) now moves to be relieved.            The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d 398.)            Counsel’s motion is denied, because his withdrawal at this time will prejudice his client.            This litigation has carried on for three years, and a jury trial is set in approximately three months. The Court is already reluctant to permit Counsel to withdraw on that basis.The dispositive factor, however, is the pending motion for sanctions against Counsel’s client. After Counsel filed his motion, Defendant filed a motion for issue, evidentiary and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. The Court will not relieve Counsel while his client is exposed to monetary or dispositive sanctions shortly before his trial begins.            The motion is denied.
