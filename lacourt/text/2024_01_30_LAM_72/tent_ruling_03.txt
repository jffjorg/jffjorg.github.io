 Hearing Date:  January 30, 2024
 Calendar Number:  7



 
 
 
Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Jay Novak (“Jay”) demurs to
the Cross-Complaint filed by Frank Novak (“Frank”) (the Court means no offense
by its use of the parties’ first names and does so only to avoid confusion).
 
The Court OVERRULES Jay’s demurrer.
 
Background
 
Jay and Frank are brothers and business partners. Each of
them owns 50 percent of the outstanding shares in Modernica, Inc.
(“Modernica”).
 
Jay filed this action against Defendants Frank and
Modernica, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) on September 20, 2022, raising
claims for (1) involuntary dissolution of Modernica pursuant to Corporations
Code sections 1800 and 1804; (2) appointment of receiver pursuant to
Corporations Code section 1803; (3) breach of contract; and (4) breach of
fiduciary duty.
 
On May 31, 2023, Frank filed a Cross-Complaint against Jay
and Modernica (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”) for breach of fiduciary duty.
 
Jay demurred to the cross-complaint on November 22, 2023.
Frank filed an opposition. Jay did not file a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Demurrer
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
Discussion
 
Jay demurs only to the Cross-Complaint’s allegations of
punitive damages, and not to any other part of the Cross-Complaint. Jay does
not demur to the Cross-Complaint’s cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty.
 
“Since a demurrer does not lie to a part of a cause of
action, petitioners' punitive damage allegations were not subject to real
parties' demurrers. There is no cause of action for punitive damages. Punitive
or exemplary damages are remedies available to a party who can plead and prove
the facts and circumstances set forth in Civil Code section 32944[.] Punitive
damages are merely incident to a cause of action, and can never constitute the
basis thereof.” (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159,
163–164 [internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted].)
 
Thus, a demurrer is not the proper procedural vehicle by
which to challenge Jay’s demand for punitive damages. “The adequacy of the
punitive damage allegations could, however, have been tested by motion to
strike.” (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 164.)
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer.
