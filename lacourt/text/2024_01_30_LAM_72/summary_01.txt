```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Honda to comply with the October 11, 2022 discovery order. Honda is required to produce the following documents:

* Conduct searches of its Tech Line/Field Report systems and warranty database based on Defect Code 03214 and produce the resulting documents from those databases.
* Produce the 13,069 emails it originally retrieved, with redactions solely for privilege and work product, and a privilege log.
* Produce the entirety of the Subject Vehicle's repair history, including an unredacted call log, and confirm in writing that it has done so.

The court denies Plaintiff's request that Honda search its dealer contacts and warranty databases based on the Entire Defect Definition, as it is too complex and convoluted.

The court orders Honda to search using a single defect code and produce the results. Honda is also required to produce all documents relating to the Subject Vehicle.

The court declines to appoint a discovery referee at this time, and instead orders Honda to comply with the discovery order.
