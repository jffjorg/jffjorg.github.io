Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Evan Everhart's motion to be appointed as the successor in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Linda Everhart. The court finds that all statutory requirements have been met, and that Everhart has provided the necessary documentation and declarations. The defendant argued that the substitution would prejudice them because they did not have the opportunity to depose Plaintiff before she passed away, but the court finds that this is not a valid basis for denying the motion. The court notes that the prejudice to the defendant would be mutual, as Plaintiff would also be unable to appear as a witness. Therefore, the court grants the motion and allows Everhart to continue the litigation as Linda Everhart's successor in interest.
