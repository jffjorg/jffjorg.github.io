And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Jay Novak's motion to strike portions of Frank Novak's cross-complaint. The motion was filed in response to Frank's allegation of punitive damages, which Jay claims are improper. The judge has ruled that the allegations of retaliation and malice in the cross-complaint are sufficient to survive a motion to strike and that Frank has stated a basis for punitive damages. The judge has also noted that a demurrer is not an appropriate way to attack the punitive damage claim, and that the motion to strike should have been filed earlier.
