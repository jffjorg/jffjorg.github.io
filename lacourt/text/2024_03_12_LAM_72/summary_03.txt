Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a dispute between Plaintiff Tatiana Solomon and Defendants 404 N Maple Dr LLC, Standard Management Company, and Samuel Freshman. The case centers around the condition of a property at 404 N Maple Drive, Unit 302, which Plaintiff alleges was damaged during her nine-year tenure. Plaintiff claims that the property suffered from mold growth, asbestos exposure, and inadequate flooring and soundproofing, which went unremedied by management. Defendant Samuel Freshman, who was involved in the management of the property, moves for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The Court denies these motions, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding Freshman's control over the property and his potential liability to Plaintiff. The Court also orders Defendants to provide Plaintiff with the text of outstanding discovery requests and orders Plaintiff to provide supplemental responses within 30 days of receipt.
