And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tammy Lynn Gardner's request for default judgment against defendants Laura Rabelo and Marcos Guereca. The request was denied due to several deficiencies, including the lack of a copy of the Statement of Damages served upon the defendants, an incomplete interest calculation, and the failure to provide proof of Guereca's ownership of the involved vehicle. The judge also dismissed the action without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging motor vehicle negligence and negligent entrustment, and had entered default. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 585, which permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear, and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, which outlines the requirements for a request for default judgment.
