Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by Defendant California Highway Patrol (CHP) to Plaintiff Sharon Smith's First Amended Complaint. The Complaint alleges four causes of action, including motor vehicle negligence, vicarious liability, and negligence pursuant to Cal. Gov. Code § 820(a). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim is barred by Gov. Code § 945.4 due to untimely filing of a claim with the Government Claims Program.

The Judge is staying the instant action pending the hearing of Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration in Case No. 21STCP03992, which will determine whether Plaintiff's claim is barred.
