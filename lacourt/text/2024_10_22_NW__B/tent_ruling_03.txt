 Case Number:  21STCV19438    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  B SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIACOUNTY OF LOS ANGELESDEPARTMENT BTENTATIVE RULINGRUBI GARCIA, vs. MAY SHEUNG LUU, et al. Case No.: 21STCV19438 Hearing Date: OCTOBER 22, 2024Defendants Dieu K. Luu and May Sheung Luu’s motion to compel the independent medical examination of Plaintiff Rubi Garcia is granted. Defendants’ request for sanctions is also granted in the reduced amount of $2,380.33.Defendants Dieu K. Luu (“Dieu”) and May Sheung Luu (“May Sheung”)(collectively “Defendants”) move to compel the independent medical examination (“IME”) of Plaintiff Rubi Garcia (“Plaintiff”), contending that there is good cause for the motion because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. (Memorandum of Points and Authorities, p. 1:5-14.)“Unless otherwise limited by order of the court …, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action …, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)Where any party seeks to obtain discovery by a physical examination, the party shall obtain leave of the court. (CCP § 2032.310(a).) The Court shall grant the motion only for good cause shown. (CCP§ 2032.320(a).)Meet and ConferPlaintiff originally had an IME scheduled for May 7, 2024, which they failed to attend. (Rodriguez Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 8.) Defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding Plaintiff’s non-appearance later that day. (Ibid.; Exh. F[meet and confer letter].) On August 7, 2024, Defense counsel further meet and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel via telephone. (Ibid. at ¶ 10; Exh. G.) As a courtesy, Defense counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel with three prospective dates for a rescheduled IME. (Ibid.; Exh. H [email].) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Ibid. at ¶ 11.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants satisfy the meet and confer declaration requirement.Separate Statement RequirementsA motion for “medical examination over objection” must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a).)“A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (CRC Rule 3.1345(c).)Defendants filed a separate statement compliant with CRC Rule 3.1345 on September 4, 2024. Accordingly, Defendants meet the separate statement requirement.Good CauseDefendants contend that there is good cause to compel Plaintiff’s IME because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. In their response to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Plaintiff claims injuries to their arms, chest, breast, and legs, swelling, neck pain, headaches, and a right knee medical meniscus bucket handle tear. (Exh. A [Plaintiff’s Response to Form Interrogatories, Set One] No. 6.2.) Plaintiff also received orthopedic treatment in connection to her alleged injuries. (Ibid. at No. 6.4.)Plaintiff did not object to Defendants’ noticed IME or oppose this motion. Without an IME, defendants cannot fully evaluate Plaintiff’s injuries and prepare a defense for trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have shown good cause to compel Plaintiff's IME.Required Specifications of the Proposed IMEA motion for an examination must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination. (CCP § 2032.310(b).)Defendants provide a scheduled IME for December 10, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., to be conducted by Jonathan T. Nassos, M.D., at 5651 Sepulveda Blvd., Suite #201, Sherman Oaks, CA 91411. (Separate Statement p. 2.) Defendants identify Dr. Nassos as an orthopedic specialist. (Ibid.) Defendants state that the IME “will be conducted for the purposes of determining, evaluating, and assessing plaintiff’s physical condition and claims of injury in controversy in this action.” (Ibid. at 18-19.) The examination “will be consistent with the practices of orthopedic surgery in Southern California and consultations in connection with such practices.” (Ibid. at 25-26.) Defendants state that this exam may include orthopedic procedures and/or manipulations of the body. (Ibid.) Finally, the exam may include the taking of x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs as the performing physician deems necessary. (Ibid.)Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants provide the required specifications of the proposed IME.SanctionsDefendants move to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $2,500.46, payable within 20 days from this hearing.Here, sanctions are appropriate since Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the May 7, 2024, IME and failure to reschedule a subsequent examination constitutes an abuse of the discovery process under CCP § 2023.010.The requested $2,500.46 consists of the following: 2.75 hours of work at a rate of $160.17 per hour, including .75 hours in anticipation for preparing a reply, and 1 hour for attending the hearing; a $60.00 filing fee; and a $2,000 non-appearance fee which Defense counsel incurred for Plaintiff’s initial IME. (Rodriguez Decl. ¶ 15.) Prior to Plaintiff’s initial May 7, 2024, Defense counsel put Plaintiff on notice of the $2,000 non-appearance fee. Accordingly, the Court finds this fee reasonable. However, seeing as Plaintiff did not oppose this motion, the Court reduces the proposed 2.75 hours of work to two. Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $2,380.33.ConclusionFor the reasons set forth above, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $2,380.33, to be paid within 20 days of this hearing.Dated: October 21, 2024Hon.
