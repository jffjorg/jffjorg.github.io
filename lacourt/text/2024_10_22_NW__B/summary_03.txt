And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Karen Moskowitz, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the independent medical examination (IME) of Plaintiff Rubi Garcia. The motion was filed by Defendants Dieu K. Luu and May Sheung Luu, who argue that there is good cause for the IME because Plaintiff placed physical injuries in controversy. The Judge agrees and grants the motion.

The Judge also awards sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $2,380.33. The sanctions are for the costs incurred by Defense counsel in preparing for and attending the hearing, including 2 hours of work at $160.17 per hour and a $60.00 filing fee.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to appear at the initial IME and failure to reschedule a subsequent examination constitutes an abuse of the discovery process. The Judge notes that Defendants provided the required specifications of the proposed IME, including the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination.

The Judge concludes that the motion to compel the IME is granted, and sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel. The hearing is scheduled for October 22, 2024.
