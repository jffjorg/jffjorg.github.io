(Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5)declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)ANALYSISSims seeks damages in the amount of $38,521.41, representing $37,675.00 in general and special damages and $846.41 in costs.Defendant has failed to timely respond or appear. Sims’s default packet meets all statutory requirements under CCP § 585. Therefore, Sims’s request for default judgment against Ovita Alexis Hines is GRANTED.Sanaee seeks damages in the amount of $12,275.00 in general and special damages.Sanaee’s request for default judgment is denied because they served their Statement of Damages on Defendant after default was entered. Statement of Damages must be served at least 30 days prior to entry of default. (CCP § 425.11(c)-(d).) Additionally, Sanaee failed to file proof of service for their Statement of Damages.Sanaee’s request for default judgment has now been denied for deficiencies twice. Accordingly, the Court sets an OSC re Dismissal and/or sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel. Further deficient filings risk dismissal without prejudice pursuant to CCP § 583.410 and CRC 3.110(h).Therefore, Sanaee’s request for default judgment against Ovita Alexis Hines is DENIED.Moving parties are ordered to give notice.
