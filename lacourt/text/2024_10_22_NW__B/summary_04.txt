And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the request for default judgment filed by plaintiff Jonathan Sims against defendant Ovita Alexis Hines, awarding Sims damages in the amount of $38,521.41. The ruling denies the request for default judgment filed by plaintiff Natalie Sanaee against the same defendant, citing deficiencies in Sanaee's filing, including serving the Statement of Damages after default was entered and failing to file proof of service. The court also sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re Sanctions against Sanaee's counsel, requiring the counselor to correct identified deficiencies and comply with court rules, and warns that further deficient filings may result in dismissal without prejudice.
