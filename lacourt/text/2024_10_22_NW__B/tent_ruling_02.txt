B DATE: OCTOBER 22, 2024 TIME: 8:30 A.M. COMPLAINT FILED: OCTOBER 16, 2020 TRIAL DATE: NONEI. BACKGROUNDOn October 16, 2020, Plaintiff Sharon Smith (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants California Highway Patrol (“Defendant”), Pearl Rodney (“Rodney”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on April 18, 2020, Rodney, acting within the scope of his employment with Defendant, ran a red light and collided with the vehicle in which Plaintiff was a passenger. (First Amended Complaint [“FAC”] ¶¶ 11-15.) Plaintiff alleges serious injuries as a result.On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed their FAC alleging four causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) vicarious liability; (3) motor vehicle negligence; and (4) negligence pursuant to Cal. Gov. Code § 820(a).On August 2, 2023, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC.On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed their opposition. Defendant filed their reply that same day.On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.II. DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FACDefendant CHP moves for an order sustaining its demurrer to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC without leave to amend, and to dismiss the FAC with prejudice because each cause of action fails to allege sufficient facts. (Notice of Demurrer, p. 2:4-9.)III. LEGAL STANDARDSA demurrer is a pleading that may be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the complaint. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10.) There are two types of demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers. (See McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)General demurrers can be used to attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (CCP § 430.10(e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.) Such demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered. (CCP §§ 430.30 and 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does notconsider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation].” (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at 318.) It gives these facts “a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Ibid.). At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) "If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence." (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.) Special demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract is oral or written. (CCP § 430.10(f).)Moreover, CCP § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP §¿430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (CCP § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).)When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there isabsolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue. (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 [“Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. (Citation.) Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given."].)IV. DISCUSSIONRequests for Judicial NoticeCHP’s July 12, 2023, request for judicial notice of the Notice of Ruling Re: Sharon Smith’s Petition for Relief from Gov. Code § 945.4 heard on February 28, 2023, in Department 16 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse, is granted pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452-454.Plaintiff’s August 8, 2023, requests for judicial notice of Executive Orders N-35-20, N-71-20, and N-08-21, issued by Governor Gavin Newsom, are granted pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452-454Meet and Confer RequirementDefense counsel declares that, on May 24, 2023, they emailed a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel regarding this matter. (Brown Decl. ¶ 2.) Counsels discussed these issues via telephone but were unable to reach an agreement. (Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court finds Defendant satisfies the meet and confer requirement under CCP § 430.41(a).Defendant’s ArgumentDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s FAC fails to allege facts stating a legal claim because Plaintiff admits to their untimely filing of a claim against a government entity pursuant to Cal. Gov. Code § 911.2. (FAC ¶ 5.) Under Gov. Code § 945.4, no personal injury suit for money or damages may be brought against a government entity until a written claim is presented to and acted upon by the Government Claims Program (“GCP”). (Gov. Code § 945.4.) The claim mustbe presented no later than six months after accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code § 911.2(a).) However, a claimant may apply to the GCP for late claim relief. (Gov. Code § 911.4.) If claimant’s application is denied, then they may petition the court for an order for relief from the presentation requirement of § 945.4. Here, Plaintiff admits to presenting an untimely claim pursuant to § 911.2. (See FAC ¶ 5.) Accordingly, Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s FAC on the grounds that her claim is barred by § 911.2.Plaintiff’s Petition for Relief from § 945.4On February 4, 2022, Plaintiff filed a petition for relief from the presentation requirement of Gov. Code § 945.4. Notably, this petition is under a different case number with the Court, Case No. 21STCP03992. (Notice of Demurrer Exh. A [notice of ruling on Plaintiff’s petition].) On February 28, 2023, the Honorable Lia Martin in Department 16 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse denied Plaintiff’s petition. (Ibid.) The notice of ruling states that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate denial of a claim under § 945.4. (Ibid. at p. 3.) Instead, Plaintiff simply stated that the GCP did not respond to her claim. (Ibid.)On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration on their petition. The motion is set to be heard on July 17, 2025, in Department 3 of Stanley Mosk.Plaintiff argues that the Court should refrain from ruling on the instant demurrer since it rests entirely on the timeliness of her claim pursuant to Gov. Code § 945.4, which will turn on Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration in 21STCP03992. In reply, Defendant “contends that plaintiff’s late claim petition should be resolved prior to proceeding with this action.” (Reply p. 2:1-2.)The Court agrees. Ruling on the instant demurrer prior to resolution of Plaintiff’s late claim petition risks conflicting outcomes. Accordingly, the Court declines to rule on Defendant’sdemurrer at this time and stays the instant action, pending the hearing of Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration in 21STCP03992.V. CONCLUSIONThe instant action is stayed until Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration in Case No. 21STCP03992 is ruled upon. The OSC re Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration and the hearing on this demurrer are continued to [date].Defendant to give notice.Dated: October 21, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
