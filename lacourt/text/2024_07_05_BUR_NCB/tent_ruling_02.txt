  [TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to compel further responses
 



            
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Alpha Medical Resources, Inc. (“Alpha”) alleges that it was
formed on May 19, 1992 by Frank A. Uchalik, Sr. (“Uchalik Sr.”), who is the
father of Defendant Frank Uchalik (“Uchalik Jr.”), along with some other
owners.  Uchalik Jr. became an employee
of Spellman Desk Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alpha.  On February 21, 2008, Defendant Frenemy, LLC
(“Frenemy”) was formed by Uchalik Jr.  On
December 14, 2009, Uchalik Jr. signed a Confidentiality Agreement to maintain
Alpha’s trade secrets concerning Alpha, Alpha II Furniture Resources, Inc.,
and/or Spellman.  When hired, Defendant
Gerardo Hernandez (“Hernandez”) and Arnaldo Villalobos (“Villalobos”) also
signed the same agreement. 
In July 2019, Uchalik Jr. succeeded Uchalik Sr. as president of Alpha
and served on the board of directors. 
During this time, Villalobos (a sales representative of Alpha) formed
Defendant MPG, LLC (“MPG”) to provide Alpha consulting services.  From July 2019 until Uchalik Jr.’s resignation
in April 2022, he approved payments of over $100,000 to MPG, which Alpha
alleges were at the discretion of Uchalik Jr. but were not in the best interest
of Alpha.  Alpha alleges that until his
resignation, Uchalik Jr. issued bonuses to himself, to Frenemy, and to other
individuals he favored, such that the shareholders determined he had mismanaged
the company’s finances.  
Alpha alleges that on July 5, 2022, Uchalik Jr. formed Defendant
Heritage Props, Inc. (“Heritage”) in order to compete with Alpha.   Thereafter, Hernandez and Villalobos
resigned from Alpha and started working for Heritage.  Alpha alleges that Uchalik Jr., Villalobos,
and Hernandez took some of Alpha’s other employees, have been contacting
Alpha’s clients, and have been diverting business away from Alpha to Heritage. 
The complaint, filed on September 27, 2022, alleges causes of action
for: (1) fraud and deceit; (2) misappropriation of funds; (3) conversion; (4) breach
of contract; (5) misappropriation of trade secrets; (6) unfair competition and
unfair business practices; (7) intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage; (8) unjust enrichment; and (9) conspiracy to commit unfair
trade practices.   
B.    
Cross-Complaints
On January 24, 2024, Frank Uchalik, Jr. filed a first amended cross-complaint
against Alpha and Frank Uchalik, Sr. for: (1) wrongful constructive termination
in violation of public policy; (2) associational race discrimination in
violation of Government Code, § 12940 et seq.; (3) false imprisonment;
(4) assault; (5) battery; and (6) breach of fiduciary duty.   
On January 9, 2023, Frank A. Uchalik Sr. filed a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendant Frank Uchalik (Jr.) for: (1) assault; and (2) battery. 
On April 10, 2024, Spellman Desk Company filed a cross-complaint
against Frank Uchalik Jr., Heritage, Villalobos, and Hernandez for: (1) fraud
and deceit; (2) misappropriation of funds; (3) conversion; (4) breach of
contract; (5) misappropriation of trade secrets; (6) unfair competition and
unfair business practices; (7) intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage; (8) unjust enrichment; and (9) conspiracy to commit unfair
trade practices.  
C.    
Motions on Calendar 
On June 11, 2024, Alpha filed a motion to
compel Heritage’s further responses to Requests for Production, set one
(“RPD”).  
On June 21, 2024, Heritage filed an opposition brief. 
On June 27, 2024, Alpha filed reply papers.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            With the opposition
brief, Heritage submitted evidentiary objections to the declarations of Stacy
Fierman-Cribbs and Frank A. Uchalik Sr.  With
the reply brief, Alpha submitted a response to the evidentiary objections.  The Court rules on Heritage’s evidentiary
objections as follows for the purposes of this motion:
·        
Ms. Fierman-Cribbs: The objections to
paragraphs 10-13 are overruled. 
·        
Uchalik Sr.: The objections to paragraphs 2-5
and 7-12 are overruled.  
DISCUSSION
            Alpha moves to compel Heritage’s
further responses to RPD Nos. 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 23-24, and
29.   
            As an initial matter,
Heritage argues that the motion was not timely filed based on the Court’s
specially set July 5, 2024 date for the hearing on this motion.  Heritage argues that based on the July 5,
2024 hearing date, Alpha should have served this motion by June 7, 2024, but
Alpha filed and served the motion on June 11, 2024.  In reply, Alpha argues that it was operating
under the general practice between the parties regarding electronic service “without
taking into account the extra time for service.”  (Reply at p.3.)  Alpha requests that if there is an issue with
timing that the Court continue the hearing to account for service or deny the
motion without prejudice so it can refile the motion.  Sixteen court days before the July 5, 2024
hearing falls on June 11, 2024, such that the motion was timely filed.  To be properly served pursuant to the code,
electronic service should have been effectuated by June 7, 2024.  However, to avoid further delay in the discovery
process and as the trial is approaching on November 25, 2024, the Court will
consider the merits of the motion, but will consider Heritage’s arguments on
timeliness when considering the issue of sanctions. 
            RPD
Nos. 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16, 18-19, and 21 seek: 
·        
RPD
No. 6 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Alpha’s
actual or prospective customers from 2019 to 2022.  RPD
No. 7 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Alpha’s
supplier and/or former suppliers from 2019 to 2022.  
·        
RPD
No. 9 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Villalobos
relating to Alpha’s actual or prospective customers from 2019 to 2022.  RPD
No. 10 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Villalobos
relating to Alpha’s supplier and/or former suppliers from 2019 to 2022.  
·        
RPD
No. 12 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Hernandez
relating to Alpha’s actual or prospective customers from 2019 to 2022.  RPD
No. 13 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Hernandez
relating to Alpha’s supplier and/or former suppliers from 2019 to 2022.  
·        
RPD
No. 15 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Espinoza
relating to Alpha’s actual or prospective customers from 2019 to 2022.  RPD
No. 16 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Espinoza
relating to Alpha’s supplier and/or former suppliers from 2019 to 2022.  
·        
RPD
No. 18 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Cates
relating to Alpha’s actual or prospective customers from 2019 to 2022.  RPD
No. 19 (modified) seeks all
communications from April 11, 2022 to the present between Heritage and Cates
relating to Alpha’s supplier and/or former suppliers from 2019 to 2022.  
·        
RPD
No. 21 (modified) seeks all
documents relating to any communications by and/or between Heritage and actual
or prospective customers from July 2, 2019 to the present. 
Heritage objected to these RPDs on the ground
that they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, harassing, and vague; sought
documents that were irrelevant or not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence; and called for the production of
confidential, proprietary, and sensitive business information.  Alpha argues these documents are necessary to
determine the actual amount of loss attributable to Heritage’s alleged use of
information obtained from Alpha to solicit customers that were
actual/prospective customers of Alpha.  Heritage
argues that the RPDs are overbroad since Heritage did not open its doors until
July 2022.  
The documents sought in RPD Nos. 6-7, 9-10,
12-13, 15-16, 18-19, and 21 are limited to communications from April 11, 2022
to the present, which is only 3 months before Heritage officially opened its
doors, regarding Alpha’s 2019 to 2022 customers and suppliers.  The RPDs are limited in time such that they
are based on Alpha’s customer/supplier lists from 2019 to 2022 and only pertain
to communications beginning in April 2022 to the present.  To the extent that the documents sought are
privileged (confidential, proprietary, and sensitive business information), Heritage
should produce a privilege log.  (CCP §
2031.240(c)(1) [“If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information
sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.”].)  As such, the motion is granted as to RPD Nos. 6-7, 9-10,
12-13, 15-16, 18-19, and 21. 
RPD Nos. 23, 24,
and 29 seek: 
·        
RPD
No. 23 (modified) seeks all
documents relating to any rental or other business invoices or agreements which
Heritage has entered into with any customer from July 2, 2019 to the
present.  RPD
No. 24 (modified) seeks all
documents relating to any rental or other business invoices or agreements which
Heritage has entered into with any supplier from July 2, 2019 to the present. 
·        
RPD
No. 29 seeks all documents
relating to the profit and loss statements, balance sheet, or any other
financial documents or quarterly or annual reconciliation of the business
operation of Heritage.
Heritage objected to these RPDs on the same
grounds as above, including the attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product doctrine, and/or common interest doctrine.  Alpha incorporates the arguments it made
regarding the prior RPDs for why further production of documents should be
ordered.  
The Court will order Heritage to provide
further responses to RPD Nos. 23 and 24 for the same reasons discussed
above.  With respect to RPD No. 29, the
financial documents sought are related to a corporate entity and are limited in
time.  As pointed out by Heritage,
Heritage opened its doors in July 2022, such that the financial documents will
be limited from this period to the present. 
To the extent that any documents are privileged, Heritage is ordered to produce
a privilege log.  The motion is granted as
to RPD Nos. 23, 24, and 29.  
Alpha seeks sanctions in the amount of
$4,326.02 against Heritage.  Heritage did
not seek sanctions in the opposition brief.  In light of the discussion above regarding the
timing of the service of the moving papers, the Court will not award sanctions
on this motion.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Alpha Medical Resources, Inc.’s motion to
compel Defendant/Cross-Defendant Heritage Props, Inc.’s further responses to
RPD Nos. 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16,
18-19, 21, 23-24, and 29 is granted. 
Heritage is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of
notice of this order. 
No sanctions will be awarded on this motion. 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
