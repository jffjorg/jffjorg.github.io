  Hearing Date:  July 5, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Demurrer



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiff DBIK Construction &
Design, Inc. (“DBIK”) alleges that it entered into a construction agreement
with Defendant Four Joy Investment LLC on April 30, 2019, in which DBIK agreed
to provide certain improvements to real property located at 1200 E Huntington
Dr., Duarte, CA 91010 including the renovation of the exterior and roof of a
67-unit hotel building, the exterior renovation of a separate 8-unit commercial
building, and landscaping of the entire property.  In exchange, Defendants agreed to pay
Plaintiff a total of $945,000.  In the
next 4 months, structural safety concerns were discovered with respect to the
commercial building, which necessitated the addition of a central column in the
building and other design changes. 
During the construction, supervision costs escalated due to increased
scope of work, COVID-19 pandemic challenges, involvement of third-party
contractors hired by Four Joy Investment LLC, etc.  DBIK alleges that for the additional
supervision, it is entitled to a project management fee of $828,823.31, or
approximately 20%.  DBIK alleges that the
total change order between the parties increased the contract amount by
$3,899,454.44, resulting in an adjusted contract amount of $4,844,454.44.  DBIK alleges it made a demand for
$4,844,454.44 and Defendants have failed to pay $1,776,084.08 of that amount.   
            The complaint, filed July 30, 2021,
alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) open book account;
(3) account stated; (4) reasonable value of labor and materials furnished; and
(5) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien. 
            On October 1, 2021, DBIK filed an
Amendment to Complaint, naming Doe 1 as “Four Joy One LLC a California limited
liability company.”  On October 8, 2021, DBIK
filed an Amendment to Complaint, correcting the name of “Four Joy Investment
LLC, a California Corporation” to “Four Joy Investment LLC, a California
Limited Liability Company.”  
            On October 24, 2023, DBIK dismissed
without prejudice Four Joy One LLC as to the complaint. 
B.    
Cross-Complaints
On July 11, 2022, Cross-Complainants DBIK and
Danny Hung Cheng filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Angel
Development, Inc., N Pro Electric, and Albert Harding Butcher Jr. dba Harding
Construction for: (1) implied indemnity; (2) contribution and indemnity; (3)
declaratory relief; and (4) negligence. 
On September 21, 2023, the default of N Pro Electric, Inc. was entered
upon the request of DBIK and Cheng. 
On January 20, 2023, Four Joy Investment,
LLC filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant Angel Development, Inc.
for: (1) intentional misrepresentation (fraud/deceit); (2) negligent
misrepresentation; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (5) negligence; and (6) recovery of payments made
to unlicensed subcontractors pursuant to Business & Professions Code, §
7031(b).  That same day, Four Joy Investment,
LLC filed an Amendment to Cross-Complaint naming Roe 1 as DC International
Design & Construction, Inc. 
On February 17, 2023, Cross-Complainants
Four Joy Investment, LLC and Four Joy One, LLC (“Four Joy Entities”) filed a
First Amended Cross-Complaint (“Four Joy FAXC”) against Cross-Defendants DBIK
and “Danny” Hung Cheng for: (1) violation of Business & Professions Code,
§§ 7125.2 and 7031(b) (disgorgement action against unlicensed contractor); (2)
violation of Business & Professions Code, § 7160 (statutory fraud by
unlicensed contractor); (3) (deceit) intentional misrepresentation; (4) deceit
(negligent misrepresentation); (5) negligence; and (6) violation of Business
& Professions Code, § 17200 et seq.  On September 14, 2023, the Four Joy FAXC was
dismissed without prejudice.  On January
17, 2024, the Court granted Four Joy Entities’ ex parte application to add
Cross-Defendant DC International Design & Construction, Inc. to the Four
Joy FAXC.  (The Court notes that Four Joy
Entities’ subsequent attempts to file a Second Amended Cross-Complaint on
February 23, 2024 and another First Amended Cross-Complaint on May 9, 2024 were
rejected by the clerk of the court.  The
Court did not grant Four Joy Entities leave to file a new pleading; rather, the
order on the ex parte application only allowed Four Joy Entities to add DC
International Design & Construction, Inc. as a party to the February 17,
2023 Four Joy FAXC.)  The February 17,
2023 Four Joy FAXC shall be deemed the operative pleading for this particular
cross-complaint. 
C.    
Demurrer on Calendar
On June 3, 2024,
Cross-Defendant DC International Design & Construction, Inc. (“DC”) filed a
demurrer to Cross-Complainant Four Joy Investment, LLC’s first amended
cross-complaint.  
On June 24,
2024, Four Joy Entities filed an opposition brief
On June 28,
2024, DC filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            DC
demurs to each of the 6 causes of action alleged in the Four Joy FAXC (filed on
February 17, 2023) on the grounds that the Four Joy FAXC fails to state
sufficient facts and is uncertain. 
            As noted in the Section B’s
“Cross-Complaints” section above, the Court will deem the Four Joy FAXC (filed
February 17, 2023) as the operative pleading for the purposes of this
demurrer.  In the opposition brief, Four
Joy Entities requests that the May 9, 2024 version of the FAXC be deemed the
operative cross-complaint.  However, the
clerk of the court rejected that pleading on the reasoning that the Court
granted Four Joy Entities’ request to add DC as a party to the Four Joy FAXC
only.   In any event, the Court will
assume that the Amended Cross-Complaint filed February 27, 2023 is the
operative pleading. As noted below, it has certain deficiencies, and the Court
will grant Four Joy Entities leave to attempt to cure those deficiencies. 
A.   
1st cause of action for violation of
Business & Professions Code, §§ 7125.2 and 7031(b) (disgorgement action
against unlicensed contractor)
DC demurs to the 1st cause of
action, arguing that Four Joy Entities have not alleged facts against DC pursuant
to Business & Professions Code, §§ 7125.2 and 7031(b). 
Section 7125.2
states in relevant part: “The failure of a licensee to obtain or
maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage, if required under this chapter,
shall result in the automatic suspension of the license by operation of law in accordance
with the provisions of this section, but this suspension shall not affect,
alter, or limit the status of the licensee as an employer for purposes of
Section 3716 of the Labor Code.” 
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7125.2.) 
Section 7031(b)
states: 
(b) Except as
provided in subdivision (e), a person who utilizes the services of an
unlicensed contractor may bring an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction in this state to recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed
contractor for performance of any act or contract.
(Bus. & Prof. Code, §
7031(b).)  
As currently alleged, the Four Joy FAXC
fails to allege facts that DC (or the Roe Cross-Defendants) was unlicensed or,
if licensed, that DC failed to obtain or maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage. 
The demurrer to the 1st
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.  
B.    
2nd cause of action for violation of
Business & Professions Code, § 7160 (statutory fraud by unlicensed
contractor); 3rd cause of action for (deceit) intentional
misrepresentation; and 4th cause of action for deceit (negligent
misrepresentation)
Business & Profession Code, § 7160
states: “Any person who is induced to contract for a work of
improvement, including but not limited to a home improvement, in reliance on
false or fraudulent representations or false statements knowingly made, may sue
and recover from such contractor or solicitor a penalty of five hundred dollars
($500), plus reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to any damages sustained
by him by reason of such statements or representations made by the contractor
or solicitor.”  
To allege a cause of action for fraud, the
requisite elements are: (1) a representation,
usually of fact, which is false; (2) knowledge of its falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation;
and (5) damage resulting from that justifiable reliance.  (Stansfield
v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 59, 72-73.)  
To allege a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, the requisite elements are: (1) a misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact; (2) without
reasonable grounds for believing it to be true; (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented; (4) ignorance of the truth and
justifiable reliance thereon by the party to whom the misrepresentation was
directed; and (5) damages.  (B.L.M. v. Sabo & Deitsch (1997)
55 Cal. App. 4th 823, 834.)  Negligent
misrepresentation, unlike fraud, does not require knowledge of falsity.  (Apollo
Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226,
243.)  
These causes of action are torts of deceit and the facts
constituting each element must be alleged with particularity; the claims cannot
be saved by referring to the policy favoring liberal construction of
pleadings.  (Committee on
Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
216.)  Since the claims must be pleaded with particularity, the
causes of action based on misrepresentations must allege facts showing how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the misrepresentations were tendered. 
(Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)  

DC demurs to the 2nd,
3rd, and 4th causes of action, which are based on fraud,
arguing that Four Joy Entities have not alleged specific facts regarding what
misrepresentations DC made.  A review of
these causes of action show that Four Joy Entities have alleged facts against
Cheng and DBIK, but they have not alleged facts regarding what representations
were made by DC, who made such representations on DC’s behalf, when they were
made, by what means, etc.  Further, the
other elements of fraud have not been sufficiently alleged against DC.  
The demurrer to the 2nd to
4th causes of action is sustained with leave to amend.  
C.    
5th cause of action for negligence
The elements of a negligence cause of
action are “duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages.”  (Carlsen
v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 892.)
DC demurs to the negligence cause of
action, arguing that the FAXC fails to allege facts regarding what DC was
retained to do, whether DC performed any work, and how the work performed was
substandard.  
Similar to the reasons stated above, the
Court sustains the demurrer to the 5th cause of action as no facts
are alleged against DC in the FAXC at this time.  
D.   
6th cause of action for violation of
Business & Professions Code, § 17200 et seq.
DC demurs to the 6th cause of
action arguing that there are no allegations alleged against DC in the FAXC. 
For the reasons stated above, the demurrer
to the 6th cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Cross-Defendant DC
International Design & Construction, Inc.’s demurrer to Cross-Complainant
Four Joy International, LLC’s first amended cross-complaint (filed February 17,
2023) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
Cross-Defendant
shall provide notice of this order.
