Significant Statements:

  - "Without a contractual underpinning, there is no independent claim for breach of the implied covenant."
  - "A claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded generally and allegations that a defendant acted 'with oppression, fraud and malice' toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages."
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in a breach of contract and insurance bad faith case. The plaintiff, Patrick Abelar, alleges that the defendants failed to provide adequate insurance coverage and breached their contractual obligations. The court overrules the demurrer as to Auzat Insurance Agency, Inc. and State Farm General Insurance Company, but sustains it as to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The court grants the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages, but allows the plaintiff to amend the complaint to provide sufficient factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also denies the defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 63, 66, and 68 of the complaint, which alleged that the defendants acted with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's rights.
