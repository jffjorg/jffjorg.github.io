The judge has granted defendant Last Property Managemnt LLC's motion to compel discovery responses from plaintiff John K Sloatman III. The defendant had served discovery requests on February 20, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. As a result, the defendant was forced to contact the plaintiff on May 8, 2024 to seek responses. Despite this, the plaintiff still failed to respond. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice of this order. Additionally, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $360, and ordered the plaintiff to pay this amount to the defendant within 20 days.
