And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Alpha Medical Resources, Inc.'s motion to compel further responses from Heritage Props, Inc. regarding certain requests for production (RPDs). The judge found that Heritage's objections to the RPDs were not valid and that the documents sought are necessary to determine the actual amount of loss attributable to Heritage's alleged use of information obtained from Alpha.

The judge also ordered Heritage to provide further responses to certain RPDs, including those seeking communications between Heritage and Alpha's customers and suppliers, as well as financial documents related to Heritage's business operations.

The judge did not award sanctions to Alpha, despite seeking $4,326.02 in sanctions, due to the timing of the service of the moving papers.
