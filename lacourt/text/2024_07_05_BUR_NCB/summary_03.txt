And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery responses and requests for sanctions. The defendant filed two motions to compel initial responses from the plaintiff, including form interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The plaintiff initially did not provide verified responses, but later provided "Draft" responses and stated that he would provide verifications the following week. The defendant has not received responses from the plaintiff as of the date of the hearing.

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel discovery responses as moot, as the plaintiff has now provided verified responses. However, the judge is imposing sanctions on the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $500, plus $120 in filing fees. The judge finds that the plaintiff's initial responses were not code compliant and were tantamount to no responses at all.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and his counsel to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,120 to the defendant, to be paid within 20 days of notice of this order. The defendant is required to provide notice of this order.
