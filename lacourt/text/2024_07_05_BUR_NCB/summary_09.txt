And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is in response to the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues filed by Plaintiff 330 North Brand, Inc. against Defendant Johnhart Corp. The case involves an unlawful detainer claim arising from the expiration of a written Office Lease between the parties on December 31, 2020, and Defendant's continued possession of the premises under a month-to-month holdover tenancy.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has established its burden of proving that Defendant has continued in possession of the premises after the Lease expired. However, Defendant has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted in favor of Plaintiff.

The Court orders Plaintiff to lodge with the Court and serve on Defendant a proposed judgment within ten (10) days and to provide notice of this order. The Final Status Conference and Trial are advanced to this date and vacated.
