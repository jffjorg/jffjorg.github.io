  Case No.:  BC635281
 
  Hearing Date:  July 5, 2024
 
 [Tentative] order RE:
motion for reconsideration of sanctions order 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
On August 3, 2015, Decedent Davis Eagle
(“Decedent”) employed and retained Defendants Sachin Navare, M.D., Robert
Gottner, M.D., and Mayur Patel, M.D. to examine, care, diagnose, and treat
Decedent for his physical condition and complaints.  Plaintiff Adam Eagle (“Plaintiff”), the sole
heir of Decedent, alleges that Defendants negligently provided medical care to
Decedent, leading to his death.  The
complaint, filed September 26, 2016, alleges a single cause of action for
wrongful death (medical malpractice).        
B.    
Relevant Background
The matter went to
jury before a trial.  On February 15,
2024, the jury entered the special verdict form.  On February 26, 2024, the Judgment After Jury
Trial was entered as follows: 
IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that
Plaintiff, Adam Eagle take nothing by his action and that Judgment be entered
forthwith in favor of Defendants Sachin Navare, M.D., Bharat Shah, M.D., David
Mok, M.D., and Brian Tzung, M.D. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND
DECREED that as the prevailing parties, Defendants Sachin Navare, M.D., Bharat
Shah, M.D., David Mok, M.D., and Brian Tzung, M.D. shall recover costs, as
permitted by California law, from Plaintiff, Adam Eagle in an amount to be
determined by a timely filed Memorandum of Costs.
(2/26/24 Judgment After Jury Trial at
p.4.)  
            On
March 29, 2024, the Court held a hearing on an Order to Show Cause re: $2,000
in sanctions against Plaintiff’s Counsel Barry Zelner for obstructing
proceedings on January 31, 2024;
and an Order to Show Cause re: $1,500 in sanctions against Mr. Zelner for his
failure to follow the direction of the Court and for talking over the Court on December
7, 2023.  On April 23, 2024, the Court ruled
on the submitted matter and ordered Mr.
Zelner to pay the $4,000 total sanctions within 30 days of this order—this
consisted of $1,000 in sanctions that were deferred as a result of Mr. Zelner’s
obstruction of the December 7, 2023 hearing, $1,500 in sanctions for Mr.
Zelner’s obstruction of proceedings on the morning of January 31, 2024, and
$1,500 in sanctions for his obstruction of proceedings on the afternoon of
January 31, 2024.  The sanctions were to
be payable in the amount of $1,000 to each defendant. 
C.     Motion on Calendar
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
for reconsideration of the sanctions order. 

The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.
LEGAL
STANDARD
            CCP § 177.5
states: 
A judicial officer
shall have the power to impose reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed
fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), notwithstanding any other provision of law,
payable to the court, for any
violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good
cause or substantial justification. This power shall not apply to
advocacy of counsel before the court. For the purposes of this section, the
term “person” includes a witness, a party, a party's attorney, or both.
Sanctions pursuant
to this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party's
moving or responding papers; or on the court's own motion, after notice and
opportunity to be heard. An order imposing sanctions shall be in writing and
shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.
(CCP
§ 177.5.)  
            CCP § 1008(a) states: “When an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same
judge or court that made the order, to reconsider
the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party
making the application shall state by affidavit
what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or
decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are
claimed to be shown.”
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for reconsideration
of the Court’s sanctions order pursuant to CCP §§ 1008(a) and 177.5.  
            Plaintiff argues that there was
never any order that sanctions be paid to Raymond Blessey or Mark Connely, but
instead the only prior order for sanctions was “that Mark Connely paid to Barry
Zelner and Ray Blessey money for his failure to comply with the Court Order of
not taking the case to trial which delayed the trial.”  (Mot. at p.3.)  Plaintiff argues that there is no basis for
sanctions and that the Court made numerous misrepresentations.  Plaintiff argues that the Court cannot
sanction Mr. Zelner pursuant to CCP § 177.5 because he was advocating his case
on behalf of his client and the Court never, specifically in writing, complied
with the section. 
            The Court did not sanction Mr.
Zelner for his advocacy on behalf on Plaintiff, but for his conduct towards the
Court, court staff, and his incivility during court proceedings.  As indicated in the Court’s April 23, 2024
order, Mr. Zelner interrupted other calendar matters prior to his case being
heard, he refused to leave the courtroom on his own volition and had to be
escorted by the Sheriff, he was orally abusive to the Courtroom Assistant, and
failed to present any evidence of his medical condition which caused a
postponement of the trial.  In addition,
the Court noted that Mr. Zelner accused the Court and its staff of being liars and
anti-Semitic, he would abusively shout at and over the Court and other counsel,
and he continued to exhibit unstable behavior. 

As a result of Mr. Zelner’s behavior, on
December 7, 2023, the Court set an OSC re: $1,000 against Mr. Zelner for
Disrupting Court Proceedings for January 18, 2024.  
On November 27, 2023, the Court set an OSC
re: Not to Exceed $2,000 in sanctions against Attorney Mark Connely and his
client for their Failure to Personally Appear on 11/27/2023 during the jury
trial.  This OSC was heard on January 12,
2024.  The Court imposed a $1,000
sanction against Mr. Connely and his client for their failure to personally
appear, payable to Raymond Blessey and Mr. Zelner in the amount of $500 each.  
On January 18, 2024, the Court held the
OSC re: $1,000 against Mr. Zelner for Disrupting Court Proceedings and stated
it would hold the issue of the $1,000 in sanctions against Mr. Zelner in
abeyance pending the conclusion of trial and would remove the sanctions issued
against Mr. Connely (also held under abeyance pending the conclusion of
trial).  
The trial proceeded, but Mr. Zelner’s
conduct did not improve.  The Court’s
observations of Mr. Zelner’s conduct are detailed on pages 3 to 5 of the
Court’s April 23, 2024 sanctions order. As a result of his conduct, on January
31, 2024, the Court set an OSC re: $2,000 in sanctions against Mr. Zelner for
obstructing proceedings for March 29, 2024. 

On March 29, 2024, the Court held the two
OSCs against Mr. Zelner.  The Court heard
oral argument, ordered Mr. Zelner to file a supplemental brief, and took the
matter under submission.  The Court
considered Plaintiff’s opposition brief and amended opposition brief filed on
April 4, 2024 and issued its ruling on April 23, 2024.  
            Based on the relevant background of
this action, the Court has amply and clearly stated its reasons for issuing
sanctions against Mr. Zelner.  Neither of
the OSC proceedings were based on the “advocacy
of counsel before the court,” but rather for Mr. Zelner’s personal behavior and
conduct in the courtroom that went beyond the bounds of advocacy and resulted
in obstruction of the proceedings.  (See
CCP § 177.5.)  In addition, the Court
gave notice to the parties regarding the OSC hearings: (1) on December 7, 2023,
the Court gave the parties notice that it was setting the OSC re: $1,000 against Mr.
Zelner for Disrupting Court Proceedings; and (2) on January 31, 2024, the Court
set an OSC re: $2,000 in sanctions against Mr. Zelner for obstructing
proceedings for March 29, 2024.  The
Court held hearings on the OSCs and ultimately provided Mr. Zelner the
opportunity to file a supplemental brief by April 5, 2024 regarding his
December 7, 2023 and January 31, 2024 behavior. 
(See 3/29/24 Minute Order.)  Thus,
the Court gave notice to the parties and provided them an opportunity to be
heard prior to entering its ruling on the matter.  
            Plaintiff has not upheld his burden
in showing that there are new
or different facts, circumstances, or law to warrant granting a motion for
reconsideration.  As such, the motion is
denied.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration of the Court’s sanctions order is denied.
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
