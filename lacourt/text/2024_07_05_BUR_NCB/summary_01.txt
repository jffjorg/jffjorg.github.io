And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik on a demurrer filed by DC International Design & Construction, Inc. (DC) against Four Joy Investment LLC's first amended cross-complaint (FAXC). The case involves a construction agreement between DBIK Construction & Design, Inc. (DBIK) and Four Joy Investment LLC, and alleged breaches of contract, open book account, account stated, reasonable value of labor and materials furnished, and foreclosure of mechanic's lien.

The Judge ruled that the FAXC fails to allege facts that DC was unlicensed or failed to obtain or maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage, and dismissed the 1st cause of action. The Judge also dismissed the 2nd to 6th causes of action, which are based on alleged misrepresentations and negligence, as the FAXC fails to allege specific facts regarding what misrepresentations were made and the elements of the causes of action.

The Judge granted DC's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, and ordered that DC shall provide notice of this order.
