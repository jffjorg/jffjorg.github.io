And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference, which means that the trial will be set for October 28, 2024. The plaintiff, Noemi Cristales, is 91 years old and alleges that she suffered injuries in a slip-and-fall incident at a Ralphs Grocery Company store in South Pasadena on June 30, 2023. The plaintiff's counsel believes that her health condition has worsened since the incident and that she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the proceedings at a later time. The judge found that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her interests would be prejudiced without a trial preference. The defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff had not shown sufficient evidence of prejudice. The judge considered the evidence presented and granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration, made on information and belief regarding the plaintiff's current health condition, was sufficient to support the motion.
