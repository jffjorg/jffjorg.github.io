Summary:

The Judge, John J. Kralik, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for reconsideration of the sanctions order. The case is BC635281, and the hearing date is July 5, 2024. The plaintiff, Adam Eagle, is seeking to overturn the sanctions order against his counsel, Barry Zelner. The Court has previously sanctioned Zelner for obstructing proceedings, including interrupting other calendar matters, refusing to leave the courtroom, and being orally abusive to the Courtroom Assistant. Zelner's behavior was deemed to be beyond the bounds of advocacy and resulted in obstruction of the proceedings. The Court has denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the plaintiff has not presented new or different facts, circumstances, or law to warrant granting the motion. The sanctions order remains in effect.
