  order RE:
MOtion to compel discovery responses; request for sanctions
 



 
On May 22, 2024,
Defendant Last Property Managmnt, LLC (“Defendant,” erroneously sued as Last
Property Management LLC) filed a motion to compel initial responses from Plaintiff
John K Sloatman III (“Plaintiff”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories (“FROG”), set
one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one; and (3) Request for
Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On February 20,
2024, Defendant served on Plaintiff the discovery requests.  Defendant states that because no responses
were received, defense counsel contacted Plaintiff on May 8, 2024 to seek
discovery responses.  As of the filing of
the motions, Defendant states that it has not received responses from Plaintiff.  
Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiff
is ordered to provide verified responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $360.  The request is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $360 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
