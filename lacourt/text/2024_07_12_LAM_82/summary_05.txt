And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue. The plaintiff, Ocean 11 RV Park, LLC, seeks to restore the status quo and obtain a permit for its RV park project. However, the court finds that the permit was issued in error and that the project does not comply with public benefits standards. The court also finds that the City Council's actions were not political interference, but rather a legitimate exercise of its authority.

The court orders that the plaintiff's ex parte application be denied, and that the City file an answer within 30 days. The court also sets a case management conference for a later date. The court notes that the plaintiff has not established a likelihood of success on the merits and that a preliminary mandatory injunction is rarely granted. The court concludes that the project is not about an applicant who has a "vested right" to a permit, but rather about political interference.
