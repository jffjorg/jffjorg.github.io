the Contract-Antelope Valley, et al. v. Antelope Valley Union High School
District, et al., Case No. 23STCP01869
 
Petitioners
filed an ex parte application for an order directing the clerk’s office to
issue the writ of mandate.  The court rules on this ex parte application
without holding a hearing, per Code of Civil Procedure section 166(a)(1). 
In fact, the writ of mandate was issued today.  Therefore, the ex parte
application is denied as moot.  Petitioners’ counsel shall provide notice
and file proof of service with the court.
