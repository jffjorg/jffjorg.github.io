 Case Number:  24STCV16728    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  82 Ocean 11 RV Park,
LLC v. City of Los Angeles 
Case No. 24STCV16728
[Tentative] Order
Denying Ex Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order
            
In the fall of 2023, Plaintiff
Ocean 11 RV Park, LLC (“Plaintiff”) began the process of developing an RV Park,
located at 23416 President Avenue in Harbor City, California 90710. (Silver
Decl. ¶ 3.)  On or about November 2,
2023, Plaintiff’s authorized agent and member, Stewart Silver, met with the
City of Los Angeles (the “City”), Department of Planning (the “LADDS”), and
submitted plans for the public benefit application (“PBA”) application for the
property. (Id. ¶ 4.)  On November 21,
2023, Plaintiff closed escrow in the property for $1.45 million. (Id. ¶
5.)  The City’s review process occurred
between November 9, 2023, and March 22, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel and Mr. Silver
allege as follows:  The permit for the
PBA application was approved and issued on March 22, 2024. (Id. ¶ 8 & Exh.
4.)  After the permit was issue on March
22, 2024, we began construction on the Property that has been ongoing since
March 22, 2024.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  The only remaining issues to be cleared
before receiving a Certificate of Occupancy was approval of landscaping and
power lines.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  There was an inspection scheduled for both on
June 28, 2024 and July 2, 2024, based upon which Plaintiff excepted to “be able
to move people into the park within a few days after the July 2, 2024 final
inspection.”  (Ibid.)  However, according to Mr. Silver, on or about
June 14, 2024, the City Councilmember from the 15th District (where the
property is located), Tim McOsker, presented a motion to the City Council to
effectively stop the project over alleged environmental concerns.  (Id. ¶ 11.) Between June 14 and June 28, 2020,
Mr. Silver had regular communication with Mr. McOsker to address his concerns
regarding construction of the RV park. (Id. ¶ 12.) Mr. McOsker introduced an
amended motion, and the City Council held a hearing on June 28, 2024. (Id. ¶¶
13-14.)  Mr. Silver and his attorney
attended the hearing, as did “concerned residents that want the Park build
[sic].” (Id. ¶ 15.)  Following the hearing,
the City Council approved Mr. McOsker’s amended motion.  (Ibid.) 
The City Council has ordered the LADDS to halt any pending approvals of
the project and to report on two issues: (1) Whether the City’s short-term
rental ordinance would be applicable to the proposed use as currently being
promoted and, if applicable, what requirements are necessary for the use to
comply and what enforcement mechanism exist; and (2) The type and extent of the
“public benefits” associated with the proposed use, a description of the public
benefits checklist and standards that qualify this project as a “public benefit
project,” and a description of the City’s ability to impose additional
conditions for the use of the land. (Id. Exhs. 1 & 2.)  At the prior hearing on this matter, Mr.
Silver and Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to portray this as a political issue
based upon complaints from Mr. McOsker’s constituents.    
 
Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application to “restore the status quo with respect to the Public Benefits
application and permit that was previously approve and issued by the City on
March 22, 2024.”  (Ex Parte Application,
p. 2:6-7; Declaration of Chris C. Chapman ¶¶ 2-3.)  Originally, the hearing on the ex parte
application was set for Monday, July 8, 2024. 
However, the court was concerned that the City had not received
sufficient notice of this ex parte application and the relief sought.  Plaintiff’s counsel provided notice on
Friday, July 5, 2024—the Friday after a holiday, which was July 4, 2024—and
admitted at the hearing that he left voicemails and never spoke to a live
person at the City Clerk’s Office or City Attorney’s Office.  The complaint and ex parte application in
this case were not filed until Monday, July 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., the same
date/time as the original hearing on this ex parte application.  There was no proof of service on file, and
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration did not state that he served a copy of the ex
parte application for a temporary restraining order on the City or the attorney
handling this matter. Accordingly, the court continued the hearing to afford
the City sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard.
 
The City’s opposition to the ex
parte application paints a different picture. 
It is true that the planning staff “thought that the project met all of
the required Performance Standards for a Public Benefits approval for an RV
Park.”  (Declaration of Anna M. Vidal ¶
3.)  Then, in April 2024, two members of
the planning staff—Anna M. Vidal and Ruben Vasquez—“double checked the
project’s compliance with the twelve Public Benefits project performance
standards in LAMC section 14.00.A.7 . . . [and] determined that there was an
issue.  (Id. ¶ 4; see also Declaration of
Ruben C. Vasquez ¶ 4.)  The planners met
with Stewart Silver, among others, on April 30, 2024, to discuss the issues and
advised Plaintiff to make changes. 
(Declaration of Anna M. Vidal ¶ 4.) 
In June 2024, the planning staff re-reviewed the plans and determined
that at least one of the required performance standards—Number Three—still had
not been met.  (Ibid.)  The planning staff attended the City Council
meeting on June 28, 2024, and discussed the lacking compliance with the
performance standard.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  Then, on July 1, 2024, at 9:00 p.m.,
Plaintiff emailed revised plans.  (Id. ¶
6.)  The revised plans “did not clearly
show compatibility with Public Benefits Standard 5, that the property has a
ten-foot landscaped buffer.” 
(Ibid.)  In response, Plaintiff
submitted revised plans on July 2, 2024, after 2 p.m.  (Id. ¶ 7.) 
The latest plans indicate a change in that there will be 39 pads instead
of 46 pads.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  Ms. Vidal emailed to confirm receipt and
asked for “some time to review it” on July 3, 2024, 1:27 p.m.  (Id. ¶ 7 & Exh. C.)  This action was filed on July 8, 2024, at
8:30 a.m.  It is unclear whether the planning
staff has had sufficient time to review the plans.   
 
The court denies Plaintiff’s ex
parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why
a preliminary injunction shall not issue. 
Effectively, Plaintiff seeks an order mandating that the City issue the
permit.  “A preliminary mandatory
injunction is rarely granted . . . [and] is not permitted except in extreme
cases where the right thereto is clearly established.”  (Shoemaker v. County of Los Angeles
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 618, 625, citations and quotations omitted.)  Plaintiff has not established a likelihood of
success on the merits.  Based upon the
record before this court, it appears that this case is not about an
applicant who has a “vested right” to a permit but for the political
interference of a member of the City Council. 
Rather, the record suggests that the permit was issued in error, and
Plaintiff still has not corrected the issues. 
Nor is there a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, as Plaintiff does
not make clear why it cannot resolve the outstanding issues in a timely
manner.  To the contrary, if the court
grants this application, it would effectively overrule the City’s requirements
and permit use of a non-compliant RV park, which may give rise to harm to the
City and/or residents.  
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
1.         Plaintiff’s
ex parte application is denied.
 
2.         The
City shall file an answer within thirty (30) days.
 
3.         The
court sets a case management conference for _______, 2024, at ___ a.m. in
Department ______.
 
4.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
