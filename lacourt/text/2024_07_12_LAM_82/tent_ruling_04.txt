J. Najarian v. City of Glendale, et al., Case No. 24STCP02101
 
Petitioner
Ara J. Najarian (“Petitioner”), who serves on the City Council for the City of
Glendale, filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the City Council’s
decision to select a different member of the City Council as mayor. 
Petitioner filed an ex parte application for a stay of this decision under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(g) or, in the alternative, section
1085.  
 
The
court rules on this ex parte application without a hearing, per the authority
of Code of Civil Procedure section 166(a)(1).  The court finds that there
is no exigency that would require this matter be heard as an ex parte
application as opposed to a noticed motion.  Therefore, the court denies
the ex parte application.  Instead, the court shall treat the moving
papers as a noticed motion for a stay, which shall be heard on August 5, 2024,
at 9:30 a.m.  Any opposition (or supplemental opposition) shall be filed
on or before July 23, 2024.  Any reply brief shall be filed on or before
July 29, 2024.
 
Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice via email and file a proof of service
forthwith.  If Petitioner’s counsel fails to do so, the court will
continue the hearing to afford sufficient notice to Respondents.
