And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Petitioner Ara J. Najarian's ex parte application for a stay of the City Council's decision to select a different member as mayor. Instead, the court will treat the moving papers as a noticed motion for a stay and schedule a hearing for August 5, 2024. Any opposition or supplemental opposition must be filed by July 23, 2024, and any reply brief must be filed by July 29, 2024. Petitioner's counsel must provide notice via email and file a proof of service forthwith. If counsel fails to do so, the court will continue the hearing to afford sufficient notice to Respondents.
