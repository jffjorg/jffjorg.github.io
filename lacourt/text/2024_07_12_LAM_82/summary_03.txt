And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Petitioner Ida P. Fung's ex parte application to stay the revocation of her driver's license is denied. The Petitioner's driver's license was suspended in October 2021 after her neighbor reported her alleged dangerous driving and she failed a drive knowledge exam. The DMV refused to reinstate her license despite her lack of success on the exam. The Petitioner is not seeking a stay of a DMV decision, but rather reinstatement of her license in advance of trial, which the court has no authority to order. The Judge concludes that the Petitioner has not demonstrated the requisite likelihood of success on the merits and that the application is denied.
