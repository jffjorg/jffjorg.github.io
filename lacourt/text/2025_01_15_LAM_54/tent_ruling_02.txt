[1] In its
supplemental brief, Defendant argues that attorneys’ fees are recoverable under
a private attorney general theory. (Defendant’s Suppl. Brief at pp. 4-5.)
Defendant did not raise this argument in either its moving papers or reply
papers. Defendant’s attempt to introduce evidence to support such theory through
the declaration of Mr. Chow submitted with the supplemental brief is improper.
“[N]ew evidence is not permitted with reply papers” as “such consideration
would deprive the respondent of the opportunity to counter the argument.” (Jay
v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.)
