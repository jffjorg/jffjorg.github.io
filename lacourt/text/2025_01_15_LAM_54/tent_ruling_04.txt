BACKGROUND
            
This is a lemon law action arising out of
Plaintiff Michele Rene Davis’ purchase of a 2019 Chevrolet Camaro manufactured
and distributed by Defendant General Motors Inc. Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on
August 26, 2024, asserting the following causes of action: (1) violation of
subdivision (d) of Civil Code § 1793.2; (2) violation of subdivision (b) of
Civil Code § 1793.2; (3) violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code §
1793.2; (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; (5) violation of
the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act; and (6) fraudulent inducement-concealment.
 
Defendant now demurs again to the sixth cause of
action, and moves to strike the claim for punitive damages.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole
complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High
Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat as true the complaint's
material factual allegations, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the sixth
cause of action for fraudulent inducement by concealment on the following
grounds: (1) the claim is time-barred; and (2) the claim has not been pleaded
with the requisite specificity. 
 
The Court previously rejected
Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff’s fraudulent concealment claim is
time-barred. (See August 6, 2024 Minute Order at pp. 2-3.) The Court declines
to address this issue again and overrules the demurrer on that ground. 
 
The elements of fraud
are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or
nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to
defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting
damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) California law
recognizes four circumstances in which a nondisclosure or concealment may
constitute actionable fraud: “(1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary
relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge
of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals
a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.”  (Heliotis
v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 646, 651.)  
 
Generally, “[i]n California, fraud must be pled
specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement
System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384,
internal quotations omitted.) Fraudulent concealment need not be pled with the
same degree of specificity, as “it appears from the nature of the allegations
that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the
facts of the controversy,” and it is necessarily difficult to specifically
plead something that did not occur. (Id.)
However, some level of specificity is required. (See Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 858, 878 [“Concealment is a species of fraud, and ‘[f]raud must be
pleaded with specificity.’”])
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff have failed to allege that Defendant concealed a material
fact and that there was no duty to disclose The Court agrees. Plaintiff relies
on the same allegations that the Court previously found deficient. (See August
6, 2024 Minute Order at pg. 4; Compare FAC ¶¶ 31, 77, 80-81, 84-85, 87 with SAC
¶¶ 32, 78, 81-82, 85-86, 88.) 
 
In addition, the SAC continues to
fail to allege a transactional relationship between the parties.  A duty to disclose pursuant to the four circumstances stated
above “presuppose[ ] the existence of some
other relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to
disclose can arise.” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 337.) The California Supreme Court “has described the necessary relationship
giving rise to a duty to disclose as a ‘transaction’ between the plaintiff and
defendant ….” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276,
311; Warner Construction Corp. v. City of Los Angeles (1970) 2 Cal.3d
285, 294 [“In transactions which do not involve fiduciary or confidential
relations”]; Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178,
1187–89 [rejecting concealment claim where plaintiffs “were not involved in a
transaction with the parties they claim defrauded them”]; LiMandri, supra,
52 Cal.App.4th at p. 337 [“such a relationship can only come into being as a
result of some sort of transaction between the parties”].) 
 
While Plaintiff continues to rely on Dhital v. Nissan
North America (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828 for the proposition that her
allegations are sufficient to show evidence of a transactional relationship
(Opposition at pp.7-9), the allegations
again fail to allege an agency relationship between Defendant and the
dealership that ultimately sold the subject vehicle to Plaintiff. (See August
6, 2024 Minute Order at pg. 5.) The SAC fails to allege the existence of a
duty. 
 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The motion
to strike is MOOT.
