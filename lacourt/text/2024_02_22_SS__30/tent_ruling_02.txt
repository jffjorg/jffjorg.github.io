CASE
NUMBER: 20STCV18156
 
Motion to Tax
Costs filed by Defendant Environmental Design Studio

 
 
Background 
On May 12, 2020, Plaintiff
Kimberly K. Higgins filed a complaint against Doe Gardeners and later amended
the complaint to also name as a defendant Environmental Design Studio, alleging
a cause of action for negligence. The complaint alleges that on June 17, 2018,
Plaintiff was performing her duties as an Associate Designer at Restoration
Hardware when a 12-foot ladder, last used by Defendants in the maintenance of
the garden, suddenly and unexpectedly fell and violently struck Plaintiff on
her head causing Plaintiff to suffer traumatic brain damage and other severe
and disabling physical and emotional injuries. 
On May 24, 2022, this Court
granted Defendant Environmental Design Studio’s motion for summary judgment and
granted judgment in favor of Defendant.
On October 27, 2023, the Court of
Appeal issued a remittitur, reversing the judgment. 
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a memorandum of costs. 
On December 22, 2023, Defendant filed a
motion to tax costs. On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On
February 14, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
Legal Standard
The
party prevailing in the Court of Appeal in a civil case is entitled to costs on
appeal.  (CRC Rule 8.278(a)(1).)  Within 40 days after the issuance
of the remittitur the party claiming costs must serve and file in the superior
court a verified memorandum of costs under CRC Rule 3.1700 and a party may
serve and file a motion in the superior court to strike or tax costs pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1700.  (CRC Rule 8.278(c)(1)-(2).)
“A party may
recover only the following costs, if reasonable: (A) Filing fees; (B)
The amount the party paid for any portion of the record, whether an original or
a copy or both. The cost to copy parts of a prior record under rule 8.147(b)(2)
is not recoverable unless the Court of Appeal ordered the copying; (C) The cost
to produce additional evidence on appeal; (D) The costs to notarize, serve,
mail, and file the record, briefs, and other papers (E) The cost to print and
reproduce any brief, including any petition for rehearing or review, answer, or
reply; (F) The cost to procure a surety bond, including the premium, the cost
to obtain a letter of credit as collateral, and the fees and net interest
expenses incurred to borrow funds to provide security for the bond or to obtain
a letter of credit, unless the trial court determines the bond was unnecessary;
and (G) The fees and net interest expenses incurred to borrow funds to deposit
with the superior court in lieu of a bond or undertaking, unless the trial court
determines the deposit was unnecessary.” CRC Rule 8.278(d)(1)(A)-(G) (emphasis
added). 
“If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App.
4th 761, 774.) If the items appear to be proper expenses, they are themselves
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services were necessarily
incurred. If the items appear proper, it is not enough for the losing party to
attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary
or reasonable. Rather, the losing party has the burden to present evidence and
prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable. (Seever v. Copley Press
Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.) However, when items claimed as
costs do not appear on their face as proper and necessary, and the items are
properly challenged by a motion to tax costs, the burden of establishing the
necessity of the items is on the party claiming them as costs. (See Id.;
See also Whitney v. Whitney (1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 577, 585.) “[I]f the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas, 19 Cal.App.4th at 774.)
 
Discussion
First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
claimed costs should be stricken in entirety because the requests for items of
costs are excessive, unnecessary, duplicative, not supported by documentation,
not supportable as reasonable, and are not allowable by statute. Notably,
Plaintiff did not file a worksheet to detail and support her Memorandum of
Costs. 
If the entirety of the Memorandum
of Costs is not stricken, Defendant seeks to tax the following specific items
in the Memorandum of Costs: (1) Filing Fees for $869.93; (4) Printing and
copying of briefs for $247.76; and (6) Transmitting, filing, and serving of
record, briefs, and other papers for $435.95.
There
is also no requirement that supporting documentation, such as receipts, be
submitted with the memo of costs. (See Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) Defendant
has not offered any specific reasons why the costs are excessive, unnecessary,
duplicative, not supported by documentation, not supportable as reasonable, and
are not allowable by statute. As such, the Court denies the request to strike
the entirety of the memorandum of costs.
 
As for the request
to tax specific items, all of the items appear to be proper charges on their
face. Thus, Defendant has the burden to show that these were not reasonable or
necessary. 
 
            Item 1
As to the filing fee, Defendant argues
that pursuant to court rules, the filing fee for an appeal is $775. Defendant
argues Plaintiff has provided no worksheet, explanation, details, or
documentation to support her claim for the requested amount. Thus, Defendant
argues, this category should be taxed accordingly. 
However, as noted above, there is also no requirement that supporting documentation,
such as receipts, be submitted with the memo of costs. Nevertheless,
Defendant has shown that the filing fee for an appeal is $775. In opposition,
Plaintiff has filed documentation of the incurred fees, which shows these fees
were reasonable. (McNicholas Decl., Exh. 1.) In reply, Defendant argues that in
addition to the $775.00 filing fee, Plaintiff was charged a “convenience fee”
in the amount of $24.93 and a “service charge” of $70. Defendant argues these
additional charges, which total $94.93, are related to the use of a filing
service (One Legal) to file the documents on Plaintiff’s behalf. Defendant
argues the fees charged by One Legal are not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, since documents can be filed on the Court’s website
with no convenience fee or service charge. 
However, filing fees are allowed
under CRC Rule 8.278(d)(1)(A) as long as they are reasonable. Plaintiff’s
documentation shows they were reasonable. Thus, the request to tax item 1 is
DENIED.
            Item 4
Next, Defendant seeks to tax $247.76
under item 4 of costs for printing and copying fees. Defendant argues that all
filings must be made through the Court’s electronic filing system. Thus, it
argues, there was no need to print and/or copy materials. Defendant contends an
expense incurred for a service which was "merely convenient" and not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation is disallowed under Code
of Civil Procedure § 1033.5(c)(2). 
Defendant’s reliance on
CCP §1033.5 is misplaced.  The right to recover costs on appeal is
governed solely by CRC Rule 8.278.  (See CCP §1034(b)(“Judicial
council shall establish by rule allowable costs on appeal and the procedure for
claiming those costs”); Musaelian v. Adams (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
1251, 1259.)
Alternatively, Defendant requests to tax
this item because the requested amount is egregious, excessive, over-reaching,
and unreasonable. It argues that two reams of paper and ink to print 500 pages
would cost no more than $20. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has provided no
worksheet, explanation, details, or documentation to support her claim for the
requested amount, or proof that the requested amount was actually incurred.
Thus, Defendant contends, this category should be taxed accordingly. 
Defendant has not presented any evidence to prove
that the costs are not reasonable, and only argues such. As noted above, there
is also no requirement that supporting documentation, such as receipts, be
submitted with the memo of costs. 
In any event,
Plaintiff has filed documentation in opposition (McNicholas Decl., Exh. 3.), which
would be evidence of the reasonableness of the costs. In reply,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was charged for scanning, not printing
or copying. 
Pursuant
to CRC Rule 8.278(d)(1), a prevailing party on appeal is entitled to recover
“the amount paid for any portion of the record, whether an original or a copy
or both” and “the cost to print and reproduce any brief, including any
petition for rehearing or review, answer, or reply.”  (CRC Rule
8.278(d)(1)(B) and (E).) Thus, even if Defendant had met its burden to show the
costs were not reasonable (which it did not), the cost of scanning in
connection with the record and the briefs in support of appeal are expressly
recoverable. 
Thus, the request to tax item 4 is DENIED.
            Item 6
Lastly, Defendant seeks to tax $435.95
under item 6 of costs for transmitting, filing, and serving of record, briefs,
and other papers. Defendant argues that it was served electronically, so there
is no basis to seek costs for service or filing service. Defendant argues that
fees for a filing service are not set forth in CRC Rule 8.278 and are therefore
not recoverable costs on appeal. Additionally, an expense incurred for a
service which was "merely convenient" and not reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation is disallowed under Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5(c)(2). 
Defendant has not met its burden to
submit proof to show this fee is not recoverable. Even if Defendant was served
electronically with briefs or other papers, this item is also for filing and
notarizing -- costs which are expressly recoverable under CRC Rule 8.278(d)(1)(D). Defendant has not presented any
evidence to show that Plaintiff cannot recover the costs for filing or
notarizing. While Defendant argues that costs for a filing service are not set
forth in CRC Rule 8.278, these costs are still filing fees. Lastly,
again, Defendant’s reliance on CCP §1033.5 is
misplaced. Thus, the request to tax item 6 is DENIED.
Conclusion
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
tax costs is DENIED.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TENTATIVE
 
Defendant’s motion
to tax costs is DENIED. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
