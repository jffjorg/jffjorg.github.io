Here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to tax costs claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed a memorandum of costs after the court of appeal reversed a judgment in favor of the defendant. The defendant argued that the costs claimed by the plaintiff were excessive, unnecessary, and not supported by documentation. However, the court found that the plaintiff had provided reasonable documentation to support the claimed costs and that the defendant had not met its burden to show that the costs were not necessary or reasonable. The court also found that the costs claimed by the plaintiff were recoverable under California Rules of Court 8.278.
