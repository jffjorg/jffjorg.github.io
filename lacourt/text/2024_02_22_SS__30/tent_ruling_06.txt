 Case Number:  22STCV18563    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  30 BASHAR DAAS vs BOUTIQUE HOMES LLC, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant Boutique Homes LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2).)Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)Evidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff’s Two Objections to Defendant’s Evidence are SUSTAINED.The Court declines to rule on Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s evidence. While the Court “must” rule on all evidentiary objections made at the summary judgment stage, it is permitted to focus its attention on those which are “important.” (See Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 532; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q) [the court need only rule those objections to evidence that were material in the disposition of the MSJ].) The Court did not rely on the evidence that Defendant has objected to and thus, need not rule on the objections.DiscussionNegligence and Premises LiabilityThe elements of negligence are “the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.” (McIntyre v. The Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.) The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.¿¿(Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)¿¿Those who own, possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing the property¿to¿avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.¿¿(Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.The general rule is that a landlord is not liable for injuries caused by a tenant’s dog, unless the landlord knew the dog was dangerous. (Uccello v. Laudenslayer (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 504, 510-11.) “It is well established that a landlord does not owe a duty of care to protect a third party from his or her tenant's dog unless the landlord has actual knowledge of the dog’s dangerous propensities, and the ability to control or prevent the harm.” (Chee v. Amanda Goldt Property Management (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1360, 1369.) A landlord is under no duty to inspect a premises for the purpose of discovering a tenant’s dangerous animal. (Martinez v. Bank of America Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass’n (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 882, 891-92.)Moreover, whether a landlord has a duty to prevent or control dangerous conditions on a property related to injuries suffered from an animal, depends on the landlord’s knowledge of an animal’s vicious nature. (Donchin v. Guerrero (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1838-39.) “It should be emphasized that a duty of care may not be imposed on a landlord without proof that he knew of the dog and its dangerous propensities.” (Uccello, 44 Cal.App.3d at 514.) Further, because the harboring of pets is such an important part of our way of life and because the exclusive possession of rented premises normally is vested in the tenant, actual knowledge and not mere constructive knowledge is required. (Id.)Defendant argues that the hotel did not know of the dog’s presence on the premises on the date of the incident, and that it did not have actual knowledge of the dog’s dangerous propensities. Defendant presents evidence that the folio applicable to Steve Waldstein’s stay at The Charlie Hotel commencing on July 22, 2020 does not include a Pet Waiver. (Treivush Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Exh. D.) All guests registering to stay at The Charlie Hotel who wish to have a pet stay at The Charlie Hotel with them are required to complete a pet waiver and pay a registration fee applicable to the registration of the pet. These two pages were completed for Smokey’s prior stay at the hotel commencing in March of 2020. (Id., ¶ 6; Exh. C.)The Court finds that Defendant has not presented evidence sufficient to show that there are no triable issues of fact as to whether it knew of the dog’s presence and therefore it did not have actual knowledge that the subject dog involved in the incident was dangerous. Defendant’s evidence that the dog was previously banned due to excessive barking is based on double hearsay and is therefore inadmissible. Further, the only evidence Defendant provides in an attempt to show it did not have knowledge of the dog’s presence is the absence of a pet waiver from the folio for the stay covering the date of the incident. However, Treivush’s declaration only states that a pet waiver is only required for pets that are staying at the hotel, not for pets that are visiting the hotel. Notably, in opposition, Plaintiff provides evidence that a pet waiver is not required for dogs that were just visiting. (Dylan Depo 44:5 – 46:3.) Plaintiff additionally presents evidence that Defendant had actual notice of Smokey on the premises when the manager at the time was seen interacting with Smokey on the date of the Incident. (Rashwan Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6.) As such, even if Defendant did meet its initial burden to show it did not have knowledge of the dog’s presence, Plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient to show there are triable issues of material fact. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
