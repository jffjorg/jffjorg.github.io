And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and request for sanctions is denied without prejudice. The defendant served the plaintiff with deposition notices, but the plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition or notify the parties of non-appearance on multiple occasions. The court cannot grant the motion because the defendant did not attach any deposition notice to the motion, and the plaintiff was not properly served. As a result, the request for sanctions is also denied.
