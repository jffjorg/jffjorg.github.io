And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Boutique Homes LLC. The motion was denied. The Judge found that the Defendant did not meet its burden to show that there were no triable issues of fact as to whether it knew of the dog's presence on the premises, and that the Plaintiff had presented evidence sufficient to show that there were triable issues of material fact. The Judge noted that the Defendant's evidence that the dog was previously banned due to excessive barking was based on double hearsay and was therefore inadmissible. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's evidence, including a declaration by a hotel manager, showed that the Defendant had actual notice of the dog on the premises. As a result, the motion for summary judgment was denied.
