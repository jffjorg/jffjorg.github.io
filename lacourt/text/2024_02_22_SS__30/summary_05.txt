And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal. The Plaintiff's counsel mistakenly failed to file proof of service, leading to the case being dismissed without prejudice on December 13, 2023. The Plaintiff's counsel has provided a declaration stating that they inadvertently missed the Order to Show Cause hearing and did not upload the proofs of service in time. The Judge has determined that the dismissal is set aside due to the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect of the Plaintiff's counsel. The case will be transferred out of the PI Hub forthwith.
