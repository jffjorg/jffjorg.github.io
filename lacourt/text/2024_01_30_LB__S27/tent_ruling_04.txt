 Case Number:  23LBCV00007    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  S27 
Background Facts

Plaintiffs, John and Jane Doe, by
and through their Guardians ad Litem, Andrea Chait and Sean Walter, filed this
action against Defendant, Long Beach Junior Crew for failure to protect/negligence
and negligence.  
 

Motion to be
     Relieved as Counsel

Plaintiffs’ attorney seeks to be
relieved as counsel, contending a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
has rendered further representation impossible. 
The motion is denied due to failure to file proper proof of
service.  
 
Counsel declares, at ¶3(a) of her
declaration, that she personally served the moving papers on her clients.  Counsel filed proof of service of the moving
papers on Andrea Chait.  She filed a
declaration re: diligent attempts to serve the moving papers on Sean
Walter.  A declaration re: diligence is
not a proof of service.  
 
Importantly, Counsel did not file
proof of service of the moving papers on all parties who have appeared in this
action, as is required by CCP §1014.  Absent
proof of service of the moving papers on all parties who have appeared in the
action, the motion cannot be granted.
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this
matter.
