And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel by the plaintiff's attorney, citing the failure to file proper proof of service of the moving papers on all parties who have appeared in the action. The attorney argues that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the judge finds that the motion cannot be granted without proof of service on all parties. The judge orders the attorney to provide notice and specifies the procedure for parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
