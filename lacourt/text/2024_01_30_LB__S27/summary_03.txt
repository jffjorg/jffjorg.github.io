And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff, Mary Wilson, filed a complaint against the defendant, Rodger Wilson, alleging various causes of action arising out of a partnership agreement during their divorce proceedings. The defendant filed opposition to the motion, claiming that he had provided supplemental responses to all outstanding discovery requests after meeting and conferring with the plaintiff. The judge finds that the motions are substantively moot and that both parties could have engaged in more extensive meet and confer efforts to avoid the need for the filing of the motions. The judge is inclined not to impose sanctions at this time and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
