[1]           The
Opposition concedes it was filed one court day late and requests relief from
this mistake. (Opp. 13:17-8.) The Court will consider the untimely Opposition. 


[2]           The
California Supreme Court has granted review of Rodriguez but declined to
de-publish this case; as such, this case can only be cited for its persuasive
value. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(e)(3).)


[3]           Despite
the Jensen Court’s conclusion that the “other motor vehicle” provision
of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2) is “reasonably free from ambiguity” (35
Cal.App.4th at p. 123.), this Court finds the text obscure.  The statute’s “peculiar grammatical
structure” (Ibid.) has yielded contrary appellate interpretations.  Our Supreme Court may soon clarify the
matter. This Court finds that the Rodriguez analysis persuasively
highlights the broader implications and unanswered questions that arise from
the Jensen court’s conclusion that a used car with the balance of a
manufacturer’s new car warranty is a new motor vehicle. Until a more definitive
ruling is issued, this Court seeks to harmonize the two precedents. Rodriguez
did so, after a fashion, concluding that Jensen was correct based on its
facts.


[4]           Although
Plaintiff now argues the Vehicle is not “used,” the Compliant admits this fact
and Defendant’s evidence also supports this finding. 


[5]           Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 requires litigants to complete discovery
proceedings at least 30 days before trial and that discovery motions be heard
at least 15 days before the date initially set for the trial of the action in
question. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)
