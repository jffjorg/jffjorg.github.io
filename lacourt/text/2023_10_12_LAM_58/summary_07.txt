And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to supplement the June 26, 2018 Order to reflect sums continuing to be owed to the Judgment Creditor (Plaintiff) following partial satisfaction of the judgment. The motion is well-taken, but the Court raises concerns about the lack of proof of service on the Judgment Debtor (Michael Stevenson). The Court notes that the proof of service filed by the Judgment Creditor appears to be signed by an attorney named Dina Lapolt, but there is no substitution of attorney in the Court's records identifying her as counsel for the Judgment Debtor. The Court will inquire about the factual and legal bases for why service on Dina Lapolt is proper service on Defendant Stevenson. The Court grants the Judgment Creditor's request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-C. The Court finds that it has the authority to issue an order approving assignment of post-judgment interest as accrued on any unpaid judgment. The Judgment Creditor is owed a further $1,460,898.43 as of June 13, 2023. The Court will consider this motion at a hearing.
