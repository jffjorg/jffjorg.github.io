And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the opposition's request for relief from filing one court day late. The opposition concedes the mistake, but requests that it be considered nonetheless. The judge notes that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the Rodriguez case, but declined to de-publish it, meaning it can only be cited for its persuasive value. The judge also finds that the statute in question, section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), is unclear and has been interpreted differently by different courts. The judge seeks to harmonize the two precedents in the Rodriguez and Jensen cases, and notes that the parties have not completed their discovery proceedings as required by law.
