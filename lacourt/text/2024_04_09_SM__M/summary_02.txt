```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud cause of action. The judge finds that the complaint does not state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement and concealment, and that the plaintiff must allege further facts to establish all the elements of intentional fraud. The judge also finds that the complaint does not state a cause of action for negligent repair, and that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the economic loss rule. The judge gives the plaintiff 20 days to file an amended complaint.
