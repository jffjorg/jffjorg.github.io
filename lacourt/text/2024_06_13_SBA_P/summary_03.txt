Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant was intoxicated and speeding at the time of the collision, but the court finds that the allegations are insufficient to support punitive damages. The court also notes that there is no evidence of any aggravating circumstances that would make the risk of injury probable. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, and the court has not allowed leave to amend the pleading. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
