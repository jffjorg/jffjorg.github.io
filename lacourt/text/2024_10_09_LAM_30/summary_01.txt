Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are bound by arbitration agreements signed by a former trustee of the Menlo Family Trust, Lesile Klein. The court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiffs and Buchalter, a law firm that represented Klein. However, the court concludes that the arbitration agreement does not apply to the Franklin Henry Menlo Trust, which is the focus of the lawsuit.

The court also finds that the Parker Milliken Agreement, which was signed by Klein, does not identify the Menlo Trusts and therefore is not binding on the trust. The court exercises its authority under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 to refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement between the plaintiffs and Buchalter.

The court concludes that the parties need not share a contractual attorney-client relationship to support a claim for professional negligence. The court also finds that the defendants' equitable estoppel defense fails, as the plaintiffs are not claiming that the defendants represented them or the trust.

The court's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is denied.
