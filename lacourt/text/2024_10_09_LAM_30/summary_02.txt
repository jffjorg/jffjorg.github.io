```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the court action. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are bound by the arbitration agreements signed by Lesile Klein, the former trustee of the Menlo Family Trust, and that the court should compel arbitration and stay the action.

The court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiffs and Buchalter, but not between the plaintiffs and Parker Milliken. The court exercises its authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 to refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement between the plaintiffs and Buchalter.

The court also finds that the defendants' equitable estoppel defense fails because the plaintiffs are not claiming that the defendants represented them or the trust. Instead, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants committed malpractice by personally and knowingly representing Klein as he embezzled funds from the trust.

The court's ruling effectively denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the court action, allowing the case to proceed in court.
