And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to extend the time for filing discovery motions and compel further responses from the plaintiff. The judge grants the motion to extend the time for filing discovery motions, but continues the hearing on the motion to compel further responses so that the plaintiff can file an opposition. The judge finds that the discovery sought is necessary, and that the delay in filing the motion was due to a clerical error, which was corrected within one day. The judge also finds that reopening discovery will mildly prejudice the plaintiff, but that the length of time between the current and former trial dates weighs in the defendant's favor. Therefore, the judge finds an extension of discovery warranted.
