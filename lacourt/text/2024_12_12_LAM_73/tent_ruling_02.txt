II.DISCUSSION
 
A.     
Legal Standard 

 
Partition
is the procedure for segregating and terminating common interests in the same
parcel of property. (Summers v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th
138, 142.) The manner of partition may be in kind—i.e., physical division of
the property—or by sale. (Id.) If the parties so stipulate, the court
shall order a partition by sale with the proceeds divided among the parties in
accordance with their interests in the property as determined in an
interlocutory judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.820(a).)
The
procedure of a partition actions is as follows: (1) determine whether the
plaintiff has an interest in the property sufficient to maintain a partition
action (CCP § 872.710); (2) determine whether the plaintiff has waived her
right to partition (CCP § 872.710(b)); (3) entry of an interlocutory judgment
of partition (CCP § 872.720(a)) and determination of the manner of partition;
(4) appointment of a referee to divide or sell the property (CCP § 873.010(a));
(5) the referee sells the property (CCP §§ 873.670, 873.680); and (6) the
referee delivers a report and the Court confirms the sale (CCP §§ 873.710,
873.720(b), 873.730(a) and 873.790(a)).

Discussion
 
The Court appointed referee, Brandan
Anand, moves for
an order directing the Clerk of the Court to issue a Writ of Possession for the
property located at: 
 
The
auto repair building located on the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and West 71st
Street on the parcel commonly known as 6836 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90043-4667, also known as 6840 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043-4667 (the
“Property”).
 
On May 1, 2024, the Court entered interlocutory judgment to partition the Property and
appointed Brandon Anand as the referee (hereinafter, “Referee”) to manage and sell the Property.  
 
The Property is a mixed-use lot consisting of four buildings, one auto
repair building and three separate residential buildings. (Anand Decl., ¶ 2.) The
auto repair building, located on the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and West 71st
Street, is currently occupied by a tenant operating a mechanic’s shop called
Florence Transmission (the “Tenant”). (Ibid.) The Referee states that upon
information and belief, the Tenant does not have a written lease agreement. (Ibid.)
 
Between July to September, 2024, Referee made multiple attempts to
contact the Tenant, and the Tenant was non-responsive. (Anand Decl., ¶ 3.) On
August 29, Referee sent a letter to the Tenant, via USPS Certified Mail,
advising them that, pursuant to the Interlocutory Judgment, rent was to be paid
to Referee. (Anand Decl., ¶ 4.) The Tenant remained non-responsive and failed
to pay rent for September 2024. (Anand Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
On September 18, 2024, Referee posted a Three-Day Notice to Quit
on the Tenant’s building at the Property, and the same notice was mailed to the
Tenant on September 19, 2024. (Anand Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 3.) 
 
On October 21, 2024, Referee received a call from an individual
named Miguel Esparza who represented that he was the owner of Florence
Transmission. (Anand Decl., ¶ 8.) The Referee states he requested verification
that rent was paid for September and October, but Mr. Esparza has failed to
provide verification or a written lease. (Anand Decl., ¶ 8.) The Tenant failed
to pay rent for October and November 2024. (Anand Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
The
Referee argues removing Tenant at this point is necessary for multiple reasons:
(1) the non-performing tenant is reducing the value of the Property; (2)
Referee can lease the unit at market rate while selling the property, creating
value for both owners, and at the same time, increase the value at sale; (3)
Referee has a prospective Lessee that will be signing a lease for $3,600 per
month; (4) a written lease is needed for multiple reasons, including that it
will provide a better ability to show the property and ensure that it is not
being maintained in a hazardous condition. (Anand Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Therefore, the Referee requests an order
directing the Clerk of the Court to issue a Writ of Possession for the
Property, directing the Los Angeles County Sheriff to remove the Tenant and any
other occupants from the Property and deliver possession to the Referee.
 
No opposition was filed. “A party who
has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an
opportunity to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition
creates an inference that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿
“In such cases, the court may hear argument limited to a request for a
continuance of the hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written
opposition.” (Id.) “[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the
introduction of legal theories without prior notice to opposing counsel
and the court.” (Id.)
 
The
Interlocutory Order grants the Referee specific authority to terminate tenancies and
take possession of the Property to ensure the highest bid for sale. (Anand
Decl., Ex. 1 “Interlocutory Order” ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
The
court in its discretion may appoint a referee for sale. (Code Civ. Proc., §
873.020.) The referee may perform any acts necessary to exercise the authority
conferred by order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 873.060.)
 
C.C.P.
§872.120 provides, as follows: “In the conduct of the action, the court may
hear and determine all motions, reports, and accounts and may make any decrees
and orders necessary or incidental to carrying out the purposes of this title
and to effectuating its decrees and orders.”
 
The
Court finds that the Interlocutory
Order and Code of Civil Procedure provide grounds for the relief requested.
 
Accordingly,
Referee’s Motion for Order Directing the Issuance of a Writ of Possession is GRANTED.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Referee’s
Motion for Order Directing the Issuance of a Writ of Possession is GRANTED.
