And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Referee's motion for an order directing the issuance of a writ of possession for the property located at 6840 S. Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043. The property is a mixed-use lot consisting of four buildings, one of which is currently occupied by a tenant who has failed to pay rent. The Referee has made multiple attempts to contact the tenant, but they have remained non-responsive. The Judge finds that the Interlocutory Order and the Code of Civil Procedure provide grounds for the relief requested. The Judge notes that the failure to file opposition to the motion creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. As a result, the Referee's motion is granted, and the Clerk of the Court is directed to issue a writ of possession for the property, directing the Los Angeles County Sheriff to remove the tenant and any other occupants from the property and deliver possession to the Referee.
