And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend his complaint. The plaintiff had sought to add new information to his complaint, but the judge found that the motion was made too late and would cause unreasonable delay. The judge also found that the proposed amendments would not change the outcome of the case. The judge cited laws and precedents that support the denial of the motion, including the need to show both actual prejudice and inexcusable delay to overcome the policy of liberally granting amendments.
