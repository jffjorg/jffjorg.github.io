Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed in this case. The first motion is a motion to bifurcate the trial, filed by the defendants. The defendants argue that the two plaintiffs, Clare Weber and Anissa Rogers, have separate claims against them and that trying the two cases together would be unduly confusing to the jury and prejudicial to the defendants. The judge agrees with the defendants and grants the motion to bifurcate the trial. The judge finds that the risk of undue prejudice to the defendants outweighs the plaintiffs' interests in trying the two cases together.

The second motion is a motion for leave to amend the pleading, filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek to add a new allegation to Clare Weber's third cause of action for gender discrimination. The defendants argue that the amendment is untimely and would substantially change the claims asserted. The judge allows the amendment, finding that it does not add new facts or causes of action and that the defendants will suffer no prejudice.
