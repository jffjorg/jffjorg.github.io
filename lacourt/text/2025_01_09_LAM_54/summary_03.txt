And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Periodic Holdings, gave the defendant, Megan McMurray, over $35 million in shares of WPF Holdings as an investment in a medical start-up. However, the defendant has not performed any of the services or work promised in exchange for the investment and has refused to return the investment. The judge believes that if the defendant is allowed to sell or transfer these shares during the lawsuit, it would cause severe prejudice to the plaintiff. Since no opposition was received, the judge has granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, which means that the defendant is temporarily restrained from transferring or disposing of the shares until the lawsuit is resolved.
