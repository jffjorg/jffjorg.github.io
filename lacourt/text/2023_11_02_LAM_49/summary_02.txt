And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, ordering the action to be stayed pending the results of the arbitration. The plaintiff, Jacquelyn Ellis, alleges that the defendant, MVN Productions, LLC, interfered with her medical leave, retaliated against her for taking medical leave, and committed wage and hour violations. The defendant claims that Ellis signed an arbitration agreement as a condition of her employment and seeks to enforce it. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement between the parties and that Ellis has not presented sufficient evidence to challenge the agreement. The court orders the action to be stayed pending the results of the arbitration and sets a status review for November 1, 2024.
