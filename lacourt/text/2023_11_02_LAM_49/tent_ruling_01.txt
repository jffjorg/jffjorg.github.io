Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843. In analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. Where a plaintiff moves for summary judgment, the burden is to produce admissible evidence on each element of a “cause of action” entitling him or her to judgment. (CCP § 437c(p)(1); see Hunter v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. (1995) 37 CA4th 1282, 1287, 44 CR2d 335, 337 (citing text) (disapproved on other grounds by Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 C4th 826, 107 CR2d 841)).  This means that plaintiffs who bear the burden of proof at trial by a preponderance of evidence must produce evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not.  At that point, the burden shifts to defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(1)).II. AnalysisIn analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)Summary judgment is appropriate in a declaratory relief action when only legal issues are presented for the court's determination. (Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor & Associates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1401–1402.)Cross-Complainant Kahn seeks the following declaratory judgment:For a declaratory judgment that Kahn is entitled to the $269,984.74 held in his client trust account, and Deakin is not entitled to any of the $269,984.74, and that Kahn may disburse $260,984.74 to himself in payment of the balance of the attorney’s fees he earned pursuant to the Fee Agreement.  (Cross-Complaint, Prayer 1.)A. Moving Party’s BurdenKahn presents evidence that he and Deakin entered into a written Retainer Agreement on June 15, 2018, pursuant to which Deakin retained Kahn to represent him in a personal injury case involving injuries Deakin sustained in a motorcycle accident on June 6, 2018. (SSUMF 1.) The retainer provided that Kahn’s fee for his legal services would be thirty-three and one-third percent if the matter settled more than 120 days before the first date set for trial, or forty percent if the matter settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial. (SSUMF 2.) The retainer also provided that Kahn could recover his costs. (SSUMF 3).On August 16, 2018 Kahn filed an action on Deakin's behalf entitled Deakin v. Tassiopulos, LASC Case No. BC717886. (SSUMF 5.) Deakin advised Kahn of his desire to net between $875,000 and $1,000,000. (SSUMF 12.) As the case progressed, Deakin continued to lower his demand. (SSUMF 13.) Kahn advised Deakin that the gross amount he was offering would net Deakin less than his desired $875,000 to $1,000,000. (Id.) On or about August 23, 2011, Deakin’s case settled for $1,675,000, after Deakin authorized Kahn to accept the Code of Civil Procedure 998 offer made by the defendant in that amount. (SSUMF 7.) Deakin accepted the settlement with knowledge of the approximate amount he would net. (SSUMF 14.) Kahn deposited the funds into his client trust account. (SSUMF 8.) Because the case settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial (February 18, 2020), Kahn was entitled to a 40 percent fee and reimbursement of costs in the amount of $94,592.02. (SSUMF 9, 10.) Despite requests from Deakin, Kahn never agreed to reduce his fee. (SSUMF 11, 16.) On September 20, 2022, Kahn disbursed $644,021.60 to Deakin with Deakin's approval. (SSUMF 20.) On January 3, 2023, Kahn disbursed another $162,565.44 to Deakin to cover one of Deakin’s medical liens. (SSUMF 24.) On or about January 16, 2023, Kahn paid himself out of this trust account a total of $494,592.02 ($400,000 for fees and $94,592.92 for costs). (SSUMF 23.) Therefore, there remains $269,984.74 in contested fees in the trust account. (SSUMF 23.) Considering this evidence, Kahn has met his initial burden to establish he is entitled to declaratory relief. This switches the burden to Deakin to establish a triable issue.B. Opposing Party’s BurdenThe opposition to a motion for summary judgment or adjudication must consist of (1) a memorandum in opposition, (2) a separate statement in opposition, and (3) evidence in opposition. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350(e).) The separate statement in opposition “must unequivocally state whether [each] fact is ‘disputed’ or ‘undisputed.’” (Id., Rule 3.1350(f)(2).)In opposition, Cross-Defendant filed a document titled “Cross-Defendant Derek Deakin’s Responses and Supporting Evidence To Robert Kahn’s Separate Statement in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment.” (See 09/08/23 Filing.) While it resembles a separate statement, if fails to identify which facts are disputed or undisputed. Moreover, Deakin has not submitted a memorandum of points and authorities. He has likewise not submitted any admissible evidence in support of his opposition. “Without a separate statement of undisputed facts with references to supporting evidence in the form of affidavits or declarations, it is impossible for the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of disputed facts.” (Lewis v. Cnty. of Sacramento (2001) 93 Cal. App. 4th 107, 116.) “[T]he court does not have the burden to conduct a search for facts that [a party] failed to bring out.” (Id.) When a moving party makes the required prima facie showing, the opposing party's failure to comply with this requirement may, in the court's discretion, constitute a sufficient ground for granting the motion. (CCP § 437c(b)(3); see Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. (2009) 170 Cal. App. 4th 554, 568.) A party seeking to avoid summary judgment “must produce substantial responsive evidence sufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact on the merits…” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App. 4th 151, 163 [bare assertion that moving party “fabricated” evidence is insufficient to avoid summary judgment])(emphasis added). And the opposing party cannot controvert the moving party's declarations by evidence “based on speculation, imagination, guess work, or mere possibilities.” (Doe v. Salesian Soc. (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 474, 481.)Based upon the current record, Deakin has failed to properly demonstrate any triable issue of material fact which would warrant a denial of this pending motion for summary judgment – which on its face, appears to be meritorious.Be that as it may, where the opposition is procedurally defective, “the proper response in most instances…is to give the opposing party an opportunity to file a proper separate statement rather than entering judgment against that party based on its procedural error.” (Parkview Villas Assn., Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (2005) 133 Cal. App. 4th 1197, 1211.)As such, if Deakin is able to adequately articulate the possibility of filing a proper opposition which actually could raise a triable issue of material fact, then this Court will consider continuing this motion to allow same.  Upon such an adequate showing, Plaintiff must file an opposition that complies with Rule of Court 3.1350 and CCP section 437c. This necessarily includes filing a memorandum of points and authorities, admissible evidence, and a separate statement that references the admissible evidence and identifies which facts are disputed or undisputed.If Deakin is unable to make such a showing at the hearing, the motion for summary judgment shall be GRANTED in its entirety.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   November 2, 2023 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
