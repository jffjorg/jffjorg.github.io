Significant Statements:
  - "The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial."

```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Cross-Complainant's Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety, or alternatively, continues the motion to a date TBD at the hearing. The ruling states that the Cross-Complainant has met his initial burden to establish he is entitled to declaratory relief, and the burden shifts to the Cross-Defendant to establish a triable issue. The Cross-Defendant has failed to properly demonstrate any triable issue of material fact, and the motion is granted due to the procedural defects in the opposition.
