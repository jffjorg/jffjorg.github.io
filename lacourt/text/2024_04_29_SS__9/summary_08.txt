And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the key points discussed during the hearing. The Judge grants the petition and allows the Petitioner to change their name. However, the Judge emphasizes the importance of the new name being clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the new name is not satisfactory, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
