Judge's Tentative Ruling:

This tentative ruling concerns the petition of the Petitioner to change their name. The Petitioner's proposed decree needs to be reviewed for spelling and legibility. If the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
