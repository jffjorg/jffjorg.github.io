The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and outlines the requirements for reviewing the proposed decree. The Petitioner must ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
