The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCP00202, setting a hearing date for April 29, 2024. The Petitioner seeks to change their name, and the judge has granted the petition.

If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing.
