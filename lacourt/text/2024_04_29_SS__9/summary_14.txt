The tentative ruling states that the petition for a name change has been granted. The Petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, the Judge emphasizes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
