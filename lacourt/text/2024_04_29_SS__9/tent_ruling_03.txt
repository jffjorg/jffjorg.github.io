 Case Number:  24STCP00099    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  9 The petition
is denied on the ground that no proof of publication has been filed.  The Court has already continued the hearing
once to allow Petitioner additional time to file proof of publication, but
Petitioner has nonetheless failed to file proof of publication.  The petition is dismissed without
prejudice.  Petitioner may file a new
petition and file proof of publication.  
 
The petition
is denied on the additional ground that Petitioner has failed to provide any
form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for
Probation/the Court to run a criminal history assessment.  Petitioner must provide Probation/the Court
with some form of identification verified by a fingerprint to enable
Probation/the Court to run a criminal history assessment.  
 
On March 4,
2024, the Court continued the instant hearing for Petitioner to enable
Petitioner to pursue one of various options to provide sufficient information
for the Court to run a criminal history assessment.  However, Petitioner failed to do so.  
 
Accordingly,
the petition is also denied and dismissed without prejudice on this
ground.
