And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the petition for a name change, and the proposed decree will be reviewed for spelling and legibility. If the new name is correctly spelled and legible, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
