 Case Number:  24STCP00693    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history assessment that
the Court’s Clerk’s Office has run through CLETS reveals that Petitioner has an
active outstanding warrant: "Sheriff’s Office North Charleston, false
information. Warrant #w357067666 – South Carolina.”
 
Petitioner must clear the outstanding
warrant and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the petition
for name change.  The OSC and hearing on the petition for name change are
continued to July 8, 2024 at 9:30 am.  No later than two weeks before the
continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must file written proof that the
outstanding warrant has been fully addressed and resolved.  Failure to do
so will result in the OSC and hearing on the petition being taken off calendar
without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof that all
outstanding warrants have been cleared.  
 
The Name Change Court Clerk is to run
a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the
warrant has been cleared.
 
The Court Clerk is to give notice to
all parties.
