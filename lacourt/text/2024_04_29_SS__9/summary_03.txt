And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition on two grounds. First, the Petitioner failed to file proof of publication, despite being given additional time to do so. Second, the Petitioner failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner was previously given an opportunity to provide the necessary information, but failed to do so. As a result, the petition is denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Court Clerk is instructed to give notice.
