And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the Judge concerns the petition to change name by the Petitioner. The Petitioner must carefully review the new name on the proposed decree to ensure it is correctly spelled and legibly written. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
