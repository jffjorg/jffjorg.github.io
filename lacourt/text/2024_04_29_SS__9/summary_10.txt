Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the name change petition to May 6, 2024, to allow the Name Change Clerk to complete the criminal history assessment. The Judge is concerned that the Clerk did not accurately assess the Petitioner's criminal history and did not properly mark the form. The Judge orders the Clerk to remove the "unable to identify" notation and to check off either "Petitioner is required to register as a sex offender" or "Petitioner is not a registered sex offender" on the form.
