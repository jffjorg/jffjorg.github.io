And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a response to a petition to change name filed by the Petitioner. The ruling states that the Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
