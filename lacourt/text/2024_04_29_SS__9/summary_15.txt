Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the name change petition. The petitioner has failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for the court to run a criminal history assessment. The court has ordered the petitioner to provide identification verified by a fingerprint, and has given three options for the petitioner to do so: providing a California driver's license number or California ID number, providing a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the name change clerk to obtain instructions for fingerprinting. The petition is continued to July 8, 2024, to allow the petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the petitioner fails to provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
