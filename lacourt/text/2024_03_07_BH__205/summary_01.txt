The Court disagrees with the defendant's argument that the elevation change was trivial and concludes that reasonable minds can differ on whether the open and obvious defense should prevail as a matter of law. The Court also finds that there are triable issues as to the adequacy of the warning signs and the dangerous condition caused by the vertical shim.
