Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to add a request for punitive damages under the CLRA. The Plaintiff's original complaint sought injunctive relief under the CLRA and now seeks to add a request for damages. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's basis for amendment is supported by Civil Code section 1782, subdivision (d), which allows an action for injunctive relief to be commenced without compliance with subdivision (a). The Court also finds that the Plaintiff complied with the notice requirement under subdivision (d). Therefore, the motion is granted.
