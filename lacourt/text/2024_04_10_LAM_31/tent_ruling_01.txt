MOTION
TO VACATE THE DISMISSAL AND MOTION TO ENFORCE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ENTER
JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On November 19, 2020, Plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company, filed a Complaint against Defendants, Ahmad Martin (“Martin”)
and John Ruffin (“Ruffin”) for subrogation recovery in the sum of $26,155.80.
 
            On April 5,
2021, Ruffin was dismissed from this action.
 
            On June 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed the parties’ Stipulation for Settlement and Entry of
Judgment (“Stipulation”).  On the same
day, the court dismissed the case without prejudice and retained jurisdiction
to enforce the terms of the settlement and enter judgment in the event of
default. 
 
            On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Vacate the Dismissal and Motion to
Enforce a Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment against Martin.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.¿ If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿ 
 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion,
the trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms
of a settlement agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia
Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret
the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182
Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first
establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the
parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court. [Citation.]”¿ (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that
a letter confirming the essential terms of a settlement agreement was not a
“writing signed by the parties” sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
Section 664.6].)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction 
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special proceeding
terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913,
917.)  “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).) 
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under
section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be express, not implied
from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting
Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).) 
 
Here, the parties signed a Stipulation containing the
parties’ agreement for the court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the Stipulation and enter
judgment in the event of an uncured default.  (Stipulation ¶¶ 14,¿16.)  Prior to the
dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and
submitted to the court.  (Ibid.) 
On July 14, 2022, the court dismissed the entire case pursuant to the
Stipulation.  The court has jurisdiction
to enforce the terms of the Stipulation.
 
B. Entry of Judgment 
 
The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff and Martin agree to settle
this matter for a discounted amount of $16,244.02 plus costs of suit and
prejudgment interest from date of loss, so long as Martin timely makes payments
in the following manner:  Martin’s
insurance carrier is to pay $46,244.02 (the policy limit available to Martin), and
Martin shall pay the balance of $2,000.00 by making payments of $50.00 per
month until the balance of $2,000 is paid in full.  (Stipulation, ¶¶ 4, 6, 9.)  All parties
signed the Stipulation. 
 
The Stipulation also provides that in the event Martin fails
to make timely payments, Martin will have a 10-day grace period for payment of
any installment.  Plaintiff must give Martin
written notice of the default and ten (10) days from the date of notice to cure
the default.  Should Martin fail to make
a payment, Plaintiff may immediately cause judgment to be entered for the full
amount of $26,155.80, less any payments made to date of the breach.  (Ibid.
at ¶¶ 9, 11.)  
 
Martin’s insurance carrier issued the payment of $14,224.02.  Thereafter, Martin made a total of $200.00 in
monthly payments then defaulted. 
Plaintiff provided written notice of default by sending Past Due Notices
on 6/07/2023, 9/06/2023, and 12/06/2023. 
(Mahfouz Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. B.)  Martin
has not remedied the default.  (Mahfouz
Decl., ¶ 10.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff now
seeks an order vacating the dismissal and entering judgment against Martin in
the sum of $16,220.01, consisting of $26,155.80 in damages, $2,720.43 in prejudgment
interest (at the annual rate of 7%), $1,174.67 in attorney fees, $593.22 in
costs, less $14,424.02 in payments made under the Stipulation.   
 
Plaintiff substantiates the damages sought.  Plaintiff sent written notice to Martin to
cure the default.  (See Mahfouz Decl.,
Ex. B.)  Martin has not cured the default.  Plaintiff has also filed a Memorandum of
Costs to support the request for $593.22 in costs.  However, Plaintiff improperly seeks to
recover attorney fees.  Contrary to
Plaintiff’s contention, the Stipulation does not permit Plaintiff to recover
reasonable attorney’s fees.  The
Stipulation states: “Each side shall bear their own costs and attorney fees
relating to this matter, except as stipulated above.”  (Stipulation, ¶ 18.)  The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff may
recover costs.  (See Stipulation, ¶ 5.)  There is no other language regarding
attorney’s fees.  Accordingly, the court
is inclined to enter judgment in the sum of $15,045.34 (the judgment requested
less attorney fees of $1,174.67).
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is CONTINUED to April 24,
2024.  Plaintiff is to file an amended
proposed judgment no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
 
Moving party to give notice.
