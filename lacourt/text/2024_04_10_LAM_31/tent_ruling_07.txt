DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Mokhtar Jabli
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Jungle
Kerry, Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is an
unlawful detainer action.   On February 8,
2023, Plaintiff, Jungle Kerry, Inc., filed a Judicial Council Form Complaint
against Defendant, Mokhtar Jabli, for remaining in  possession of the real property at 9010 Hopen
Place, Los Angeles, California 90069 after failing to pay rent.  Plaintiff served Defendant with a 3-day
notice to pay rent or quit.
 
            On February
23, 2024, Defendant filed this Demurrer to the Complaint.
 
            On April 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant for unnecessary delay
occasioned by the filing of this demurrer.
 
Defendant did not reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where
the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].)
Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿ In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿If the cause of action is based
in statute, the facts supporting each statutory requirement must be
specifically pled. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214
Cal.App.3d 590, 604.)
            A demurrer
may be brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”¿(Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
            Where the
complaint contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend.¿ (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden
is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Ibid.)¿
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant brings this demurrer on two grounds: (1) the
Complaint does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1166, and (2)
the Complaint fails to state a cause of action. 
 
The arguments are not well taken.  Defendant utterly fails to explain how the
Complaint does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1166.  Defendant states only that the “notice to
quit, summons and complaints must be consistent.”  (Dem., p. 4.) 
To the extent Defendant is implying there are inconsistencies across the
notice to quiet, summons, complaint, Defendant does not so demonstrate.  Indeed, a review of those documents proves
otherwise.  Defendant’s second argument
is even less developed and deserves no further consideration.
 
V.          CONCLUSION
            
The demurrer is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to serve and
file his Answer to the Complaint within 5 days of this order.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section
128.7(b)(1) is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
