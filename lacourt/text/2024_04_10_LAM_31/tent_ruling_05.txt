DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
The Regents of the University of California
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Arami
Cheyenne Walker
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This case
arises from the alleged unauthorized use of photographic images.  On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff, Arami Cheyenne
Walker,[1]
filed a Complaint against Defendant, The Regents of the University of
California (erroneously sued as Board of Regents, University of California),
alleging causes of action for: (1) Appropriation (Civil Code section 3344); (2)
Breach of Contract; and (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.¿ 
 
As alleged, Plaintiff was a student University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  On May
28, 2015, Plaintiff was approached by a photographer at UCLA to take images of
her.  Plaintiff agreed and the
photographer, Elena Zhukova, took a few images and asked for Plaintiff to sign
a release. The release authorized use of the images so long as they were not
defamatory. Years later, on March 20, 2020, Plaintiff learned that UCLA Giving was
using her photographic image as part of a funding campaign in response to Covid-19.
 Plaintiff claims this use of her
likeness was unauthorized and defamatory within the meaning of the release.
 
            Defendant
demurred to all three causes of action in the Complaint.  On September 12, 2023, the Court sustained
the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend.
 
            On September
26, 2023, Plaintiff timely filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC).  
Defendant demurred to the FAC.  On December 15, 2023, the court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer.  The court granted
leave to amend as to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.  Leave to amend was denied as to Plaintiff’s appropriation
and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.
 
            On January
3, 2024, Plaintiff timely filed the Second Amended Complaint (SAC).   The
SAC asserts causes of action for Breach of Contract (Promissory Estoppel), and
an “Appropriation and Invasion of Privacy 2022” claim. 
 
            On February
5, 2024, Defendant filed a Demurrer to the SAC and concurrently filed a Motion
to Strike portions of the SAC.
            
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant replied.[2]
 
II.        DISCUSSION RE DEMURRER  
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect
to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general
or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America v.
Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Where the complaint
contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be
overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend.  (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of
successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading
can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
B.      Application
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            Defense counsel has complied with
the meet and confer requirement. (See Declaration of Jason Scupine, ¶¶ 4-6.)
 
            Analysis
 
            Defendant demurs to the SAC on the
ground that the breach of contract claim fails to state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action.  Given that the court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC, the court compares the allegations
in the FAC and the SAC.
 
Breach of Contract
– Promissory Estoppel 
 
            In sustaining the demurrer to the
breach of contract claim, the court noted that Plaintiff had not alleged
anything new to show the use of her image was defamatory.   The
sole issue to be decided is whether Plaintiff now states a claim for promissory
estoppel.
 
            The elements of a claim for
promissory estoppel are: (1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2)
reliance by the party to whom the promise is made; (3) [the] reliance must be
both reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must
be injured by his reliance.”  (Joffe
v. City of Huntington Park (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 492, 513.)
 
            “Promissory estoppel is a doctrine
which employs equitable principles to satisfy the requirement that
consideration must be given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced. Because
promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine to allow enforcement of a promise
that would otherwise be unenforceable, courts are given wide discretion in its
application.”  (Id. [cleaned up].)  
 
            Plaintiff promissory estoppel claim
is predicated on Defendant’s promise to discontinue use of her image.  The promise was made on March 25, 2022.  The court found that Plaintiff had not
sufficiently pled the fourth element: injury from reliance.  Here, Plaintiff now alleges that she relied
on Defendant’s promise to not use her image and thereafter deleted all her
records related to Defendant’s use of her image in 2020.  (SAC, ¶ 16.) 
Upon learning Defendant had not honored their promise, Plaintiff “spent seven
months recovering the images and emails related to the case. The process of
recovering the evidence related to the case has caused Plaintiff to feel
anxiety, anger, and sadness.”  (SAC, ¶ 17.)  Further, Plaintiff “has spoken to two
different therapists based on experiences of rage, exhaustion, humiliation, and
distress. These therapists have also helped Plaintiff through the process of
collecting and recovering the evidence related to the case.”  (SAC, ¶ 18.) 
“Plaintiff has seen Dr. Jenna Beam multiple times during the legal
process to help with changes in sleep, menstruation, and emotional harm
inflicted by the Defendant’s actions on March 12, 2022.”  (SAC, ¶ 19.) 

 
            Defendant argues the allegations of
the SAC still not dot not satisfy the injury element of a promissory estoppel
claim because damages for mental suffering and emotional distress are not
recoverable in an action for breach of an ordinary commercial contract.  For this proposition, Defendant cites Erlich
v. Meneses (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 558.  Erlich is distinguishable.  Erlich concerned a breach of
contract of the defective construction of a house.  The Supreme Court specifically held that “available
damages for defective construction are limited to the cost of repairing the
home, including lost of use or relocation expenses, or the diminution in
value.”  (Id. at p. 561.)  
 
            The present issue does not concern a
contract, let alone a contract for the construction of a home.  This is a promissory estoppel claim.  “The Courts of Appeal likewise have treated
promissory estoppel and contract claims as fundamentally different.”  (Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc. v. CMC
Fabricators, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 230, 244 (Douglas E. Barnhart).)  “Because the doctrine [of promissory
estoppel] is equitable in nature, the court should have broad judicial
discretion to fashion remedies in the interests of justice.”  (Toscano v. Greene Music (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 685, 693.)  A plaintiff may
recover damages solely under an equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel when
there is no contract.  (Kajima/Ray
Wilson v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2000)
23 Cal.4th 305, 317.)  However, a promise
enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel may be appropriately
treated as a contract for the purpose of fashioning an appropriate remedy.  (Douglas E. Barnhart, supra,
211 Cal.App.4th at p. 248.)
 
Here, the SAC
pleads an agreement whereby Defendant promised to discontinue using Plaintiff’s
image.  Relying on Defendant’s promise,
Plaintiff disposed of her files concerning Defendant’s use of her image in 2020.
 Upon learning Defendant was still using
her image in 2022, Plaintiff suffered mental distress and bodily harm.  (See SAC, ¶ 19.)  That Plaintiff suffered, in part, emotional
distress is not fatal to her promissory estoppel claim.  Rather, a court is empowered to fashion an
appropriate remedy for Plaintiff’s injury. 
Plaintiff pleads a cause of action for promissory estoppel.  
 
III.       DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO STRIKE
 
A.   
Legal Standard
 
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322(b).)¿ On a motion to strike, the court
may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a
motion to strike are limited to matters appearing on the face of the challenged
pleading or matters which must or may be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a);
Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d
17, 20.) 
 
B.    
Discussion
 
Defendant moves
for an order striking the “Appropriation and Invasion of Privacy 2022” claim on
the grounds that Plaintiff was not given leave to amend her appropriation claim
or add a claim for invasion of privacy. 
The court agrees.  The court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend the
appropriation claim.  (See Minute Order,
12/15/23.) The court’s order also did not state that Plaintiff could add
further causes of action.  Absent that order,
Plaintiff must seek leave of court.
 
Plaintiff argues her
appropriation claim is not barred because it is based on Defendant’s conduct in
2022 which the court’s December 15, 2023 does not address.  Plaintiff is correct.  The court’s December 15, 2023 order does not
address her appropriation claim in connection to Defendant’s conduct in 2022.  In effect, however, Plaintiff seeks to add a
separate misappropriation claim for other conduct.  Plaintiff must seek leave of court.
 
V.          CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Demurrer to the SAC is OVERRULED.
 
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff may seek leave of court to amend her pleading.
 
Defendant to give notice.
