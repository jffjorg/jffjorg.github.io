On February 7, 2023, a jury entered verdicts in favor of Plaintiffs DONE! Ventures, LLC (“Done!”) and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. (“Coastal”), and against Defendants Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P. (“ESPA”), and Theta Holding IV, Inc. (“Theta”), for Plaintiffs’ claims for interference with contract, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and breach of contract. Done! now seeks to compel further responses to its judgment debtor discovery (requests for production and special interrogatories) propounded on Defendants.  Defendants had objected that the discovery was improper to the extent there wasn’t a final judgment. In their Opposition, Defendants only argue that they were not properly served with the Motions because service was by email when there is no stipulation for electronic service between the parties. This lacks merit because Defendants had notice of the Motions and they were not prejudiced by email service.  In fact, they filed their Opposition before the deadline to do so. Because there is no substantive Opposition, there is an inference that the Motions have merit. Therefore, the Motions to Compel Further Responses are granted.  Further responses are to be provided within 20 days.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
