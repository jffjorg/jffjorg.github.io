And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute between Plaintiff Roland Esparza and Defendants Conagra Brands, Inc., The Vons Companies, Inc., Full-Fill Industries, LLC, and BASF Corporation. The Plaintiff alleges that he was injured by toxic butter spray manufactured, distributed, or sold by the Defendants.

The Judge has ruled that the Defendant Full-Fill Industries, LLC's motion to quash service of summons will be continued for the purposes of jurisdictional discovery. The Plaintiff must demonstrate that the Defendant has sufficient contacts with California to justify the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction.

The Judge has also ruled that the Defendant BASF Corporation's motion for determination of good faith settlement will be granted. The Defendant has tendered a confidential payment to the Plaintiff in exchange for a release of all claims, and the Court finds that the settlement was made in good faith. However, the Court notes that proof of service must be provided at the hearing for the settlement to be officially approved.
