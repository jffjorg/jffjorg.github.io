And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

On February 7, 2023, a jury delivered verdicts in favor of Plaintiffs DONE! Ventures, LLC and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. and against Defendants Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc. The Plaintiffs are now seeking to compel further responses to their judgment debtor discovery, which the Defendants had objected to, citing the lack of a final judgment. The Judge has reviewed the Opposition filed by the Defendants and finds it to lack merit, as the Defendants had notice of the Motions and were not prejudiced by email service, despite the absence of a stipulation for electronic service between the parties. The Judge grants the Motions to Compel Further Responses and orders the Defendants to provide further responses within 20 days.
