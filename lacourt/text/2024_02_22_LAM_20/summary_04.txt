The Court has granted motions to compel discovery responses by the Defendant, and now seeks to punish the Plaintiffs for their failure to comply with the discovery rules. The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiffs' actions amount to a misuse of the discovery process, and that terminating sanctions are appropriate. The Court has stricken the pleadings of the Plaintiffs with respect to the Defendant, but has not awarded additional monetary sanctions.
