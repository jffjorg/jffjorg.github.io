And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of the defendant, The Ronald Marshall Trust and Cheron Turner Robinson, to the entire complaint of the plaintiff, Bruce Talbot. The plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief are all lacking in merit. The agreement between the plaintiff and Ronald Marshall is not an enforceable contract because it does not obligate the plaintiff to do anything, and there is no consideration by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent inducement are also insufficient, as they fail to specify how the defendant misrepresented any material fact. The plaintiff's claims for unjust enrichment and declaratory relief are also unnecessary and superfluous. The court grants the defendant 20 days' leave to amend.
