And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff T.S.'s motion to compel further responses and documents from defendant Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (Watchtower) in part. The motion is granted as to requests for production Nos. 3-6, 10-19, 22-35, 41-46, 48, and 54. Watchtower is ordered to serve further verified responses with complete representations of inability to comply to these requests within 30 days. Additionally, Watchtower is ordered to serve a privilege log identifying documents withheld subject to its objections and including sufficient factual information for plaintiff to evaluate the objections.

The basis for the motion is that Watchtower's responses to these requests were inadequate and incomplete. Specifically, Watchtower did not provide complete representations of inability to comply, failed to identify documents being withheld subject to its objections, and did not provide sufficient factual information for plaintiff to evaluate its objections. The court finds that these responses do not comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure and, therefore, the motion is granted.
