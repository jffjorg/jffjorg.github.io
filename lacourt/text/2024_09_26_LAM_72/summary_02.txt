And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Stephenson S. Alegre's motion to set aside the default entered against him on May 13, 2024. The default was entered due to Defendant's mistake and inadvertence, as he did not understand what was happening at the April 10, 2024 Case Management Conference (CMC) and therefore did not understand that he needed to file an answer. Defendant's declaration creates a prima facie showing that he defaulted in this case due to mistake and inadvertence, and Defendant intended to defend the case. The Judge disagrees with Plaintiff's argument that Defendant's failure to timely respond to the First Amended Complaint and the fact that Defendant only retained an attorney days before the second CMC shows calculated and systemic carelessness, and instead finds that it appears to be the inadvertent result of Defendant's diagnosed bipolar disorder and stimulant use. The Judge grants permissive relief from default under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473 (b).
