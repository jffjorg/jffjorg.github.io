And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by Defendant TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. against Plaintiffs Tadeh Davtian, Lauren Gordon, and Gabriella Mitry. The Plaintiffs allege violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) and seek declaratory relief, but the Court has found that they do not allege sufficient facts to support their claims. Specifically, the Court has found that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not concern the investigative consumer reporting agency's own violations, but rather the landlord's violations of statutory requirements imposed on the person requesting an investigative report. As a result, the Court has sustained the demurrer to all causes of action against TransUnion and granted leave to amend the complaint. The Court has also denied the Plaintiffs' requests for judicial notice of two complaints in other actions.
