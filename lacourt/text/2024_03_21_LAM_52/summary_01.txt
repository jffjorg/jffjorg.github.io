And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Plaintiff Ugo O. Asobie's motion to compel the deposition of non-party Kevin Dancer and to compel production of documents. The Plaintiff did not meet his burden of showing he made a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. Additionally, the Plaintiff did not show an effort to resolve disputes over document requests. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not acknowledge Universal's statement that Dancer no longer works for UPS and did not make a serious attempt to resolve the disputes over the deposition and document requests.
