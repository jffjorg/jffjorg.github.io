And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Jeffrey Ito's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that Ito did not properly serve defendants Michele Morgan, Carol Folt, Yannis Yortsos, and the University of Southern California with the motion, and did not provide sufficient notice of the motion to the defendants and the court. Specifically, the court found that electronic service on Kjar, McKenna & Stockalper LLP, the law firm representing the defendants, was not a valid method of service since the defendants had not made a general appearance in the case. Additionally, the court found that Ito did not file and serve the motion at least 16 court days before the hearing, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. As a result, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.
