The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion. 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES FROM POTOMAC RIVER PRODUCTIONS, INC.
Plaintiff Dan Sackheim
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Potomac
River Productions, Inc. (“Potomac”) to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, numbers 1-10, 13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27-29, 31, 33, and
34-42, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Potomac in
the amount of $5,469. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 1-10 because, given the specially defined term “DESCRIBE IN DETAIL,”
those interrogatories contain subparts and are compound in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure 2030.060, subdivision (f), and therefore Potomac’s objections
on the ground that they are compound are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 13, 18, 27-29, 31, and 33-38 because the answers to those
interrogatories are not evasive or incomplete. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, number
19 because Potomac’s objections to that interrogatory are not without merit
since the interrogatory calls for information that is protected by the
work-product protection.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 21-22 and 39-42 because the answers to those interrogatories are
evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
In light of the mixed results
of the court’s ruling, the court finds that the circumstances presented make
the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Potomac. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES FROM SKYDANCE TELEVISION, LLC
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant
Skydance Television, LLC (“Skydance”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, numbers 21-22 and 39-42, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Skydance in the amount of $5,469. 
(Nov. 9, 2023 Notice of Partial Withdrawal, p. 2:6-9.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Skydance’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 21-22 and 39-42 because the answers to those interrogatories are
evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court finds that the
circumstances presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore
denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Skydance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES FROM GENRE ARTS, INC.
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling defendant Genre Arts, Inc. (“Genre Arts”) to serve
further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 21-22
and 39-42, and (2) awarding sanctions
in favor of Plaintiff and against Genre Arts in the amount of $5,469.  (Nov. 9, 2023, Notice of Partial Withdrawal,
p. 2:6-9.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Genre Arts’ further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 21-22 and 39-42 because the answers to those interrogatories are
evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court finds that the
circumstances presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore
denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Genre Arts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
