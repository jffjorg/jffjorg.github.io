[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  special interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion
on March 7, 2023, moving the court for an order (1) compelling defendant John
Stich (“Defendant”) to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
Set One, without objections, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $1,660.
The court
finds that Plaintiff has not presented evidence showing that Defendant was
served with the pending motion. 
Plaintiff did not attach a proof of service to the motion, and although
Plaintiff filed a proof of service on March 8, 2023 establishing service on
Defendant of other various discovery motions, that proof of service does not
state that Defendant was served with the papers filed in connection with the
pending motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories.  Moreover, Defendant did
not file an opposition with the court. 
The court
therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion in order to give Plaintiff an opportunity to serve Defendant with the moving
papers and to give Defendant an opportunity to file an opposition.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez’s motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories is continued to January 8, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department
53. 
            The court orders plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez (1) to serve a notice of this ruling on defendant John Stich, and to
file a proof of service of the notice of ruling with the court, and (2) to
serve defendant John Stich with all the papers filed in support of the motion
to compel responses to special interrogatories in compliance with the Code of
Civil Procedure, and to file a proof of service with the court by no later than
December 8, 2023. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 30, 2023
