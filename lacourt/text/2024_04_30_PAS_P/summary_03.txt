Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The defendant had served the plaintiff with discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, requests for admission, and special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests in a timely manner, but eventually responded after a meet and confer letter was sent. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were late, but that the defendant did not show that the late responses were done in bad faith. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motions to compel responses and declined to award sanctions against the plaintiff.
