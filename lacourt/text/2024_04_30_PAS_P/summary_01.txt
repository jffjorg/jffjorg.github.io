And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by San Gabriel Valley Medical Center (the defendant) to the first amended complaint of Hong Gan (the plaintiff). The plaintiff has sued the defendant for medical malpractice, alleging that the defendant took a urine sample by way of a catheter during an involuntary mental health hold. The defendant has argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and that the doctrine of res judicata applies, as the plaintiff has previously brought two similar lawsuits against the defendant, which were both dismissed.

The judge has determined that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The judge has also determined that the doctrine of res judicata applies, as the same causes of action were involved in the two prior lawsuits and the plaintiff was a party to both actions. The judge has concluded that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the case is dismissed.
