Ceballos alleges he was injured in a car accident with a City employee on
the 134 West freeway in Pasadena. On February 27, 2024, Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Authority filed the instant motion to compel responses to the
Requests for Production, Set One. Plaintiff filed an omnibus opposition on
March 21, 2024. Defendant filed an omnibus reply on April 23, 2024.          Before the Court is Defendant LACMA’s
motion for an order compelling response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One. Because the evidence shows Plaintiff responded, the motion
is denied.II.      LEGAL
STANDARD“Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the
action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) “If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP § 2025.480(a).)“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.480(j).)III.     ANALYSIS          Defendant served Ceballos with Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One on October 27, 2023 via email. Responses were due November
28, 2023. On December 27, 2023, Counsel for Defendant sent a meet and confer
letter inquiring after the discovery responses and extending the deadline to
respond to January 27, 2024. (Ortega Decl. ¶ 7, referencing Exh. 2.) No
responses were received by this date. However, responses to the discovery were
served on March 6, 2024. (See Opposition p. 2: 20-22.)          In opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel provides an explanation
of the late discovery responses. She declares that in January of 2024, the
attorney handling this case left the firm unexpectedly. (Jacobson Decl. ¶ 8.)
She declares that she joined the firm the following month and inherited the
case. (Jacobson Decl. ¶ 9.) She declares on March 20, 2024, she then let
defense counsel know that discovery responses had been served. (Jacobson Decl.
¶ 10.) Defense counsel indicated that he would call her back and he did not.
(Jacobson Decl. ¶ 11.) She followed up several times and did not get a clear
response. (Jacobson Decl. ¶¶ 12-14.)          As Plaintiff did provide responses, the motion is DENIED.           B. SanctionsThe Court declines to award sanctions to either
party, as the motion was neither made nor opposed in bad faith.IV.     CONCLUSION

motion for an order compelling response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One is denied.           Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice.                Dated: 4/29/24                                               _______________________________                                                                                   JARED D. MOSES

OF THE SUPERIOR COURT2.I.        INTRODUCTIONIn this personal injury action, Plaintiff Angel
Ceballos alleges he was injured in a car accident with a City employee on the
134 West freeway in Pasadena. On February 27, 2024, Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Authority filed the instant motion to deem requests for admission
admitted. Plaintiff filed an omnibus opposition on March 21, 2024. Defendant filed
an omnibus reply on April 23, 2024.Before the Court is a
motion by Defendant LACMA to deem matters admitted. LACMA served Ceballos with
a set of Requests for Admission on October 27, 2023. The motion is opposed, and
code-compliant responses have been served. The motion for an order deeming
matters admitted is DENIED.II.      LEGAL
STANDARD“If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply: (a) The party to whom the
requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) The party's failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (b) The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (c) The court shall make this
order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280.)          III.     ANALYSISi. Motion LACMA presents evidence
that on October 27, 2023, it served Ceballos by email with Requests for
Admission, Set One. (Exh. 1 to Ortega Decl.) Responses were due November 28,
2023. On December 27, 2023, Counsel for Defendant sent a meet and confer letter
inquiring after the discovery responses and extending the deadline to respond
to January 27, 2024. (Ortega Decl. ¶ 7, referencing Exh. 2.) However, responses
to the discovery were served on March 6, 2024. (See Opposition p. 2: 20-22.)          In opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel provides an explanation
of the late discovery responses. She declares that in January of 2024, the
attorney handling this case left the firm unexpectedly. (Jacobson Decl. ¶ 8.)
She declares that she joined the firm the following month and inherited the
case. (Jacobson Decl. ¶ 9.) She declares on March 20, 2024, she then let
defense counsel know that discovery responses had been served. (Jacobson Decl.
¶ 10.) Defense counsel indicated that he would call her back and he did not.
(Jacobson Decl. ¶ 11.) She followed up several times and did not get a clear
response. (Jacobson Decl. ¶¶ 12-14.)Based
on the above evidence, LACMA has established that Ceballos was served a Set of
Requests for Admission. However, Ceballos did provide responses. Pursuant to
CCP section 2033.280, the Court does not deem the matters in Requests
for Admissions, Set One admitted.ii. SanctionsSanctions are mandatory against the party that
necessitated bringing the instant motion unless that party serves compliant
responses before the hearing on the motion. (CCP § 2033.280(c).)           Plaintiff served code-compliant responses before the
hearing. Therefore, sanctions are not mandatory.   IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER          Motion by Defendant LACMA for an order deeming matters
admitted is DENIED. Counsel
for Plaintiff to give notice.            Dated:  4/29/24                                            _______________________________                                                                                  JARED D. MOSES
