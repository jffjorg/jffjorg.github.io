  Case Number:  23AHCV00462    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND I.        INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Hong Gan, who is self-represented, is
suing Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical Center (Defendant) for medical
malpractice. The pleading contains some factual allegations that seem to
concern the taking of a urine sample by way of a catheter during an involuntary
mental health hold. The pleading characterizes this act as a rape. 
This is Plaintiff’s third lawsuit against Defendant
concerning these same allegations.  In Los Angeles Superior Court case
numbers 19STLC08450 and 20STLC07641, demurrers were sustained without leave to
amend and the actions were dismissed.  
           San Gabriel filed the instant demurrer on November 14,
2023. It is unopposed.
Before
the Court are San Gabriel’s challenges to the first amended complaint. San
Gabriel alleges that: (1) the first amended complaint fails to state sufficient
facts as San Gabriel obtained a final judgment against plaintiff in the two
prior cases and res judicata should apply.

III.     DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a complaint
fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
           B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
           The Declaration of Christopher P. Wend is offered in
support of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41.Wend
declares that he sent a draft of the proposed demurrer to plaintiff on November
6, 2023. (Wend Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff did not respond. Wend then sent another
email on November 8, 2023, to discuss the demurrer. Plaintiff did not respond. (Wend
Decl. ¶ 13.)
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
           C. Res Judicata
Res
judicia is the doctrine describing the preclusive effect of a final judgment on
the merits, preventing re-litigation of the same cause of action in a
subsequent suit between the same parties. (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896-897.) “A prior judgment is not res judicata on a subsequent
action unless three elements are satisfied: ‘1) the issues decided
in the prior adjudication are identical with those presented in the later
action; 2) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action; and 3)
the party against whom the plea is raised was a party or was in privity with a
party to the prior adjudication.’” (Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v.
ExxonMobil Corp. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, 685-686, internal citations
omitted.) “[A] demurrer based on res judicata is properly sustained only if the
pleadings and judicially noticed facts conclusively establish the elements of
the doctrine.” (Planning & Conservation League v. Castaic Lake Water
Agency (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 210, 231.) “If all of the facts necessary to
show that an action is barred by res judicata are within the complaint or
subject to judicial notice, a trial court may properly sustain a general
demurrer.” (Frommhagen v. Bd. of Supervisors (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1292,
1299.)
           Here, the two prior cases, 19STLC08450 and 20STLC07641, involved the exact same parties as the
instant case. The two prior filed cases involve causes of actions
arising from the same event and set of facts, an involuntary psychiatric hold
and catheterization of Plaintiff. (See Defendant’s RJN, Exhs. A, E.) 20STLC07641 involved the identical causes of
action now before the Court. (Defendant’s RJN Exh. E.) In both actions, the entire
action was dismissed. (Defendant’s RJN, Exhs C, D, F, G.) Indeed, the demurrer
in 20STLC07641 was sustained for res judicata reasons. (Id. Exh. F.) As
there were final judgments on the merits of the prior actions (dismissal), the
same causes of action were involved and Gan was a party to both prior actions,
the doctrine of res judicata has been conclusively established. 
Because
Defendant has demonstrated this action is barred by the doctrine of res
judicata, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 San Gabriel’s demurrer to the first amended
complaint is sustained without leave to amend. 
           Counsel for San Gabriel to give notice of this order.
