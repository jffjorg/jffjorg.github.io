[1] The
court notes that the objections filed by defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation
Centre, LLC erroneously list two objections with the number 30.  The objections also erroneously skip
objections number 33 and 41.  (Def.
Objections, pp. 32:9-33:8 [setting forth objection number 32 and, next, 34],
39:1-28 [setting forth objections 40 and 42].) 


[2] The
court notes that, in opposition, Plaintiff contends that Dr. Rosen is not
qualified to opine on the relevant standard of care since her experience is
limited to internal medicine and geriatric medicine at the Department of
Veteran’s Affairs.  But Dr. Rosen has
explained, in her declaration, that she has “experience providing care and
treatment to skilled nursing facility patients” and therefore is “familiar with
the applicable standard of care as it applies to skilled nursing facilities, in
the community, such as [Defendant] and its staff, who provide care and service
to patients, such as” Plaintiff.  (Dr.
Rosen Decl., ¶ 2.)
