And here is the English text summary:

The court notes that the objections filed by the defendant, Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC, contain errors. Notably, two objections are listed with the same number (30), and objections 33 and 41 are skipped. The court also addresses the plaintiff's contention that Dr. Rosen, who is an expert witness, is not qualified to opine on the standard of care because her experience is limited to internal medicine and geriatric medicine at the Department of Veteran's Affairs. However, Dr. Rosen has explained in her declaration that she has experience providing care and treatment to skilled nursing facility patients and is therefore familiar with the applicable standard of care as it applies to skilled nursing facilities. The court will consider these points in making its final ruling.
