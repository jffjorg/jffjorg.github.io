And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Los Angeles Unified School District's motion to continue the trial from March 27, 2024 to June 5, 2024. The district argued that there was good cause to continue the trial to allow for a hearing on its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, which is scheduled for May 1, 2024. However, the court found that the district failed to file its motion within the time limits set by the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore does not have a right to have its motion heard before trial. The court has denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff, Eric Jones, to give notice of the ruling.
