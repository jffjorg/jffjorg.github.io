MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS
ADMITTED
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) deeming admitted the truth of
the matters specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, served
on defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC (“Defendant”) on September 24, 2020,
and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant
in the amount of $51.38.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response that is in substantial
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with the Requests for Admission, Set One, on September 24,
2020.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 2, Proof of
Service.)  On September 28, 2020,
Defendant filed a special motion to strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint,
thereby staying all discovery proceedings in the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (g) [“All
discovery proceedings in the action shall be stayed upon the filing of a notice
of motion made pursuant to” Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16].)  On June 4, 2021, the court issued an order
granting Defendant’s special motion to strike as to each of the seven causes of
action alleged in the First Amended Complaint. 
(June 4, 2021 minute order, p.1; June 4, 2021 Order, p. 1.)  The clerk gave notice of the June 4, 2021 minute
order to the parties.  (Certificate of
Mailing, filed June 4, 2021.)   
On June 18,
2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal, stating that he appealed from the
court’s June 4, 2021 order.  (Notice of
Appeal, filed June 18, 2021, ¶ 1.)  Plaintiff’s
filing the appeal stayed proceedings in the trial court as to Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a); Newport
Harbor Ventures, LLC v. Morris Cerullo World Evangelism (2018) 4 Cal.5th
637, 645.)  In addition, on July 15, 2021,
the court issued an order granting Plaintiff’s request to stay proceedings as
to defendants Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC and Lorraine Escobar
pending completion of the appeal.  (July
15, 2021 Order, p. 1; July 15, 2021 minute order, pp. 1-2.)  
On August
12, 2022, the Court of Appeal issued its opinion which reversed the trial court’s
order granting Defendant’s special motion to strike as to the causes of action for
professional negligence and negligence, and affirmed the order in all other
respects.  The Court of Appeal issued its
remittitur on October 21, 2022.  Plaintiff contends that, after the stay was
lifted by issuance of the remittitur on October 21, 2022, Defendant failed to
serve timely responses to his Requests for Admissions, even though Plaintiff
sent a letter to Defendant on November 28, 2022, requesting that Defendant
provide responses.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 5.)

In
opposition, Defendant asserts that, despite the stay on discovery imposed by
the filing of her special motion to strike, she timely served objections to the
discovery.  Specifically, she has
attached a copy of an October 12, 2020 letter that she sent to Plaintiff, in
which she stated, in relevant part, the following:  “I am formally objecting to all of the
purported discovery whether served on me, other parties, or third party
witnesses.  Beside the fact that many of
your requests seek privileged information and/or information not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and/or the discovery
sought is oppressive and harassing, I am objecting because you are intentionally
violating the automatic discovery stay of which you admit you are aware.”  (McIntosh Decl., Ex. E, p. 1; Opp., p.
5:17-18 [arguing that Defendant “timely interposed legal objections” on October
12, 2020].)   
The court
finds that the stay of discovery proceedings imposed by the filing of
Defendant’s special motion to strike was terminated by the clerk’s giving
notice of entry of the order ruling on the motion on June 4, 2021.  (Certificate of Mailing, filed June 4, 2021.)  The court also finds that the stay imposed by
Plaintiff’s appeal from the June 4, 2021 order granting Defendant’s special
motion to strike and the stay imposed by the trial court’s July 15, 2021 order
were terminated by the Court of Appeal’s issuance of the remittitur on October
21, 2022.  (Bryan v.Bank of America
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 185, 190 [“‘When the remittitur issues, the jurisdiction
of the appellate court ceases, and that of the trial court attaches.’”  (Citation omitted.)].)     
The court
finds that Defendant’s October 12, 2020 letter does not constitute a valid response
to the Requests for Admission.  The party
to whom requests for admission have been directed shall (1) respond in writing
separately to each request, (2) set forth objections to each particular request,
and (3) serve responses that bear the same identifying number and are in the
same sequence as the corresponding request. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.210, subds. (a), (b), (d).)  The responses must also identify the
responding party, the set number, and the requesting party.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.210, subd.
(c).)  Defendant’s October 12, 2020
letter does not satisfy these requirements. 
Moreover, the letter does not identify the sets of discovery requests to
which she was attempting to object. 
(McIntosh Decl., Ex. E, p. 1 [stating that she was “in receipt of the
various discovery demands” served by Plaintiff and was objecting to “all”
discovery].)  
Thus, the
court finds that, because the October 12, 2020 letter does not satisfy Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.210, the objections therein do not constitute
valid responses. However, on March 1, 2024, Defendant filed the “Supplemental
Declaration of Michael F. Sisson re Request for Admissions,” to which
Defendant’s counsel has attached Defendant’s proposed responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission.  (Supp. Sisson
Decl., ¶ 5; Supp. Sisson Decl., Ex. O.) 
Defendant served her responses on Plaintiff by email on March 1,
2024.  (Sisson Decl., Ex. O, p. 37 [Proof
of Service].)  
The court (1)
finds that Defendant has presented evidence showing that, before the hearing on
this motion, she served proposed responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admissions that are in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220, and (2) therefore
denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Supp. Sisson
Decl., Ex. O; Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)   
The court acknowledges
that it is mandatory for the court to impose a monetary sanction against the
party whose failure to serve timely responses necessitated a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  While section 2033.280 may not limit sanctions
to costs allowed by section 1033.5, the court has considered that the copying
and postage costs requested by Plaintiff are not recoverable costs under that
statute, and exercises its discretion not to award those costs to
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (b)(3) [“Postage, telephone, and photocopying charges, except for
exhibits” are not allowable as costs].) 
The court therefore awards monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $7.00 for the costs that Plaintiff incurred
in obtaining minute orders.  (Reyes
Decl., ¶ 17.) 
The court
denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve responses, without objections, to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) awarding sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $49.76.
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant
with the Special Interrogatories, Set One, on September 24, 2020.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 2, Proof of Service.)  Thereafter, Defendant sent the October 12,
2020 letter objecting to “all of the purported discovery” served on her.  (McIntosh Decl., Ex. E, p. 1.)  Defendant thus contends that she timely served
objections to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories.  The court disagrees. 
The court finds that Defendant’s
October 12, 2020 letter does not constitute a valid response to Plaintiff’s
special interrogatories because it does not (1) respond and object to each
interrogatory separately, (2) identify the responding party, the propounding
party, and the set number of the discovery, or (3) use the same identifying
number or letter in the same sequence as the corresponding interrogatory, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210.  The court further notes, as set forth above,
that Defendant did not identify the sets of discovery requests to which she was
attempting to object in her letter.  
Thus, because the October 12,
2020 letter does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210, the
court finds that the objections therein do not constitute valid responses.  Defendant has not presented evidence
establishing that she has since served valid responses to this discovery, even though Plaintiff sent
a letter to Defendant on November 28, 2022, requesting that Defendant provide
responses (Reyes Decl., Ex. 5). 
The court therefore grants
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Special
Interrogatories.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290.)  
The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  
The court denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling Defendant to
serve responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories—General, Set One, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $49.04.
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿¿ 
As set
forth above, the parties have presented evidence establishing that (1)
Plaintiff served discovery, including the Form Interrogatories—General, Set
One, on Defendant on September 24, 2020, and (2) Defendant sent a letter to
Plaintiff on October 12, 2020 stating that she was objecting to “all of the purported discovery” served on
her.  (Reyes Decl., Ex. 2, Proof of
Service; McIntosh Decl., Ex. E, p. 1.) 
The court finds, for the reasons set forth above, that this letter does
not constitute a valid response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories because it
does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210.  Defendant has not presented evidence
establishing that she has since served valid responses to this discovery, even though Plaintiff sent
a letter to Defendant on November 28, 2022, requesting that Defendant provide
responses (Reyes Decl., Ex. 5).   
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories—General, Set
One.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290.)  
The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).)  
The court denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DEMANDS
FOR INSPECTION
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling Defendant to
serve responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, and (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $298.68.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
As set forth above, the parties have shown that (1) Plaintiff served
Defendant with discovery requests, including Plaintiff’s Inspection Demands, on
September 24, 2020, and (2) Defendant sent a letter on October 12, 2020 stating that she was
objecting to “all of the
purported discovery” served on her. 
(Reyes Decl., Ex. 2, Proof of Service; McIntosh Decl., Ex. E, p. 1.)  
In responding to document
demands, a party shall (1) respond and object separately to each item or
category of item, (2) identify the responding party, the demanding party, and
the set number, and (3) serve responses that bear the same number and are in
the same sequence as the corresponding item or category in the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subds. (a),
(b), (c).)  The October 12, 2020 letter
does not include this information and does not respond separately to each
document demand.  (McIntosh Decl., Ex.
E.)  Moreover, as set forth above, the
letter does not identify the sets of discovery requests to which she attempted
to object.  
Thus, the court finds that,
because the October 12, 2020 letter does not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.210, the statements and objections contained therein do
not constitute valid responses.  Defendant
has not presented any evidence establishing that she has since served valid
responses to this discovery, even though Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant on November
28, 2022, requesting that Defendant provide responses (Reyes Decl., Ex. 5). 
The court therefore grants
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Inspection
Demands.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300.) 
The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  
The court denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
