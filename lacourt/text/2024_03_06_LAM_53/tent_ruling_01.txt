[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to continue trial and
  related dates
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Eric Jones
Motion to Continue Trial and Related Dates
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order continuing trial in this action, filed by plaintiff Eric
Jones (“Plaintiff”), from March 27, 2024 to June 5, 2024 (or as soon thereafter
as the court can accommodate), and all related dates.  Defendant contends that there is good cause
to continue trial because, on January 25, 2024, Defendant filed its motion for
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication, but the hearing on
its motion is scheduled for May 1, 2024 (i.e., after the trial date of March
27, 2024).    
The court finds that Defendant has not shown good cause to further
continue trial in this action.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332.) 
The court acknowledges that “‘[a] trial court may not refuse to hear a
summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 437c.’”  (Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) 
However, here, Defendant did not file its motion within the time limits
of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c by failing to serve and file the motion
with 75 days’ notice (plus two court days for electronic service) to Plaintiff
and with enough time to be heard 30 days before the then-scheduled February 28,
2024 trial date or the current March 27, 2024 trial date.[1]  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 437c, subds.
(a)(2), (a)(3), 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) 
Thus, Defendant does not have a right to have its summary judgment
motion heard before trial.  (Cole,
supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at p. 89 [“Because [the petitioners’] motion for
summary judgment was filed within the time limits set by section 437c, they
have a right to have their motion heard before the start of trial”].) 
            Thus, the court finds that Defendant
has not met its burden to show that there is good cause to continue trial in
order to allow Defendant’s motion for summary judgment or, alternatively,
summary adjudication to be heard.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subd. (c).) 
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion. 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s motion to continue trial and related dates. 
            The court orders plaintiff Eric
Jones to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 6, 2024
