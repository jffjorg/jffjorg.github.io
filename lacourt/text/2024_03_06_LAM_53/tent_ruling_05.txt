[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  discovery
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Christopher Lemole  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Discovery 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Christopher Lemole (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Dean Scott-Smith (“Defendant”) to serve
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (2)
awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$1,861.65.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿¿
Plaintiff
served Defendant with his Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on May
4, 2023, by mail.  (Hemming Decl., Ex. B,
Requests for Production, p. 5, Proof of Service.)  Defendant did not serve timely responses to this
discovery and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff
filed this motion.  (Hemming Decl.,
¶ 8 [“To date, no response has been received by this office to plaintiff’s
discovery requests”].)  Defendant did not
file an opposition or other evidence with the court establishing that responses
have since been served. 
The
court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to the
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for an award of monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $961.65 ((3
hours x $300 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of
sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Hemming Decl., ¶ 9.)  
The court notes that, in Plaintiff’s memorandum of points and
authorities, Plaintiff also requests that the court compel Defendant to serve
initial responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories.  (Mot., p. 4:1-4, 4:27.)  However, Plaintiff did not request that
relief in the notice of motion.  The
court therefore denies that request. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1010; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1110, subd. (a) [“A
notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order”]; Kinda v. Carpenter
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1277 [“courts generally may consider only the
grounds stated in the notice of motion”].) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff
Christopher Lemole’s motion to compel responses to discovery as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders defendant Dean Scott-Smith (1) to serve on
plaintiff Christopher Lemole full and complete verified responses, without
objections, to plaintiff Christopher Lemole’s Request for Production of
Documents or Things, Set One, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210 through 2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Christopher Lemole
all documents and things in defendant Dean Scott-Smith’s possession, custody,
or control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date
of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Dean
Scott-Smith to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Christopher Lemole in the
amount of $961.65 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff
Christopher Lemole to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 6, 2024
