The pending motions were previously scheduled for hearing on February 20,
2024.  In its minute order issued on that
date, the court noted that (1) plaintiff Emilio Reyes filed a request for a
court reporter, but (2) the Court Reporter Assignments Office was not able to
provide a court reporter for the hearing on that date.  (Feb. 20, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  The court therefore continued the hearing on
the pending motions to March 6, 2024.
