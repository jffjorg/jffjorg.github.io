And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long in a case between Carlice Etame (Plaintiff) and Inland Empire Health Plan (Defendant). The case was filed on December 8, 2023, and the Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike on February 8, 2024. The Judge granted the demurrer and motion to strike, sustaining the demurrer on the grounds that the Plaintiff failed to allege compliance with the Government Claims Act, failed to allege any statutory basis for the second, third, and fourth causes of action, and failed to plead the terms of the contract sufficiently. The Judge also struck the allegations relating to punitive damages. As a result, the case is dismissed.
