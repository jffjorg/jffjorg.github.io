And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was filed by Defendant Milton Joyner and others, including Compton Remedy and Sun Bay Group LLC, seeking to have the case dismissed. The judge found that the Complaint sufficiently alleges a basis for Defendant's liability and that the Complaint sufficiently alleges Plaintiffs' standing to bring the lawsuit.

The judge noted that the Complaint alleges that Defendant is the owner of record and/or beneficiary under a Short Form Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents, and that an unlicensed cannabis dispensary operating under the name Compton Remedy was located at the property. The judge also found that the property is located in the unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, which is prohibited by Los Angeles County Code section 22.140.134.

The judge further noted that Defendant's grant deed dated October 30, 2023, indicates that the property is in the "Unincorporated area." The judge therefore denied Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered that the case proceed to the next stage of litigation.

The judge also granted Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of certain exhibits and denied Defendant's request for judicial notice of other exhibits.
