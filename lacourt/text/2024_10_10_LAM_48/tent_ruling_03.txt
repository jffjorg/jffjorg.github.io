  CASE NO.: 22STCV07986
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2024



 
On
March 4, 2022, Great Divide Insurance Company filed this action against Cannon Constructors
South Inc. (“Cannon”) for damages in subrogation for general negligence.  The Complaint alleges that Cannon allegedly caused
a back-up in a building’s plumbing system, resulting in substantial property damage
for the insured, which was discovered on June 4, 2021.
On
April 18, 2024, Cannon filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against GPS
Painting & Wallcovering (“GPS”), alleging (1) express indemnity; (2) implied
indemnity; (3) equitable indemnity; (4) contribution; (5) declaratory relief re:
duty to defend; (6) declaratory relief re: duty to indemnify; and (7) breach of
contract.
On
April 26, 2024, GPS filed a demurrer and motion to strike.  GPS demurs to
the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action.  The request for judicial notice is denied as unnecessary
because the FACC and its exhibits are already part of this case’s record.
DISCUSSION
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting
the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
A.        The Claims Are Not
Facially Time-Barred.
GPS argues that the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action
are barred by the four-year statute of limitations for breach of written contract
and/or the ten-year statute of repose for latent construction defect.  (Demurrer at pp. 13-16; see Code Civ. Proc., §§
337, 337.15.)
“‘In
order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect
must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough
that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.’”  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership v. City of
San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)
The
statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 337.)  The statute of limitations for construction
defect is ten years.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
337.15.)  Code of Civil
Procedure section 337.15’s ten-year limitation “begins when the individual contribution
to the work of improvement has been substantially completed, rather than being tolled
until the project is entirely completed.” 
(Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All American Development
Co. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 30, 36.)  “Actions
barred after 10 years encompass both direct actions by the consumer against the
contributor (§ 337.15, subd. (a)) and actions for indemnity against such contributor
based upon his role in the project (§ 337.15, subd. (c)).”  (Id. at p. 36.)
GPS
argues that the December 2020 purchase order does not itself contain an indemnity
provision, and Cannon cannot rely on the parties’ prior agreements dated 2004 or
2010.  (Demurrer at pp. 13-14.)  This does not make the FACC facially time-barred.  The clock does not start when the contract is
signed.  Rather, the limitations period begins
when a cause of action accrues.  There could be no negligent construction, breach of contract, or failure
to indemnify until the work on the underlying project occurred.  GPS’s subcontractor work was
necessarily completed sometime between the December
2020 purchase order and the June 2021 discovery of the negligent construction work.  Accordingly, the causes of action accrued well
within four years of both Great Divide filing this action (March 4, 2022) and Cannon
filing its original cross-complaint against GPS (March 23, 2023).
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
B.        The Claims Are Uncertain and Do Not Allege
a Valid Basis for Express Indemnity.
GPS
also argues that the first, fifth,
sixth, and seventh causes of action are fatally uncertain because
the allegations refer to indemnity provisions that do not apply to this underlying
project.  (Demurrer at pp. 17-19.)
Cannon alleges that it is entitled to indemnity from GPS pursuant to
the parties’ March 2010 Master Agreement. 
(See FACC ¶¶ 11-14 & Ex. B.)  The
2010 Master Agreement states that Cannon intends to engage GPS to provide subcontractor
work pursuant to purchase orders, which “will explicitly incorporate by reference
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.”  Article 5.1 requires GPS to indemnify Cannon for
all claims arising from GPS’s operations.
In December 2020, GPS approved a purchase order for Cannon’s work on
the premises.  (FACC ¶ 14 & Ex. C.)  GPS argues that this purchase order does not provide
a basis for indemnity because it does not explicitly incorporate the 2010 Master
Agreement.  (Demurrer at pp. 13-16.)  Instead, “This Purchase Order is subject to and
shall be governed by all of the provisions of the Master Subcontract Agreement between
CANNON CONSTRUCTORS, INC. and the addressee dated 03/24/04.”  (FACC, Ex. C.)
Cannon argues that the parties’ 2004 Master Subcontract Agreement also
contained an indemnity provision, and it automatically renews in the absence of
a notice of termination.  (Opposition at pp.
4-5; see FACC ¶ 15 & Ex. D.)
Article 6.5 of the 2010 Master Agreement states that the “Agreement
and any Purchase Order governed hereunder contains all of the covenants and provisions
agreed upon by the Parties and supersede and nullify all prior negotiations, proposals
or stipulations.”  The parties “shall not
be bound by or be liable for, any statement, representation, promise or agreement
not set forth herein.”  Accordingly, the 2004
Master Subcontract Agreement has been superseded and nullified by the 2010 Master
Agreement.
The December 2020 purchase order (relevant to Great Divide’s claim
in this action) does not “explicitly incorporate by reference all of the terms and
conditions of this [2010 Master] Agreement.” 
It is expressly governed by the 2004 Master Subcontract Agreement, which
is no longer in effect.
Accordingly, there is no contractual basis for indemnity arising from
this purchase order—and thus no basis for express indemnity, declaratory relief
regarding express indemnity, or breach of contract.
The demurrer is sustained on this ground.
CONCLUSION
The demurrer to the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action is SUSTAINED.  Because Cannon has not shown any way to amend
the claims to correct their deficiencies, no leave to amend is granted.
GPS is ordered to file an answer to the remainder of the FACC within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
