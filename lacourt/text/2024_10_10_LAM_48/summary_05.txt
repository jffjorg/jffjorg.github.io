And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for substituted service on the Secretary of State. The plaintiff, Divvypay LLC, filed an action against defendants Buy Zeeba Inc. and Ameneh Riahi on April 14, 2023. The plaintiff attempted to serve process on Kambiz Marashi, the agent for service of process, CEO, Secretary, CFO, and Director for Buy Zeeba Inc., at 510 West 6th Street, Suite 728, Los Angeles, California 90014. However, the process servers were unable to find Kambiz Marashi at the designated address and provided declarations of reasonable diligence to support their efforts.

Based on the evidence presented, the court finds that the agent designated for service of process could not with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for personally delivering the process. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's application for substituted service and allows process to be served on the Secretary of State.
