[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUBSTITUTED
  SERVICE ON SECRETARY OF STATE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2024



 
On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff
Divvypay LLC filed this action against Defendants Buy Zeeba Inc. and Ameneh Riahi.
On
June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Application for Order Directing Service of Summons
on Defendant Corporation by Delivery of Process to Secretary of State.
If
a corporation’s agent designated for service of process cannot with reasonable diligence
be found at the address designated for personally delivering the process, and it
is shown by affidavit that the domestic corporation cannot be served in accordance
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10, 415.20, 416.10, or 416.20, the court
may order service on the Secretary of State. 
(Corp. Code, § 1702, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
provides Declarations of Reasonable Diligence from its process servers.  (Application, Exs. B-C.)  On April 19, 2023, the process server attempted
service on Kambiz Marashi (Agent for Service of Process, CEO, Secretary,
CFO, and Director for Buy Zeeba Inc.) at 510 West 6th Street, Suite 728, Los Angeles,
California 90014.  There was no answer/response.  She checked in with security who let her up, but
the office door was locked and no one would answer.  On April 28, 2023, the agent was not in or available.  On April 30, 2023, the agent was not in or available
and the office was closed.  On May 1 and 2,
2023, there was no answer and it was quiet. 
On May 14, 2024, a different process server encountered a locked door and
was informed by the front desk that “they work remotely.”  On May 16, 20, 22, and 23, 2024, there was no
answer and the door was closed/locked.  The
process server left a courtesy copy on May 23, 2024.
Plaintiff
has shown that the agent designated for service of process (and sole officer and
director) could not with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated
for personally delivering the process.  
Accordingly,
the Application for Order Directing Service of Summons on Defendant Corporation
by Delivery of Process to Secretary of State is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
