And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge Thomas D. Long has issued a tentative ruling on October 10, 2024, in the case of Clarence Harrell v. City of Pasadena. The case involves a dispute over discovery requests made by Harrell, the plaintiff, against non-parties Francis Jose and Suzanne Stone, who are employees of the City of Pasadena. The City had served objections and supplemental responses to the requests, and Harrell had filed motions to compel further responses.

The Court found that Harrell's motion to compel further responses for Francis Jose is untimely, as it was filed after the 60-day deadline for making such motions. Therefore, the motion is denied.

The Court also found that Harrell has not shown good cause for the discovery requests related to Suzanne Stone, as they are overly broad and seek documents that are not relevant to the case. Therefore, the motion to compel further discovery responses is also denied.

The parties are required to notify the Court if they intend to submit on the tentative ruling, and if all parties submit, no further appearances before the Court are required unless a companion hearing is also scheduled.
