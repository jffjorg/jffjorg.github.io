[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT
  ON THE PLEADINGS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2024



 
On
April 11, 2024, Plaintiffs The People of the State of California and County of Los
Angeles filed this action against Defendant Milton Joyner and others to abate a
public nuisance and enjoin the operation and maintenance of an illegal cannabis
dispensary.
Defendant
filed an answer, and on September 16, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for judgment
on the pleadings.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s
objections to Plaintiffs’ RJN Exhibit D are sustained.  Information on websites, even official governmental
agency websites, can be reasonably subject to dispute and are not proper subjects
for judicial notice.  (Jolley v. Chase
Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 888-889; see also Huitt v.
Southern Cal. Gas Co. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1605 fn. 10.)
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is granted.
Plaintiffs’
request for judicial notice is granted as to Exhibits A, B, and C.
DISCUSSION
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity
Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) 
Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal
sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  The Court “must
accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does not consider conclusions
of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or facts that
are judicially noticed.”  (Stevenson Real
Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220.)
A.        The Complaint Sufficiently Alleges a Basis
for Defendant’s Liability.
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant is “owner of record and/or Beneficiary under a
Short Form Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents.”  (Complaint ¶ 7.)  An unlicensed cannabis dispensary operating under
the name Compton Remedy was located at the property.  (Complaint ¶¶ 14-17.)  On May 16, 2023, Plaintiffs began contacting Defendant
and Compton Remedy to inform them that they needed to take steps to ensure the illegal
activity ceased.  (Complaint ¶ 18.)  Defendant’s attorney stated that Defendant would
evict the cannabis business.  (Complaint ¶
20.)
Defendant
argues that he cannot be liable because he no longer owns or controls the subject
property.  (Motion at p. 6.)  Through a grant deed dated October 30, 2023, Defendant
granted the property to Sun Bay Group LLC. 
(Defendant RJN, Ex. A.)
Plaintiffs
seek, in part, civil penalties for violations of Los Angeles County Code sections
1.23.010 et seq., 22.140.134, 22.242.020 et seq.; Health and Safety Code section
11570 et seq.; and Business and Professions Code sections 17200, 26200 et seq.  These civil penalties may be imposed for each
day that Defendant permitted a cannabis business to operate at the property.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 35, 47, 59, 71.)  The Complaint sufficiently alleges—and Defendant
admits—that Defendant owned the property during some of the relevant time period.
The
motion is denied on this ground.
B.        The Complaint Sufficiently Alleges Plaintiffs’
Standing.
Los
Angeles County Code section  22.140.134 prohibits
the operation of a marijuana business in the unincorporated portions of Los Angeles
County.  Defendant argues that the property
is in the incorporated areas of the City of Compton.  (Motion at p. 8.)
Plaintiffs
allege that the property is “located in the unincorporated area of Los Angeles County
at real property commonly known as 15320 Avalon Boulevard, Compton CA 90220.”  (Complaint ¶ 1.)  Although Compton is an incorporated city, “Compton”
in the property’s address is not dispositive. 
This is further supported by Defendant’s own grant deed, which indicates
that the property (also known as “15320 Avalon Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90220”) is
in the “Unincorporated area.”  (Defendant
RJN, Ex. A.)
The
motion is denied on this ground.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
