And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a nunc pro tunc order, deeming the complaint filed on September 15, 2023, despite it being rejected due to an error on the Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum. The judge found that the rejection was improper because the complaint complied with state requirements, and the clerk has a ministerial duty to file it. The judge cited California law and court rules to support the decision.
