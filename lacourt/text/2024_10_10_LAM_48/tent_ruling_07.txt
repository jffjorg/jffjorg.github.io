  CASE NO.: 23STCV23077
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR NUNC
  PRO TUNC ORDER 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2024



 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff Darral
Scott filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles, Deputy Justin
Sabatine, and Deputy Jacob Ruiz.
On
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for nunc pro tunc order.  Plaintiff asks that his complaint be deemed filed
on September 15, 2023, which would render it timely filed.
Plaintiff’s
counsel explains that they attempted to file the complaint and its accompanying
documents on September 15, 2023.  (Ricketts
Decl. ¶ 4.)  Counsel made an error on the
Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum when marking the reason for choosing the venue,
which resulted in the entire filing being rejected.  (Ricketts Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.)
Defendants
argue that the Complaint was properly rejected under Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6, subdivision (e)(4)(C) because it did not “comply with applicable filing
requirements,” and Plaintiff did not timely file a corrected version.  (Opposition at pp. 4-5.)
“[T]he
local superior court may not condition the filing of a complaint on local rule requirements.  Instead, so long as a complaint complies with
state requirements, the clerk has a ministerial duty to file.  In legal effect, a complaint is ‘filed’ when it
is presented to the clerk for filing in the form required by state law.”  (Carlson v. State of California Department
of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1270.)  “If a party that is required to provide a cover
sheet under this rule or a similar local rule fails to do so or provides a defective
or incomplete cover sheet at the time the party’s first paper is submitted for filing,
the clerk of the court must file the paper.” 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.220(c).)  “The Judicial Council added subdivision (c) to
former rule 982.2 (subsequently renumbered as 3.220) effective January 2002 to address
the very problem that occurred in this case: ‘the refusal of some clerks to file
an initial pleading because it is not accompanied by a cover sheet or the sheet
is somehow defective.’”  (Mito v. Temple
Recycling Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276, 280.)
The
only defect in Plaintiff’s filing was an incorrect mark on the Civil Case Cover
Sheet Addendum—a local form and local requirement.  The September 15, 2023 filing was improperly rejected
for this error.  Accordingly, the motion for
nunc pro tunc order is GRANTED.  The complaint
is deemed filed on September 15, 2023.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
