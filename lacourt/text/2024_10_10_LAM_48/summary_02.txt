And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrers to the first, second, and third causes of action, and grants the motion to strike the cross-complaint. The court finds that the claims for intentional and negligent misrepresentation are time-barred, and that the claims for contribution, equitable indemnity, and implied contractual indemnity are insufficiently pled. The court also finds that the cross-complaint was filed without leave of court, and grants the motion to strike. The court grants Cross-Complainants 30 days' leave to amend the first, second, and third causes of action.
