Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds that the attorney fees, which
are 25% of the funds, are fair and reasonable.
Although
the Petitioners do not identify the financial institutions in Attachment 18b(2)
as required, they do identify the financial institutions in the declarations of
Travon Smith Sr. and Renee Mohamed, as well as in the proposed orders.
Accordingly,
the Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Deposits Into Blocked Accounts for
January 10, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a).)  If acknowledgements
of receipt by the financial institutions are filed before that date, no appearance
will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
