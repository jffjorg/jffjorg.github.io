And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, North Mill Equipment Finance LLC, will be granted its application for a writ of possession. The plaintiff is seeking to obtain possession of a 2023 OmniPrint PKGF-J330TX Plus Printing Equipment, Serial/VIN #QUOTE# K4015 VIN: #1224288049016TX, which is claimed to be owed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not opposed the application, and the judge has found that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property. The judge will sign the proposed order, but will strike the portion that would allow the sheriff to enter the equipment at any other location known by the defendants, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated probable cause that the equipment is at any location other than the address specified in the Equipment Finance Agreement. The judge will also hear from counsel at the hearing to determine what undertaking, if any, the defendant should be required to provide for redelivery or to stay delivery of the equipment.
