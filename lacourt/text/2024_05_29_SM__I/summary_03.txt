And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this matter, which is set for a demurrer and status conference. The plaintiff, cross-complainant, contends that the matter is moot because a first amended cross-complaint has been filed. The court does not see the pleading on its docket, but if the cross-complainant is correct, then the demurrer is indeed moot. The court will therefore continue this matter for two weeks to allow the filing of the amended cross-complaint. If the amended pleading is not filed, the court will hear the demurrer. The court will deny leave to amend if the demurrer is sustained. The status conference will be continued for approximately 60 days.
