  Case Number:  21SMCV01459    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  I The application is reluctantly GRANTED.  The court was unhappy with the last
continuance and unhappy granting the motion to add the new
cross-defendant.  Predictably, the
parties now seek to continue the trial. 
Because the new defendant has rights—and only for that reason—the court
will continue the matter.  However, the
problems here are generally a lack of diligence more than anything else.  The case was filed over 2.5 years ago.  But only two depositions have taken
place.  It took literally years to get a
certificate of merit to bring in the most recently added party.  No mediation has occurred.  In fact, the pleadings are not even settled
yet.  
 
The court will discuss when it has availability.  The likelihood is that the next availability
will be in 2025.  Further, this case will
have last priority on the trial calendar. 
That means that if more than one case is ready for trial at the FSC,
this case will not have priority but rather will be continued or trail.  Because the parties have asked that the cut
offs be extended, the court will extend them.
 
There will be no further continuances under any but the most
extreme circumstances, by which the court means that a very key player is
suddenly medically unavailable and (if it is a lawyer) no replacement counsel
can be found in Southern California.
