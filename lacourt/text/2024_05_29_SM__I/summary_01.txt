And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reluctantly granted the application, but with certain conditions. The court is unhappy with the last continuance and the addition of a new cross-defendant. The parties now seek to continue the trial, but the court will not grant such a continuance without good reason. The case has been ongoing for over 2.5 years, with only two depositions taken and no mediation or settlement of pleadings. The court will discuss availability and will likely continue the matter in 2025 with last priority on the trial calendar. The court will extend the cutoffs, but will not grant further continuances except in extreme circumstances.
