 Case Number:  23SMCV05190    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to strike is DENIED.  Plaintiff contends that there was unsafe
construction that harmed plaintiff and was done in the manner in which it was
done to force out plaintiff.  Defendant
moves to strike the punitive damages allegations and plaintiff opposes. 
 
The court believes that the issues raised are better tested
on motion for summary judgment or at trial than by motion to strike.  There is enough here such that, if proven,
punitive damages could be proper.  The
court is aware of the requirements to make a corporate entity responsible in
punitive damages for actions done by an employee.  But great pleading specificity is not needed
for that.  The specific information as to
who knew what, who approved what things, and what may or may not have
constituted ratification are better known to the defense than the
plaintiff.  If there is truly no basis to
hold the company liable for punitive damages, then a motion for summary
adjudication might lie.
 
For present purposes, the motion fails and is DENIED.
