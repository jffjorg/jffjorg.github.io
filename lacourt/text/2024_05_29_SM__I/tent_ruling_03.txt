 Case Number:  23SMCV02874    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a demurrer and status
conference.  Cross-complainant contends
that the matter is moot because a first amended cross-complaint has been
filed.  The court does not see it on the
court’s docket, but if cross-complainant is correct that one was filed, then
the demurrer is indeed moot.  The court
will therefore CONTINUE this matter for two weeks.  If the amended pleading was somehow not
filed, the court is of the view that it will allow the filing of a first
amended cross-complaint within 2 court days of today.  If the amended cross-complaint is not filed
already or within 2 court days, then the court will hear the demurrer.  No further briefing will be allowed, however,
if the demurrer is heard and sustained, leave to amend will be denied on the
ground that cross-complainant has elected to stand on the cross complaint.  If the amended cross-complaint is filed,
cross-defendant will have the time allowed by law to answer or otherwise
respond.  The status conference will be
continued for approximately 60 days.  The
court suspects that cross-defendant might demur to the amended cross-complaint
(although maybe not), and the matter will not be at issue until there is either
an answer to the cross-complaint, the demurrer is overruled, or the demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend.
