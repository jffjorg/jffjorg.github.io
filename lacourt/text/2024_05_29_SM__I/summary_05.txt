And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made a preliminary decision regarding the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations. The plaintiff claims that the defendant is liable for punitive damages due to unsafe construction that harmed the plaintiff and was done to force the plaintiff out. The defendant opposes the punitive damages allegations and seeks to strike them. The court believes that the issues raised are better tested on motion for summary judgment or at trial rather than through a motion to strike. The court is aware of the requirements to make a corporate entity responsible in punitive damages, but believes that great pleading specificity is not needed. If there is no basis to hold the company liable for punitive damages, a motion for summary adjudication might be appropriate. For present purposes, the motion to strike is denied.
