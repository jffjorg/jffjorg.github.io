Here is the summary in English-text format:

The tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The complaint is not uncertain, and the defendant's argument that it is unclear and lacks sufficient allegations is unfounded. The complaint states a cause of action for contribution by a cotenant and alleges sufficient facts for a cause of action. The complaint does not, however, allege sufficient facts to remove the defendant's name from the title, and an action to quiet title under Code of Civil Procedure section 760.010 et seq. would be necessary. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 20 days.
