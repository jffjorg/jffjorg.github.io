  Case Number:  23STCVC18481    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Orange Grove Village II Homeowners Association requests court
judgment by default against defendant Nina R. Chomsky.  Plaintiff seeks judgment including a
permanent injunction, declaratory relief, costs of suit, and attorney
fees.  Plaintiff’s application meets all
requirements for default judgment.  
At the
prior hearing on March 12, 2024, the court found plaintiff’s proposed default judgment
was overly broad and not sufficiently clear. 
On March 29, 2024, plaintiff submitted a revised proposed judgment.  The new proposed judgment corrects the
problems the court identified.  It is properly
tailored to the allegations in the complaint and is sufficiently clear to be
enforced as a permanent injunction.  
Plaintiff
Orange Grove Village II Homeowners Association’s request for court judgment by
default is granted.  The court
will sign and enter the revised proposed judgment plaintiff submitted on March
29, 2024.
