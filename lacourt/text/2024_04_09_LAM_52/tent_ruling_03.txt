 Case Number:  24STCV05798    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Michael Niro’s Motion to Quash
Service of Summons
            Defendant
Michael Niro moves to quash service of summons in this action by plaintiff WF
Chateau Partners LLC.  The motion is
premature.  A motion to quash service of
summons concerns “whether service was valid.”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1436, italics added.) 
Niro’s declaration in support of this motion states, “I only know about
this case by checking with the court on the status of the first unlawful
detainer case.  I have not been served in
any manner with the summons and complaint in this case, and just file this
motion to avoid a default based upon a perjured claim of service by the process
server.”  (Niro Decl., lines 6-9.)  But plaintiff has not filed any proof of
service.  To the contrary, over two weeks
after Niro filed this motion, plaintiff applied for an order to serve the summons
by posting.  The basis of that
application is that plaintiff was not able to serve the summons on Niro.  
There is no service of summons to quash.  The court must deny the motion.  
            Defendant Michael Niro’s motion to
quash service of summons is denied.
