And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Michael Niro's motion to quash service of summons in the case brought by Plaintiff WF Chateau Partners LLC. The Judge finds that the motion is premature as it concerns the validity of service, which has not been filed. The Defendant's declaration in support of the motion states that he has not been served with the summons and complaint, and he is seeking to avoid a default. However, the Plaintiff has not filed any proof of service, and has instead applied for an order to serve the summons by posting. The Judge concludes that there is no service of summons to quash, and therefore denies the Defendant's motion.
