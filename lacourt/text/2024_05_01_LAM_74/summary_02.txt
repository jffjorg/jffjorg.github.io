And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to continue the trial and related deadlines. The defendants had requested that the court continue the trial date, final status conference, and hearing on their motion for summary judgment, and vacate and reset all trial-related deadlines. The judge found that the defendants' inability to comply with the original discovery deadlines was due to their own delay in propounding discovery and requesting deposition dates, and therefore did not demonstrate good cause to reset the discovery deadlines. The judge ordered the defendants to give notice of the court's decision.
