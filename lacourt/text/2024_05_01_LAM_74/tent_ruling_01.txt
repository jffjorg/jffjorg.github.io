  Case Number:  22STCV06818    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  74 Mitch Jacobs v. Scott Cohen
 
Plaintiff Mitch Jacobs Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) from
Defendant Scott Cohen
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a
contractual dispute.
            On February 24, 2022, Plaintiff
Mitch Jacobs (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Scott Cohen
(Defendant). The complaint alleges the following causes of action: breach of
written contract, breach of partnership agreement, breach of fiduciary duty,
and an accounting. 
            On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to requests for
production of documents (set two) (RFPs). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
            A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to a
demand for inspection if the propounding party deems that an answer or
statement of compliance is evasive or incomplete, or that an objection is
“without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause for the discovery sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further responses to
RFP Nos. 38, 39, 47, and 49. As a preliminary matter, the court finds that the
parties have sufficiently met and conferred. The court will address the RFPs at
issue in turn.
            RFP
No. 38
            This RFP seeks all non-public
documents referencing the formation of Sams Ventures. Based on the court’s
prior ruling, Defendant objects in part that this information is not relevant
or discoverable. The court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached
the parties’ partnership agreement by not sharing 25% of the proceeds Defendant
received from the sale of Straight Smile. Defendant held stock in Straight
Smile through Sams Ventures, and claims he only received sale proceeds in
proportion to his ownership interest in Sams Ventures. However, if Sams
Ventures is Defendant’s alter-ego, Defendant would have received a greater
amount of sale proceeds. Information about the way in which Sams Ventures’ was
formed will help Plaintiff determine this issue and assess the damages to which
he may be entitled. Moreover, information about those who formed Sams Ventures
could reveal the other individuals who would have received distributions from
the sale, which could help Plaintiff verify the amount of sale proceeds
Defendant claims he received.
            Defendant
also objects that this request violates his right to privacy in his financial
affairs because Sams Ventures is a family LLC. (Valley Bank of Nevada v.
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) But Plaintiff has a
countervailing interest that outweighs the Defendant’s potential privacy
interest. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th
621, 656.) As noted above, Plaintiff needs this discovery to determine the
amount of sale proceeds that Defendant allegedly withheld from Plaintiff in
violation of the parties’ partnership agreement. Thus, further response is
necessary.
            RFP
No. 39
            This RFP seeks documents that
reference the purpose for forming Sams Ventures. Based on the court’s prior
ruling, Defendant objects in part that this information is not relevant or
discoverable. The court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached
the parties’ partnership agreement by not sharing 25% of the proceeds Defendant
received from the sale of Straight Smile. Defendant held stock in Straight
Smile through Sams Ventures, and claims he only received sale proceeds in
proportion to his ownership interest in Sams Ventures. However, if Sams
Ventures is Defendant’s alter-ego, Defendant would have received a greater
amount of sale proceeds. Information about the purpose behind Sams Ventures’
formation will help Plaintiff determine this issue and assess the damages to
which he may be entitled. 
            Defendant
also objects that this request violates his right to privacy in his financial
affairs because Sams Ventures is a family LLC. (Valley Bank of Nevada v.
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) But Plaintiff has a
countervailing interest that outweighs the Defendant’s potential privacy
interest. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th
621, 656.) As noted above, Plaintiff needs this discovery to determine the
amount of sale proceeds that Defendant allegedly withheld from Plaintiff in
violation of the parties’ partnership agreement. Thus, further response is
necessary.
            RFP
No. 47 
            This
RFP seeks documents and communications referencing Defendant’s membership in or
management of Sams Ventures. Based on the court’s prior ruling, Defendant
objects in part that this information is not relevant or discoverable. The
court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the parties’
partnership agreement by not sharing 25% of the proceeds Defendant received
from the sale of Straight Smile. Defendant held stock in Straight Smile through
Sams Ventures, and claims he only received sale proceeds in proportion to his
ownership interest in Sams Ventures. However, if Sams Ventures is Defendant’s
alter-ego, Defendant would have received a greater amount of sale proceeds.
Information about how Defendant managed Sams Ventures will help Plaintiff
determine this issue and assess the damages to which Plaintiff may be entitled.

            Defendant
also objects that this request violates his right to privacy in his financial
affairs because Sams Ventures is a family LLC. (Valley Bank of Nevada v.
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) But Plaintiff has a
countervailing interest that outweighs the Defendant’s potential privacy
interest. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th
621, 656.) As noted above, Plaintiff needs this discovery to determine the
amount of sale proceeds that Defendant allegedly withheld from Plaintiff in
violation of the parties’ partnership agreement. Thus, further response is
necessary.
            RFP
No. 49
            This RFP seeks all documents and
communications referencing Damschroder’s role in or relationship to Sams
Ventures. Defendant objects in part that this information is not relevant or
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant’s
objection is well taken. That is, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the
parties’ partnership agreement by not sharing 25% of the proceeds from the sale
of Straight Smile with Plaintiff. Defendant held stock in Straight Smile
through Sams Ventures. To determine damages, Plaintiff would need to know how
much money Sams Ventures distributed to Defendant from the sale. Information
about Damschroeder’s role in Sams Ventures is not necessary to determine how
much money Defendant received from the sale. Moreover, this request also has
the potential to cover information protected by the attorney-client privilege,
as Damschroeder was Defendant’s attorney. Further response is not necessary. 
CONCLUSION
                The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendant’s further responses to requests for production of documents
(set two) in part. Defendant shall provide further responses to RFP Nos. 38,
39, and 47 within 30 days of this order. The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant’s further response to RFP No. 49.
                Plaintiff shall give notice.
