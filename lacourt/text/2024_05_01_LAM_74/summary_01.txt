And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants plaintiff Mitch Jacobs' motion to compel defendant Scott Cohen's further responses to requests for production of documents (set two) in part. Defendant shall provide further responses to RFP Nos. 38, 39, and 47 within 30 days of this order. The court denies plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's further response to RFP No. 49. The court finds that the parties have sufficiently met and conferred, and that plaintiff needs this discovery to determine the amount of sale proceeds that defendant allegedly withheld from plaintiff in violation of the parties' partnership agreement.
