evidentiary matter submitted with the reply ordinarily should not be allowed,
the court has discretion to consider it as long as the party opposing the
motion for summary judgment has notice and an opportunity to respond to the new

The Court notes that the missing pages identifying the witness are part of the
deposition in this case, where counsel was present. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s

taken. (Opposition at p. 5.)

Plaintiff did not object to Gantchev’s declaration at paragraph 8.


[3]
Plaintiff did not object to Gantchev’s declaration at paragraph 9 on hearsay
grounds, but only the basis that this paragraph lacks foundation as to “agent.”
