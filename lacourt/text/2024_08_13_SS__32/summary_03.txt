And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena issued by Security Paving Company, Inc. to Verizon Wireless seeking telephone records for Decedent Eric Lamont Armstead. The subpoena seeks records from November 25, 2020 to November 26, 2020, including incoming and outgoing calls, data transmission, and call detail. The judge finds that the subpoena is overbroad and irrelevant, and grants the motion to quash. The judge also finds that the subpoena violates a privacy interest, but does not require a compelling interest because the records are not obvious invasions of interest fundamental to personal autonomy. The judge declines to award monetary sanctions and orders the Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of the court's order.
