Judge's Tentative Ruling: Motion to be Relieved as Counsel

The Court is considering a motion by Plaintiff Andrew Ramirez's Counsel, Alan Finestone, to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodged a proposed order on form MC-053 as required. Counsel has provided valid reasons for withdrawal, including health problems that prevent him from representing Plaintiff at trial, and Plaintiff's refusal to cooperate and refusal to obtain a new attorney.

The Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal and grants the motion to relieve counsel. Counsel shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
