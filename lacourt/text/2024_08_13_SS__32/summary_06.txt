And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The defendants had argued that there was no evidence of breach and causation for the premises liability and negligence causes of action. However, the judge finds that a triable issue of fact exists regarding breach and causation because the plaintiff claims that he tripped on the height differential between the planter and cement, which was not an open and obvious danger. The judge also finds that the defendants did not present sufficient evidence to establish that the alleged condition was open and obvious, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment/adjudication is denied.
