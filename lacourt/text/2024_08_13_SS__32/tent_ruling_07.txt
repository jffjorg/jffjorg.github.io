Defendants appear to request that the Court find the defect was open and
obvious, based solely on the Court’s review of photographs, with no notice to
Plaintiff and no evidence submitted in support of this argument other than the
photographs. (See Reply at p. 3 [“where photographs of the condition in
question are submitted in support of the summary judgment from which the court
can conclude that the condition was open and obvious, expert witness testimony
to the contrary did not create a triable issue of fact.”].) The photographs do
not demonstrate that the defect was open and obvious as a matter of law. (See Kasparian
v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 11, 25 [summary
judgment cannot be granted where reasonable minds could differ as to whether
the defect was trivial or open and obvious].)
