And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering additional evidence submitted by the plaintiff in response to a summary judgment motion. The plaintiff argues that a deposition contains testimony from an unknown person, but the judge notes that the deposition was taken with counsel present and the missing pages are part of the deposition. The judge also rules that the plaintiff did not properly object to certain paragraphs in a declaration submitted by the defendant, Gantchev. The judge will consider the additional evidence and the plaintiff's arguments in making a final decision on the summary judgment motion.
