And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is related to a motion filed by Plaintiff Javier Mejia's Counsel, Azuka L. Uzoh, seeking to be relieved as Counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the Counsel failed to provide sufficient information for the Court to review the request. Additionally, Counsel was unable to confirm Plaintiff's address, and failed to file a proposed order and future proceedings information as required.

The Judge denied the motion without prejudice, citing the need for Counsel to provide more information and make further attempts to confirm Plaintiff's address. The Judge also noted that Counsel has not complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362 and California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700. The Judge emphasized that an attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and withdraw from a case is not absolute, and that the decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the court's discretion.
