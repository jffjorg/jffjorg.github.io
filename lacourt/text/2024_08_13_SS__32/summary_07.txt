And here is the summary in English text:

The defendants are attempting to convince the court that the defect was open and obvious, solely based on the court's review of photographs that were submitted without notice to the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the photographs do not demonstrate that the defect was open and obvious as a matter of law. The court cites the case of Kasparian v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 11, 25, which states that summary judgment cannot be granted where reasonable minds could differ as to whether the defect was trivial or open and obvious. Therefore, the court is not convinced that the defect was open and obvious and will likely deny the defendant's request for summary judgment.
