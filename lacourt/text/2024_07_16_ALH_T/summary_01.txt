And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling grants plaintiff Sevana Khajadourian's motion to file a First Amended Complaint to add a Second Cause of Action for Negligence against Maquire Properties - 350 S. Figueroa LLC and Doe Defendants 4-50. The court finds that amendment is warranted due to the plaintiff's lack of knowledge of the facts giving rise to the Second Cause of Action at the time of the original Complaint. The court also finds that the remaining defendants will not be prejudiced by the amendment, as they have been participating in written discovery. The court notes that the proposed amendments are premised on the same underlying accident, claims, and facts already raised in the present Complaint. The court further finds that the plaintiff has complied with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and has demonstrated good cause for the amendment. The court orders the plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint within 20 days of this order.
