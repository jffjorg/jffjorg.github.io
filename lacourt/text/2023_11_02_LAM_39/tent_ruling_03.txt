Motion to Strike
Second Amended Complaint
 
            The Court
posts this order on Monday, October 30, 2023, in advance of the hearing on Defendants’
motion to strike, which is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023, at 8:30
a.m.  The Court provides notice that if
Plaintiff does not appear, either remotely or in-person, absent good cause, Plaintiff
shall waive the right to be heard on this motion and shall submit to entry of
this order.  If Plaintiff wishes to
appear remotely but is experiencing difficulty, Plaintiff may contact the Court’s
clerk, Roberto Mendoza, at (213) 633-0159 for assistance.  
 
            Plaintiff Genesis
Pink (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on February 10, 2023, and filed a first
amended complaint on July 25, 2023.  The first
amended complaint asserts 12 causes of action against Defendant 5335 West Adams
LA, LLC and six individual defendants (collectively, “Defendants”).  Then, on August 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
second amended complaint without leave of the Court.  Therefore, Defendants filed a motion to
strike.  Per Code of Civil Procedure section
472, Plaintiff was permitted to file an amended complaint without leave of the Court
only once.  Therefore, the Court orders
as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants Defendants’ motion to
strike.
 
            2.         The second amended complaint is stricken
and the first amended complaint shall be the operative complaint.
 
            3.         Defendants shall file an answer or responsive
pleading within thirty (30) days.
 
            4.         Defendants’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
