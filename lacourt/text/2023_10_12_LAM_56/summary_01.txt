And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants in this case. The plaintiffs, Leobardo Segura-Meza, et al., have alleged that the defendants, Agoura Hills Marble and Granite, Inc., et al., concealed information about the hazardous materials used in the manufacturing process, which caused Segura-Meza to develop silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

The defendants have filed demurrers arguing that the allegations in the first amended complaint are uncertain and fail to state a claim for fraudulent concealment. The judge has sustained the demurrers with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs have the opportunity to re-file their complaint with additional specificity.

The defendants have also filed motions to strike the allegations regarding punitive damages, which the judge has granted with 20 days leave to amend. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiffs may need to re-file their complaint with more specificity to state a claim for fraudulent concealment, and that the allegations regarding punitive damages may need to be re-worded.
