MOVING
PARTIES: Defendants Parsoda USA, Inc. (“Parsoda”); Caesarstone USA, Inc.
(“Caesarstone”); Lyons Marble, Inc. (“Lyons”); and M S International (“M S”)
(collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
            
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of alleged
injuries caused by exposure to hazardous materials. The currently operative
first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) negligence; (2) strict
liability – warning defect; (3) strict liability – design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium.  
 
In
relevant part, the FAC alleges: Plaintiff Leobardo Segura-Meza (“Segura-Meza”)
performed work fabricating and installing granite, marble, and artificial stone
counters from about 2012 to 2022.  (FAC
¶ 73.)  During this employment
period, Segura-Meza was exposed to toxicologically significant amounts of
silica and metals that were present in products manufactured by Moving
Defendants.  (See FAC ¶¶ 72,
74.)  In March 2022, Segura-Meza was
diagnosed with silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis as a result to exposure to the
toxins in Moving Defendants’ products. 
(FAC ¶ 76.)  Although Moving
Defendants were aware of the high concentrations of crystalline silica in their
artificial stone products, the health risks of exposure to their products, and
that Segura-Meza and his employers did not know of the products’ hazards or the
necessary protective measures to mitigate the risk of exposure, Moving
Defendants concealed information regarding the necessary protective measures
for preventing fabricators and installers from getting silicosis.  (See FAC ¶¶ 483-86.)
 
Moving
Defendants each filed a demurrer (collectively, the “Demurrers”) to the fourth
cause of action on the grounds that the FAC fails to allege sufficient facts to
state a fraudulent concealment claim and is uncertain.  Moving Defendants also each filed a motion to
strike (collectively, the “Motions”) portions of the FAC concerning punitive
damages.[1]
 
DEMURRER
Meet
and Confer
            The meet and
confer requirement has been met for the Demurrers and Motions.
 
Legal Standard
A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored.  (Chen
v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.)  A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.  (Id.) 

 
 
 
 
Fraudulent Concealment
The
elements of fraudulent concealment are: (1) misrepresentation by nondisclosure;
(2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (4)
justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. 
(Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.)  To plead fraud by omission, the plaintiff
must also plead that the defendant was under a duty to disclose the allegedly
omitted fact.  (Lopez v. Nissan North
America, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 72, 596.)  There are four circumstances that impose a
duty on the defendant such that nondisclosure or concealment may constitute
actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with
the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant has exclusive knowledge of material facts
not known to plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 276, 310-11.)  The heightened
pleading for standard for fraud claims is relaxed if it appears from the nature
of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full
information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge of opposing
parties.  (Alfaro v. Community Housing
Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356,
1384-85; see also Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
1187, 1198-1200 (discussing pleading standard for fraudulent concealment in
toxic tort cases).)  The plaintiff need
not plead specific information that should be within the knowledge of the
defendant.  (West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
 
A
transaction giving rise to a duty to disclose, as would support a claim for
intentional concealment, must necessarily arise from direct dealings between
the plaintiff and defendant; it cannot arise between the defendant and the
public at large.  (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 312).  As a matter of common sense, such a
relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort
of transaction between the parties. 
(LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 337.)  Thus, a duty to disclose may arise from the
relationship between seller and buyer, employer and prospective employee,
doctor and patient, or parties entering into any kind of contractual
agreement.  (Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum Com. v. Insomniac, Inc. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 803, 831.)  
 
            The Demurrers raise similar arguments about the
specificity of the allegations in the FAC and the requisite facts necessary to
allege fraudulent concealment.  While the
specificity standard for pleading fraud claims is relaxed in circumstances
where the allegations concern information that is in the defendant’s control,
here, the FAC lacks information that is within Plaintiffs’ control, such as the
approximate timeframe during which Meza-Segura used Moving Defendants’
respective products.  The Court therefore
SUSTAINS the Demurrers with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
MOTIONS TO STRIKE
Legal Standard
A motion to strike either: (1) strikes any
irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strikes
any pleading or part thereof not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
this state, a court rule or order of court.  (CCP § 436.)
Punitive
Damages
A plaintiff may recover punitive damages in an
action for breach of an obligation not arising from contract when the plaintiff
proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ. Code
§ 3294, subd. (a).)  
 
            The
FAC seeks punitive damages in connection with the fraudulent concealment
claim.  In light of the Court’s ruling on
the Demurrers regarding the sufficiency of the fraudulent concealment
allegations, the Court GRANTS the Motions with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
