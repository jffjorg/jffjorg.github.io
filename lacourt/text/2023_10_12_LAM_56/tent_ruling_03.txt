MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).  
 
BACKGROUND
            On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the
“Complaint”) that alleges violation of Proposition 65.  
 
            On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enter
judgment (the “Motion”) on the grounds that Plaintiff and Defendant Lizard
Skins, LLC (“Defendant”) have entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Settlement”) and stipulated to have the Court enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the Settlement.[1]
 
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 664.6, if parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  (CCP § 664.6, subd. (a).)  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.  (Id.)

 
In
support of the Motion, Plaintiff provides evidence of the Settlement.  (See Declaration of Vineet Dubey
(“Dubey Decl.”) ¶ 9, Exhibit 2.)  The Settlement includes a provision that
provides for the Court’s authority to enter judgment and includes terms that
satisfy the requirements of Health and Safety Code section 25249.7, subd.
(f)(4).)
 
As
it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
 
Parties
