And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff's Request No. 11. Defendant is ordered to provide further code-compliant responses to the request within 30 days. The Court finds that Defendant's objections to the request are without merit. Specifically, the Court finds that Defendant's objections based on relevance, privilege, and privacy are without merit. The Court modifies the request to seek only documents directly complaining of Dr. Castillo's conduct in providing medical services. The Court also finds that Defendant's privacy objections are without merit, particularly where Plaintiffs appear amenable to measures which would limit the disclosure of any private patient information.
