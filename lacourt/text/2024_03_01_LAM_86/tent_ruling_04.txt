[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINTS FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF 
 
 
Under the Housing
Accountability Act (HAA), Government Code[1] section 65589.5, a municipality may not
“disapprove” a qualifying affordable housing project on the grounds it does not
comply with the municipality’s zoning and general plan if the developer
submitted either a statutorily defined “preliminary application” or a “complete
development application” while the city’s Housing Element was not in
substantial compliance with state law. (See § 65589.5, subds. (d)(5), (h)(5),
(o)(1).) This statutory provision, colloquially known as the “Builder’s
Remedy,” incentivizes compliance with the Housing Element Law by temporarily
suspending the power of non-compliant municipalities to enforce their zoning
rules against qualifying affordable housing projects.
 
Respondents, the
City of La Cañada Flintridge, the City of La Cañada Flintridge Community
Development Department, and the City of La Cañada Flintridge City Council (collectively,
Respondents or the City) determined Petitioner 600 Foothill Owner, L.P.’s (600
Foothill) proposed mixed-use development did not qualify for the Builder’s
Remedy. Petitioner 600 Foothill, Petitioner California Housing Defense Fund
(CHDF), and Petitioners-Intervenors the People of the State of California, Ex.
Rel. Rob Bonta and the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD)(collectively, Intervenors), challenge Respondents’ decision.
 
The petitions are
granted. The court orders a writ shall issue directing Respondents to set aside
their May 1, 2023 decision finding 600 Foothill’s application does not qualify
as Builder’s Remedy and to process the application in accordance with the HAA.
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
600 Foothill’s
Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) filed November 8, 2023 is denied as to
Exhibit A and granted as to Exhibits B through F. Respondents’ objections to
Exhibits B through F are overruled. Respondents’ objections 1 and 4 are
sustained to the extent they pertain to Exhibit A.
 
Respondents’ RJN in
support of its opposition to the 600 Foothill petition is granted as to all
referenced exhibits except as to Exhibits D-3, V and BB.[2]  
 
600 Foothill’s
Reply RJN of Exhibit AA is granted.  
 
CHDF’s RJN of
Exhibits A through D is granted.  
 
Respondents’ RJN in
support of its opposition to the CHDF petition is granted as to all referenced
exhibits except as to Exhibit D-3 and V. Except as to Exhibits D-3 and V, the
objections of Intervenors and CHDF are overruled.  
 
For all RJNs, the
court does not judicially notice any particular interpretation of the
records.  Nor does the court judicially
notice the truth of hearsay statements within the judicially noticed records.  
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS, MOTION IN LIMINE AND CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1094.5,
SUBDIVISION (E)
 
Preliminarily, the court finds none of the
parties’ evidentiary objections are material to the disposition of any cause of
action or issue. The court nonetheless rules on the objections for
completeness. The court notes it is not required to parse through long narratives
with generalized objections. The court may overrule an objection if the
material objected to contains unobjectionable material. The parties make many
objections to multiple sentences where much or some of the material is not
objectionable. (See Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. East Bay Union of Machinists,
Local 1304, United Steelworkers . . . (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712.)

Motion In Limine
 
Respondents’ Motion
In Limine to Exclude Issues or Evidence (filed February 5, 2024) is
denied.  Respondents do not demonstrate
600 Foothill has submitted any evidence concerning “infeasibility” of the project
that is outside of the administrative record. Respondents do not require
discovery to respond to 600 Foothill’s infeasibility arguments given such
arguments are based entirely on the administrative record. (See § 65589.5,
subd. (m)(1); Code Civ. Proc., 
§
1094.5, subd. (e).)    
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, Subdivision (e)
 
Section
65589.5, subdivision (m)(1) in the HAA specifies “[a]ny action brought to
enforce the provisions of this section shall be brought pursuant to Section
1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. . . .” Accordingly, the HAA causes of
action are subject to the limitations on extra-record evidence in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, subd. (e). Nonetheless, the HAA causes of action
involve questions of substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law,
governed, at least in part, by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (See e.g., § 65587, subd. (d)(2).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5,
subdivision (e) does not apply to a cause of action governed by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085. 
 
The parties have
neglected to suggest which parts of their declarations are subject to Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1094.5, 1085 or both. The parties also have not moved
to augment the administrative record pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5, subdivision (e). Under the circumstances, the court will admit
and consider the parties’ declarations despite the court having made no order
to augment the record. The court notes, however, even if the court excluded all
the extra-record evidence submitted, including the lengthy Koleda declarations,
the result here would not change.

 
BACKGROUND
 
The Housing Element Law[4] 
 
“In 1980, the
Legislature enacted the Housing Element Law, ‘a separate, comprehensive
statutory scheme that substantially strengthened the requirements of the
housing element component of local general plans.’ ”  (Martinez v. City of Clovis (2023) 90
Cal.App.5th 193, 221-222 [Martinez].)
 
A housing element within
a general plan must include certain components, including, but not limited to:
an assessment of housing needs and the resources available and constraints to
meeting those needs; an inventory of sites available to meet the locality’s
housing needs at different income levels, including the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA); a statement of goals, quantified objectives, and policies to
affirmatively further fair housing; and a schedule of actions to address the
housing element’s goals and objectives. (§ 65583, subds. (a), (b), (c).)  
 
“A municipality
must review its housing element for the appropriateness of its housing goals,
objectives, and policies and must revise the housing element in accordance with
a statutory schedule. (§ 65588, subds. (a), (b).)
The interval between the due dates for the revised housing element is referred
to as a planning period or cycle, which usually is eight years.” (Martinez,
supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 221-222.)
 
“Before revising its housing element, a
local government must make a draft available for public comment and, after
comments are received, submit the draft, as revised to address the comments, to
the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). (§ 65585, subd. (b)(1); see § 65588 [review
and revision of housing element by local government].) After a draft is
submitted, the HCD must review it, consider any written comments from any
public agency, group, or person, and make written findings as to whether the
draft substantially complies with the Housing Element Law. (§ 65585, subds. (b)(3), (c), (d); . . . .)
[¶] If the HCD finds the draft does not substantially comply with the Housing
Element Law, the local government must either (1) change the draft to
substantially comply or (2) adopt the draft without changes along with a
resolution containing findings that explain its belief that the draft
substantially complies with the law. (§ 65585, subd. (f).)” (Martinez,
supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 221-222.)

The City’s October
2021 and October 2022 Draft Housing Elements, and HCD’s Findings the City Had
Not Attained Substantial Compliance with the Housing Element Law
 
Under the Housing
Element Law, the City had a statutory deadline of October 15, 2021 to adopt a
substantially compliant 6th cycle housing element. (AR 443.) The City submitted
its draft housing element to HCD on that day. (AR 443.)  
 
On December 3, 2021, HCD informed the City while the draft “addresses
many statutory requirements,” to comply with the Housing Element Law, significant
revisions were required. (AR 443, 445-453.) HCD identified fourteen areas within
the first version of the City’s draft housing element that required specific
programmatic revisions, organized into three broad categories—housing needs,
resources, and constraints; housing programs; and public participation. (AR
445-453.) As examples, HCD found the draft housing element lacked a sufficient site
inventory analysis identifying potential sites for housing development
distributed in a manner to affirmatively further fair housing, or an inadequate
site inventory of the City’s vacant and underutilized sites to meet the City’s
RHNA determination. (AR 445-447.) 
 
Ten months later, on October 4, 2022, the City adopted its 2021-2029 housing
element (October 2022 Housing Element). (AR 4504-4508, 4509 [Housing Element].)
The City thereafter submitted its adopted Housing Element to HCD for review.
(AR 5263.)
 
On December 6, 2022, HCD informed the City “[t]he adopted housing
element addresses most statutory requirements described in HCD’s [prior]
review; however, additional revisions are necessary to fully comply with State
Housing Element Law.” (AR 5263 [referencing a May 26, 2021 review].) HCD’s
findings of non-compliance for the October 2022 Housing Element are discussed further
in the Analysis section infra.
 
600 Foothill’s Preliminary Application 
 
On November 10, 2022—after the City’s adoption of the October 2022
Housing Element but before HCD’s December 6, 2022 review—600 Foothill submitted
the Preliminary Application seeking the City’s approval to construct a
mixed-used project on a site located at 600 Foothill Boulevard, which is
currently occupied by two vacant church buildings and a surface parking lot.
(AR 5241.) 600 Foothill proposed to build 80 apartments on the site, 16 of
which (or 20 percent) would be reserved for persons earning less than sixty
percent of the area median income (the Project). (AR 5243.) 600 Foothill’s
Preliminary Application explained “given that the City continues to have a
Housing Element that is out of compliance with state law,” 600 Foothill
proposed the Project as a Builder’s Remedy pursuant to section 65589.5,
subdivision (d) meaning the Project was not required to account for the City’s
zoning or general plan. (AR 5235.)

The City Staff Acknowledge Changes to the October 2022 Housing Element
Are Necessary to Comply with HCD’s Findings 
 
The City’s Director of Community Development, Susan Koleda,
acknowledged on January 11, 2023 in an email communication that “[a]ll
additional changes to the Housing Element have yet to be determined but will
likely require additional [Planning Commission/City Council] approval.” (AR
12894.) At the City’s January 12, 2023 Planning Commission meeting, City staff
acknowledged revisions were required for “the Housing Element to be in
conformance” with applicable law. (AR 5274-5275.) Director Koleda also stated in
a February 9, 2023 email communication that “additional clarifications were
required” to the October 2022 Housing Element, and “[t]he additional
information will be incorporated into a revised Housing Element, scheduled to
be adopted by the City Council on February 21, 2023. It will then be submitted
to HCD for review as a third submittal.” (AR 13011.)
 
The City Adopts a February 2023 Housing Element, Fails to Rezone, and
“Certifies” Its Substantial Compliance with the Housing Element Law 
 
On February 21, 2023, the City adopted its third revised housing
element, which addressed the deficiencies to the October 2022 Housing Element identified
by HCD. (AR 6274-6279.) In its resolution adopting the revised housing element,
the City Council stated it “certifies that the City’s Housing Element was in
substantial compliance with State Housing Element law as of the October 4, 2022
Housing Element adopted by the City Council. . . .” (AR 6274.) Despite use of
the word “certifies” in the City’s resolution, Director Koleda opined at the
February 21, 2023 council meeting that the “consensus” from the City Attorney,
the City’s consultants, and HCD was that “self-certification” of the City’s
housing element “is not an option.” (AR 6207-6208; see also Opposition to Intervenors
19:18-21:7 [“wrongly accuse . . . of ‘back-dating’ and ‘self-certifying’ ”].)  
 
At the time the City adopted its third revised housing element on
February 21, 2023, it had not completed the rezoning required by the Housing Element
Law. Accordingly, on April 24, 2023, HCD found, although the February 2023
housing element addressed the previously identified deficiencies in the October
2022 Housing Element, and met “most of the statutory requirements of State
Housing Law,” the City was not in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law because the City adopted the February 2023 housing element more
than one year past the statutory due date of October 15, 2021 and the City had
not completed its statutorily required rezoning. (AR 6297-6300; see also AR
7170-7171.) As a result, HCD found the City could not be deemed in substantial
compliance with state law until it completed all required rezones. (AR
6297-6300; see § 65588, subd. (e)(4)(C)(iii). [“A jurisdiction that adopts a
housing element more than one year after the statutory deadline . . . shall not
be found in substantial compliance with this article until it has completed the
rezoning required by” the Housing Element Law].) 
 
In its April 24, 2023 letter, HCD also opined that “a local
jurisdiction cannot ‘backdate’ compliance to the date of adoption of a housing
element,” and the City was not in substantial compliance with the Housing Element
Law as of October 4, 2022, notwithstanding its “certification” in the City’s
February 21, 2023 resolution. (AR 6297-6298.)
 
The City Determines 600 Foothill’s Preliminary Application Could Not
Rely on the Builder’s Remedy and the City Council Affirms the Decision 
 
On February 10, 2023, in response to 600 Foothill’s Preliminary Application,
the City issued an incompleteness determination (the First Incompleteness
Determination) requesting additional detail on several issues. The First
Incompleteness Determination did not allege any inconsistencies between the
Project and the City’s zoning and general plan. (AR 5276-5279.) Petitioner
supplemented its application materials in response to the First Incompleteness
Determination on April 28, 2023. (See AR 6305, 7095-7096, 7152-7153, 7169,
7166, 8050-8060.)
 
On March 1, 2023, the City issued a second incompleteness
determination (the Second Incompleteness Determination). The Second
Incompleteness Determination advised 600 Foothill the Builder’s Remedy did not
apply to the Project making the Preliminary Application incomplete for its
failure to comply with the City’s general plan zoning laws and residential density
limitations. (AR 6280-6281; see AR 7176.)

On March 9, 2023, 600 Foothill appealed
the Second Incompleteness Determination. (See 
§ 65943, subd. (c); AR 6282-6287, AR 12926.) In support of its appeal,
600 Foothill provided a letter from its attorney explaining 600 Foothill’s
position the City Council’s failure to grant the appeal would constitute a
violation of the HAA. (AR 6304-6462, 6317 [“flouts the law”].) 
 
The City Council heard 600 Foothill’s appeal on May 1, 2023. The City
Council voted unanimously to adopt Resolution No. 23-14, denying the appeal and
upholding the Second Incompleteness Determination (the May 1, 2023 Decision).
(AR 7151-7160, AR 7161-7168.)
 
On June 8, 2023, HCD sent the City a Notice of Violation advising the
City it violated the HAA and Housing Element Law by denying 600 Foothill’s appeal.
(AR 7170-7175.) HCD summarized the alleged violations: 
 
The City
cannot ‘backdate’ its housing element compliance date to an earlier date so as
to avoid approving a Builder’s Remedy application. In short, the October 4,
2022 Adopted Housing Element did not substantially comply with State Housing
Element Law, regardless of any declaration by the City. Therefore, the
Builder’s Remedy applies, and the City’s denial of the Project application
based on inconsistency with zoning and land use designation is a violation of
the HAA. (AR 7170.)   
 
///
 
The City Determines the Application is Complete and the Project is
Inconsistent with City’s Zoning Code and General Plan
 
On May 26, 2023, the City informed 600 Foothill that its Project
application was complete. (AR 7169.) On June 24, 2023, the City advised 600
Foothill:
 
[I]t
remains the City’s position (as affirmed by City Council on May 1, 2023) that
the 2021-2029 Housing Element was in substantial compliance with state law as
of October 4, 2022. Based on that, staff reviewed the project for consistency
with the General Plan, applicable provisions of the Downtown Village Specific
Plan (DVSP), the Zoning Code, and the density proposed within the 2021-2029
Housing Element. In accordance with [] § 65589.5(j)(2)(A), this letter serves
as an explanation of the reasons that the City considers the proposed project
to be inconsistent, not in compliance, or not in conformity with these
aforementioned guiding documents. (AR 7176.)
 
The City Completes Rezoning and HCD Certifies the City’s Substantial
Compliance with the Housing Element Law
 
On September 12, 2023, the City adopted a resolution completing its
rezoning commitments set forth in its housing element. HCD reviewed the
materials and, on November 17, 2023, sent a letter to the City finding the City
had “completed actions to address requirements described in HCD’s April 24,
2023 review letter.” (Coy Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. D.) 

 
Writ Proceedings 
 
On July 21, 2023,
600 Foothill filed its verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint for
declaratory and injunctive relief against Respondents. On July 25, 2023, CHDF
filed its verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory
relief. The court has related the two actions and coordinated them for trial
and legal briefing. The court denied Respondents’ motion to consolidate the two
actions.  
 
On December 20,
2023, pursuant to a stipulation, Intervenors filed their petition for writ of
mandate and complaint for declaratory relief in the CHDF proceeding.
 
For this
proceeding, the court has considered 600 Foothill’s Opening Brief, CHDF’s Opening
Brief, Intervenors’ Opening Brief, Respondents’ three opposition briefs, 600
Foothill’s Reply Brief, CHDF’s Reply Brief, Intervenors’ Reply Brief, the
administrative record, the joint appendix, all requests for judicial notice,
and all declarations (including exhibits).[5]  
 
///
 
///
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Pursuant to the Los
Angeles County Court Rules (Local Rules), “[t]he opening and opposition briefs
must state the parties’ respective positions on whether the petitioner is
seeking traditional or administrative mandamus, or both.” (Local Rules, Rule
3.231, subd. (i)(1).)  The parties must also
provide their position on the standard of review in their briefing. (See Local Rule,
Rule 3.231, subd. (i)(3).)  
 
600 Foothill, CHDF
and Respondents do not suggest the standard of review that applies to the
causes of action. Intervenors argue Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, not
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, applies to their petition.
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the relevant issues are
whether (1) the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) there was a
fair trial, and (3) there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of
discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).)
 
In administrative mandate proceedings not affecting a fundamental
vested right, the trial court reviews administrative findings for substantial
evidence. Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance which is
reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value. (Mohilef v. Janovici (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 305 n. 28.) Under
the substantial evidence test, “[c]ourts may reverse an [administrative]
decision only if, based on the evidence . . ., a reasonable person could not
reach the conclusion reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v. California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602,
610.) The court does “not weigh the evidence, consider the
credibility of witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it.” (Doe v. Regents of the
Univ. of Cal. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1073.)  
 
To obtain a traditional writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085, there are two essential findings. First, there must be a clear,
present, and ministerial duty on the part of the respondent. Second, a
petitioner must have a clear, present, and beneficial right to the performance
of that duty. (California Ass’n for
Health Services at Home v. Department of Health Services (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 696, 704.) “Generally, mandamus is available to compel a public agency's
performance or to correct an agency’s abuse of discretion when the action being
compelled or corrected is ministerial.” (AIDS Healthcare
Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 693, 700.)   
 
An agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code, § 664.)
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, the “trial court must afford a
strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20
Cal.4th 805, 817.) A petitioner seeking administrative mandamus has the burden of
proof and must cite the administrative record to support its
contentions. (See Alford v. Pierno (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691.) Similarly, a petitioner “bears the burden
of proof in a mandate proceeding brought under Code of Civil Procedure section
1085.” (California Correctional Peace
Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.) A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to a [challenge to an
administrative decision] and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742 [context of civil appeal.)
 
“ ‘On
questions of law arising in mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s]
independent judgment.’ . . . . Interpretation of a statute or regulation is a
question of law subject to independent review.” (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Petition for Writ of Mandate – Violations of the HAA 
 
600 Foothill, CHDF, and Intervenors seek a
writ of mandate to enforce the requirements of the HAA against the City. Among
other relief, they seek a writ directing Respondents to set aside the City Council’s
“decision, on May 1, 2023, to disapprove an application for a housing
development project at 600 Foothill Boulevard, and compelling Respondent to
approve the application or, in the alternative, to process it in accordance
with the law.” (CHDF Pet. Prayer 
¶ 1; see also 600
Foothill Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 3-5 and Intervenors Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 1-3.)[6]  
 
              Standard
of Review 
 
As noted, the HAA at section 65589.5,
subdivision (m)(1) specifies “[a]ny action brought to enforce the provisions of
this section shall be brought pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. . . .” Nonetheless, Intervenors argue Code of Civil Procedure section
1085, not Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, applies because Respondents
have a “ministerial duty under the HAA to process the Foothill Owner’s
Builder’s Remedy application.” (Intervenors’ Opening Brief 10:27; see Sunset
Drive Corp. v. City of Redlands (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 215, 221-222. [“A
writ of mandate may be issued by a court to compel the performance of a duty
imposed by law.”])
 
While there is a colorable argument Code
of Civil Procedure section 1085 applies to parts of the HAA claims involving
the Housing Element Law, given the Legislature’s clear instructions in section
65589.5, subdivision (m)(1), the court concludes Petitioners’ writ petitions to
enforce the HAA are all governed by Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5.  
 
The court’s task “is therefore to
determine whether the City ‘proceeded in the manner required by law,’ with a
decision supported by the findings, and findings supported by the evidence; if
not, the City abused its discretion.” (California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund
v. City of San Mateo
(2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 820, 837.) The City “bear[s] the
burden of proof that its decision has conformed to all of the conditions
specified in Section 65589.5.” (§
65589.6.)  
 
As noted, based on the circumstances, the
court reaches the same result in its analysis even if the petitions, or parts
thereof, are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (See e.g., §
65587, subd. (d)(2) [action to compel compliance with Housing Element Law
“shall” be brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085].) The HAA
claims raise legal questions of statutory construction and concerns about
Respondents’ substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law. The court decides
such issues independently, regardless of whether Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5 or 1085 governs. (See e.g. Martinez, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 237.)   
 
              The
City “Disapproved” the Builder’s Remedy Project 
 
600 Foothill contends the City
“disapproved” the Project, as the term is defined in the HAA, because the City
“determined that the Project could not proceed because it believed the
Builder’s Remedy was inapplicable.” (600 Foothill Opening Brief 7:11-12.) CHDF
and Intervenors make the same argument. (CHDF Opening Brief 21:25-28; Intervenors’
Opening Brief 15:27-16:3.)  
 
The Builder’s Remedy, at section 65589.5, subdivision
(d)(5) provides in pertinent part: 
 
(d) A local agency shall not disapprove a
housing development project . . . for very low, low-, or moderate-income
households . . . unless it makes written findings, based upon a preponderance
of the evidence in the record, as to one of the following:
              
. . . .
 
(5) The housing development project . . . is
inconsistent with both the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance and general plan
land use designation as specified in any element of the general plan as it
existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the
jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial compliance with this
article. (Emphasis added.)
 
Thus,
to prove their claim under the HAA and to proceed with the Project as a Builder’s
Remedy, Petitioners must show the City “disapprove[d] a housing development
project.” 
(§
65589.5, subd. (d).)[7] Section 65589.5, subdivision (h)(6)
provides to “ ‘disapprove the housing development project’ includes any
instance in which a local agency does any of the following: (A) Votes
on a proposed housing development project application and the application is
disapproved, including any required land use approvals or entitlements
necessary for the issuance of a building permit . . . .” (Emphasis added.)  
 
Here, on May 1, 2023, the City Council denied
Petitioner’s appeal of the Second Incompleteness Determination stating: 
 
[T]he City Council of the City of La Cañada
Flintridge hereby denies the appeal and upholds the Planning Division’s March
1, 2023, incompleteness determination for the mixed use project at 600 Foothill
Boulevard, on the basis that the ‘builder’s remedy’ under the Housing
Accountability Act does not apply and is not available for the project, and
that the project did not ‘vest’ as a ‘builder’s remedy’ project as alleged in
the project’s SB 330 Preliminary Application submission dated November 14,
2022, because the City’s Housing Element was, as of October 4, 2022, in
substantial compliance with the Housing Element law. (AR 7167.)
 
Notably, Director Koleda informed the City Council,
prior to its vote on the appeal, that “if the appeal is denied, the project
will be processed accordingly as a standard, nonbuilder's remedy project.” (AR
7103.) Thus, the City Council “voted” on a proposed housing development project
application and determined the Project could not proceed as a Builder’s Remedy
project—that is, the Project would be subject to the City’s discretionary
approvals. 
 
The Legislature has expressed its intent that the HAA
“be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible
weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.” (§ 65589.5,
subd. (a)(2)(L); California
Renters Legal Advocacy & Education Fund. v. City of San Mateo, supra, 68 Cal.App.5th at 854.) In addition, “[a]s a basic
principle of statutory construction, ‘include’ is generally used as a word of
enlargement and not of limitation. . . . Thus, where the word ‘include’ is used
to refer to specified items, it may be expanded to cover other items.” (Rea
v. Blue Shield of California (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1227.) Applying
these canons of statutory construction, the court finds section 65589.5,
subdivision (h)(6) should be given a broad construction. Because the City
Council made clear any required land use approvals or entitlements would not be
issued for the Project, as a Builder’s Remedy project, the City
Council’s May 1, 2023 decision falls within the HAA’s broad definition of
“disapprove.”  
 
///
 
///
Respondents contend: 
 
600 Foothill defined the “approvals” and “entitlements”
it sought in its application – namely, a Conditional Use Permit
(USE-2023-0016), Tentative Tract Map 83375 (LAND-2023-0001), and Tree Removal
Permit (DEV-2023-0003). (AR 5285.) There was no vote on May 1, 2023, on any
of these “required land use approvals” or “entitlements” and, thus, . . .
the “vote” needed under the HAA has not occurred. (Opposition to 600 Foothill
19:22-26 [emphasis in original].)
 
Respondents’ narrow interpretation of the statute is unpersuasive.
(See § 65589.5, subd. (a)(2)(L).) While the City Council may not have voted to
deny the conditional use permit, tentative tract map, and tree removal permit, the
City Council voted on May 1, 2023 and determined the Project could not proceed
as the project proposed—a Builder’s Remedy project. Because the Project was
proposed as a Builder’s Remedy, the City Council’s May 1, 2023 vote on the
project application was a “disapproval” within the meaning of the HAA.
 
Respondents also contend “[t]he City cannot as a
matter of law approve or disapprove a development project, including a project
under the Builder’s Remedy, prior to conducting environmental review under CEQA
. . . .”[8] (Opposition to 600 Foothill 16:15-16.)
Respondents argue the HAA does not authorize the court “to order the City to
accommodate CEQA review after a possible finding by the Court of a
violation of the HAA.” (Opposition to 600 Foothill 16:25-26 [emphasis in
original].)
 
Again, Respondents’ arguments are unpersuasive—a city
can disapprove a project without an CEQA review. Nothing requires a city to
under CEQA review before deciding to disapprove a project. Further, CEQA does
not apply to “[p]rojects which a public agency rejects or disapproves.” (Pub.
Res. Code, § 21080, subd. (b)(5).) “[I]f an agency at any time decides not to
proceed with a project, CEQA is inapplicable from that time forward.”  (Las Lomas Land Co., LLC v. City of Los
Angeles (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 837, 850.) Respondents do not cite any
language from the HAA that supports their position.
 
While CEQA review is preserved by the HAA[9] nothing suggests a disapproval
under the HAA can occur only after CEQA review or a court lacks authority to
issue a writ to compel compliance with the HAA, even if a Builder’s
Remedy project is subject to CEQA compliance. Notably, a suit to enforce the HAA must be filed “no later
than 90 days from” project disapproval. (§ 65589.5, subd. (m).) Further, the HAA must “be
interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible weight
to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.” 
(§ 65589.5, subd. (a)(2)(L).) Respondents’
interpretation of the HAA, under which a disapproval cannot occur prior to CEQA
review, would hinder the approval and provision of housing. Accordingly, an
agency may “disapprove” a project under the HAA before conducting any environmental
review under CEQA, and a petitioner’s claim to enforce the HAA may be ripe for
consideration even if CEQA review has not been performed or completed.  
 
Respondents’
reliance on Schellinger Brothers v. City of Sebastopol (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 1245, 1262 [Schellinger] is misplaced. Schellenger involved
a request to compel the certification of an environmental impact report.
Schellinger did not hold that all claims under the HAA or other housing
laws are unripe or cannot be filed until CEQA review is completed. It also did
not suggest a trial court lacks discretion to structure a writ issued pursuant
to the HAA in a manner that allows for CEQA review to be completed. “An opinion
is not authority for propositions not considered.” (People
v. Knoller (2007) 41 Cal.4th 139, 154-55.)
 
The court
acknowledges Schellinger advised the HAA “specifically pegs its applicability
to the approval, denial or conditional approval of a ‘housing development
project’ . . . which, as previously noted, can occur only after the EIR is
certified. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15090(a).)”  (Schellinger, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th
at 1262.) Nonetheless, the court’s statement must be interpreted in the context
of the issues before that Court. Because the agency there had not disapproved
the project at issue, the Court’s reference to the “denial” of a housing
development project was a dictum. In any event, as discussed, Schellinger
did not decide the legal question presented here—whether the City
“disapproved” a Project when it determined, through a vote of its City Council,
the Builder’s Remedy Project did not qualify for the Builder’s Remedy under the
HAA.[10]  
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioners have demonstrated the City Council
“disapproved” the Project, within the meaning of the HAA, with its May 1, 2023 Decision.
Respondents do not show the petitions are “unripe” because CEQA review has not
been completed, or that CEQA review is a prerequisite to the “disapproval” of a
Project under the HAA. In light of the court’s conclusion, the court need not
reach the parties’ contentions regarding California Renters v. City San
Mateo (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 820 and appellate briefing from that case. (See
Opposition to 600 Foothill 17:10-28 [citing Sheridan Decl. Exh. EE and FF].)
 
“Vesting” of the Builder’s Remedy and the
Date the Project Application was Deemed Complete 
 
Respondents assert the filing of a
SB 330 preliminary application does not “vest” the Builder’s Remedy because
“when a city is determining whether it can make the finding in subsection
(d)(5), it considers the status of its Housing Element as of the date the
finding is made.” (Opposition to 600 Foothill 23:11-13 [emphasis in
original].)  
 
The HAA defines “deemed complete” to mean that “the applicant
has submitted a preliminary application pursuant to Section
65941.1.” (§ 65589.5, subd. (h)(5).) Section 65589.5, subdivision (o)(1)
states “a housing development project shall be subject only to the ordinances,
policies, and standards adopted and in effect when a preliminary application
including all of the information required by subdivision (a) of Section 65941.1 was submitted.” Construing
these statutory provisions, along with section 65589.5, subdivision (d), the
court concludes a Builder’s Remedy “vests” if the local agency does not have a
substantially compliant housing element at the time a complete preliminary
application pursuant to section 65941.1 is submitted and “deemed complete.”  
 
Respondents have not developed any argument the Preliminary
Application, submitted in November 2022, lacked the information required by
section 65941.1 or was otherwise incomplete within the meaning of the HAA. (See
AR 5234-5246.) Thus, if the City’s housing element did not substantially comply
with the Housing Element Law at that time (see analysis infra), the
Builder’s Remedy “vested” when 600 Foothill submitted its Preliminary
Application in November 2022.[11]  
 
Respondents’ reliance on subdivision (o) of the HAA
is misplaced. Section 65589.5, subdivision (o)(4) provides “ ‘ordinances,
policies, and standards’ includes general plan, community plan, specific
plan, zoning, design review standards and criteria, subdivision standards and
criteria, and any other rules, regulations, requirements, and policies of a
local agency.” (Empasis added.)  The
housing element is a mandatory element of the general plan. (§ 65582, subd. (f).)  Section 65589.5, subdivision (o)(1) precludes
Respondents from retroactively applying a housing element to a Builder’s Remedy
project that “vested” before certification of the housing element.  
 
Respondents’ vesting argument is also inconsistent
with the HAA’s policy of promoting housing. (§ 65589.5, subd. (a)(2)(L).) If
Respondents were correct, “no housing
developer would ever submit a builder’s remedy application because of the
uncertainty about whether the project would remain eligible long enough to be
approved.” (CHDF Reply 19:8-9.)  
 
600 Foothill’s application was “deemed
complete,” for purposes of the HAA, in November 2022 when 600 Foothill
submitted its Preliminary Application.  If
the Builder’s Remedy applies (see infra), it therefore “vested” in
November 2022.[12]  
 
The City
Could Not Be in Substantial Compliance with the Housing Element Law until it
Completed Rezoning 
 
Petitioners
contend the City’s housing element was not in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law when 600 Foothill filed its Preliminary Application because the
City had not completed the rezoning required by sections 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A)
and section 65583.2, subdivision (c). (See 600 Foothill Opening Brief 12:21-23.)
Petitioners are correct.
 
Section
65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(i) states: 
 
For the adoption of
the sixth revision and each subsequent revision, a local government that does
not adopt a housing element that the department has found to be in substantial
compliance with this article within 120 days of the applicable deadline described
in subparagraph (A) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall comply with subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (c) of Section 65583 and subdivision (c) of Section 65583.2 within
one year of the statutory deadline to revise the housing element.
 
Section
65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) states: 
 
A jurisdiction that
adopts a housing element more than one year after the statutory deadline
described in subparagraph (A) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall not be found in
substantial compliance with this article until it has completed the rezoning
required by subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (c) of Section 65583 and subdivision (c) of Section 65583.2. (Emphasis
added.)  
 
The
legislative history of Assembly Bill 1398, which added section 65588,
subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii), demonstrates the Legislature specifically intended
to tie the rezoning deadlines to HCD’s certification of substantial
compliance:  
 
This bill would
revise the penalty for failure to adopt a housing element in a timely way. . .
. In place of the existing requirement, this bill would require that any local
government that fails to adopt its housing element within 120 days of the
statutory deadline would only have one year from the housing element's
statutory deadline to complete any required rezonings, instead of the current
allotment of three years and 120 days. This change could substantially
expedite the timeframe by which new production could occur in these
jurisdictions. . . . This bill also adds that, to
avoid the expedited timeline, the housing element must be determined by HCD to
be substantially compliant with housing element law. This change removes the
circumstances where jurisdictions adopt non-compliant housing elements to avoid
penalties. (600 Foothill RJN Exh. D at RJN082.)
 
The plain
language of section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) and its legislative
history also demonstrate the Legislature intended for the statutory substantial
compliance bar to apply to the courts. As originally drafted, that legislation
provided: 
 
If a jurisdiction
adopts a housing element more than one year after the statutory deadline, the
department [HCD] shall not find that jurisdiction’s housing element to be in
substantial compliance with this article . . . until all required rezoning is
complete. (RJN, Ex. E, at RJN 149 (emphasis added).) 
 
In a
September 3, 2021 amendment, the HCD-specific language was stricken and
replaced with the current language. The adopted version is not limited to HCD;
the statute mandates the jurisdiction “shall not be found in substantial
compliance” until completing the rezoning. (Ibid.)[13] 
 
As applied here, the City’s
statutory deadline to adopt a substantially compliant 6th cycle housing element
was October 15, 2021. (AR 443.) The City submitted its draft housing element on
October 15, 2021. (AR 443.) Because the City failed to secure certification of
the housing element within 120 days (see AR 443-447), October 15, 2022 served
as the City’s deadline to complete its required rezoning. It is undisputed the
City did not complete the required rezoning until September through November
2023.  
 
Pursuant to the plain language of section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii),
the City “shall not be found” in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law until the City completed its rezoning in September through November
2023. As a result, the City did not have a substantially compliant housing
element when 600 Foothill submitted its Preliminary Application to the City in
November 2022; the Builder’s Remedy applies to the Project.
 
Respondents
do not challenge the plain language interpretation of section 65588,
subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii). Thus, they concede where an agency has failed to
adopt a substantially compliant housing element by more than a year after the
statutory deadline to do so, the agency cannot be found in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law by HCD or a court until it completes
its required rezoning. (Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328,
1345, fn. 16 [failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  
 
Respondents contend the “City could not rezone until it had a General
Plan Housing Element under Section 65860(c), HCD did not promulgate draft [Affirmatively Further Fair Housing]
requirements for the 6th Cycle housing element until April 23, 2020, and did
not promulgate the final version until April 2021, only six months before the
then-existing deadline (within SCAG) for submitting a 6th RHNA Cycle Housing
Element.” (Opposition to CHDF 8: 11-15.) 
 
Respondents’ evidence does not demonstrate actions or omissions of HCD
or the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) precluded the City
from adopting a substantially compliant housing element or the required
rezoning. Director Koleda advises the final affirmatively further fair housing
requirements were available by April 2021, and the City’s RHNA increased by only
two dwelling units between March 22, 2021 and July 1, 2021. (Koleda Decl. ¶¶ 20,
36.) As persuasively argued by Intervenors, the City “had sufficient time to
accommodate its RHNA allocation, or at the very least, the two additional
dwelling units added between March and July 2021.” (Intervenors’ Reply 16, fn.
8.) Respondents also do not show, with persuasive evidence, the timing of HCD’s
promulgation of affirmatively further fair housing
requirements prevented the City from adopting a substantially compliant housing
element.  
 
Respondents also argue section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii)’s
rezoning requirement “is illegal, unconstitutional, and unenforceable” because
“[t]he Government Code specifically contemplates that rezoning will occur after
adoption of an amendment to a General Plan, including Housing Elements, . . . .”
(Opposition to Intervenors 12:19, 14:26-27.) Respondents’ statutory argument is
not fully developed, lacks sufficient analysis of governing legal principles,
and is unpersuasive.  
 
Respondents wholly fail to explain how section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii)
is “illegal” or “unconstitutional.” At most, Respondents assert section 65588,
subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) conflicts with other statutes requiring consistency
between the zoning ordinances of a general law city and its general plan, and
the requirement such zoning ordinances be amended “within a reasonable time” to
be consistent with a general plan that is amended. (Oppo. to Int. 13:13-16 [citing
§ 65860].)
 
Respondents do not show a conflict between section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii)
and section 65860 or any other statutes. Contrary to Respondents’ assertion, it
is possible for a city to comply with both statutes. Thus, as argued by 600
Foothill, a city could update its zoning simultaneously with the adoption of
its housing element. A city could also adopt a housing element that is
provisionally certified by HCD and then subsequently complete the rezoning,
which is what occurred here. While section 65588,
subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) may subject a city to the Builder’s Remedy it if
does not complete its rezoning at the same time adopts its housing element,
Respondents do not show such possibility conflicts with section 65860 or that
the Legislature lacked the authority to impose such measures to encourage the
development of housing.[14]  
 
Because the City had not completed its required rezoning, the City’s
housing element was not in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law
when 600 Foothill filed the Preliminary Application in November 2022.  As a result, the City Council prejudicially
abused its discretion when it found the Builder’s Remedy did not apply to the
Project in its May 1, 2023 Decision.    
 
Did the City’s October 2022 Housing
Element Substantially Comply with the Housing Element Law Without Consideration
of Rezoning?
 
In
its May 1, 2023 Decision, the City Council found “the ‘builder’s remedy’ under
the Housing Accountability Act does not apply and is not available for the
project . . . because the City’s Housing Element was, as of October 4, 2022, in
substantial compliance with the Housing Element law.” (AR 7167.)  Petitioners contend the City Council’s finding
was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The court agrees.
 
Standard
of Review—Substantial Compliance with Housing Element Law  
 
“In
an action to determine whether a housing element complied with the requirements
of the Housing Element Law, the court's review ‘shall extend to whether the
housing element  . . . substantially
complies with the requirements’ of the law. (§ 65587,
subd. (b),
italics added.) Courts have defined substantial compliance as ‘actual compliance
in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,’
as distinguished from ‘mere technical imperfections of form.’ [Citations.] Such
a review is limited to whether the housing element satisfies the statutory
requirements, ‘not to reach the merits of the element or to interfere with the
exercise of the locality’s discretion in making substantive determinations and
conclusions about local housing issues, needs, and concerns.’ ” (Martinez,
supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 237.)  
 
HCD is mandated by
statute to determine whether a housing element substantially complies with the
Housing Element Law. (See e.g., § 65585, subds. (i)-(j); Health & Saf. Code
§ 50459, subds. (a), (b).) Given HCD’s statutory mandate and its expertise,
HCD’s determination of substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law, or
lack thereof, is entitled to deference from the courts. (See Hoffmaster v.
City of San Diego (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1113, fn. 13 [“We
substantially rely on the Department of Housing and Community Development’s
interpretation [. . .] regarding compliance with the housing element law . . .
.”]; accord Martinez, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 243 [“courts generally
will not depart from the HCD's determination unless ‘it is clearly erroneous or
unauthorized’ ”].)  
 
However, “HCD’s housing
element compliance determinations are not binding on courts.” (See Intervenor
Reply 10:2; see also 600 Foothill Opening Brief 15:8-9.)  The
trial and appellate courts “‘independently ascertain
as a question of law whether the housing element at issue substantially
complies with the requirements of the Housing Element Law.’ . . .” (Martinez,
supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 237.)[15]  
 
Affirmatively Further
Fair Housing  
 
HCD
found the City’s October 2022 Housing Element did not substantially comply with
the City’s duties under the Housing Element Law to analyze how the housing
element will affirmatively further fair housing. Specifically, HCD wrote: 
 
While
the element now analyzes census tracts and sites with a concentration of
affordable units (p. D71-73), it should still discuss whether the distribution
of sites improves or exacerbates conditions. This is critical as the sites to
accommodate the lower-income households are only located along Foothill
Boulevard near the 210 Freeway. If sites exacerbate conditions, the element
should include programs to mitigate conditions (e.g., anti-displacement
strategies) and promote inclusive communities. (AR 5263-5264.)  
 
HCD
also found “the element must
include a complete assessment of fair housing. Based on the outcomes of that
analysis, the element must add or modify programs.” (AR 5264.)  
 
Housing
elements must contain “an inventory of land suitable and available for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having realistic and
demonstrated potential for redevelopment during the planning period to meet the
locality’s housing need for a designated income level”—the “sites inventory.” (§
65583, subd. (a)(3).) The sites inventory must be accompanied by “an analysis
of the relationship of the sites identified in the land inventory to the
jurisdiction’s duty to affirmatively further fair housing.” (Ibid.) In
addition, each updated housing element must include “a statement of the
community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
affirmatively furthering fair housing” (§ 65583(b)(1)), and must commit to
programs that will, among other things, “Affirmatively further fair housing in
accordance with [Section 8899.50].” (§ 65583, subd. (c)(10).)[16]
 
Here,
the October 2022 Housing Element discloses the sites identified by the City to
accommodate affordable housing are all located near the Foothill Freeway. (AR
5130.) In this context, HCD found the October 2022 Housing Element lacked
sufficient analysis of the relationship of the sites identified in the land
inventory to the City’s duty to affirmatively further fair housing, i.e.
whether the site inventory would improve or exacerbate fair housing conditions.
(AR 5263-5264.)
 
Respondents
do not cite to any specific analysis in the October 2022 Housing Element
addressing the concern raised by HCD. (See Opposition to 600 Foothill 9:14 [citing
AR 1741, 5203].) In fact, neither AR 1741 nor 5203 demonstrate the October 2022
Housing Element analyzed how the clustering of affordable housing near the
Foothill Freeway would promote or exacerbate fair housing. While Respondents
now explain in the context of this proceeding why the City clustered all
affordable housing near the freeway (See Koleda Decl. ¶¶ 9-16), Respondents
were required to include that analysis in the October 2022 Housing Element. (See
§ 65583, subds. (a)(3), (b)(1), and (c)(10).) 

 
Respondents
contend the “City undertook numerous outreach efforts to reach a variety of
economic groups, including via two housing workshops with 18 different
stakeholder organizations.” (Opposition to 600 Foothill 9:10-12 [citing Koleda
Decl. ¶¶ 38-50 and AR 3896-3900, 4651].) Respondents do not cite any authority
that outreach alone satisfies the City’s statutory obligations to include in its
housing element “an analysis of the relationship of the sites identified
in the land inventory to the jurisdiction's duty to affirmatively further fair
housing.” (§ 65583, subd. (a)(3) [emphasis added].) Exercising its independent
judgment on the statutory question, the court concludes outreach alone does not
substantially comply with the requirement—outreach does not constitute analysis.  
 
The
deficiencies in the October 2022 Housing Element as to the affirmatively
further fair housing analysis are demonstrated by changes made by the City in
the February 2023 Housing Element. Specifically, the February 2023 Housing
Element added analysis—“the sites to accommodate the lower and moderate-income
households are concentrated primarily in the western end of the City along the
Foothill Boulevard Corridor, and near the 210 Freeway.” (AR 6090.) The analysis
recognized “adverse air quality conditions have the potential to be
exacerbated” based on “close proximity to the freeway[.]” (AR 6090.) In
addition, the revised February 2023 Housing Element committed to Program 24 to
mitigate these impacts. (AR 6091; See also AR 5577-5578 [adding Program 24,
“Mitigation for Housing in Proximity to Freeways” committing to building design
measures for new residential development near the freeway].)
 
Respondents
contend “those air quality mitigation measures were adopted in 2013 and the
2023 Housing Element merely added a heading regarding these existing measures.”
(Opposition to 600 Foothill 9:7-8 [citing Koleda Decl. ¶ 33 and AR 4515].)
Respondents cite AQ Policy 1.1.6 from its General Plan Air Quality Element,
which states the policy to “Ensure that new developments implement air quality
mitigation measures, such as ventilation systems, adequate buffers, and other
pollution reduction measures and carbon sequestration sinks, especially those
that are located near existing sensitive receptors.” (Koleda Decl. ¶ 33.)  
 
While
Program 24 and AQ Policy 1.1.6 have similarities, they are not the same.
Program 24 identifies specific mitigation measures that apply to receptors near
the freeways and is enforceable by HCD. (See § 65585, subd. (i) [requiring HCD
to investigate a “failure to implement any program actions included in the
housing element.”].) In contrast, AQ Policy 1.1.6 is a shorter and more general
policy that is not enforceable by HCD as a housing element program. Contrary to
Respondents’ assertion, the inclusion of Program 24 in the February 2023
Housing Element supports HCD’s findings that the October 2022 Housing Element
lacked sufficient analysis of the City’s affirmatively further fair housing obligations.  
 
Exercising
its independent judgment, while giving the deference owed to HCD’s findings,
the court concludes that City’s October 2022 Housing Element did not
substantially comply with the affirmatively further fair housing requirements
in section 65583, subdivisions (a)(3), (b)(1), and (c)(10).[17]
 
Nonvacant Sites Analysis 
 
HCD found the October
2022 Housing Element’s analysis of nonvacant sites did not sufficiently analyze
“redevelopment potential and evaluate the extent existing uses impede
additional development.” (AR 5264.) HCD also found “as the element relies on
nonvacant sites to accommodate 50 percent or more of the housing needs for
lower-income households, the adoption resolution must make findings based on
substantial evidence in a complete analysis that existing uses are not an
impediment and will likely discontinue in the planning period.” (AR 5264.)
 
For nonvacant sites, the
Housing Element Law provides “the city or county shall specify the additional
development potential for each site within the planning period and shall
provide an explanation of the methodology used to determine the development
potential.” (§ 65583.2, subd. (g)(1).) In addition, “when a city or county is
relying on nonvacant sites . . . to accommodate 50 percent or more of its
housing need for lower income households, the methodology used to determine
additional development potential shall demonstrate that the existing use . . . does not
constitute an impediment to additional residential development during the
period covered by the housing element. An existing use shall be presumed to
impede additional residential development, absent findings based on substantial
evidence that the use is likely to be discontinued during the planning period.”
(§ 65583.2, subd. (g)(2).)  
 
The Court of Appeal explains “there are many types of sites
the Legislature has either deemed infeasible to support lower income housing or
that require additional evidence of their feasibility or by-right development
approvals before being deemed adequate to accommodate such housing [including] .
. . when a city relies on over 50 percent of the inventory to be accommodated
on nonvacant sites . . . . The goal is not just to identify land, but to
pinpoint sites that are adequate and realistically available for residential
development targets for each income level.” (Martinez, supra, 90
Cal.App.5th at 244.)
 
Here, more than 50
percent of the parcels included in the City’s site inventory to accommodate the
lower income RHNA are nonvacant. (AR 4506.) Accordingly, the City is required
to comply with section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2). The site inventory in the
October 2022 Housing Element does not show substantial compliance with section
65583.2, subdivision (g)(2). (See AR 5124-5129.) The criteria used to describe
nearly all of the lower income nonvacant sites are some combination of
“underutilized site,” “buildings that are older than 30 years,” “vacant lot or
parking lot with minimal existing site improvements,” “property has not been
reassessed” in some time, “antiquated commercial uses,” or “existing use
retained and institution would add residential units.” (AR 5124-5129; see also
AR 4601-4603 [discussing methodology].) While these factors may be relevant to
and inform on the analysis of “additional development potential” required by
section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(1), they do not sufficiently address in any
substantive way whether the sites are “likely to be discontinued during the
planning period,” as required by section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2).  
 
In the resolution
adopting the October 2022 Housing Element, the City Council made the following
finding: 
 
Based on general
development trends resulting from continuously rising land values, changes in
desired land uses, the financial pressures placed on religious institutions
that have been impacted by falling congregation numbers, aging structures, and
underutilized properties, rising demand for housing, adjacency to public
transportation and commercial services, and other factors/analysis as
identified in the Section 9.4.1.3 Future Residential Development Potential and
Section 9.4.1.4 Overview of Residential Development Potential and Realistic
Capacity Assumptions by Zone of the Housing Element, the existing uses on the
sites identified in the site inventory to accommodate the lower income RHNA are
likely to be discontinued during the planning period, and therefore do not
constitute an impediment to additional residential development during the
period covered by the housing element. (AR 4506.)
 
The City
Council’s generalized statement does not reference any specific evidence to
support a finding the existing uses of nonvacant sites, which were identified
to accommodate housing need for lower
income households, are “likely to be discontinued during the
planning period.”  (§ 65583.2, subd. (g)(2).)  
 
Further, Petitioners cite record evidence that the owners of
several of the nonvacant sites included in the October 2022 site inventory,
including certain sites identified for lower income households, informed the City
they did not intend to redevelop the site or discontinue the existing use
during the planning period. (See AR 5114-5116, 2222, 2238, 2206, 5126, 12812,
5233, 5123-5129, 6054-6061.)[18] Significantly, the City
subsequently amended the housing element to disclose that some of the
identified lower income category sites are “not currently available” and were
included in the site inventory “as a buffer site because it may become
available further along in the 6th cycle HE planning period.” (AR
6054-6061, 6098.) Such a change in
characterization is a major substantive change in the site inventory and demonstrates
the October 2022 Housing Element did not substantially comply with the Housing
Element Law.
 
The court has
also reviewed Director Koleda’s summary of changes to the October 2022 Housing
Element. The court concludes, on the whole, Director Koleda’s summary is
consistent with Petitioners’ arguments the October 2022 Housing Element was not
substantially compliant and required significant changes. (See Koleda Decl. ¶
56 and Exh. A.) As Intervenors argue, the substantial changes to the October
2022 Housing Element show the City did not substantially comply with section
65583.2, subdivision (g)(2) until after it adopted the October 2022 Housing
Element.  
 
Respondents assert the City “adopted a Site Inventory using both a data-driven
model endorsed by HCD . . . and along with that gathered ‘substantial evidence’
by sending TWO mailings to each commercial and religious property owner in the
City to determine potential inclusion on the Site Inventory.” (Opposition to
600 Foothill 11:9-12 [citing Koleda Decl. ¶¶ 29, 54-56].)  However, Respondents do not dispute it
included multiple nonvacant sites in the October 2022 Site Inventory for which the
City lacked substantial evidence, in October 2022, that the existing
uses were “likely to be discontinued during the planning period.” (§
65583.2, subd. (g)(2).) Notably, Respondents do not cite any written
communications with the nonvacant site owners, prior to the adoption of the October
2022 Housing Element, as evidence the uses were “likely to be discontinued during the planning period.” (§
65583.2, subd. (g)(2).)
 
Respondents argue 600 Foothill’s principal “actively manipulated”
certain sites that were later deemed “buffer sites.” (Opposition to 600
Foothill 10:22.) Respondents also blame deficiencies in their October 2022 site
inventory on “dilatory guidance” of HCD and dilatory actions of SCAG.  (Opposition to 600 Foothill 12:9-10.) Having
considered the evidence cited by Respondents, the court finds Respondents’
arguments unpersuasive.  As discussed infra
with Respondents’ unclean hands defense, Respondents do not demonstrate 600
Foothill or its principals have engaged in any inequitable or wrongful conduct
related to these proceedings, including the City’s adoption of its housing
element. Respondents also do not prove deficiencies in the site inventory of
the October 2022 Housing Element resulted from actions or omissions of 600
Foothill, SCAG or HCD. Nor do Respondents cite any authority suggesting a city
or county may be excused from substantial compliance with the Housing Element
Law based on actions or omissions of SCAG, HCD or a project applicant.  
 
Respondents contend the City was permitted “to rely upon letters with site owners and between
itself and HCD not included specifically in its Housing Element” and the City
“made reasonable inferences” from the information it received from site owners.
(Opposition to 600 Foothill 12:15-19.) Respondents rely on Martinez to
support their claims. (See Martinez, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 248.)
 
Martinez addressed the City of Clovis’ nonvacant site analysis
under section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(1); the Court did not analyze the
heightened requirements of section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2). (See Martinez,
supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at 248-250.) While Martinez held the substantive
material required by section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(1), need not appear in
the Housing Element itself, the Court did not suggest nonvacant sites may be
included in a site inventory if the agency lacks substantial evidence, or has
not sufficiently investigated or analyzed, whether the sites are “likely to be discontinued during the
planning period.” 
(§ 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2).)  
 
Here, Respondents have
not cited substantial evidence to support the City’s position multiple
nonvacant sites listed in the October 2022 inventory could realistically be
developed in a manner to satisfy the City’s RHNA obligations. In addition, that Respondents made substantive revisions to the
site inventory after October 2022 also supports a reasonable
inference the City did not complete the analysis and attain the evidence
required by section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2), for many of the sites on its
site inventory, before it adopted the October 2022 Housing Element. (Compare AR 5124-5129 with 6054-6061.)  
 
Exercising
its independent judgment, while giving the deference owed to HCD’s findings,
the court concludes the City’s October 2022 Housing Element did not include a
nonvacant site analysis that substantially complied with the Housing Element
Law, including section 65583.2, subdivision (g)(2).
 
Realistic Assessment of Development Capacity 

 
The Housing
Element Law requires that municipalities “specify for each site [in its
inventory] the number of units that can realistically be accommodated on that
site.” (§ 65583.2, subd. (c).)  The law provides
“the number of units calculated” for each site “shall be adjusted” to account
for “the land use controls and site improvements requirement identified
in paragraph
(5) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583, the realistic development capacity for the site,
typical densities of existing or approved residential developments at a similar
affordability level in that jurisdiction, and on the current or planned
availability and accessibility of sufficient water, sewer, and dry utilities.”
(Id. at subd. (c)(2).)
 
CHDF
contends the October 2022 Housing Element did not substantially comply with
these statutory provisions because it failed to apply a “downward adjustment on
the number of units projected on each site to account for, among other
constraints, the City’s maximum floor-area ratio of 1.5 (AR 4607), its
80-percent maximum lot-coverage requirement (AR 4566), its 35-foot height limit
(AR 4567), and significant parking requirements (AR 4572) for sites in
mixed-use zones.” (CHDF Opening Brief 20:4-7.) 
 
Respondents
did not address or rebut CHDF’s argument. (Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. 
Traylor Brothers, Inc., supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at 1345, fn. 16 [failure to address
point is “equivalent to a concession”].) The court concludes the City’s October 2022 Housing
Element did not substantially comply with Housing Element Law because the City failed
to adjust the
development capacity for each site based on the factors set forth in section 65583.2,
subdivision (c)(2).
 
Government Code Section 65583.2, Subdivision (h)  
 
CHDF argues fewer than 50 percent of the October 2022 Housing
Element’s low-income sites were zoned exclusively for residential use, and the City
did not include analysis showing it would “accommodate all of the very low and
low-income housing need on sites designated for mixed use [and] allow 100
percent residential use and require that residential use occupy 50 percent of
the total floor area of a mixed-use project.” (CHDF Opening Brief 20:21-23
[citing 
§ 65583.2, subd. (h)].) CHDF supports its assertion with citations
to the administrative record. (CHDF Opening Brief 21:1-4 [citing AR 5124-5129,
4607-4610]; see also AR 4612.) Based on the evidence, CHDF argues the October
2022 Housing Element did not substantially comply with section 65583.2,
subdivision (h).[19]  
 
Respondents do not squarely address CHDF’s position, and they do
not show, with citation to the administrative record, the October 2022 Housing
Element substantially complied with section 65583.2, subdivision (h). (Opposition
to CHDF 12:4-9.) Accordingly, the court concludes the October 2022 Housing
Element did not substantially comply with the Housing Element Law for this
reason as well.  
 
Based
on the foregoing, the court concludes the October 2022 Housing Element did not
substantially comply with the Housing Element Law. Accordingly, the City
Council prejudicially abused its discretion when it found in its May 1, 2023 Decision
the Builder’s Remedy did not apply to the Project.  
 
Respondents’
Defenses to the HAA Causes of Action 
              
Respondents
raise a defense of unclean hands to the HAA causes of action asserted by 600
Foothill. Respondents also raise defenses of ripeness, exhaustion of
administrative remedies, and claim the petitions violate rules designed to prevent
piecemeal litigation.  
 
Unclean
Hands  
 
A party
seeking equitable relief must have “clean hands” and inequitable conduct by the
party seeking relief is a complete defense. (Dickson, Carlson & Campillo
v. Pole (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 436, 446; Salas v. Sierra Chem. Co.
(2014) 59 Cal.4th 407, 432.) The plaintiff must “come into court with clean
hands, and keep them clean,” or the plaintiff “will be denied relief,
regardless of the merits of his claim.” (Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v.
Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 970, 978.) For the doctrine to apply,
“there must be a direct relationship between the misconduct and the claimed
injuries.” (Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 820, 846, citation omitted.) 

 
Respondents
contend “the only reasonable inference to draw [from the opposition evidence]
is that on the eve of final review and approval of the Housing Element
containing the Site Inventory, 600 Foothill’s principal was running around town
attempting to manipulate owners to ‘decline’ inclusion on the inventory and
derail the process.” (Opposition to 600 Foothill 14:2-5.) The court has
reviewed all of the evidence cited by Respondents. (Koleda Decl. ¶¶ 46-51;
Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5; AR 7081-7085, 5233; Sheridan Decl. Exh. DD.)
Respondents’ assertion that Garret Weyand, one of 600 Foothill’s principals,
engaged in “deliberate attempts to manipulate the Site Inventory” is
speculative and not supported by the evidence. (Opposition
to 600 Foothill 10:22.) To the contrary, the court finds Weyand’s
public advocacy in support of the Project is not evidence of inequitable
conduct. (See Reply Weyand Decl.) Respondents have not demonstrated, by a preponderance
of the evidence, 600 Foothill or any of its principals, including Weyand and
Jon Curtis, engaged in inequitable conduct that has a direct relationship to
any cause of action in 600 Foothill’s petition. Respondents failed to meet
their burden of demonstrating unclean hands and their entitlement to the
defense.[20]  
 
Ripeness,
Exhaustion, and Piecemeal Litigation  
 
“
‘A decision attains the requisite administrative finality when the agency has
exhausted its jurisdiction and possesses ‘no further power to reconsider or
rehear the claim.’ . . . Until a public agency makes a ‘final’ decision, the
matter is not ripe for judicial review.” (California Water Impact Network v. Newhall County Water Dist. (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1464, 1485.)  Relatedly,
“[t]he exhaustion doctrine precludes review of an intermediate or interlocutory
action of an administrative agency.  A party must proceed through the full
administrative process ‘to a final decision on the merits.’ ” (Id. at
1489.) There are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, including “when the
aggrieved party can positively state what the administrative agency’s decision
in his particular case would be.” (Edgren
v. Regents of University of California (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515,
520.)  
 
Respondents do not show any lack of finality or any further
administrative remedy to exhaust as to the May 1, 2023 Decision. The May 1,
2023 Decision of the City Council is final because there is no further avenue
for administrative appeal. As discussed, the City disapproved (within the
meaning of the HAA) the Project. Nothing in the HAA requires Petitioners to
complete CEQA review before suing to enforce the HAA.
 
Respondents argue 600 Foothill did not sufficiently raise issues
pursued in this proceeding, including that the City failed to rezone, the housing
element does not meet its affirmatively further fair housing obligation,
as well as the site inventory issues. The court concludes Petitioners
sufficiently raised and preserved their contentions during the administrative
proceedings. (See AR 6284-6286, 6307-6317.) Many of the issues in these petitions
were also raised by HCD in letters to the City at the administrative level,
including a notice of violation. (AR 7170-7175.)
 
Respondents argue “[n]o express ‘disapproval’ of the entire project
occurred here . . . .” (Opposition to CHDF 16:25.) While not entirely clear,
Respondents seemingly suggest 600 Foothill should redesign the Project to
avoid reliance on the Builder’s Remedy. Respondents do not develop an argument
600 Foothill has any legal obligation, under the circumstances here, to
redesign the Project “as a
standard, nonbuilder's remedy project.” (AR 7103.).
Respondents also do not show that any further administrative action, including
appeal of the City’s June 24, 2023 letter describing inconsistency between the
Project and the City’s general plan and zoning ordinances (see AR 7176), could
remedy the harm suffered by 600 Foothill when the City Council determined the
Builder’s Remedy does not apply to the Project. 

 
Moreover, Petitioners can positively state what the City’s decision is
with respect to 600 Foothill’s application to develop the Builder’s Remedy Project.
In its May 1, 2023 Decision, the City Council
made clear any required land use approvals or entitlements would not be issued
for the Project as a Builder’s Remedy project. Based on
its review of the administrative record and the parties’ declarations, the
court finds no reasonable possibility Respondents, including the City Council,
will change their position and process 600 Foothill’s Project as a Builder’s
Remedy under the HAA.  Accordingly, even
if some additional appeal or administrative process were available, the
futility exception to exhaustion applies under these facts. (See, e.g., Felkay
v. City of Santa Barbara (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 30, 40-41 [futility
exception, which is a question of fact, applied where city “made plain” it
would not permit the proposed development]; Ogo Associates v. City of
Torrance (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 830, 832-34 [futility exception applied where
it was “inconceivable the city council would grant a variance for the very
project whose prospective existence brought about the enactment of the
rezoning” that necessitated the variance in the first place].)  
 
Respondents do not demonstrate (1) the HAA claims in the petitions are
unripe, (2) Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, or (3)
Petitioners have violated rules designed to prevent piecemeal litigation.
Further, even if Petitioners have additional administrative remedies (such as
an appeal of the June 24, 2023 inconsistency letter), the court finds exhaustion
of such remedies is futile under the circumstances presented here.  
 
              CHDF’s Claims of Bad Faith and
Discrimination Based on Race and Income
 
CHDF
contends: 
 
La Cañada
Flintridge officials clearly acquiesced to the biases and prejudices of
city residents when they revised the draft Housing Element’s sites inventory
and rezoning program to eliminate multiple ‘low-income’ sites south of Foothill
Boulevard. This was a blatant violation of California and Federal fair housing
laws alike. (See Gov. Code, § 65008, subd. (b)(1)(C) . . . ; Cal. Code Regs,
tit. 2, § 12161, subd. (c) . . . ; Mhany Management, Inc., supra, 819
F.3d 581 . . . .) (CHDF Opening Brief 17:13-21.)  
 
As
acknowledged in reply, CHDF did not plead a cause of action in its petition
alleging the City violated the Fair Housing Act or state or federal
discrimination laws. (CHDF Reply 10:15-20.) 
CHDF also did not move to amend its petition or request leave to amend
its petition. (See Simmons v. Ware (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1048. [“The
pleadings are supposed to define the issues to be tried.”])  
 
In reply,
CHDF argues the “City’s discriminatory site-selection practices demonstrates
the City did not substantially comply with the Housing Element Law’s
requirements to affirmatively further fair housing.” (CHDF Reply 10:18-19.)
However, CHDF failed to plead that claim in its petition. (See CHDF Reply
10:20-21 [citing CHDF Pet. ¶¶ 22, 26, 29-30 (generalized allegations the City “did
not affirmatively further fair housing or provide an assessment of fair housing”)].)  
 
On the
merits of CHDF’s claim, even if the affirmatively further fair housing allegations
in the petition are interpreted to encompass CHDF’s arguments about race and
income discrimination (a difficult task), the court finds Respondents’
opposition persuasive. (Oppostion to CHDF 13:5-15:21.) There is insufficient
evidence the City Council “acquiesced” to or acted based on public comments at the
August and September 2022 public hearings highlighted in CHDF’s briefs. (See
e.g., AR 2602-2603 [“different value system and much more high crime . . . the
value system is different than people that move here”], 3491-3494 [similar
comments from same individual at AR 2602-2603], 3539-3541, 3543-3545 [“dust off
my shotgun” “likelihood of being some bad apples”], 3493 [additional similar comments
from commenter at AR 2602-2603 and AR 3491-3494], 5107-5110 [crime and will
become dangerous community], 5112 [“fear poor or homeless people will move into
La Canada and bring crime”].) While some of the public comments were quite unfortunate,
CHDF cites statements of councilmembers out of context and does not show those councilmembers
“agreed” with the public comments highlighted by Petitioners. (CHDF Opening
Brief 10:13-11:6.) Even if the councilmembers could have stated their
disagreement with certain public comments, but did not, there is insufficient
evidence to support an inference the City Council took any action on the housing
element based on the unfortunate public comments and discrimination.  
 
Other Contentions Related to the HAA
Causes of Action 
 
Several
other contentions are not necessary to the court’s ruling on the HAA claims.
For completeness, the court briefly addresses them.
 
The
court agrees with Intervenors that the City did not have authority under the
HAA or Housing Element Law to backdate its housing element and “self-certify”
or declare its housing element to be in substantial compliance with state law
as of October 2022. (Intervenors Opening Brief 14:3-15:24.) Respondents appear
to concede the point. (See Opposition to Intervenors 19:18-21:7 [asserting City
did not back date or self-certify].)  
 
As
argued by 600 Foothill, when HCD found the October 2022 Housing Element did not
substantially comply with the law, section 65585, subdivision (f) required City
to take “one” of the following actions: “(1) Change the draft element or draft
amendment to substantially comply with this article; [or] (2) Adopt the draft
element or draft amendment without changes [, but with] written findings which
explain the reasons the legislative body believes that the draft . . . substantially
complies with this article despite the findings of the department.” (600 Foothill
Opening Brief 14:16-19.) The court agrees the “City unlawfully blended these
approaches by making some changes in response to HCD’s comments, adopting the
February 2023 Housing Element with written findings explaining why the October
2022 Housing Element was sufficient, and then resubmitting its revised draft to
HCD.” (600 Foothill Opening Brief 14:19-22.) 

 
If
the City believed its October 2022 Housing Element substantially complied with
the Housing Element Law, it should have taken the action set forth in section
65585, subdivision (f)(2).  Thereafter, the
City could have sued for a judicial declaration that its October 2022 Housing
Element substantially complied with state law. The City did not do so here.
 
The
court finds 600 Foothill’s arguments based on section 65589.5, subdivisions (j)
and (o) are not ripe at this time. Once ripe, the claims are subject to
exhaustion. (See 600 Foothill Opening Brief 9:12-10:21; Pet. ¶¶ 134-162.) Upon the
remand ordered here, the City is required to process the application as a
Builder’s Remedy project and in accordance with the HAA, including sections
65589.5, subdivisions (j) and (o). Thus, it is premature to adjudicate today whether
the City has complied with those provisions of the HAA.  
 
Relatedly,
since the court concludes the City is required by law to process the
application pursuant to the Builder’s Remedy provision of the HAA, the court
need not address the financial infeasibility of a redesigned project. (600
Foothill Opening Brief 8:21-9:3 and 10, fn. 6.)
 
              Summary
of HAA Causes of Action and Scope of Writ Relief 
 
The
court finds the City Council prejudicially abused its discretion with its finding
in its May 1, 2023 Decision that the Builder’s Remedy does not apply to the
Project. As a remedy, the court grants 600 Foothill’s petition and will issue a
writ directing Respondents to set aside the May 1, 2023 City Council decision finding
600 Foothill’s Project does not qualify as Builder’s Remedy and compelling the
City to process the application in accordance with the HAA and state law.  That remedy is consistent with section
65589.5, subdivision (k)(1)(A)(ii) of the HAA (compliance required in 60 days) and
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (f).  
 
CHDF
argues the court should order the Project “approved” due to the City’s alleged
bad faith and unlawful discrimination. (CHDF Opening Brief 23:18-24:24.) For
the reasons discussed, the court finds evidence the City Council “acquiesced”
to or acted based on the public comments from the August and September 2022
public hearings highlighted in CHDF’s briefs insufficient.  (See e.g., AR 2602-2603,
3491-3494, 3539-3541, 3543-3545, 3493, 5107-5110, 5112.) CHDF has not met its
burden of demonstrating Respondents acted in bad faith in connection with those
public comments.  
 
CHDF also
argues “[w]hen 600 Foothill subsequently proposed a project under the HAA’s
builder’s remedy, the City Council concocted a bizarre scheme to evade judicial
review of their decision to disapprove that project, . . . .” (CHDF Opening
Brief 24:15-18.) 600 Foothill contends the court should order Respondents to
approve the Project on similar grounds. (600 Foothill Reply 18:13-19:8.) While
the court finds the City prejudicially abused its discretion with its May 1,
2023 Decision finding the Builder’s Remedy inapplicable to the Project, the
court does not find sufficient evidence to conclude the City Council acted in
bad faith when it made its legally incorrect decision.
 
Further,
even if it could be argued the City Council lacked a good faith reason to find the
Project did not qualify as a Builder’s Remedy, Petitioners do not show it would
be equitable for the court to compel the City to approve the Project. Among
other reasons, CEQA
review is specifically preserved by the HAA. (See § 65589.5, subds. (e) and
(o)(6); Schellinger, supra, 179
Cal.App.4th at 1245.) In the exercise of the court’s discretion, the court
finds a writ compelling Respondents to approve the Project, without CEQA
review, would not be an equitable or proportionate remedy for the violations of
the HAA at issue. Respondents should be permitted on remand to process 600
Foothill’s application, as a Builder’s Remedy, in conformance with state law,
including the HAA and CEQA. The court is open to suggestion from 600 Foothill about
an order CEQA review “be narrowly tailored in relation to the City’s
discretion, and quickly completed, to ensure that Respondent’s do not abuse the
CEQA process.” (600 Foothill Reply 19:20-22.)
 
The
HAA causes of action are GRANTED IN PART as stated.  
 
600
Foothill’s First Cause of Action – Violation of Housing Element Law 
 
600 Foothill prays for a writ of mandate “compelling Respondents to
adopt a revised housing element pursuant to Government Code Section 65754. 2”
and “to complete the required rezoning consistent with an HCD-approved housing
element.” (Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 1-2.) 600 Foothill filed its petition on July 21,
2023. The petition alleged the City had not substantially complied with the
Housing Element Law at that time. (Pet. ¶ 91.) 

 
As discussed, the City
completed
the required rezoning in September through November 2023, after 600 Foothill
filed its petition. On November 17, 2023, HCD sent a letter
to the City finding the City had “completed actions to address requirements
described in HCD’s April 24, 2023 review letter” and was in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law. (See Coy Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. D.)  
 
600 Foothill has not pleaded in the
petition, or argued in its briefing, there is any deficiency in the February
2023 Housing Element that HCD found to be substantially compliant with the
Housing Element Law in November 2023, after the City completed its rezoning. Accordingly,
the first cause of action is moot. (Wilson & Wilson v. City Council of
Redwood City (2011) 191
Cal.App.4th 1559, 1573 [“A case is considered moot when ‘the question addressed
was at one time a live issue in the case,’ but has been deprived of life
‘because of events occurring after the judicial process was initiated.’ . . . .
‘The pivotal question in determining if a case is moot is therefore whether the
court can grant the plaintiff any effectual relief.’”])  
 
600 Foothill’s first cause of action is
DENIED as moot.
 
600
Foothill’s Second Cause of Action – Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing 
 
600 Foothill prays for a writ “compelling
Respondents to comply with their statutory obligation to Affirmatively Further
Fair Housing.” (Pet. Prayer ¶ 9.) 600 Foothill’s writ briefing, however, only
challenges the City’s compliance with affirmatively further fair housing obligations as to the October 2022 Housing
Element and required rezoning. (See 600 Foothill Opening Brief 21:10-12; Pet.
¶¶ 106-108.) 600 Foothill does not develop any argument the City’s February
2023 housing element, after completion of the required rezoning, does not
comply with the City’s affirmatively further fair housing obligations. Accordingly, the second cause of
action is moot. (Wilson & Wilson,
supra, 191 Cal.App.4th at 1573.) Alternatively, to the extent 600 Foothill
contends in the petition the City remains out of compliance with its affirmatively further fair housing obligations (see Pet. ¶ 105), 600 Foothill has
not sufficiently supported its position with evidence and legal analysis. 
 
600 Foothill’s second cause of action is DENIED
as moot.
 
600 Foothill’s Sixth Cause of
Action – Violation of the Permit Streamlining Act (PSA)
 
600 Foothill contends the City violated the PSA
in several ways with its incompleteness determinations and the City Council’s
May 1, 2023 Decision. (600 Foothill Opening Brief 19:14-20-25; Pet. ¶¶
163-175.) 600 Foothill prays for a writ “compelling
Respondents review and process applications pursuant to the Permit Streamlining
Act’s provisions, including refraining from refusing to process development
applications based on erroneous assertions of incompleteness.” (Pet. Prayer ¶
4.)
 
600 Foothill has demonstrated Respondents
violated the PSA in at least two respects. 
Specifically, section 65943, subdivision (a) provides “[i]f the
application is determined to be incomplete, the lead agency shall provide the
applicant with an exhaustive list of items that were not complete.” (Emphasis
added.) In addition, the list “shall be limited to those items actually required on the lead agency's
submittal requirement checklist.” (Ibid. [Emphasis added].) “In any subsequent review of the application determined to be incomplete, the local
agency shall not request the applicant to provide any new information that
was not stated in the initial list of items that were not complete.” (Ibid.
[Emphasis added].)
 
While neither
party has cited any published authority interpreting these provisions, the
plain language of section 65943, subdivision (a) is clear. The PSA required the
City to provide 600 Foothill with an “exhaustive list” of incomplete items in its
First Incompleteness Determination; incomplete items are limited to items on the
City’s “submittal requirement checklist”; and the City could not later request
new information it omitted from the initial list. Respondents provide no
alternative interpretation of the statutory language. (Opposition to 600
Foothill 20:5-21:8.) Director Koleda reports “it is a common practice
for the City to provide information to a developer in the early stages of the
application review regarding ways that the development does not meet applicable
development standards.” (Koleda Decl. ¶ 42 [emphasis added].) Even if true, the
City’s common practice does not supersede the statutory requirements of the
PSA.  
 
In violation
of these provisions of the PSA, the Second Incompleteness Determination found the
Project was inconsistent with City’s zoning and general plan standards because
the Project did not qualify as a Builder’s Remedy. (AR 6280-6281.) However,
that issue was not raised in the First Incomplete Determination and was also
not included on the City’s submittal requirement checklist. (See AR
5276-5279, 6280-6281;
see also Koleda Decl. ¶ 42.) Accordingly, the City violated section 65943, subdivision (a).[21]
 
Respondents suggest
600 Foothill was not prejudiced by the violations of the PSA because the
application was deemed complete on May 26, 2023. (Oppo. to 600 Foothill 22:19-21
[citing AR 7169].) Respondents do not cite any authority for the proposition
that PSA violations are excused by a purported lack of prejudice. Moreover, 600
Foothill was prejudiced when Respondents made a legally unauthorized
incompleteness determination.  
 
600 Foothill does not cite a statute or published
authority suggesting the appropriate remedy for these types of violations of
the PSA is an order compelling the City to approve the project.  As discussed for the HAA causes of
action, the court will grant a writ directing Respondents to set aside the City
Council’s May 1, 2023 Decision and process 600 Foothill’s application in
accordance with the HAA. The violations of the PSA proven by 600 Foothill
provide additional support for that remedy. 600 Foothill does not demonstrate any
additional relief is justified under the PSA. 

 
To the extent 600 Foothill prays for a writ
directing the City to comply with the PSA in the future or with respect to
development applications of non-parties (see Prayer
¶ 4), 600 Foothill does not sufficiently support such a prayer in its briefing.
Specifically, 600 Foothill does not explain how it has standing to enforce the
PSA on behalf of non-parties, or how any claim with respect to the City’s
future compliance with the PSA is ripe for judicial review.
 
600 Foothill’s sixth cause of action is GRANTED
IN PART.  The court finds the City
violated the PSA in the manner it processed 600 Foothill’s application. As a
remedy, the May 1, 2023 Decision finding that the application was incomplete
because the Project does not qualify as a Builder’s Remedy must be set aside. In
all others respect, the sixth cause of action is DENIED.
 
600
Foothill’s Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action – State Density Bonus Law and
Subdivision Map Act
 
600
Foothill argues the City Council’s May 1, 2023 Decision effectively denied 600
Foothill’s requests for a density bonus and concessions or incentives under the
State Density Bonus Law, and “necessarily constituted a disapproval” under the
Subdivision Map Act. (600 Foothill Opening Brief 21:25-22:12; see Pet. ¶¶
176-197.)  
 
The
court’s analysis of the seventh and eighth causes of action is similar to that
set forth earlier with 600 Foothill’s claims under section 65589.5, subdivisions
(j) and (o). Upon remand, the City will be required to process 600 Foothill’s application
as a Builder’s Remedy and in accordance with the HAA and other state housing
laws, including the State Density Bonus Law and the Subdivision Map Act. It is
premature at this time to adjudicate whether the City has complied with those statutes.
600 Foothill has been informed that the City’s review process under the State
Density Bonus Law and the Subdivision Map Act is ongoing. (See AR 7176-7178,
7169.) Accordingly, 600 Foothill does not prove its seventh and eighth causes
of action are ripe for judicial review or that the issues have been exhausted. Further,
to the extent 600 Foothill seeks a writ directing the City to “approve” the
Project in full, it does not demonstrate it is entitled to that remedy, as discussed
earlier.  
 
600
Foothill’s seventh and eighth causes of action are DENIED.
 
600
Foothill’s Ninth Cause of Action is Stayed 
 
Respondents
specially moved to strike 600 Foothill’s ninth cause of action (right to fair
hearing) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The court denied
the motion, and Respondents appealed. Given the appeal, the ninth cause of
action is stayed. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 425.16, subd. (i), 916, subd. (a); Varian
Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 195.)[22]  
 
///
 
Causes
of Action for Declaratory Relief by All Petitioners
 
Issuance of a
declaratory judgment is discretionary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) Further, “it
is settled that declaratory relief is not an appropriate method for judicial
review of administrative decisions.” (Selby Realty Co. v. City of San
Buenaventura (1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 127; accord Sheetz v. County of El
Dorado (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 394, 414 [“administrative mandamus is ‘the
proper and sole remedy’ to challenge a local agency's application of the law
(e.g., application of a zoning ordinance to a particular property)”].)  
 
Although the petitions
include various requests for declaratory relief, all such requests pertain to
the validity of City Council’s May 1, 2023 Decision, including the City
Council’s determination the October 2022 Housing Element substantially complied
with state law and the Project did not qualify as a Builder’s Remedy. None of
the Petitioners have developed a legal argument that declaratory relief is an
appropriate, or necessary, form of judicial review of the administrative
decisions at issue. Accordingly, Petitioners have not demonstrated they are
entitled to declaratory relief. 
 
600 Foothill’s
eleventh cause of action for declaratory relief, CHDF’s second cause of action
for declaratory relief, and Intervenors’ second cause of action for declaratory
relief are DENIED as unnecessary given the court’s decision on the HAA causes of
action.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The petitions of 600 Foothill, CHDF,
and Intervenors to enforce the HAA are GRANTED IN PART. The court finds the City
Council prejudicially abused its discretion when it found in its May 1, 2023 Decision
that the Builder’s Remedy does not apply to the Project. The court will grant a
writ directing Respondents to set aside the City Council’s decision, dated May
1, 2023, finding 600 Foothill’s application does not qualify as a Builder’s
Remedy and to process the application in accordance with the HAA and state law.
The HAA claims are denied in all other respects.  
600 Foothill’s first, second, seventh,
and eighth causes of action are DENIED.
 
600
Foothill’s sixth cause of action is GRANTED IN PART.  The court finds the City violated the PSA in
the manner it processed 600 Foothill’s application and, as a remedy, the May 1,
2023 Decision finding the application was incomplete because the Project does
not qualify as a Builder’s Remedy must be set aside. In all others respect, the
sixth cause of action is DENIED.
 
600 Foothill’s ninth cause of action is stayed
pending Respondents’ appeal of denial of its anti-SLAPP motion. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 425.16, subd. (i),
916, subd. (a).)
