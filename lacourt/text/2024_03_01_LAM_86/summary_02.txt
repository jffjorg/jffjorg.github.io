And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute between Petitioner and EDD regarding an alleged overpayment of benefits. According to the EDD, Petitioner received overpayments of $13,939.90 for IHSS benefits in 2020 and 2021, and is liable for the amounts overpaid plus a 30% statutory penalty. However, Petitioner disputes the alleged overpayment, arguing that they were not required to report certain payments to the EDD. The Judge takes judicial notice of IRS Notice 2014-7, which explains that certain payments, known as "difficulty of care payments", are excluded from taxable income. The Judge concludes that the issue is not about the amount of overpayment, but whether there was an overpayment in the first place, and whether Petitioner was required to report the IHSS payments to the EDD.
