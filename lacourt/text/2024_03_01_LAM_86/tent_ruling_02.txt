[1] The notice advised
the overpayment occurred for benefits paid for certain weeks in the first four
months of 2021. (AR 5.) On the same date, Petitioner also received a second
notice of overpayment for various dates in 2020. (AR 10.) The second notice of
overpayment indicated Petitioner had improperly received benefits of $13,939.90
for 24 weeks in 2020 and two weeks in January 2021. (AR 10.) The EDD’s notice
of overpayment also advised Petitioner he was liable for the amounts overpaid
and a 30 percent statutory penalty. (AR 10.) For purposes of this petition, the
issue is not about the alleged amount of overpayment, but whether there was,
in  fact, an overpayment. The petition
turns on whether Petitioner was required to report to the EDD certain payments
he received for providing In Home Support Services (IHSS).


[2] On its own motion,
the court takes judicial notice of IRS Notice 2014-7. The notice explains certain
payments (“difficulty of care payments”) are “excludable under § 131 of the
Internal Revenue Code.” 26 United States Code at section 131 provides “amounts
received by a foster care provider” shall not be included in the provider’s
gross taxable income. Nothing suggests the IHSS payments received by Petitioner
relate to foster care.
