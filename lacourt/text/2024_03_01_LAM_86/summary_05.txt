And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the City's compliance with the Housing Accountability Act (HAA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) regarding a housing development project. The project was deemed complete when the applicant submitted its application in November 2022. The City Council made a decision on May 1, 2023, regarding the project, which the Respondents argue did not constitute a "disapproval" under the HAA. The court finds that the City did not adopt a substantially compliant housing element until after the application was submitted, and therefore, the Builder's Remedy applies to the project. The court also concludes that the City did not substantially comply with the affirmatively further fair housing requirements in section 65583. The court rejects the Respondents' argument that the City's obligation to affirmatively further fair housing is excused by the City's alleged intentional obstructive behavior.
