[1] All further undesignated statutory references are to
this code.


[2] Contrary to 600 Foothill’s assertion, Respondents did
not request judicial notice of Exhibit A to the Koleda declaration. 600
Foothill and Intervenors appear correct—Respondents did not submit Exhibits D-3
or V with the Koleda declaration. Accordingly, the court cannot judicially
notice Exhibits D-3 or V.


[3] The
declaration is properly submitted to respond to the defense of unclean hands and
allegations of “manipulation of the HCD approval process” discussed in
Respondents’ opposition brief.  


[4] See section 65580, et seq.


[5] The court accounted for its evidentiary rulings as to the
evidence.


[6] 600 Foothill’s writ claims under the HAA are alleged
in its third through fifth causes of action while CHDF’s and Intervenors’ are
alleged in their first causes of action. 



[7] It is undisputed the Project constitutes a “housing
development project . . . for very low, low-, or moderate-income households” within the meaning of the HAA.  HCD advised the City on June 8, 2023: “The
Project is proposed as an 80-unit mixed-use project where 20 percent of the
units (16 units) will be affordable to lower-income households. The residential
portion equates to approximately 89 percent of the Project; therefore, the Project
qualifies as a ‘housing development project’ under the HAA (Gov. Code, §
65589.5, subd. (h)(2)(B)).” (AR 7171.)  Respondents
develop no argument to the contrary. 


[8] CEQA refers to the California Environmental Quality
Act at Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq.


[9] See section
65589.5, subdivisions (e) and (o)(6).


[10] Respondents
indicate the City took action to pay for CEQA review of the Project starting in
September 2023. (Opposition to 600 Foothill 18:11-14 [citing Sheridan Decl.
Exh. JJ].) By that time, however, the City Council had already determined the
Project could not proceed as proposed pursuant to the Builder’s Remedy. (AR 7167; see also AR 7176.) Respondents do not
explain the purpose of CEQA review for a project the City Council has
determined could not be approved consistent with the law. This evidence does
not support Respondents’ position the City Council’s May 1, 2023 Decision did
not constitute a “disapproval” under the HAA.
 


[11] 600 Foothill’s preliminary application was “deemed
complete,” within the meaning of the HAA, when 600 Foothill submitted its
application in November 2022. (See AR 5241, 7171; see also Gov. Code §§
65589.5(h)(5) and 65941.1.)


[12] However, the court reaches the same result in its analysis below even
if the application was deemed complete or “vested” anytime up to May 1, 2023,
the date of City Council’s decision.  


[13] In any event, as discussed infra, the court
concludes the City did not adopt a substantially compliant housing element
until after 600 Foothill submitted its complete Preliminary Application.
Accordingly, even if the statutory bar of section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) does not apply to the courts,
the court still concludes the Builder’s Remedy applies to the Project.
 


[14] Further,
even assuming a conflict existed, Respondents do not explain why section 65860
would take precedence over section 65588, subdivision (e)(4)(C)(iii) under the
specific circumstances presented here (i.e., a statutory bar to attaining
substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law until rezoning is
complete). (See State Dept. of Public Health v. Superior Court (2015) 60
Cal.4th 940, 960-961. [“If conflicting statutes cannot be reconciled, later
enactments supersede earlier ones [citation], and more specific provisions take
precedence over more general ones.”])  
 


[15] While Martinez
advises “ ‘[t]he burden is on the challenger to demonstrate that the
housing element . . . is inadequate” (ibid.), the HAA provides the City “bear[s] the burden of proof that
its decision has conformed to all of the conditions specified in Section
65589.5.” (§
65589.6; see also § 65587, subd. (d)(2) [city has burden of proof in action to
compel compliance with requirements of section 65583, subd. (c)(1)-(3)].) The
parties do not address the language in Martinez or how it should be
applied, if at all, in this proceeding. The court concludes based on
sections 65589.6 and 65587, subdivision (d)(2) the burden is on Respondents to
show the City Council’s May 1, 2023 Decision complied with the HAA. Such a showing
requires the City to demonstrate it attained substantial compliance with the
Housing Element Law before 600 Foothill’s submitted its Preliminary Application
and it was “deemed complete.” The court notes and clarifies, however, it would reach
the same result herein even if the initial burden of proof is with Petitioners.  
 


[16] Section
8899.50, subd. (b)(1) provides: “A public agency shall administer its programs
and activities relating to housing and community development in a manner to
affirmatively further fair housing, and take no action that is materially
inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing.”
Compliance with the obligation is mandatory. (Id. at subd. (b)(2).)  The statute defines “affirmatively further
fair housing” as: 
taking
meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome
patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers
that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics.
Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful
actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs
and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly
integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically
concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and
maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. The duty to
affirmatively further fair housing extends to all of a public agency's activities
and programs relating to housing and community development. (Id. at
subd. (a)(1).)  
 


[17] In reaching this conclusion, the court has considered
Respondents’ assertion the City undertook outreach efforts “in the face of
‘changing goal posts’ and what appeared to be intentional obstructive behavior
by HCD.” (Opposition to 600 Foothill 9:16-21.) The court finds Respondents’
evidence does not prove substantial compliance with the affirmatively further fair housing requirements in section 65583 or an excuse from
substantial compliance. (See e.g. Koleda Decl. ¶¶ 49-50.) The court has also
considered CHDF’s arguments and evidence that the City discriminated on the
basis of race and income when it selected sites for rezoning. The court further
discusses CHDF’s claims of discrimination and bad faith infra.
 


[18] For example, a representative of a restaurant (Panda
Express) wrote “we have NO intention of discontinuing the current use of this
property during the next eight-year housing planning period.” (AR 5115.) The
owner of sites 86-89 on the October 2022 site inventory (identified in the
lower income category) similarly informed the City that the premises are leased
to retail store (Big Lots) under a 20-year lease with two 10-year extension
options, and it had no intention of discontinuing the current use during the
planning period. (AR 5116.)  


[19] Section 65583.2, subdivision (h)
provides in pertinent part: “At least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing
need shall be accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for
which nonresidential uses or mixed uses are not permitted, except that a city
or county may accommodate all of the very low and low-income housing need on
sites designated for mixed use if those sites allow 100 percent residential use
and require that residential use occupy 50 percent of the total floor area of a
mixed-use project.”  


[20] This defense only applies to 600 Foothill.
Respondents do not develop any argument the HAA claims of CHDF or Intervenors are
subject to the defense.


[21] 600 Foothill also contends “Respondents’ Second
Incompleteness Determination was issued on March 1, 2023 (AR 6280-81) more than
30 days after Petitioner submitted the Project application on January 13,
2023.” (600 Foothill Opening Brief 20:22-24.) 600 Foothill did not pay the fees
for the application until January 31, 2023, which was less 30 days before March
1, 2023. (AR 7161-7162.) When submitting its application, the City advised 600
Foothill “the 30-day time limit to determine completeness of a development
application per Government Code Section 65943 does not begin until all invoiced
fees have been paid.” (AR 7161-7162) Section 65943 is ambiguous as to whether
the 30-day period begins running when the application is submitted/received or
when the fees are paid. While 600 Foothill has a colorable argument the 30-day
period began when City “received” the application on January 13, 2023, Respondents’
alternative interpretation is also reasonable. 600 Foothill has not submitted
any legislative history to support its interpretation. Accordingly, the court
is not persuaded 600 Foothill met its burden as to it complaint about
timeliness under the PSA.    


[22] Respondents conceded at the time the court heard the
special motion to strike that an appeal would stay only the ninth cause of
action.
