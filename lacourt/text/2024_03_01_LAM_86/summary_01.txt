And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied Petitioner Lionel C. Williams' petition for a writ of mandate seeking to set aside the decision of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB) affirming the Employment Development Department's (EDD) determination that Petitioner received an overpayment of unemployment insurance benefits. The EDD had determined that Petitioner was overpaid due to his failure to report his wages received from providing In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) to a care recipient. Petitioner argued that these wages were exempt from reporting to the EDD, but the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and CUIAB disagreed. The Court found that Petitioner's reliance on statutes related to income tax withholding and deductions was not applicable to whether an individual has "wages" for purposes of determining entitlement to unemployment insurance benefits. Therefore, the petition was denied.
