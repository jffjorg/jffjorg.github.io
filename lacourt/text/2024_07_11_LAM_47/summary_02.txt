And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reconsidering their previous order granting the defendant's motion to strike their answer and enter default against the plaintiff. The judge believes that granting the motion would deprive the plaintiff of his right to a jury trial, and that the plaintiff would be limited in his recovery if a default judgment were entered. The judge also notes that the defendant did not provide any authority for the proposition that a defendant who has answered and defended the case can withdraw their answer and seek entry of default on the eve of trial. The judge is giving the parties an opportunity to respond to the reconsideration and will hold a hearing on August 7, 2024.
