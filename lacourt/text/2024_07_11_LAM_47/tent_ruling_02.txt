 Case Number:  BC511769    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  47 BC511769 PATRICK MINNER VS WASHINGTON MOTORS LLCCOURT ORDER:On June 24, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Washington
Motors, LLC’s motion for an order striking its answer to Plaintiff Patrick
Minner and entering default against Defendant.  Having devoted further
thought to the matter, the Court now moves sua sponte to deny
Defendant’s motion and reset the matter for a jury trial.  The Court’s
authority to reconsider the June 24 ruling on its own motion is Le Francois
v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, which hold that even when Code of Civil
Procedure (C.C.P.) §1008 would preclude a party from moving for
reconsideration, a trial court has inherent authority to correct an erroneous
ruling on its own motion. 
 
The Court’s rationale for reconsidering the prior order and
denying the motion rests on a few core principles.  First, Defendant
offered no authority for the proposition that a defendant who has answered and
defended the case may withdraw its answer and seek entry of default on the eve
of trial.  Second, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the motion primarily on
the grounds that the order sought by Defendant would deprive him of his right
to a jury trial.  It is true that if Defendant simply chose not to appear
for a properly noticed jury trial, Plaintiff would be entitled to proceed
 at trial without opposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 594,
rather than by default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 594(a); Heidary v.
Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863.)  It appears that
Plaintiff would be entitled to a jury trial under these circumstances, because
none of statutory grounds for waiver of his right to a jury trial would have
been satisfied.  (Code of Civil Proc. §631(f).  Third, contrary to
the Court’s prior ruling, granting Defendant’s motion could have a prejudicial
impact on Plaintiff, in that he would have to confront the statutory
restrictions for seeking default judgment, including that the Court cannot
grant relief on any claim that is not well-pled, nor award damages that are not
explicitly listed in the complaint (for non-personal injury claims) or in a
separate Statement of Damages (for personal injury claims).  (Carlsen
v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal. App. 4th 879, 899; Vasey v. California
Dance Co. (1977) 70 Cal. App. 3d 742, 749; Code Civ. Proc. § 580(a).) 
Thus, to impose a default on Plaintiff where he did not choose to pursue it
might limit his recovery in ways that would not be applicable at trial.  (Garimendi
v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 694, 705.)  
 
For all these reasons, the Court announces its intent to
reconsider the June 24, 2024 ruling.  Consistent with Le Francois v.
Goel, supra, the Court grants the parties leave to respond to the Court’s
suggested reconsideration and be heard on the matter before a further order is
issued.  Accordingly, the Court directs Defendant to file and serve any
opposition brief by July 22, 2024 and Plaintiff to file and serve any reply
brief by July 31, 2024.  The Court sets a hearing on its motion to
reconsider for August 7, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  
 
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to advance the hearing date
for his motion for reconsideration is continued for hearing to August 7, 2024
at 9:00 a.m.  
 
The hearing on the Order to Show Cause why default judgment
has not been entered is advanced from July 22, 2024 and continued to August 7,
2024 at 9:00 a.m.
