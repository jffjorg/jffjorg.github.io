And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial due to the death of the three plaintiffs. The defendants need time to conduct discovery and obtain successors-in-interest for the plaintiffs. The court finds that good cause exists to continue the trial and grants the motion. The trial date is advanced and continued to July 1, 2024, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
