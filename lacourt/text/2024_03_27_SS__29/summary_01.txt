And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The hearing on the motion to recover costs filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles is continued. The Defendant filed a motion to recover costs, which was opposed by the Plaintiff, Juan Ramon Valdez. However, the Court has scheduled a hearing on the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs on April 8, 2024, and will hear both motions at the same time. The hearing on the motion to recover costs is therefore continued to April 8, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
