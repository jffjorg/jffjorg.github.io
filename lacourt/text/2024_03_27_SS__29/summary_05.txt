And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on the motion for spoliation of evidence. The motion requests an extreme sanction for the destruction of evidence, and the court believes that the matter is serious enough to warrant further consideration. Initially, the hearing was set for April 15, but plaintiff's counsel filed an application to advance the hearing date, which the court granted. However, the parties later stipulated to continue the trial to July 11, which has now removed the emergency that initially necessitated the earlier hearing date. Additionally, the court truncated briefing for the motion and did not allow for a written reply. The defendant's opposition to the motion mentions a recently noticed deposition of Yancy Barrios, a key witness on the issue of spoliation. The court is now inquiring whether the hearing should be continued until after the deposition is complete and the parties have had an opportunity to file any additional briefing.
