 Case Number:  21STCV45091    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  29 Tentative
The Court will hear from counsel.
The Court’s tentative is to continue the
hearing on this motion.  This is a
serious matter involving a request for the most extreme sanction for spoliation
of evidence.  The hearing was initially
set for April 15.  Plaintiff’s counsel
filed an ex parte application to advance the hearing date, which the Court
granted – because trial was set for April 11 (before the scheduled hearing date).  Then, a week later, the parties stipulated to
continue the trial to July 11. 
Accordingly, there is no longer any emergency requiring the matter to be
heard and resolved today.
Also, in connection with the order advancing
the hearing date, the Court truncated briefing and did not allow for a written
reply.
Moreover, in the Opposition, Defendant states
that the deposition of Yancy Barrios – one of the most important witnesses, and
perhaps the most important witness, as to the spoliation issue – was recently
noticed.  
The Court inquires of counsel whether the
hearing on this important motion should be continued until after that
deposition is complete, and the parties have been able to submit any additional
briefing necessary or appropriate in light of her testimony.
