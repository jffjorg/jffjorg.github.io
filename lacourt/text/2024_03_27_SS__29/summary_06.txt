And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed on February 16, 2024, to approve a minor's compromise for Jasiah Rochon, a 12-year-old. The court has granted the personal appearance exemption for the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing them to appear by phone or video conference. However, the court has identified two discrepancies that must be addressed before the petition can be approved. Firstly, no medical records were attached to the petition. Secondly, the court requires reasoning for the apportionment of settlement on attachment 11b(6). Therefore, the petition is denied without prejudice, and the petitioner may file a new petition that addresses these issues. The moving party is required to give notice.
