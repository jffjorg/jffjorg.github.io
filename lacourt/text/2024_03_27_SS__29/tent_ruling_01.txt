Background   
 
On September 5, 2019, Juan Ramon

Los Angeles (“Defendant”), Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
State of California, Union Pacific Railroad and Does 1 through 50 for personal injuries
Plaintiff sustained after being struck by a train on November 14, 2018.
 
On November 28, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.  Judgment in favor of County was filed on
December 21, 2023.
 
On February 9, 2024, Defendant

On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion to recover costs. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 14, 2024.

Plaintiff filed a motion to tax
cost that is set to be heard on April 8, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
As Plaintiff has a motion to tax costs
that is set for hearing on April 8, 2024, the Court will CONTINUE the hearing
on this motion so that the two costs-related motions may be heard at the same
time.
 
The hearing on this motion is
continued, on the Court’s own motion, to April 8, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
