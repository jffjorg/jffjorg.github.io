 Case Number:  22STCV27793    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Nina Sargsyan.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On August 25,
2022, Cristina De Jesus (“Plaintiff”) and Kenya Peralta filed a complaint
against Antoinette Renee Clark, Picquet J. Honore, and Does 1 to 50 for motor
vehicle negligence, general negligence, violation of Vehicle Code 20001(a), and
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress causes of action arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on August 27, 2020.
On February 26,
2024, counsel Nina Sargsyan (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as
counsel as to Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
On February 26,
2024, Counsel filed the motion, declaration and proposed order to be relieved
as counsel. Counsel states there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.
(Decl., No. 2.) While Counsel was unable to confirm Plaintiff’s current
address, Counsel attempted to discover the address by mailing motion papers,
calling client’s last known number, hiring a private investigator to locate
Plaintiff on January 31, 2024, and performing a people search/contact letters
sent via mail on January 29, 2024.
Counsel lists
the upcoming hearings on both the declaration and the proposed order.
The Court finds
that Counsel has shown good cause to be relieved as counsel due to the
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Further, Counsel has taken steps
to determine Plaintiff’s address to serve Plaintiff with this motion and its
attachments.
As such, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The motions to
be relieved as counsel are GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service of
the signed order on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
