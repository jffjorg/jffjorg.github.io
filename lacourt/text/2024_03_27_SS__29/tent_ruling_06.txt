 Case Number:  22STCV14212    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  29 Petition to
Approve Minor’s Compromise for Jasiah Rochon (Age 12).
 
Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on February 16, 2024. There are two discrepancies that must be addressed
before the petition can be approved. 
 
First, no medical records were
attached. 
 
Second, there is no reasoning given
as to the apportionment of settlement on attachment 11b(6), as is required.
 
Therefore, the Petition to Approve
Minor’s Compromise is DENIED without prejudice. 
Petitioner may file a new petition that addresses the issues identified
above.
 
Moving party to give notice.
