Industry seeks to compel further responses from Hernandez and Cubias, who argue that the motions are premature and that Industry did not properly meet and confer. The Court is concerned that the issues in dispute have become a bit of moving target and will consider imposing monetary sanctions against Hernandez and Cubias if they are found to have acted without substantial justification.
