Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the order striking the answer and entering default. The defendant's counsel failed to pay the monetary sanctions imposed by the court, and the court found that the terminating sanctions were improper. The court noted that the defendant had previously complied with the discovery orders, albeit tardily, and that the failure to pay the sanctions was the sole basis for the striking of the answer and entering of default. The court found that the defendant's counsel's failure to pay the sanctions was beyond the power of the court under the law, and therefore, the terminating sanctions were reversed.
