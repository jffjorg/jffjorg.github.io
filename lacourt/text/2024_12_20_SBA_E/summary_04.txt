Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendant's plea in abatement is sustained, and the action is stayed pending the termination of the Lewis case. The Lewis case involves a PAGA claim against Canoo Inc. and is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. The judge finds that the parties in the instant case and the parties in the Lewis case are identical because both cases involve PAGA claims. The judge grants the plaintiff's requests for judicial notice in full. The ruling is based on the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, which provides that a second-in-time action should be stayed if doing so would avoid potentially conflicting results or a waste of judicial resources.
