BACKGROUND
 
            On May 3,
2024, Plaintiffs Serina
Reed and Mitchell Reed filed the
Complaint alleging a single cause of action for Violation of the Song-Beverly
Act – Beach of Express Warranty.
 
            On October 25, 2023,
Plaintiffs propounded on Defendant the First Set of Form and Special Interrogatories.

 
            On November 28, 2023,
Defendant served responses that objected to all of Plaintiffs’ Form and Special
Interrogatories.
 
            On December 28, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent Defendant a meet and confer letter. 
 
            On July 10, 2024,
Defendant served its further responses to Plaintiffs’ Form and Special Interrogatories.  
 
            On August 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’
Form and Special Interrogatories. 
 
            On October 7, 2024,
Defendant filed their Opposition.
 
            On October 16, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their Reply.
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The propounding party
may file motions to compel further responses to requests for production if it
believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections
raised are meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
In response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent bears the
burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.    Meet and Confer
 
The Court finds
that Plaintiffs satisfied the meet and confer requirements as evidenced by
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, wherein he states that he met and conferred
with Defendant on July 29, 2024, regarding the Request for
Documents, Set One, and received
no response. (Thomas ¶ 16.)
 
B.    Procedural Defects
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs’ motion is procedurally defective and should be denied.
 
            Notice
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' Notice of Motion fails
to meet the procedural requirements. Specifically, it asserts that the notice
does not adequately specify the grounds for the motion, nor does it identify
the specific interrogatories in dispute or explain the deficiencies in
Defendant’s responses. However, the Court finds that the notice requirement is
satisfied because Plaintiffs' memorandum of points and authorities provides the
necessary grounds for the motion. The memorandum outlines the alleged
deficiencies in Defendant’s responses, including the failure to provide Code-compliant
responses as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure, and identifies
the specific requests in question. This provides sufficient notice to both the
Defendant and the Court regarding the issues being raised.
 
            California Rules of Court 3.1113 (b) 
 
            Defendant
argues that California Rules of Court 3.1113(b) requires that a memorandum
supporting a motion include a statement of facts, a concise statement of the
law, evidence, arguments, and a discussion of the legal authorities cited. (Cal
Rules of Court 3.1113(b).) Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving good cause and
justifying the discovery requests with specific facts. (Kirkland v. Superior
Court (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 Cal.App. 92, 98.) 
 
Defendant argues that instead of addressing
the merits of their motion and specific interrogatories (Nos. 2-12, 15-27,
29-30, 40-41, and 43-44), Plaintiffs merely assert that Defendant has not
provided complete responses without further elaboration. Thus, the motion
should be denied.
 
In reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s
assertion, that their Memorandum does not comply with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1113(b), is unfounded. Rule 3.1113(b) requires a memorandum to
contain a statement of facts, legal arguments, and supporting citations, all of
which Plaintiffs assert they provided. They contend that Defendant’s
supplemental responses to various Special Interrogatories and Form
Interrogatory 15.1 referenced unspecified documents, which Plaintiffs argue
does not meet the Code requirements for specificity. Plaintiffs addressed this
briefly in their motion, as they believed it was a straightforward compliance
issue. Additionally, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant failed to produce
promised documents for several Special Interrogatories and did not provide the
ordered supplemental responses to specific Interrogatories, despite assurances
to the Court on multiple occasions and an order following the June 21, 2024,
IDC. Plaintiffs maintain that these issues were sufficiently detailed in their
original Memorandum, underscoring that Defendant did not fulfill its
commitments.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs have complied
with Rules of Court 3.1113(b). Plaintiffs’ memo contains a statement of facts,
a brief statement of the law, arguments, evidence, and analysis. (Motion to
Compel further Responses to Special Interrogatories p. 1-5.) 
 
            Separate
Statement
 
            Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs' Separate Statement
fails to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court rule 3.1345(c), for
several reasons. First, Plaintiffs did not include the verbatim responses or
objections from Defendant, as required. Instead, they provided summaries or
paraphrases, which do not fully inform the court of the actual content of the
objections and responses. Second, Plaintiffs failed to offer a sufficient
explanation as to why Defendant’s objections were invalid or why their
responses were incomplete. Their reasoning is deemed conclusory and lacks the
specific analysis needed to show how the responses fail to comply with legal
requirements. Third, Plaintiffs omitted the necessary definitions,
instructions, or contextual details to help the court understand the scope of
the discovery requests and responses, thereby undermining the clarity of their
arguments. Lastly, Plaintiffs improperly referenced prior responses by
Defendant rather than setting them out verbatim, in violation of the rule
prohibiting incorporation by reference from other documents. According to
Defendants, these procedural deficiencies constitute violations of CRC
3.1345(c) and provide sufficient grounds for the court to deny the Plaintiffs'
motion.
 
Plaintiffs argue
that they submitted a concise outline in lieu of a separate statement pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 subdivision (b)(2). Furthermore,
Plaintiffs state that they do not take issue with any of Defendants objections.

 
“The Court may
allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2030.300 subd. (b)(2).) Here,
Plaintiff has provided a concise outline that lists every response in dispute.
(SROG Concise Outline p. 2-5.) The Court finds this to be sufficient and will
not deny the motion on this procedural ground.
 
Merits
 
            Form Interrogatories
 
            In response to the form interrogatories Defendant served
an 853-page pdf of documents. In response to Form Interrogatory 15.1, which
requests factual information, witness contacts, and supporting documents for
each denial, special defense, and affirmative defense asserted by Defendant,
Defendant merely referenced unspecified documents in the 853-page PDF. Plaintiff
requests that the Court compel Defendant to provide a code-compliant, verified
supplemental response to Form Interrogatory 15.1.
 
            Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has failed to properly
respond to Form Interrogatory 15.1, which seeks detailed factual information,
witness contacts, and supporting documents for each denial, special defense,
and affirmative defense asserted by Defendant. Plaintiffs contend that
Defendant misunderstood or ignored the requirements of Form Interrogatories,
drafted by the Judicial Council, by giving a single, broad response for all 34
affirmative defenses without specifying facts, witness information, or documents.
Plaintiffs assert that Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220(a) requires
responses to be complete and specific, and Defendant’s approach violates this
requirement.
 
            Defendant argues that its response to Interrogatory No.
15.1 is both appropriate and sufficient, especially given the current stage of
discovery and the broad scope of the interrogatory. Defendant states that Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1 seeks detailed information on all affirmative defenses,
including associated facts, documents, and witnesses, which is overly broad and
vague. Defendant further contends that it provided a substantive response,
addressing key aspects of its defenses, such as the lack of defect in the
vehicle, the adequacy of repair attempts, and Plaintiff's rejection of a
repurchase offer.
 
Defendant
emphasizes that discovery is ongoing, with depositions and vehicle inspections
yet to occur, which limits the ability to give a complete response at this
time. Defendant also invoked Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.230, allowing
reference to already-produced documents containing the requested information,
which they argue fulfills the legal requirement for specificity.
 
Defendant concludes
that the response provided is detailed enough for the current stage of
discovery and will be supplemented as discovery continues, arguing that
Plaintiffs’ demand for further responses is premature and does not acknowledge
the progressive nature of the discovery process.
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 subdivision (a)
states that “Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete
and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding
party permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220, subd. (a).) Here,
Defendant's response is not compliant with Section 2030.220(a) as Defendant has failed to give complete
and straightforward answers regarding the facts, witnesses, and documents
related to Defendant's affirmative defenses. Furthermore, while Defendant cites
Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.230 as justification for its response,
however, Section 2030.230 requires that specification of already produced
documents “be in sufficient detail to permit the propounding party to locate
and to identify, as readily as the responding party can, the documents from
which the answer may be ascertained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.) The Court finds
that merely referring to an 852-page PDF does not satisfy Section 2030.230.
 
            Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1
            
            Special Interrogatories
 
            In response to Special Interrogatories 2-7, 10-12, 15,
and 16, Defendant referenced unspecified documents it claimed to have produced
along with its response to Form Interrogatory 15.1.  In response to Special Interrogatories 8,
17-23, 25-27, 43, and 44, Defendant promised to produce certain documents
subject to a protective order.  Defendant
provided no response at all to Special Interrogatories 24, 29-30, or 40-41.
Plaintiff requests Code-compliant responses to Special Interrogatories 2-12,
15-27, 29-30, 40-41, and 43-44. 
 
            SROGs
2-7, 10-12, and 15-16
            
            Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s responses to Special
Interrogatories 2-7, 10-12, 15, and 16 all reference unspecified documents
Defendant may have produced, which does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2030.230 
 
            Defendants argue that their responses are complete as
they provide all facts necessary and point to the documents produced as part of
the 853-page PDF. However, Defendant has not provided in sufficient detail the
documents from which the answer may be ascertained as to each Special
Interrogatory. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel Further
Responses to SROG’s 2-7, 10-12, and 15-16.
 
            SROGs
8, 17-23, 25-27, and 43-44. 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendant promised to produce SROGs 8, 17-23, 25-27, and 43-44
under a protective order but has failed to do so. However, Defendants produced
the documents on September 25, 2024. (Hassantash Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
            Therefore,
the Court Denies the Motion to Compel Further Responses to SROG’s 8, 17-23,
25-27, and 43-44 as moot.
 
            SROGs
4, 29-30 40-41 
 
            Plaintiffs argue that Defendant failed to respond to
Special Interrogatories 24, 29-30, and 40-41, thereby waiving its objections
under Section 2030.290(a). Plaintiffs anticipate that Defendant will claim its
November 28, 2023, responses are sufficient but assert that Defendant’s counsel
committed to providing supplemental responses to all discovery in court
appearances on June 21 and July 9, 2024, deadlines that Defendant did not meet.
Plaintiffs contend that Defendant should be held accountable for these
representations and omissions and be ordered to produce responses to the
specified interrogatories without objections.
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ motion is procedurally
improper and untimely, as it was filed on August 26, 2024, 229 days after the
extended deadline of April 19, 2024, to compel further responses. Under Code
Civil Procedure section 2030.300, any motion to compel must be filed within 45
days of receiving responses, which Plaintiffs missed. Defendant contends that
its initial objection-only responses, served on November 28, 2023, were
legitimate and that supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories 24,
29-30, and 40-41 were provided on July 10, 2024, consistent with courtroom
discussions. Defendant asserts that it never agreed to provide further
responses for every discovery request, nor did it extend any response deadlines
beyond April 19, 2024.
 
Defendant also
highlights that the scheduling of an Informal Discovery Conference does not
extend the filing deadline for a motion to compel, per courtroom rules and
Local Rule Appendix 3A. Defendant contends Plaintiffs waived their right to
compel further responses by missing the April deadline, making the current
motion baseless. The deadline to file this motion is mandatory, and Defendant
asserts that the Court lacks authority to extend this deadline, warranting
denial of Plaintiffs' motion regarding the specified interrogatories.
 
In the reply,
Plaintiffs argue that the Court should grant the Motion despite its
untimeliness because Defendant allegedly lied to Plaintiffs and the Court
regarding Defendant’s willingness to provide further responses to all special
interrogatories. In the alternative, the Plaintiffs request the Court construe
the current motion as one to compel compliance with the Court’s June 21, 2024,
Order. However, Plaintiff provides no authority under which the Court can grant
either of their requests.
 
Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion to Compel Further Responses as to SROGs
4, 29-30, and 40-41 as untimely.
 
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 2030.300(d) and 2031.310(h) state that the court shall impose a
monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or
demands for production unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (d); Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310
subd. (h).)
 
Plaintiffs request sanctions in the amount of $3,975.00
regarding the SROGs and $3,390.00 regarding the form interrogatories.
Defendants request sanctions in the amount of $900 for opposing the motion
regarding the SROGs and $900 for opposing the motion regarding the form
interrogatories.
 
The Motion to
Compel Further Responses to SROGs was granted in part and denied in part, and
thus, the court refuses to award sanctions for either party, as the motion was
partially successful, but the partial denial shows that Defendant was justified
in opposing the motion.
 
As to the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, the Motion to Compel was
granted, and thus sanctions are warranted. However, the Court finds Plaintiffs
request for sanctions excessive. Plaintiff's counsel states that they spent 2.9
hours drafting the motion, 3 hours drafting the reply, and 1.5 hours preparing
for the hearing, billed at 450$ an hour plus a $60 filing fee totaling to $3,390. Plaintiffs Motion only regarded one form
interrogatory. Therefore, the Court lowers the time spent to .5 hours on the
motion, .5 hours on the reply, and .5 hours on the hearing, plus the filing
fee, equaling sanctions in the amount of $735.
 
Therefore, the
Court grants Plaintiffs request for sanctions in the amount of $735.

HEARING: Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified in

            The Court considered the moving,

RULING
 
The Court denies the Motion to Deem the Truth of
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission Admitted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On May 3,
2024, Plaintiffs Serina
Reed and Mitchell Reed filed the
Complaint alleging a single cause of action for Violation of the Song-Beverly
Act – Beach of Express Warranty.
 
            On October 25, 2023,
Plaintiffs propounded on Defendant a First Set of Requests for Admissions.
 
            On November 28, 2023,
Defendant served responses that objected to all of Plaintiffs’ Requests for
Admissions.
 
            On December 28, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent Defendant a meet and confer letter.
 
            On June 21, 2024,
Defendant promised to serve supplemental discovery responses by July 3, 2024.
 
            On July 10, 2024,
Defendant served its further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions.
Defendant provided no response at all to RFAs 23, 33, or 34.
 
            On July 29, 2024,
Plaintiffs sent Defendant a meet and confer letter.
 
            On August 26, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed the instant motion.
 
            On October 3, 2024,
Defendant filed the Opposition.
 
            On October 10, 2024,
Defendant filed the Reply.
 
            Trial is set for April
7, 2025.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to
the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of
specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to
fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.250, subd. (a).)
If a party to whom a request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including those based on privilege
or the work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted and
for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court
shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance before the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
            
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiffs
request that the Court deem RFAs 23, 33, and 34 admitted.
 
Plaintiffs argue
that the Discovery Act entitles them to obtain discovery responses to all RFAs.
If a party fails to respond within 30 days, they waive any objections,
including those based on privilege. (Code Civ Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
Plaintiffs assert that if a party fails to respond timely, the requesting party
can move for an order deeming the matters admitted, without a time limit on
filing or a requirement to meet and confer before doing so. (Code Civ Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs expect Defendant to argue that its responses
from November 28, 2023, are sufficient, but they contend that Defendant’s
counsel previously represented in court appearances that it would serve
supplemental responses to all discovery by specific deadlines, which were not
met. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant should be held accountable for its
counsel's representations and ordered to respond to RFAs 23, 33, and 34.
 
However, a Motion
to Deem the Truth of
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission Admitted may only be granted if the
opposing party fails to file a response to a request for admission. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) Here, Defendant served responses on November 28,
2023. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit. B.) While Plaintiff argues that Defendant
should be held accountable for its promises, the Court does not have the power
to grant the instant motion based on Defendant’s alleged representations. Plaintiffs
also argue that Defendant likely violated their Duty of Candor toward the
Tribunal under Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3; however, even if Defendant
breached these duties, the Court would not be able to grant the instant motion.

 
Therefore,
because Defendant served responses to Plaintiff's RFAs, the Court denies the Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified
in Requests for Admission Admitted.
 
Sanctions 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 2030.300(d) and 2031.310(h) state that the court shall impose a
monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or
demands for production unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (d); Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310
subd. (h).)
 
Here, both parties request that sanctions be
imposed. However, the Court exercises its discretion and refuses to impose any
sanctions. Sanctions cannot be imposed against Defendant because they were
successful in their opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. Furthermore, the Court
refuses to impose sanctions on Plaintiff based on Defendant’s representation
that it would provide further responses.
