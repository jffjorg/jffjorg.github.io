BACKGROUND
 
            On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff Brasie
Maria Thomas filed the Complaint against Defendants Specialized Loan Servicing

REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            The Court may take
judicial notice of records of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of
record of the United States or of any state of the United States. (Evid. Code §
452 subd. (d).) The Court may also take judicial notice of “Official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States.” (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (c).)      Last,
the Court may take judicial notice of “facts and propositions that are
not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452 subd. (h).)
 
            Defendants request the Court take
judicial notice of the Substitution of Trustee recorded on November 17, 2021,
in the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office, the Substitution of Trustee
recorded on July 24, 2023, in the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office, the
eligibility guidelines for the California Housing Finance Agency's Mortgage
Relief Program as published by the U.S. Treasury, and the 2019 national
conforming loan limit values by county for mortgages that finance single-family
one-unit properties as published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
 
            The Court takes judicial notice of
the Substitution of Trustee documents pursuant to Evidence Code section 452
subdivision (c). The Court also takes judicial notice of the eligibility
guidelines for the California Housing Finance Agency's Mortgage Relief Program
and the 2019 national conforming loan limit values by county for mortgages that
finance single-family one-unit properties, pursuant to Evidence Code section
452 subdivision (h). (See, Ampex Corp. v. Cargle (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
1569, 1573.)
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) 
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for
uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the
complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendant
NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing demurs to the Complaint.
 
On May 7, 2019, Plaintiff obtained a
$1,060,000 loan secured by a Deed of Trust on a property located at 9633
Crenshaw Blvd., Inglewood, CA. On December 13, 2020, the beneficial interest in
the Deed of Trust was assigned to Great Lake Funding I Trust, U.S. Bank Trust
National Association as trustee. 
 
In December 2021, Plaintiff defaulted on her
loan obligations, and a Notice of Default was recorded by Quality Loan Service
Corporation on December 14, listing arrearages of $127,600. This Notice of
Default was rescinded on December 22, 2022.
 
In July 2023, ZBS Law LLP was substituted as
the foreclosure trustee, and on October 16, 2023, ZBS recorded a new Notice of
Default indicating arrearages of $62,636.61. When Plaintiff did not cure the
default, a Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded on February 29, 2024, with a
scheduled sale date of March 21, 2024.
 
In June 2023, Plaintiff learned of the
California Mortgage Relief Program, which aids homeowners by covering past-due
mortgage payments if arrearages are under $80,000 and the unpaid principal
balance at loan origination is below the conforming loan limit of $726,525.
 
Plaintiff alleges that her arrearages were
around $30,000 in June 2023. She applied to the program in July 2023, and her
application was approved. Plaintiff claims Defendant needed to approve the
application for the program, delayed in doing so, and that by the time they
responded, her arrearages had risen to $80,000, leading her to assert, that Defendant
ultimately denied the application.
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Before filing a
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
            On September 16, 2024, Defendants met and conferred
Plaintiff via phone. (Jindal Decl. ¶ 4.) The Court finds this is sufficient to
satisfy the meet and confer requirement.
 
Cause
of Action 1 – Violation of Civil Code Section 2924(a)(6)
            
Civil Code Section 2924 subdivision (a)(6)
reads, “An entity shall not record or cause a notice of default to be recorded
or otherwise initiate the foreclosure process unless it is the holder of the
beneficial interest under the mortgage or deed of trust, the original trustee
or the substituted trustee under the deed of trust, or the designated agent of
the holder of the beneficial interest. An agent of the holder of the beneficial
interest under the mortgage or deed of trust, original trustee, or substituted
trustee under the deed of trust shall not record a notice of default or
otherwise commence the foreclosure process except when acting within the scope
of authority designated by the holder of the beneficial interest.” (Civ. Code § 2924.12 subd. (a)(6).)
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim
alleging a violation of Civil Code section 2924 subdivision (a)(6) fails
because there is no private right of action under that section. The Legislature
specifically outlined which sections of the Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR)
allow homeowners to seek remedies for violations. Civil Code section 2924.12(b)
permits homeowners to recover damages for violations of seven specific HBOR
sections after a foreclosure sale: Civil Code sections 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7,
2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.17. (Civ. Code § 2924.12 subd. (b).) Furthermore, Civil Code
section 2924.12(a) allows homeowners to seek injunctive relief for violations
of the same seven sections if a foreclosure sale has not yet occurred. (Civ.
Code § 2924.12
subd. (a).) Section 2924(a)(6) is notably absent from this list, indicating
that the Legislature did not intend for it to be enforceable through a private
cause of action. Defendant contends that the Legislature’s omission of section
2924(a)(6) from the enforceable sections means that no action can be brought
under it. (Gomes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
1149, 1155.)  Therefore, Defendant argues
that the demurrer to this claim should be sustained without leave to amend.
            
            In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that Courts have consistently allowed claims that challenge
whether the entity initiating foreclosure has the proper authority under the HBOR.
However, Plaintiff does not provide any such cases. Last, Plaintiff argues that
this is a substantive issue and not a procedural issue, as it directly impacts
the legality of the foreclosure proceedings.
 
            In Gomes, the
Court of Appeal found that Civil Code Section 2924 subdivision (a) does not
provide for a private cause of action because “nowhere does the statute provide
for a judicial action to determine whether the person initiating the
foreclosure process is indeed authorized, and we see no ground for implying
such an action.” (Gomes, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1155.) In
her opposition, Plaintiff provides no rebuttal to Gomes. Thus, the Court
finds that there is no private right of action under Civil Code section 2924
subdivision (a)(6). Subsequently, Plaintiff’s claim fails as a matter of law. 
 
            Therefore, the Court
sustains the Demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend.
 
Cause
of Action 2 – Violation of Civil Code Section 2924.17
 
            Civil Code Section 2924.17 requires that a notice of
default, notice of sale, assignment of a deed of trust, or substitution of
trustee be accurate, complete, and supported by reliable evidence. (Civ. Code § 2924.17) 
 
            Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s second claim, alleging a violation of Section 2924.17, is
unfounded. Plaintiff claims that the 2023 Notice of Default and 2024 Notice of
Trustee's Sale were improperly recorded by ZBS as the foreclosure trustee,
asserting that ZBS had not been legally substituted as trustee under the Deed
of Trust at that time. However, Defendant points out that a Substitution of
Trustee was recorded on July 24, 2023, designating ZBS as the foreclosure
trustee. Therefore, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s claim is invalid and
should be dismissed, as the recorded documents confirm ZBS’s authority to act
as trustee.
 
            In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that the second cause of action for violation of Civil Code
2924.17 should not be dismissed, asserting that the foreclosure documents were
filed without the necessary due diligence by Defendant.  Plaintiff’s complaint claims that the 2023 Notice
of Default and 2024 Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded without proper
verification, as required by Civil Code 2924.17, because ZBS was not legally
substituted as a trustee at the time of filing. Furthermore, Plaintiff contends
that the earlier Notice of Default filed by Quality Loan Service Corporation
was invalid for the same reason.
 
            The Court has taken
notice of the Substitution of Trustee dated November 5, 2021, showing that
Quality Loan Service Corporation was transferred trusteeship from Fidelity
National Title Company and Great Lake Funding I Trust. (Request for Judicial
Notice Exhibit 1.) The Court has also taken notice of the Substitution of
Trustee dated July 18, 2023, showing that ZBS was transferred trusteeship.
(Request for Judicial Notice Exhibit 2.) 
 
            A demurrer “does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar, supra, 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.) Here, the judicially noticed documents show that there was a
valid transfer of trusteeship to Quality Loan Service Corporation and, later,
to ZBS. Thus, Plaintiff’s contentions that both Notices of Default and Notices
of Trustee Sale were improperly filed without authorization are unfounded. 
 
            Therefore, the Court
sustains the Demurrer to the second cause of action with leave to amend.
 
Cause
of Action 3 – Tortious Interference with a Contractual Relationship
 
            To establish
liability for tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff
must prove "(1) it has a valid and existing contract with a third party;
(2) defendants had knowledge of the contract; (3) defendants committed an
intentional act designed to induce a breach or disrupt the contractual
relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contract relationship
occurred; and (5) damages were suffered as a result." (Quelimane Co.
Inc. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 55.)
 
            Defendant asserts that Plaintiff fails to establish a
claim of tortious interference with a contractual relationship because she does
not allege a valid and enforceable contract with CalHFA that Defendant
interfered with.
 
While Plaintiff
claims she was "approved" by CalHFA for assistance in June 2023, she
also states that Defendant later denied her application when her arrearages
exceeded $80,000, which contradicts the existence of an enforceable contract.
(Comp. ¶ 28.) Furthermore, Defendant highlights that Plaintiff could not have
qualified for a contract with CalHFA since the program’s guidelines require the
original loan balance to be under the conforming loan limit, which was $726,525
in 2019. Plaintiff’s loan was over $1 million at origination, making her
ineligible for the program. Therefore, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claim
for interference with contractual relations lacks the necessary foundation of a
valid contract and should be dismissed.
Plaintiff argues that her third cause of
action for tortious interference with contractual relations against Defendant
should not be dismissed. Defendant claims Plaintiff lacks a valid, enforceable
contract with CalHFA; however, Plaintiff contends that her approval for
assistance under the California Mortgage Relief Program by CalHFA created a
legitimate expectation of performance, even without a formal contract.
 
Plaintiff argues that interference with
prospective contractual relations can exist if there is a probable economic
benefit, even if the contract is not finalized. (Quelimane Co. Inc, supra, 19 Cal.4th 26; Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co.
(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1118, 1126.) Plaintiff’s
approval by CalHFA represented a prospective contract, and Defendant’s alleged
interference disrupted her ability to benefit from the program, fulfilling the
elements of tortious interference.
 
Defendant’s argument about Plaintiff's loan
exceeding the program’s conforming limit does not bar her claim. Plaintiff
argues that interference may still apply even if a final agreement was not reached
or eligibility requirements were unmet. (Crown Imports, LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1395,
1405.) Plaintiff states she was initially approved, and any issues related
to the loan limit only arose after Defendant's interference, which caused her
arrearages to exceed the program's limit. Plaintiff claims Defendant’s actions
disrupted her ability to complete the program and obtain mortgage relief,
supporting her claim for tortious interference.
 
Intentional
interference with a contractual relationship requires a valid and existing
contract with a third party. (Quelimane Co. Inc, supra, 19 Cal. 4th 26,
55.) While Plaintiff cites Quelimane and Pacific Gas in asserting
that interference with prospective contractual relationships can
occur even if the contract is not finalized, neither case supports this
assertion. In Quelimane, the Court found that there was an existing
contract between the parties, leading to the successful pleading of tortious interference with contractual
relations, and the Court in Pacific Gas was analyzing the tort of
interference with prospective economic advantage, not tortious interference with a contractual
relationship. (Quelimane
Co. Inc, supra, 19 Cal. 4th 26, 56;
Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., supra, 50
Cal.3d 1118, 1126.) 
 
Here, the Complaint fails to plead any
contract between Plaintiff and CalHFA, and thus, the cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations
fails as a matter of law,
 
Therefore, the Demurrer to the third cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Cause
of Action 4 – Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200
 
            California Business and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits “any
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Cal. Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605,
610.)  A violation of other laws is deemed independently actionable under
the UCL. (See Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance
Services (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 544, 554.)  “‘Virtually any law, federal,
state or local, can serve as a predicate for a section 17200 action.’” (Id.
(quoting Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305,
1335).)  To establish a fraudulent practice under the UCL, the plaintiff
must show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.  (See West
v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 806.)  “A
business practice is unfair within the meaning of the UCL if it violates
established public policy or if it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or
unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its
benefits.”  (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1457, 1473.)  Further, Statutory claims must be pled with
particularity.  (Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 396, 410.)
 
            The Complaint pleads
that “the conduct and business practices of Defendants, and their agents,
alleges[sic] herein, constituted unfair and unlawful business practices within
the provisions of California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq”
(Complaint ¶ 84.)
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff lacks standing under the
Unfair Competition Law because she has not demonstrated an "injury in
fact" involving a loss of money or property directly caused by Defendant's
actions, as required by Business and Professions Code § 17204. Plaintiff only
alleges increased loan arrears and incurred costs without clarifying how these
damages were caused by Defendant's conduct. Defendant points out that
Plaintiff's financial losses stem from her own loan default, not Defendant’s
actions. Defendant argues that borrowers who default prior to the alleged
wrongful acts lack standing to sue under Section 17200, as the default, rather
than any alleged misconduct, initiates fees and foreclosure proceedings. (Jenkins
v JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A (2013) 216 Cal.App. 4th 497, 522-523.)
Consequently, Plaintiff’s failure to meet the UCL standing requirement renders
her claim legally insufficient.
 
            Furthermore, under the "fraudulent" prong,
Plaintiff must show that Defendant’s practices were likely to deceive the
public, which Plaintiff has not alleged, nor has she demonstrated actual
reliance on any alleged fraudulent conduct. (In re Tobacco II Cases, 46
Ca1.4th 298, 312.) Regarding the "unfair" prong, Defendant’s conduct
must violate a public policy connected to specific legal provisions. Plaintiff
has not successfully linked her UCL claim to any HBOR violation, and, according
to Defendant, she lacks grounds to maintain any HBOR claim. For the
"unlawful" prong, Plaintiff must establish a violation of another law
as a basis for the UCL claim, but she has not provided facts supporting any
statutory violation. (Berryman v. Merit Prop. Mgmt.,
Inc., 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
failure to establish unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent conduct justifies
dismissal of her UCL claim.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues that she has standing
under the UCL, as the statute grants individuals standing if they suffered
injury in fact, and lost money or property due to an unfair practice. Plaintiff
alleges that Quality Loan Service Corporation and ZBS improperly recorded
foreclosure notices without proper authority, violating California Civil Code sections
2924 and 2924.17.
 
Although Defendant
contends that Plaintiff’s financial issues stem from her default, Plaintiff
clarifies she is not disputing her default but rather the legality of
Defendant’s foreclosure procedures, including the unlawful recording of Notice
of Trustee Sale. Plaintiff argues that foreclosure irregularities tied to
improper assignments or substitutions provide grounds for her UCL claim.
Plaintiff concludes that the alleged foreclosure misconduct caused her
significant financial harm, precisely the type of injury that UCL seeks to
address, and therefore requests the court deny Defendant's Demurrer.
 
“Violation of another law is a predicate for stating
a cause of action under the UCL's unlawful prong." (Berryman, supra, 152
Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) 
 
            The Court has found
that Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action under California Civil Code section 2924 or 2924.17, as
the Court has taken judicial notice of valid Substitution of Trustee documents
relating to both Quality Loan Servicing and ZBS. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to
plead facts showing violation of another law as required to state a cause of
action under Business and Professions Code § 17200. (Berryman, supra, 152
Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) 
 
            Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer to the fourth
cause of action with leave to amend.

HEARING: Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction
            
The
Court considered the moving and opposition papers.
 
RULING
 
            The Court
denies the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff Brasie
Maria Thomas filed the Complaint against Defendants Specialized Loan Servicing
LLC and ZBS Law LLP, alleging causes of action for violation of Civil Code §
2924(a)(6), violation of Civil Code § 2924.17, tortious interference with
contractual relationships, and violation of Business and Professional Code §
17200 arising from an alleged unlawful foreclosure.
 
            On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff
requested the Court grant a preliminary injunction restraining Defendants from
foreclosing on Plaintiff's property located at 9633 Crenshaw Blvd, Inglewood,
California.
 
            On November 4, 2024, Defendant
NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing LLC (erroneously sued as
Specialized Loan Savings LLC) filed their opposition. The same day Defendant RF
Mortgage Services Corporation (Doe 1) filed their opposition.
 
            Plaintiff has not filed a reply.
 
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The purpose of a
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the
merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App.
4th 618, 623.)  In deciding whether or not to grant a preliminary
injunction, the court looks to two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that
the plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms
that is likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.) The
factors are interrelated, with a greater showing on one permitting a lesser
showing on the other.  (Dodge, Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc.
v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420.)  However, the party
seeking an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of
success on the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35
Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the burden of
demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the occurrence of
irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (CCP § 526(a).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
             Plaintiff requests the Court grant a
preliminary injunction restraining Defendants from foreclosing on Plaintiff's
property located at 9633 Crenshaw Blvd, Inglewood, California.
 
On May 7, 2019, Plaintiff obtained a
$1,060,000 loan secured by a Deed of Trust on property located at 9633 Crenshaw
Blvd., Inglewood, CA. On December 13, 2020, the beneficial interest in the Deed
of Trust was assigned to Great Lake Funding I Trust, U.S. Bank Trust National
Association as trustee. 
 
In December 2021, Plaintiff defaulted on her
loan obligations, and a Notice of Default was recorded by Quality Loan Service
Corporation on December 14, listing arrearages of $127,600. This Notice of
Default was rescinded on December 22, 2022.
 
In July 2023, ZBS Law LLP was substituted as
the foreclosure trustee, and on October 16, 2023, ZBS recorded a new Notice of
Default indicating arrearages of $62,636.61. When Plaintiff did not cure the
default, a Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded on February 29, 2024, with a
scheduled sale date of March 21, 2024.
 
In June 2023, Plaintiff learned of the
California Mortgage Relief Program, which aids homeowners by covering past-due
mortgage payments if arrearages are under $80,000 and the unpaid principal
balance at loan origination is below the conforming loan limit of $726,525.
 
Plaintiff alleges that her arrearages were
around $30,000 in June 2023. She applied to the program in July 2023, and her
application was approved. Plaintiff claims Defendant needed to approve the
application for the program, delayed in doing so, and that by the time they
responded, her arrearages had risen to $80,000, leading her to assert, that Defendant
ultimately denied the application.
 
Likelihood to Succeed on the Merits
 
            The party seeking an
injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of success on the
merits.  (IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)
 
            Cause of Action 1
- Violation of Civil Code Section
2924(a)(6)
 
            Plaintiff argues she will succeed on her claim for
violation of California Civil Code 2924(a)(6), which states that only the
holder of the beneficial interest, the original trustee, the substituted
trustee, or a designated agent may record a notice of default or initiate
foreclosure. Plaintiff claims that Defendants failed to comply with this code
and wrongfully initiated foreclosure proceedings against her property, putting
her and her family at risk of an imminent trustee sale. (Civ.
Code § 2924 subd. (a)(6).)
 
Plaintiff explains
that the Deed of Trust identifies Fidelity as the trustee, and on February 4,
2021, a substitution assigned the Deed of Trust’s beneficial interest to Great
Lake Funding I Trust, U.S. Bank Trust National Association. However, Plaintiff
alleges that ZBS Law LLP (ZBS), on behalf of Specialized Loan Servicing, recorded
a Notice of Default on October 18, 2023, and a Notice of Trustee’s Sale on
February 29, 2024, without authority. Plaintiff claims that Fidelity, not ZBS,
was the only entity authorized to record foreclosure notices and that ZBS acted
without valid authority.
 
As a result,
Plaintiff argues she was prejudiced because she could not engage with the
proper trustee to seek a postponement of the sale or loan reinstatement.
Plaintiff claims further harm, including damage to her credit, imminent
eviction, and a lost opportunity to modify her loan to save her home from
foreclosure.
 
Plaintiff requests
the court enjoin Defendants' scheduled foreclosure sale until they demonstrate
compliance with Civil Code 2923.5, which allows injunctive relief when
foreclosure procedures are improperly followed.
 
            Defendants have
provided a Substitution of Trustee dated November 5, 2021, showing that Quality
Loan Service Corporation was transferred trusteeship from Fidelity National
Title Company and Great Lake Funding I Trust, and a later Substitution of
Trustee dated July 18, 2023, showing that ZBS was transferred trusteeship.
(Request for Judicial Notice Exhibit 1, 2.) Thus, Defendant has shown that ZBS
was the trustee at the time of the Notice of Default and the Notice of Trustee
Sale. Furthermore, the Court has found that Civil Code Section 2924(a)(6) does not grant a private right of action. (Gomes
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1155.)
 
            Therefore, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable likelihood to succeed on the
merits as to the first cause of action.
 
Cause of Action 2 –
Violation of Civil Code Section 2924.17
 
Civil Code section 2924.17 requires that a
notice of default, notice of sale, assignment of a deed of trust, or
substitution of trustee be accurate, complete, and supported by reliable
evidence. (Civ. Code § 2924.17)

 
Plaintiff argues she will succeed on her claim
for violation of Civil Code section 2924.17. Plaintiff contends that Defendants
failed to comply with the requirements of Civil Code section 2924.17, which has
unlawfully jeopardized her interest in her home by initiating foreclosure
without proper authority or evidence. She claims that Defendants, specifically
ZBS, acting without proper authority, recorded a Notice of Default and Notice
of Trustee’s Sale despite the substitution rights being assigned to Great Lake
Funding I Trust, rendering the foreclosure notices void.
 
Plaintiff argues that, due to these violations
and since her property has not yet been sold, she is entitled to injunctive
relief to prevent Defendants from proceeding with the foreclosure sale while
the action is pending.
 
            Defendants have
provided a Substitution of Trustee dated November 5, 2021, showing that Quality
Loan Service Corporation was transferred trusteeship from Fidelity National
Title Company and Great Lake Funding I Trust, and a later Substitution of
Trustee dated July 18, 2023, showing that ZBS was transferred trusteeship.
(Request for Judicial Notice Exhibit 1, 2.) Thus, Defendant has shown that ZBS
was the trustee at the time of the Notice of Default and the Notice of Trustee
Sale. 
            
            Therefore, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable likelihood to succeed on the
merits as to the second cause of action.
 
Cause of Action 3 –
Tortious Interference with a Contractual Relationship
 
            To establish liability for tortious interference with contractual
relations, a plaintiff must prove "(1) it has a valid and existing
contract with a third party; (2) defendants had knowledge of the contract; (3)
defendants committed an intentional act designed to induce a breach or disrupt
the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contract
relationship occurred; and (5) damages were suffered as a result." (Quelimane
Co. Inc. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 55.)
 
            Plaintiff argues that she will prevail on her claim for tortious
interference with contractual relations. 
Plaintiff contends that specific intent is not required for this tort;
instead, it suffices if Defendants knew that their actions were substantially
certain to interfere with Plaintiff’s economic advantage. (Korea Supply Co.
v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29
Cal.4th 1134, 1154.)
 
Additionally,
according to Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Plaintiff does not need to
show an actual breach of contract, only that Defendants’ interference made her
performance more burdensome. (Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co. (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1118, 1126.) 
 
In late June 2023,
Plaintiff discovered the California Mortgage Relief Program (CMRP), which
provides mortgage relief up to $80,000. At the time, her past-due balance was
about $30,000, making her eligible. She was informed by an agent from Defendant
that she could either apply for a loan modification directly with Defendant or
apply to the CMRP, but not both. Relying on assurances from Defendant’s agent,
Plaintiff applied for CMRP and was approved. However, Defendant delayed
responding to CMRP until Plaintiff’s arrears reached $80,000, resulting in her
application’s denial. Plaintiff claims this disrupted her ability to pay the
past due balance, sell her home, and avoid foreclosure.
 
Intentional interference with a contractual
relationship requires a valid and existing contract with a third party. (Quelimane Co. Inc, supra, 19 Cal. 4th 26, 55.)  Here, Plaintiff has failed to show that a
contract was ever formed between Plaintiff and the CMRP, as Plaintiff was never
approved for the program.
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has not a reasonable likelihood to succeed on the
merits as to the third cause of action.
 
            Cause of Action 4 – Violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200
 
            Plaintiff argues that the trial court has broad authority to enjoin
conduct violating Business and Professions Code 17200 (UCL), which prohibits
any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices. Under Section
17200, "unlawful" conduct includes practices forbidden by any law, civil,
criminal, or regulatory. A business practice may be considered
"unfair" if it violates the spirit or policy of established law. (People
v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1948) 159 Cal.App.3rd 509, 530.) Plaintiff
contends that Defendant’s actions constitute unlawful conduct, as they have
engaged in statutory violations directly causing the harm Plaintiff faces, unlawful
foreclosure. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s foreclosure activities were
inherently unfair, aiming to wrongfully foreclose on Plaintiff's property.
Therefore, Plaintiff urges the Court to enjoin Defendant’s unlawful and unfair
business practices associated with the foreclosure of her home under the UCL.
 
            “Violation of another law is a predicate for stating a
cause of action under the UCL's unlawful prong." (Berryman
v. Merit Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.)
 
            The Court has found that Plaintiff was unlikely to
succeed on the causes of action it bases its UCL cause of action on. Thus, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to provide a violation of another law as
required for a successful UCL claim. (Berryman, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th
1544, 1554.) 
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has not a reasonable likelihood to succeed on the
merits as to the fourth cause of action.
 
            Subsequently,
Plaintiff has not shown a “reasonable probability of success on the
merits.  (IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.) Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.
