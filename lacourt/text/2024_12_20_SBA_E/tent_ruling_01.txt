RULING
 
            The Court grants the Motion to Set Aside the
Order Striking the Answer and Entering Default.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On April
3, 2023, Plaintiffs Giuseppe Sanzone and Caroline Peterson filed the Complaint
against Defendant FCA US LLC, alleging causes of action for violations of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
 
            On January 16, 2024, the
Court ordered monetary sanctions of $2,500 against Defendant’s Counsel, payable
within 20 days. The Court also ordered Defendant to provide verified amended or
further responses without objection within 20 days. Neither of these orders were
followed.
 
            On March 29, 2024, the Court
ordered further monetary sanctions of $2,500 against Defendant’s Counsel,
payable by April 19, 2024.
 
            On August 26, 2024, the
Court granted additional monetary sanctions of $3,660 against counsel for
Defendant, payable by September 13, 2024.
 
            On October 4, 2024, this
Court struck the Answer of Defendant and issued an Order to Show Cause.
 
            On November 20, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
            On December 9, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the Opposition.
 
            On December 20, 2024,
Defendant filed the Reply.
                        
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The court is
authorized, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to impose the following
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating
sanctions, and contempt. (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030 subd. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by
an order dismissing the action against whom the sanction is imposed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿2023.030 subd. (d)(3).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010,
subdivision (g), provides that a misuse of the discovery process includes, but
is not limited to, “[d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”  
 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of
New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of
the party entitled to but denied discovery. (Ibid.) “But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.,
quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280; Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702
(quoting same).)  
 
Because terminating sanctions are the most
“drastic” penalty, they are typically a “last resort” to be “used sparingly”;
however, they may still be appropriate “as a first measure” in “extreme cases”
where a litigant violates a court order and “persists in the outright refusal
to comply with [its] discovery obligations.” (Siry Investment, L.P. v.
Farkhondehpour¿(2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 1098, 1118,¿as modified on denial of
reh’g (Mar. 23, 2020).)
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
             
On October 4, 2024,
the Court granted a Motion to Strike the Answer and Enter Default (terminating
sanctions.) An OSC for contempt and default judgment was set for November 15,
2024. At that hearing, the Court ordered any motion for relief to be heard on
December 20, 2024. Defendant requests the Court vacate the prior order and
reinstate Defendant’s answer.
 
Defendants argue
that the Court's order imposing terminating sanctions against Defendant was
improper because the sanctions arose from the attorneys’ failure to pay
monetary sanctions. Defendant fully complied with the court's discovery orders,
and the court never ordered Defendant to pay sanctions. Defendants contend that
terminating sanctions cannot be imposed on Defendant for the fault of its
attorneys, that dismissal is never an appropriate remedy for an attorney's
failure to pay monetary sanctions, and that such an order would exceed the
court's jurisdiction. (Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
755-756.)
 
Defendants further
argue that the proper remedy for unpaid attorney sanctions is not terminating
sanctions. Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b)
mandates relief when an attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect
causes a default or dismissal. This provision protects innocent clients from
the consequences of their attorneys' errors and shifts the burden to the
attorney to seek relief. (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 257.) Here, Defendant satisfies all the statutory
requirements for mandatory relief because the sanctions arose solely from the
attorney’s failure to act, and there is no evidence of Defendant's misconduct.
 
Finally, Defendants
highlight that none of the two exceptions to mandatory relief under §473(b)
apply here. The default was not caused by Defendant, but solely by the
attorneys’ failure to pay sanctions, and there is no dispute about the
attorneys' fault. Given the strong policy favoring relief for innocent clients,
Defendants argue the order striking Defendant’s answer and entering default
must be vacated, as it was issued in excess of the court’s jurisdiction.
 
Plaintiff argues
that terminating sanctions against Defendant are justified because both
Defendant and its attorneys are responsible for the discovery failures and
noncompliance with court orders. While monetary sanctions were imposed
specifically on Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff emphasizes that Defendant itself
failed to respond to written discovery and comply with multiple court orders.
Plaintiff asserts that an attorney’s actions or inactions are imputed to the
client, and a party cannot avoid sanctions by shifting blame to their attorney.
(Carroll v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 892, 898.)
 
Plaintiff argues
that Jones is distinguishable because the court did not dismiss the case
but struck Defendant’s Answer as a terminating sanction, which is permissible
under California Code of Civil Procedure §2023.030(d). (Jones, supra,
156 Cal.App.3d 754, 759.) This section explicitly allows courts to impose
terminating sanctions, including striking pleadings, when a party engages in
misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s repeated
failures to provide verified discovery responses and its violations of court
orders constitute clear misuse of the discovery process.
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff highlights that this Court has already acknowledged Defendant’s
failures independent of its counsel’s conduct. The January 16, 2024, Order
explicitly required Defendant to provide verified responses, which it failed to
do. The March 29, 2024, Order noted Defendant’s repeated failure to meet
deadlines. Plaintiff argues that these failures demonstrate Defendant’s own
culpability, not just its counsel’s.
 
In reply, Defendant
highlights that the Court had previously denied two motions for terminating
sanctions, recognizing that Defendant had complied with all discovery orders,
albeit tardily. This is evident from the Court’s March 29, 2024, minute order,
which explicitly stated that Defendant “did ultimately comply with the
Court-ordered discovery.”(March 29,
2024, Minute Order.) 
 
Defendant
emphasizes that the basis for the terminating sanctions was counsel’s failure
to pay the sanctions, not any misconduct by Defendant. The Court’s prior
rulings consistently rejected terminating sanctions against Defendant, and the
subsequent order striking Defendant’s answer was predicated solely on the
actions of its attorneys. 
 
In Jones,
the Court found that “dismissal can never be an appropriate remedy for an
attorney's noncompliance with an order imposing monetary sanctions.” (Jones,
supra, 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 759.)
 
The Court’s March
29, 2024, Order notes
that Defendant failed to abide by multiple deadlines and that while Defendant’s
discovery abuse does not warrant terminating sanctions at the moment, it may in
the future. (March 29, 2024, Minute Order.) 
 
The Court’s August
2024 order notes that Defendant failed to pay the sanctions imposed at the
order on March 29,
2024. (August 26, 2024, Minute Order.) The Order also required Defendant’s
Counsel to pay further sanctions and set a compliance hearing for September 20,
2024. (August 26, 2024, Minute Order.) At the September 20, 2024, Compliance Hearing,
the Court was informed that Defendant’s counsel had not paid the imposed
sanctions, and thus, the Court scheduled the October 4, 2024, Order to Show
Cause Re: Failure to Pay Monetary Sanctions; Why Court Should Not Terminate Sanctions,
including striking the Answer; Contempt of Court hearing. (September 20, 2024,
Minute Order) On October 4, 2024, Defendant failed to appear or pay the imposed
sanctions, and thus, the Answer was struck, and Defendant entered default.
(October 4, 2024.)
 
            Plaintiff argues that Jones is distinguishable
because the Court has not ordered a dismissal, which is a terminating sanctions
against plaintiffs. Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has also
failed to follow past Court orders. However, the Court finds that Jones is
controlling. The Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs argument regarding
dismissal. It would be absurd to find that Jones is only applicable to
terminating sanctions directed at plaintiffs and not terminating sanctions directed
at defendants. Additionally, while Defendant has been late in responding to
court-ordered discovery, the Court struck the Answer because Defendant's
Counsel failed to pay the imposed sanctions or appear at the September 20,
2024, hearing not based on Defendant’s discovery abuses. Thus, the Court finds
that the terminating sanctions were imposed for Defendant’s Counsel’s failure
to pay sanctions, which Defendant has shown is beyond the power of the Court
under Jones. (Jones, supra, 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 759.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Set Aside the
Order Striking the Answer and Entering Default.
