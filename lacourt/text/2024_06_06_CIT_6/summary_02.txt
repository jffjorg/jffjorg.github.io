Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Mountain View School District, is overruled. The plaintiff, V.V., alleged childhood sexual abuse and filed a complaint against the defendant. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the retroactive elimination of the claims presentation requirement in AB 218 is unconstitutional. The court found that AB 218 is constitutional and does not violate the Gift Clause. The court also found that the Legislature has the power to revive claims previously barred by the claims presentation requirement. The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 10 calendar days, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within 5 calendar days.
