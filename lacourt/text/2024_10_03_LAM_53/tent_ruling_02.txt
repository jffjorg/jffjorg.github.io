  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s ex parte application for
  appointment of guardian ad litem under pseudonym
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 V.L., a minor, by and through
her guardian ad litem, R.L.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Ex Parte Application for Appointment of Guardian ad Litem Under
Pseudonym
On September 13, 2024, V.L., minor
plaintiff, filed an Application for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem—Civil and
Family Law, requesting an order appointing R.L. as her guardian ad litem in
this action. 
On September 13, 2024, the clerk
issued a “Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing,” stating that the Order for
Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem was rejected because plaintiff V.L. did not
submit a separate ex parte request to use a pseudonym under Code of Civil
Procedure section 372.5.  (Sep. 13, 2024
Notice.) 
V.L. now moves the court for
an order permitting R.L. to apply for appointment as her guardian ad litem with
a pseudonym. 
The court finds that (1) R.L
has an overriding interest in preserving his anonymity to ensure that the
identity of minor plaintiff V.L., who alleges claims of sexual abuse, sexual
assault, and the distribution of child pornography, remains anonymous, which
supports permitting R.L. to appear under a pseudonym; (2) there is a
substantial probability that R.L.’s interest in preserving his and V.L.’s anonymity
will be prejudiced if he is not permitted to appear under a pseudonym; (3) permitting
R.L. to appear under a pseudonym is narrowly tailored to serve his interest in
preserving anonymity without unduly prejudicing the public’s right of access or
the ability of other parties to prosecute, defend, or resolve the action; and
(4) there are no less restrictive means of protecting R.L.’s interest in
preserving his, and V.L.’s, anonymity.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.5, subd. (c); Compl., ¶ 14; Ramey Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5.) 
The court therefore grants plaintiff V.L.’s ex parte application as
follows. 
The court orders that applicant R.L. shall be permitted to apply for
appointment as the guardian ad litem for V.L. in this action under a
pseudonym.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 372.5,
subd. (a) [“The court may appoint a guardian ad litem under a pseudonym
pursuant to the requirements of this section”].) 
The court notes that R.L. has filed, but the court has denied, an
application for the appointment of guardian ad litem.  The court does not appoint R.L. as guardian
ad litem pursuant to this order.  R.L.
must file an amended “Application for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem—Civil
and Family Law” on Judicial Council form CIV-010/FL-935 (and an amended proposed
“Order Appointing Guardian Ad Litem—Civil and Family Law” on Judicial Council
form CIV-011/FL-936), so that the application may be ruled on by the judicial
officer that determines applications for appointment of guardian ad litem.
The court directs the clerk to give notice of this order to plaintiff.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 3, 2024
