And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the minor plaintiff V.L.'s ex parte application to permit her guardian ad litem R.L. to apply for appointment as guardian ad litem under a pseudonym. The court finds that R.L. has an overriding interest in preserving his anonymity to ensure V.L.'s anonymity, given the allegations of sexual abuse, sexual assault, and the distribution of child pornography. The court determines that permitting R.L. to appear under a pseudonym is narrowly tailored to serve his interest in preserving anonymity without unduly prejudicing the public's right of access or the ability of other parties to prosecute, defend, or resolve the action. The court orders that R.L. shall be permitted to apply for appointment as guardian ad litem for V.L. in this action under a pseudonym, subject to certain conditions and requirements.
