Foundation Enterprises, Inc.  24STCV20188

Ex
Parte Application  10/3/24
The
court finds that plaintiff’s ex parte application is not accompanied by a
declaration regarding notice required by California Rules of Court, rules 3.1201
and 3.1204(b). 
The
court therefore denies the ex parte application.
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
