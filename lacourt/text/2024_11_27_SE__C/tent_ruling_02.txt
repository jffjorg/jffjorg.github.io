v. Hyundai Motor America 23NWCV01355
 
This lemon law action
was filed on May 5, 2023. A Notice of Settlement was filed on September 20,
2024. Plaintiffs' move ex parte for an order to enforce settlement, enter
judgment, and issue sanctions. 
 
Plaintiffs' Ex Parte
Application for Order to Enforce Settlement, Enter Judgment, and Issue
Sanctions is DENIED without prejudice. On the Court's own Motion, the
Court specially sets Plaintiff's Motion to Enforce Settlement, Enter Judgment,
and Issue Sanctions to be heard on shortened time on Thursday, December 12,
2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. This Ex Parte Application will be deemed
the Moving Papers. Opposition to be filed and served by no later than December
4, 2024. Reply to be filed and served by no later than December 6, 2024. 
 
The Court notes that the
998 Offer attached as Exhibit 3 to the Declaration of Amy R. Rotman states that
the parties agreed "Plaintiffs will dismiss this entire action with
prejudice." (Rotman Decl., Ex. 3..) Although CCP §998(b)(1) uses the phrase
“enter judgment”, a dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent to a judgment
for purposes of a valid 998 Offer. (On-Line Power, Inc. v. Mazur (2007)
1079, 1085.) As the 998 Offer is a contract, the parties govern the nature of
the “judgment” to be entered. (Chinn v. KMR Property Management (2008)
166 Cal.App.4th 175, 184.) The parties can agree for the entry of judgment in
favor of the plaintiff or for the voluntary dismissal of the action. (Id.;
Goodstein v. Bank of San Pedro(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 899, 905-07.) Based
on the evidence presented to the Court at this time, it appears that the
settlement agreement at issue contemplates voluntary dismissal—not entry of
Judgment. This matter is scheduled for hearing as indicated above. If the
parties are able to informally resolve their dispute without court
intervention, the Moving Party is ORDERED to file a Notice of Withdrawal
of their Motion prior to the December 12, 2024 hearing date.
