And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to enforce settlement, enter judgment, and issue sanctions without prejudice. The court has instead set the motion to be heard on shortened time on December 12, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. The parties are required to file opposition by December 4, 2024, and reply by December 6, 2024. The judge notes that the 998 offer between the parties states that the plaintiffs will dismiss the action with prejudice, which is equivalent to entering judgment. The parties can agree on the nature of the judgment, and based on the evidence presented, it appears that the settlement agreement contemplates voluntary dismissal, not entry of judgment. The court encourages the parties to informally resolve their dispute without court intervention and orders the moving party to file a notice of withdrawal of their motion if they are able to do so.
