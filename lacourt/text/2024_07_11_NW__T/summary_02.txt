And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Matthew Woolverton, who is also a licensed attorney. The Judge finds that the demurrer contains extraneous facts and argument not supported by the complaint, and that it is improper for the defendant to cite facts outside the four corners of the complaint. The court will not set an OSC re sanctions, but warns the defendant to stay within the law when providing pleadings to the court. The demurrer is overruled, and the complaint is found to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 20 days. The court sets a Trial Setting Conference (TSC) on an unspecified date, and will set a trial date approximately 6 months from the date of the TSC. Counsel are required to meet and confer prior to the TSC.
