 Case Number:  24VECV01292    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV01292 Notable Finance v Woolverton
Tentative ruling: Demurrer by defendant Matthew Woolverton.
Matthew Woolverton, the defendant, is also a licensed attorney.  As such, he is presumed to know and understand the law of demurrers.  It is improper to cite facts in his demurrer which are outside the four corners of the complaint unless they are judicially noticeable.  The demurrer is replete with extraneous facts and argument, none of which was judicially noticeable.  This was improper.  The court does not set an OSC re sanctions but reminds Mr. Woolverton, as he is representing himself, to stay within the law when providing pleadings to the court. 
The Demurrer is overruled.  The court finds that the complaint is not uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible, and that it does state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract.  Also, the face of the complaint does not disclose, as a matter of law, that the statute of limitations had expired prior to the filing of the complaint.
Defendant is to answer the complaint within 20 days.
The court sets a Trial Setting Conference (TSC) on _____________, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  The court will set a trial date approximately 6 months from the date of the TSC.  Counsel are to meet and confer prior to the TSC.
