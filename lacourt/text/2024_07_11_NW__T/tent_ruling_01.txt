  Case Number:  23VECV05661    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  T CREDITORS ADJUSTMENT BUREAU  V SCHOFIELD 23VECV05661 [TENTATIVE] ORDER: Defendants  Brian Schofield and Aecon Global Security, Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside Default  Judgment and Clerk’s Entry of Default is GRANTED. The default and default judgment are vacated. The answer filed 5/17/2024 will stand.  The case is set for a Trial Setting  Conference on ___________, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Dept. T. Introduction  Defendants Brian Schofield  (Schofield) and Aecon Global Security, Inc. (Aecon) (collectively Defendants)  moved to set aside the clerk’s entry of default against Schofield on March 18,  2024, the clerk’s entry of default against Aecon on May 15, 2024, and the  default judgment entered against both Defendants on May 24, 2024 in favor of  Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau (Plaintiff),  Discussion Defendants move to set aside  default judgment on the grounds that the judgment is void and invalid on its  face. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 473(d); see also Braugh v. Dow (2023) 93  Cal.App.5th 76 [evidence is not required to determine if a judgment is void, only  that the invalidity of the judgment is apparent on the face of the record];  Berman v. Klassman (1971)17 Cal.App.3d 900 [a motion made under section 473 is  a remedial measure which is liberally construed by the Court].) Plaintiff filed this action on  December 21, 2023. The clerk entered default against Defendants on March 18 and  May 15, 2024. On May 17, 2024, Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint. On  May 21, Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ counsel appeared for a Case Management  Conference. During the CMC, the Court noted that the “[c]ase is at issue”, set  a Trial Setting Conference for November 19, 2024, and ordered the parties to  meet and confer regarding CRC 3.724. (5/21/24 Minute Order.) Defendants contend  that they were unaware of any request for or entry of default against them when  they attended the CMC, and that Plaintiff’s counsel “declined to serve” its  default application package on Defendants. (Motion, 5:11-17; Shaneyfelt Decl.,  para. 7.) Defendants’ counsel declares, and the proof of service on file  confirms, that Defendants were only served with a notice of entry of default  judgment on May 30, 2024, more than a week after the CMC. (Shaneyfelt Decl.,  para. 10.)  Even though plaintiff knew  there was counsel representing the defendants, and that all counsel had appeared  as if the defendants were not in default, no notice was given to counsel for  defendants about the impending request for entry of default judgment. Where a default has been entered  against a party, he or she has no right to appear in court until either the  default is set aside or the default judgment is entered. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa  AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.) However, Plaintiff  did not object to Defendants’ appearance at the CMC, nor did Plaintiff inform  the Court that prior the CMC, Plaintiff received Defendants’ Answer and CMC  Statement. Plaintiff’s failure to object to Defendants’ appearance in court on  May 21, 2024, constitutes a waiver. Based on these facts, together with the  public policy favoring allowing a party to be heard on the merits, the filing  of the answer and appearance at court which shows the defendants' intent to  defend itself on the merits, and the lack of prejudice to plaintiff, the Court  GRANTS Defendants’ motion to set aside entry of default and default judgment  against them.  IT IS SO ORDERED, DEFENDANTS TO GIVE VERBATIM NOTICE.
