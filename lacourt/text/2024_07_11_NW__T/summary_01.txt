And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Brian Schofield and Aecon Global Security, Inc., have moved to set aside the default judgment entered against them. The court has granted this motion, vacating the default and default judgment. The answer filed by the defendants on May 17, 2024, will stand. The case is set for a trial setting conference on an unspecified date in 2025. The defendants claimed that they were unaware of the entry of default and default judgment, and that they did not receive notice of the impending request for default judgment. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to object to the defendants' appearance at the case management conference constituted a waiver, and that the defendants' intent to defend themselves on the merits outweighed any potential prejudice to the plaintiff.
