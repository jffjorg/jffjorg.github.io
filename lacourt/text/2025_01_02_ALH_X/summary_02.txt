And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The amended complaint aims to address issues raised by the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike. The judge notes that the plaintiff has the right to amend the complaint without leave of court up to the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. The amended complaint includes changes such as dropping certain defendants from the negligence cause of action and adding new allegations, including a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The judge finds that the motion is timely and necessary to address deficiencies in the original complaint, and that the amendments will not prejudice the defendants. The judge orders that the amended complaint be filed and served within 10 days, or by January 13, 2025.
