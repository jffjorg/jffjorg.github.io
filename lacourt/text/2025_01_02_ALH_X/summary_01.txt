And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint filed by Plaintiff Pref Pasadena Collection, LLC. The Plaintiff claims that Defendant Pasadena Collection West Property Owner's Association failed to abide by the Declaration of Establishment of Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions (CC&R) for the Pasadena Collection West. The Plaintiff filed the original complaint on August 5, 2022, alleging three causes of action for declaratory relief, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealings. The Plaintiff now seeks to file a first amended complaint adding new causes of action and damages.

The Judge grants the motion, finding that the proposed amendments do not introduce new facts but rather assert new legal theories based on the same operative facts already pleaded. The Judge also finds that the need for additional discovery or a continuance does not constitute prejudice sufficient to deny leave to amend. The Judge sets a Non-Appearance Case Review for January 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. and requires the Plaintiff to file and serve the first amended complaint within 10 days. If the amended complaint is filed with proof of service, Defendant's Motion for Summary Adjudication scheduled for February 25, 2025 will be advanced and vacated.
