  Case Number:  22AHCV00548    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  X PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINTPlaintiff moves for leave to file a
first amended complaint.  This case arises out of Plaintiff Pref
Pasadena Collection, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Pasadena
Collection West Property Owner’s Association (“Defendant”) failed to abide by
the Declaration of Establishment of Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions
(“CC&R”) for the Pasadena Collection West. Plaintiff filed this complaint
on August 5, 2022, alleging three causes of action for (1) declaratory relief,
(2) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealings.Tentative RulingPlaintiff Pref Pasadena Collection, LLC’s Motion for Leave
to File a First Amended Complaint (8393) is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is to file the FAC and serve
Defendant within 10 days.The Court sets a Non-Appearance Case Review for January 28,
2025 at 8:30 a.m.  No appearances are
required at this hearing.  If Plaintiff’s
amended complaint is filed with proof of service, Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Adjudication (1048) scheduled to be heard on 02/25/25 will be advanced and
vacated.Legal Authority and
AnalysisA motion for leave
to amend must comply with the requirements set forth in California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1324.  Dilatory delays and
prejudice to the opposing parties is a valid ground for denial.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists
where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as an increased burden of
discovery.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group,
Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.)Leave to amend is
generally liberally granted.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(a); Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290,
296.)  The court will not generally
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion
for leave, instead deferring such determinations for a demurrer or motion to
strike, unless the proposed amendment fails to state a valid claim as a matter
of law.  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (Marker, U.S.A.) (1989) 213 Cal. App.3d 1045, 1048; California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280–281
disapproved of on other grounds by Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.)The initial “trial”
before a referee is not set to occur until April 2-3, 2025.  (Amended MPA, p. 5.)  Plaintiff filed this motion approximately six
months before April 2, 2025.  Plaintiff proposes
adding fourth and fifth causes of action as well as damages on those claims.  (See Proposed FAC, 9:10-10:8, 10:10-22, 11:3-5.)Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration complies with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.  The
declaration generally explains when the facts were learned and why the request
for leave to amend was not filed earlier, which the Court finds sufficient.  In
its amended motion, Plaintiff asserts that the proposed amendments are based on
facts discovered during Defendant’s responses to written discovery in September
2024.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff
unreasonably delayed in seeking leave to amend, as the facts underlying the new
causes of action were known or should have been known to Plaintiff at the time
of the original complaint, filed in August 2022.  (Opp., p. 4.)The timing of Plaintiff’s
motion does not constitute unreasonable delay.  A court has the discretion to allow the
amendment of any pleading “at any time before or after commencement of trial,
in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.)  California generally has a liberal policy of
allowing amendments to pleadings at any stage of a case. (Douglas v.
Superior Court (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 155, 158.)  When the plaintiff is the moving party,
proximity to the trial date is not a ground for denial absent a showing of
prejudice to defendant.  (See Mesler v
Bragg Mgt. Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 297.)Defendant contends
that granting the motion would result in prejudice by necessitating additional
discovery, delaying the trial, and rendering Defendant’s pending Motion for
Summary Adjudication moot.  Defendant
also argues that the amendment is intended to trigger its insurance coverage,
which has been denied, and is therefore brought for an improper purpose.  The Court finds that Defendant has not
demonstrated sufficient prejudice to warrant denial of the Motion.The proposed
amendments do not introduce new facts but rather assert new legal theories
based on the same operative facts already pleaded.  That is, a fourth cause of action for breach
of CC&Rs and fifth cause of action for negligence.  “(I)t is irrelevant that new legal theories
are introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general
set of facts.”  (Kittredge Sports Co.
v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [internal citations
omitted].)  Further, Defendant retains
the ability to conduct additional discovery in preparation for an adjudication
on the merits.  The need for additional
discovery or a continuance does not, by itself, constitute prejudice sufficient
to deny leave to amend. As to Defendant’s
argument regarding its pending Motion for Summary Adjudication scheduled for
February 25, 2025, the Court notes that the proposed amendments do not affect
Defendant’s ability to pursue dispositive motions.  Even Plaintiff supports Defendant’s desire to
pursue its motion, stating in its reply, “if Defendant requires a reasonable
extension of the deadline to file and serve its Motion for Summary Adjudication
as a result of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, then Plaintiff would so
stipulate upon Defendant’s request.”  (Reply,
p. 5.)  Moreover, the potential impact on
Defendant’s insurance coverage is not a valid basis for denying leave to amend.For the foregoing
reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is to file the FAC
and serve Defendant within 10 days.  The Court sets a Non-Appearance Case Review for January 28,
2025 at 8:30 a.m.  No appearances are
required at this hearing.  If Plaintiff’s
amended complaint is filed with proof of service, Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Adjudication (1048) scheduled to be heard on 02/25/25 will be advanced and
vacated.Moving Party is to give notice.
