And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a habitability matter filed by Pabla “Paulina” Hernandez Trinidad and others against Defendant Maria Leon. The Plaintiffs initially included two minors, but they have since settled their claims, rendering the trial preference granted by the Court on March 26, 2024, moot. The Defendant seeks to vacate the trial preference and set a new trial date, which the Court grants. However, the Court will continue the trial date, to be discussed at the motion hearing. The motion to vacate the trial preference is granted, and counsel are directed to provide notice of the new trial date.
