And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Apple, Inc. The motion argues that plaintiff Diego Mejia Duarte does not have standing because he did not suffer any Labor Code violations. Specifically, Apple argues that the items identified by Duarte as not being included in his regular rate of pay are excludable as a matter of law. Duarte has filed a separate application to continue the instant motion to conduct further discovery on the issue of whether the COVID-19 bonus was non-discretionary and thus needed to be included in his regular rate. Apple opposes the request for a continuance, contending that Duarte delayed the propounding of relevant discovery. The court finds that there are triable issues for the matter of standing and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment. The court also overrules the objections and grants the requests for judicial notice.
