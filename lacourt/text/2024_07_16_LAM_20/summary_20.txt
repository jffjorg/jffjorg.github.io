And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling stating that James River Insurance Company's motion to dismiss Imienfan Odigie's underinsured motorist claim is granted. The claim was filed too long ago, and Odigie has failed to retain counsel or take any action in the discovery or arbitration proceedings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are encouraged to appear remotely through LACourtConnect rather than in person. The court has discretion to dismiss cases due to delay in prosecution under California Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410.
