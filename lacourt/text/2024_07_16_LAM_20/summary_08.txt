And here is the English-text summary:

This is a habitability matter. The Court previously granted a motion to exclude the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert, Shilpa Sayana, M.D., due to unsubstantiated opinions. Plaintiffs Jennifer Roth and Matthew Lifson now seek leave to augment their expert designation to include Dr. Nachman Brautbar. After considering the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court finds that the conditions for granting leave to augment the expert witness list are satisfied. The Court will allow the expert discovery cutoff to relate to the current trial date of September 9, 2024, to minimize prejudice to Defendants. A trial continuance may be discussed if necessary. The Motion is granted.
