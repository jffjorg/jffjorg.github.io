And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the Plaintiff's claims and has made a tentative ruling on the Demurrers filed by the Defendants. The judge has found that the Plaintiff's claims are insufficient to state a cause of action in several instances. The judge has sustained the Demurrers of some of the Defendants, including Dan and Saeed, as to certain causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, accounting, money had and received, negligence, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation. The judge has also sustained the Demurrers of all other Defendants, without leave to amend.

The judge has, however, allowed the Plaintiff's alternative theory of money had and received as an alternative theory upon which the Plaintiff could recover his $13,000 investment. The judge has also allowed the Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim to the extent that the parties' alleged contract is ineffective and the Plaintiff tendered $13,000 to Dan and Saeed, but received nothing in return.

The judge has denied leave to amend the complaint and has instructed the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling.
