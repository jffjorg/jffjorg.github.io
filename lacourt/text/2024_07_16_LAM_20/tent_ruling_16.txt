 This is a habitability matter.  On June 8, 2023, Pabla “Paulina” Hernandez Trinidad, her father Gustavo Hernandez Vallejo, her brothers Jose Antonion Hernandez and Juventino Froylan Hernandez, her daughter Guadalupe Pollido, her daughter Graciela Hernandez, and Graciela’s two children, Aiden Angel Jonathan Areliano Hernandez (age 9) and Malaya Grace Rodriguez (age 3) filed a Complaint against Defendant Maria Leon. Defendant answered on October 3, 2023.    On March 26, 2024, the Court granted a trial preference because two of the Plaintiffs are minors.  The trial date was set for July 24, 2024. Defendant now seeks to vacate the trial preference because the two minors in this matter have settled their claims. Plaintiffs do not oppose vacating the preferential status of the trial date, but argue that the trial date should move forward as there are only three Plaintiffs remaining and Defendant should have been preparing to go to trial despite the settlements.   Because the minors have settled their claims, the Trial Preference is vacated. Defendant seeks for the Court to set a trial setting conference.  The Court will, in the exercise of its discretion, continue the trial date.  The date will be discussed at the Motion hearing. The Motion is granted.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
