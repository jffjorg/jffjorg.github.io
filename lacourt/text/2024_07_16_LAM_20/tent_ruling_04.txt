This is an action in which Plaintiff Babak Zarabian alleges that the Defendants cut him out of a partnership deal relating to the “Zanna” family of corporate entities.  On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Fifth Amended Complaint (“5AC”) for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) accounting, (4) money had and received, (5) negligence, (6) intentional misrepresentation, (7) negligent misrepresentation, (8) unjust enrichment, and (9) promissory estoppel.Defendants (1) Zanna USA, LLC, (2) Zanna USA 5 Holdings, LLC, (3) Zanna USA, Inc., (4) Zanna USA Holdings, LLC, (5) Zanna USA 2SB Holdings, LLC, (6) Zanna USA 3 Holdings, LLC, (7) DKNK Holdings, LLC, (8) Zanna USA 4 Holdings, LLC, (9) SSZS Holdings, LLC, (10) Adelanto Warehousing, LLC, (11) Dan Kohanarieh, (12) Glenn Willwerth, and (13) Saeed Steve Aminpour now each separately demur to the entirety of the 5AC for failure to state sufficient facts.  There are thirteen Demurrers at issue.  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)Breach of ContractThe essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action are: (1) a contract between the parties; (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant's breach; and (4) damages to plaintiff from the breach.  (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co.¿(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)¿  Previously the Court ruled: “While basic facts have been pleaded, the material terms of the contract have not been sufficiently indicated.  What was the ownership stake that Plaintiff was supposedly entitled to or how was it supposed to be calculated?  How did the parties share profits and losses?  What were Defendants’ obligations?  Nothing is clear other than that Plaintiff invested money and got nothing in return.”There is now an allegation of what appears to be a general partnership or joint venture, with a 40/30/30 split in ownership amongst Dan, Saeed, and Babak, respectively; and sharing of control and profits and losses according to ownership, but changing with subsequent capital contributions, with Babak making a $13,000 investment.  On the other hand, to the extent there is no allegation of partnership interest by Glenn or any of the entity Defendants, they cannot be liable for breach of any partnership or joint venture agreement, as they were never partners.  Simply stating these parties entered into a contract is insufficient.  The 5AC and the Opposition do not provide a coherent theory of liability. Thus, the Demurrers of Saeed and Dan are overruled as to the first cause of action.  The Demurrers of all other Defendants are sustained as to the first cause of action.  Given that there have already been six iterations of the complaint, the Court will not allow any further amendment. Breach of Fiduciary Duty“The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach. [Citation.]” (Mosier v. Southern Cal. Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1044.)Defendants argue that a fiduciary relationship has not been alleged.  This lacks merit with respect to Dan and Saeed because “partners or joint venturers have a fiduciary duty to act with the highest good faith towards each other regarding affairs of the partnership or joint venture.”  (Pellegrini v. Weiss (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 515, 524.) On the other hand, a sufficient relationship has not been alleged to demonstrate a fiduciary duty for any of the other Defendants.  Thus, the ruling on the second cause of action is the same as the ruling on the first cause of action.Accounting“An account stated is an agreement, based on prior transactions between the parties, that the items of an account are true and that the balance struck is due and owing. [Citation.] To be an account stated, ‘it must appear that at the time of the statement an indebtedness from one party to the other existed, that a balance was then struck and agreed to be the correct sum owing from the debtor to the creditor, and that the debtor expressly or impliedly promised to pay to the creditor the amount thus determined to be owing.’ [Citation.]”  (Maggio, Inc. v. Neal (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 745, 752.)“The essential elements of an account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due. [Citations.]”  (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.)Here, the derivative accounting claim is sufficient against alleged partners Dan and Saeed.  (See, e.g., Corp. Code § 16405.)  A sufficient relationship has not been pleaded for the other Defendants.  Thus, again, the ruling is the same here as it is for the first cause of action.Money Had & ReceivedThe elements of a cause of action on a common count for money had and received are: “1. That [name of defendant] received money that was intended to be used for the benefit of [name of plaintiff]; [¶] 2. That the money was not used for the benefit of [name of plaintiff]; and [¶] 3. That [name of defendant] has not given the money to [name of plaintiff].” (CACI No. 370, italics added.) “ ‘A cause of action is stated for money had and received if the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum “for money had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.” ’ [¶] This common count is available in a great variety of situations [citations] and ‘lies wherever one person has received money which belongs to another, and which in equity and good conscience should be paid over to the latter.’ ”  (Gutierrez v. Girardi (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 925, 937.)The Court will allow the subject claim as an alternative theory upon which Plaintiff could recover his $13,000 investment form Dan and Saeed, who are alleged not to have provided an ownership interest or other payout to Plaintiff despite his investment. This claim, however, fails against the other Defendants, who are not properly alleged to have any relationship in procuring a partnership interest for Plaintiff.Thus, again, the ruling here is the same as the ruling for the first cause of action.  Negligence Negligence requires duty, breach of duty, proximate causation, and damages.  (N.N.V. v. American Assn. of Blood Banks (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1402.) The negligence claim relates to the allegations that Defendants agreed to manage finances but did an inadequate job by misappropriating funds.  This claim inappropriately recasts Plaintiff’s contract claim as a tort claim and is, therefore, subject to the economic loss rule.  (See, e.g., Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 979, 989-90.)Thus, the Demurrer is sustained as to the negligence claim, without leave to amend.Intentional/Negligent Misrepresentation“The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 638, internal quotation marks omitted.) “[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations] Thus the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.  This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645, internal quotation marks omitted.)  Negligent misrepresentation requires “misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was directed; and resulting damage.”   (Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 154, 175.)A negligent misrepresentation claim should also be pleaded with specificity.  (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 185, fn. 14.) These claims lack specificity because there is no indication as to where or how (telephone, in-person, etc.) the subject representations were made.  Further, the negligent misrepresentation claim relates to a negligent false promise, which is not an actionable form of deceit.  (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 159.)The Demurrer is sustained as to the subject claims, without leave to amend.Unjust Enrichment “Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however, or even a remedy, but rather a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies .... [Citation.] It is synonymous with restitution. [Citation.] (Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347.) Unjust enrichment has also been characterized as describing the result of a failure to make restitution.... (Dunkin, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 198, fn. 15, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44, quoting Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774 (Lauriedale ).)  [¶] There are several potential bases for a cause of action seeking restitution. For example, restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud or is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason. (See generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, §§ 148–150, pp. 218–220; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, §§ 112, 118, pp. 137–138, 142–144.) Alternatively, restitution may be awarded where the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or similar conduct. In such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to seek restitution on a quasi-contract theory (an election referred to at common law as waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit).”  (McBride v. Boughton  (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387–89 (internal quotes omitted).)There may be a basis to allow unjust enrichment to the extent the parties’ alleged contract is ineffective and Plaintiff tendered $13,000 to Dan and Saeed, but received nothing in return.  Thus, the ruling here is again the same as the ruling for the first cause of action.Promissory Estoppel The Demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the promissory estoppel claim because Plaintiff pleads consideration in the form of having tendered $13,000.  Indeed, a promissory estoppel claim is “aimed solely at allowing recovery in equity where a contractual claim fails for lack of consideration . . . .”  (US Ecology, Inc. v. State of California (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 887, 904.)  Summary The Demurrers of Dan and Saeed are sustained as to the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action, but are otherwise overruled.  Leave to amend is denied. The Demurrers of all other Defendants are sustained, without leave to amend.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
