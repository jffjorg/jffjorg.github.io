PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Amalia Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez ask the Court to grant relief from potential waiver of jury trial. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 631 provides in part: 
“(a) The right to a trial by jury as declared by
Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to
the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to
subdivision (f). 
* * *
 “(f) A party waives trial by jury in any of the
following ways: 
* * *
  “(4) By failing
to announce that a jury is required, at the time the cause is first set for
trial, if it is set upon notice or stipulation, or within five days after
notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation. 
“(5) By failing to timely pay the fee described in
subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid
that fee. 
* * *
 “(g) The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,
allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by
jury.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subds. (a), (f)(4) & (5), (g).) 
“
‘The right to a jury trial is a basic and fundamental part of our system of
jurisprudence . . . In case of doubt, therefore, the issue should be resolved
in favor of preserving a litigant’s right to trial by jury.’”  (R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68 (Cal. Practice Guide),
quoting Byram v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 648, 652; see Grafton
Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 958 [“any ambiguity or
doubt concerning the waiver provisions of section 631 must be ‘resolved in
favor of according to a litigant a jury trial’ ”].) 
“While
the matter is discretionary, ‘it is well settled that, in light of the public
policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should
be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious
hardship to the objecting party.’ ” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:317, pp. 2-69 to 2-70, quoting Boal
v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809.)  “Stated differently, ‘The Court abuses its
discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other
party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.’”  (Id. at p. 2-70, quoting Gann v.
William Bros. Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1704.) 
“The
prejudice which must be shown to justify [denial of relief from jury trial
waiver] is prejudice from granting relief from the waiver, as opposed to
prejudice from a jury trial.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:320, p.
2-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Amalia Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez inadvertently waived their right to a jury trial by not
demanding a jury trial in their initial complaint.  On September 14, 2023, Amalia
Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez paid their jury fees and served their Notice of
Posting Jury Fees. 
The
Court finds that granting Amalia Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez relief from waiver
of a jury trial will not prejudice the other parties.  The Court exercises its discretion to grant
the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion of Plaintiffs Amalia Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez for
relief from jury trial waiver. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
