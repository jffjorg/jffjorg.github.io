PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendants
ask the Court to consolidate case number 21STCV09154 and case number 23BBCV01652, titled Paulette Stokes v. Empire
Properties, LLC et al. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
          Denied. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a),
provides: 
“(a) When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: 
“(a) Requirements of motion 
“(1)  A notice
of motion to consolidate must: 
“(A)  List all
named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record; 
“(B)  Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed
in each case sought to be consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion
to consolidate: 
“(A)  Is deemed
a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be
served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the
cases sought to be consolidated; and 
“(C)  Must have
a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases
were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the
first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated case
must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case. (3) Before
consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited case must
be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
Although
the Court has related this case (21STCV09154) with case number 23BBCV00635, the
Court has not related this case to case number 23BBCV01652. Stokes filed a notice
of related case in case number 23BBCV01652 (which the Court did not address because 23BBCV01652 is not the low-numbered case), but no party filed a notice of related
case in this case seeking to relate 21STCV09154 and 23BBCV01652.  
In
addition, Defendants did not file a notice of motion to consolidate in 23BBCV01652. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion to consolidate filed by Defendants Empire Properties,
Radford Residential LLC, and Apartment Management Consultants, LLC. 
          Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
