And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case involves related cases 21STCV09154 and 23BBCV00635. However, the judge has not related case 21STCV09154 to case 23BBCV01652. The defendants, Empire Properties, Radford Residential LLC, and Apartment Management Consultants, LLC, moved to consolidate case 21STCV09154 and case 23BBCV01652. The judge denies the motion because the defendants did not file a notice of motion to consolidate in case 23BBCV01652 and did not relate the two cases. The judge also notes that the cases are not in the same department, which is a requirement for consolidation. The judge orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
