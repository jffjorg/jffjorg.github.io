Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiffs, Amalia Alvarez and Nemecio Alvarez, should be granted relief from the waiver of their right to a jury trial. The plaintiffs accidentally waived their right to a jury trial by not demanding one in their initial complaint. However, the judge finds that granting relief from the waiver will not prejudice the other parties. The judge exercises discretion to grant the motion, citing public policy favoring trial by jury and the importance of preserving a litigant's right to a jury trial.
