is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.

GRANTED.
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiffs Daniel Litman and Paige Lopynski, collectively
known as “BONNIE X CLYDE” (“Plaintiffs”), filed this action against Defendant
Lowly Palace, LLC.
 
The Complaint alleges the following. On September 9, 2022,
Plaintiffs and Defendant entered into a Recording Agreement (hereinafter
“Agreement”) for the production and promotion of music by Plaintiffs. On June 9, 2023, the Agreement was amended (hereinafter
“Amendment”) to increase the Recording Commitment and Marketing Fund for the
Option Period. The
Agreement, as amended, provided for a total Marketing Fund of $440,000,
requiring mutual written approval for all marketing expenditures. Section 5B of
the Agreement stipulates that the Marketing Fund shall be expended within 18
months of the final commercial release, which is now defined as August 2, 2024.
Despite Plaintiffs’ repeated requests for written confirmations of
expenditures, Defendant has explicitly stated their refusal to spend the
marketing funds unless a mutually agreed upon plan, which Defendant has
consistently obstructed, is reached. On
August 12, 2024, Plaintiffs issued a formal Notice of Termination of the
Recording Agreement dated September 9, 2022, as amended on June 9, 2023,
between the Plaintiffs and Defendant. This termination notice was necessitated
by the Defendant’s continued and material breaches of the Agreement.
 
The body of Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges the following causes of action: 
C/A
1:  Anticipatory Breach of Contract 
C/A
2:  Preliminary Injunction 
C/A
3:  Declaratory Judgment
C/A
4: Contract Termination
C/A
5: Revocation of Licenses
 
On September 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike, arguing:
·       Defendant
seeks the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ Complaint in its entirety; that the causes
of action for preliminary injunction (Second Cause of Action), declaratory
judgment (Third Cause of Action) contract termination (Fourth Cause of Action),
revocation of licenses (Fifth Cause of Action) be dismissed without leave to
amend; that Plaintiffs’ request for legal fees and costs be struck; that
Plaintiffs’ transcriptions, summaries and opinions in its exhibits be struck;
and that Exhibit I to the Complaint be struck in its entirety.
·       The Complaint
alleges seven causes of action on the cover page but only five causes of action
in its body. 
·       Plaintiffs Do
Not Allege Facts Sufficient to Constitute their Causes of Action.
·       The fourth
and fifth causes of action for Contract Termination and Revocation of Licenses
are not valid cause of action.
·       Plaintiffs’
Request for Attorneys’ Fees is Improper.
o  
The Agreement and subsequent Amendment attached to Plaintiffs’
Complaint does not provide for attorneys’ fees in the event of a breach.
Further, Plaintiffs have chosen to appear pro se and cannot be awarded
attorneys’ fees.
·       Plaintiffs’
Exhibits Contain Inadmissible Hearsay and Should be Struck.
o  
Plaintiffs submitted typed reproductions of each exhibit attached
to the Complaint. These transcriptions constitute inadmissible hearsay and
should be struck. Cal. Evid. Code § 1200.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Plaintiffs
have adequately pleaded all necessary elements for their causes of action,
including Anticipatory Breach of Contract, Preliminary Injunction, Declaratory
Judgment, and entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees.
·       Plaintiffs
request leave to amend Complaint to address the fourth and fifth causes of
action
o  
Plaintiffs acknowledge that revocation of licenses is a remedy
associated with contract termination. Plaintiffs respectfully request leave to
amend the Complaint to remove this as a separate cause of action and include it
as part of the remedies sought.
·       The motion to
strike should be denied.
 
Defendant filed a reply, arguing:
·       Plaintiffs
blatantly disregard page limits and have improperly filed the equivalent of two
oversized memorandums in support of their Opposition to Defendant’s Demurrer.
The Court should not consider Plaintiffs’ papers. California Rule of Court Rule 3.1113(g) and 3.1300(d).
·       Plaintiffs
quoted nonexistent cases in their opposition.
·       Plaintiffs
have not plausibly refuted any of the manifest deficiencies in their Complaint
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, counsel for Defendant submitted a declaration stating he sent
an email to Plaintiffs identifying the alleged deficiencies in the Complaint
and had a telephonic meet and confer conference with Plaintiffs on September
17, 2024. (Gipson Decl., ¶¶
3-5.) The Court finds the moving party satisfied its meet and confer
obligation. Thus, the Court proceeds on the merits.
 
B.      Procedural
Deficiencies with Plaintiffs’ Opposition
 
As an initial
matter, Defendant asserts that the Court should refuse to consider Plaintiffs’
opposition.
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ opposition referenced
nonexistent cases and was improperly oversized. Memorandums that exceed their respective page limits are
deemed late. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 3.1113(g), 3.1300(d).) Here,
Plaintiffs’ filed a 21-page Opposition and a 24-page Memorandum of Points and
Authorities. Defendant asserts the Opposition and Memorandum combined contained
thirty-seven pages of arguments - which exceeds the permitted fifteen pages.
(Cal. Rule of Court 3.1113(d).) Although Plaintiffs are pro per litigants, in
propria persona parties are treated like any other party and thus must adhere
to the rules of procedure. (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246-47.) 
 
Nevertheless, the Court exercises its
discretion to consider the opposition. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300,
subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th
1197, 1202.)  
 
C.      Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the
court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is
whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)
 
D.     First Cause
of Action: Anticipatory Breach of Contract
 
Defendant
demurs to the first cause of action arguing that Plaintiffs fail to plead the
requisite elements. 
 
The elements
necessary to plead anticipatory breach of contract are: (1) plaintiff's full
performance up to time of repudiation; (2) that he was ready, willing and able
to complete performance, except for the expressed, unretracted and unequivocal
repudiation; and (3) that he suffered damages thereby.  (Daum v.
Superior Court, Sutter County (1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 283,
288-89.)   
 
An
anticipatory breach occurs when one of the parties to a bilateral contract
repudiates the contract expressly or impliedly.  (Mammoth Lakes Land
Acquisition, LLC v. Town of Mammoth Lakes (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 435,
463.)  “When a promisor repudiates a contract, the injured party faces an
election of remedies: he can treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach
and immediately seek damages for breach of contract, thereby terminating the
contractual relation between the parties, or he can treat the repudiation as an
empty threat, wait until the time for performance arrives and exercise his
remedies for actual breach if a breach does in fact occur at such time.” 
(Id.)  An essential element of an anticipatory breach is that
repudiation by the promisor occur before his performance is due.  (Gold
Mining & Water Co. v. Swinerton (1943) 23 Cal.2d 19,
29.)   
 
The Complaint
alleges that Defendant’s statements and actions clearly indicate an intention
not to perform their contractual obligations regarding the expenditure of the
Marketing Fund.
 
In
Plaintiffs’ opposition, they argue they performed their obligations by
delivering musical works to Defendant and submitting a marketing plan. However,
these allegations are not pled in the Complaint. Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to
allege their full performance of the contract and that they were ready, willing
and able to complete performance.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED. 
 
E.      Third Cause
of Action: Declaratory Judgment
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs’ third cause of action fails.
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a party
would have to demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a
proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving
justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”  (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, cleaned up.) 
“[T]here is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are
involved.”  (Osseous Technologies of
America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357,
366, cleaned up.)
 
The Complaint
alleges that a genuine dispute exists between the parties concerning their
respective rights and obligations under the Agreement. The Complaint further
alleges Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendant is obligated to
expend the Marketing Fund within the specified timeframe as stipulated in the
Agreement, and that Defendant’s refusal to do so constitutes an anticipatory
breach.
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity any facts that
underlie the alleged “genuine dispute between the parties”, they simply
conclude that a controversy exists. Moreover, Defendant argues that another
form of adequate relief is available. Defendant contends that under their cause
of action for Declaratory Judgment, Plaintiffs plainly ask the Court to
adjudicate their cause of action for anticipatory breach of contract.
 
The Court
agrees. The Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendant is obligated
to expend the Marketing Fund within the specified timeframe as stipulated in
the Agreement, and that Defendant’s refusal to do so constitutes an
anticipatory breach.” (Complaint, ¶ 32; emphasis added.) Plaintiffs fail to
show how their request for declaratory relief amounts to anything more than a
claim for anticipatory breach.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED. 
 
F.       Second, Fourth
and Fifth Causes of Action: Preliminary Injunction, Contract Termination and
Revocation of Licenses
 
Defendant
demurs to the second, fourth and fifth causes of action arguing that they are
not causes of action, and further no facts are sufficiently alleged to justify
injunctive relief. 
 
The Court
agrees. “Injunctive relief is a remedy, not a cause of action.” (City of S.
Pasadena v. Dep't of Transportation, 29 Cal. App. 4th 1280, 1293 (1994) (“A
permanent injunction is merely a remedy for a proven cause of action. It may
not be issued if the underlying cause of action is not established.”) (citation
omitted); MaJor v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623
(1992) (“A preliminary injunction is an interim remedy designed to maintain the
status quo pending a decision on the merits. It is not, in itself, a cause of
action. Thus, a cause of action must exist before injunctive relief may be
granted.”) (citing Shell Oil Co. v. Richter, 52 Cal. App. 2d 164, 168
(1942)); Allen v. City of Sacramento, 234 Cal. App. 4th 41, 65 (2015)
(affirming that the trial court did not err in sustaining Defendant’s demurrer
to the second cause of action for an injunction.); Dep't of Fair Emp. &
Hous. v. Superior Ct. of Kern Cnty., 54 Cal. App. 5th 356, 384 (2020) (“[A]
preliminary injunction may be sought only when the underlying cause of action
on which the provisional remedy rests is presented for decision through the
pleadings.”). Thus, Plaintiffs’ second cause of action for preliminary
injunction is not a cause of action. In Plaintiffs’ opposition, they concede
that their fourth and fifth causes of action are not causes of action. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the second, fourth and fifth causes of action is SUSTAINED. 
 
G.    
Motion to
Strike 
 
A motion to strike lies only where the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. (Civ. Proc. Code § 436.) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Id. § 437.) 
 
Defendant requested the Court to
strike portions of the Complaint as follows:
1.      Complaint, Paragraph
40 [“Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for legal fees and costs, estimated at
$30,000.”]
2.      Complaint,
page 10, Paragraph E [“Legal fees and costs in the amount of $20,000.”]
3.      Complaint at
Exhibit A, at pp. 19-26 (stamped 08-015) 
4.      Complaint at
Exhibit B, at pp. 31-32 (stamped 020-21) 
5.      Complaint at
Exhibit C, at pp. 34-36 (stamped 023-25) 
6.      Complaint at
Exhibit D, at pp. 38-41 (stamped 027-30) 
7.      Complaint at
Exhibit E, at pp. 43-48 (stamped 032-37) 
8.      Complaint at
Exhibit F, at pp. 50-52 (stamped 039-41), 56-64 (stamped 045-53) 
9.      Complaint at
Exhibit G, at pp. 66-68 (stamped 055-57), 71-76 (stamped 060-65) 
10.  Complaint at
Exhibit H, at pp. 78-79 (stamped 67-68), 82-87 (stamped 071-76) 
11.  Complaint at
Exhibit I, at pp. 89-108 (stamped 078-97) 
12.  Complaint at
Exhibit J, at pp. 110-118 (stamped 099-107) 
13.  Complaint at
Exhibit K, at pp. 120-125 (stamped 109-114), 128-131 (stamped 117-120)
 
a.      
Attorneys’
Fees
 
Defendant moves to strike the request for attorneys’ fees.
Defendants argues these requests are improper because Plaintiffs are
appearing pro se and are not entitled to attorneys’ fees. Further, the
Agreement and subsequent Amendment attached to Plaintiffs’ Complaint do not
provide for attorneys’ fees.
 
Nevertheless, the Court notes that
the Complaint is uncertain as the Complaint contains contradicting allegations.
Plaintiffs allege they are requesting legal fees and costs estimated at $30,000 and then allege they are requesting legal fees and costs in
the amount of $20,000. Plaintiffs also fail to point to a provision of the
contract that provides for legal fees.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion to strike attorneys’ fees is GRANTED. 
 
b.     
Exhibits
 
Defendant moves to strike portions of the Complaint’s
exhibits because they contain inadmissible hearsay. 
 
Plaintiffs submitted typed
reproductions of each exhibit attached to the Complaint. (Complaint, Exhibits
A-K.) The Court agrees that these transcriptions constitute inadmissible
hearsay and should be stricken. (Cal. Evid. Code § 1200.) Further, Plaintiffs
fail to authenticate, Exhibit I, which is purported to be a transcript of a
phone call. 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to
strike the requested portions of the Complaint’s Exhibits is GRANTED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendant’s
motion to strike is GRANTED.
