And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendant, Lowly Palace, LLC, in the case of Daniel Litman and Paige Lopynski v. Lowly Palace, LLC.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, Anticipatory Breach of Contract, with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was sustained because the Complaint failed to allege the full performance of the contract and that the Plaintiffs were ready, willing, and able to complete performance.

The demurrer to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, Preliminary Injunction, Contract Termination, and Revocation of Licenses, was also sustained because these causes of action are not valid.

The motion to strike was granted because the Complaint contains inadmissible hearsay and because the Plaintiffs failed to authenticate one of the exhibits.

The Court has also granted the motion to strike the request for attorneys' fees because the Plaintiffs are appearing pro se and are not entitled to attorneys' fees.

The Defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are GRANTED in part and SUSTAINED in part.
