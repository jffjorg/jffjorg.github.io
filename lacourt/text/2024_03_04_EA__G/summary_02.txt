Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Al Bayaan Islamic Center, Inc. are continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer, as the defendant's counsel only sent an email to the plaintiff's counsel instead of attempting to meet and confer in person or by telephone. The judge orders the defendant's counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel regarding the demurrer and motion to strike and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
