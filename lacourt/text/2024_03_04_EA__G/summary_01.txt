And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on General Motors' motion to tax Meza's memorandum of costs. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court finds that Meza's request for service of process costs and discovery motion costs is unreasonable and unnecessary, and therefore grants General Motors' motion to tax these costs. On the other hand, the court denies General Motors' motion to tax Meza's request for jury fees, notice of change of address costs, and other costs that are properly allowable as costs under California law. The court also notes that Meza's memorandum of costs is unclear and lacks sufficient information to support the claimed costs, and therefore grants General Motors' motion to tax the discovery motion costs.
