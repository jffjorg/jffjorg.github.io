And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge decides on a motion to strike portions of plaintiff Julian Huerta's complaint filed against defendants Brett Lashure and Alexa Lashure. The defendants seek to strike paragraphs 18 of the complaint and paragraph 5 of the prayer for relief, arguing that the complaint fails to plead facts warranting punitive damages. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack factual support. The plaintiff argues that the defendants were aware of the dog's aggressive behavior and failed to adequately control or secure the dog. The court finds the allegations to be conclusory and grants the motion to strike with leave to amend the complaint.
