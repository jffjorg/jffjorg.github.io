And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Walmart, Inc. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Josh Grossguth. The demurrer argues that the complaint is completely devoid of any facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is therefore defective. The Judge agrees with the demurrer and finds that the complaint is ambiguous and unintelligible. The complaint fails to specify which intentional tort the Plaintiff is suing for and lacks factual allegations to support the cause of action. The demurrer is sustained, but the Plaintiff is given leave to amend the complaint. The Plaintiff must file and serve a first amended complaint within 20 days of notice of this order.
