And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has found that Defendant Robert J. Giombetti's Motion to Set Aside Default is warranted. The Court grants the motion and orders that the Answer filed by the Defendant on January 31, 2023, is deemed to be the Defendant's Answer to the Complaint. The trial remains on calendar as currently scheduled.

The Court has found that the Defendant has demonstrated that the default was caused by his counsel's inadvertence and excusable neglect, and that the Defendant has a meritorious defense in this matter. The Court has also found that the advanced declaration of the Defendant's counsel of record attests to the counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect that led to default being entered against the Defendant.

Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion and sets aside the default. The Defendant is allowed to defend the action by accepting the Answer filed on January 31, 2023.
