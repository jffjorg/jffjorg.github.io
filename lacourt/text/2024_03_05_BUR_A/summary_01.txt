Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions to quash service of ORAP and subpoena duces tecum filed by Floyd Mayweather, Jr. against KH Capital, LLC. The judge finds that Mayweather is a proper subject of the subpoena duces tecum and ORAP, and that he meets the residency requirement of CCP § 1989. The judge denies the motions to quash, finding that Mayweather's motions were not brought in bad faith or without substantial justification. The judge also denies each party's request for attorney fees and costs.
