The Judge's tentative ruling denies Maneesh Bansal's motion to disqualify Forward Counsel LLP from representing defendants Arunpal Sehgal and Paramjot Mann. The Judge finds that Forward Counsel LLP does not represent plaintiff's individual interests, despite plaintiff's extensive communication with the firm. The Judge also denies defendants' motion to compel arbitration, finding that they waived their right to arbitrate by substantially invoking the litigation machinery and failing to seek arbitration earlier in the proceedings.
