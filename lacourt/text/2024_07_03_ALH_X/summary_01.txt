And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Joel L. Lofton, issued a tentative ruling on July 3, 2024, regarding a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and a request for production of documents in the case Soto, et al. v. FCA US LLC, et al. (Case No. 23AHCV02082).

The Plaintiffs, Ramon Soto and Michelle Soto, filed a lemon law claim against the Defendant, FCA US LLC, in September 2023. The Plaintiffs sought to compel further responses to special interrogatories and a request for production of documents, and also requested sanctions in connection with their motions.

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories numbers 45-48, finding that the interrogatories were overly broad in scope. The Judge granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents as to number 45, but denied it as to number 46, finding that the request for production was relevant but not limited to a specific claim of defect, repair, or component.

The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions, finding that the dispute regarding the discovery was in good faith and that the motions were denied and granted in part. The Judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the tentative ruling.
