BACKGROUND 
 
This case
arises out of Plaintiffs Ramon Soto and Michelle Soto’s (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) lemon law claim for a 2022 Jeep Compass (the “Subject Vehicle”).
Plaintiffs filed their complaint against Defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”) on September
11, 2023. Now, Plaintiffs seek to compel further responses to special interrogatories and request
for production of documents from Defendant. Plaintiffs request sanctions in
connection with their motions. Defendant filed an opposition brief, and
Plaintiffs filed a reply brief. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
             
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatory numbers 45–48 is
DENIED. 
 
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for
Production is GRANTED as to number 45 and DENIED as to number 46. 
 
Plaintiffs’
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
  
   
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives
unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories,
demands to produce, or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) 
 
To request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause
for the production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)). 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
A motion to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
The court finds
that the meet and confer requirement has been met. (Powell Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
SPECIAL INTERRGATORIES
 
SROG No. 45: At the time of release for the 2022 Jeep
Compass vehicles, state your anticipated range for repairs per thousand
vehicles sold (R/1000).
 
SROG No. 46: State the repairs per thousand vehicles
sold (R/1000) for 2022 Jeep Compass vehicles.
 
SROG No. 47: Identify in order the five symptoms with
the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Jeep Compass vehicles, and
the corresponding repairs per thousand.
 
SROG No. 48: Identify in order the five components
with the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Jeep Compass vehicles,
and the corresponding repairs per thousand.
 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
 
RFP No. 45: All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by
owners of the 2022 Jeep Compass vehicle regarding any of the complaints that
the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities
for repair during the warranty period.
 
RFP No. 46: All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs
to 2022 Jeep Compass vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR
authorized repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty.
 
Here, the Court finds that the subject interrogatories, as
written are overly broad in scope, as they are not limited to any relevant time
frame or any specific claim, repair, or component of similar vehicles.
Accordingly, the Court sustains Defendant’s objections thereto and denies
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’
Special Interrogatory numbers 45–48.
 
As to the subject request for production, the Court finds
that request number 45 is relevant and properly limited to vehicles of the same
make and model as Plaintiffs’ and to complaints that the Subject Vehicle was
presented for; however, request number 46 is not limited to any specific claim
of defect, repair or component. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for
Production as to number 45 and denies the motion as to number 46. 
 
Plaintiffs request sanctions in the total amount of $5,220
($2,610 x 2 motions) to be imposed on Defendant and its attorney. The request for
sanctions is denied as the motions are denied and granted in part, and because
the court finds that the parties’ dispute regarding the subject discovery was
in good faith. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatory numbers 45–48 is
DENIED. 
 
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for
Production is GRANTED as to number 45 and DENIED as to number 46. 
 
Plaintiffs’
request for sanctions is DENIED.
