BACKGROUND
 
This is an action for personal injuries
and damages arising from an automobile accident on January 7, 2022. Plaintiffs
Jenny Nguyen (“Nguyen”) and Tron Thi Ha (“Ha”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed
their Complaint against Defendants Mario Alberto Villa (“Villa”) and Sarkis
Batanian (“Batanian”) (collectively “Defendants”) on September 19, 2023. Defendants
filed their Answer on December 22, 2023. 
 
Plaintiffs filed a combined five motions
to compel discovery which are before this court now. Out of the five motions,
Plaintiff Nguyen filed three and Plaintiff Ha filed two. No opposition has been
filed to any of the motions as of June 28, 2024.   
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The court grants the motions to
compel discovery. Defendants are ordered to serve complete, verified responses,
without objection, within 20 days of this order.  
The court grants Plaintiff
Nguyen’s request for monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,110 (3.5
hours x $300, plus $60) and Plaintiff Ha’s request for monetary sanctions in
the total amount of $810 (2.5 hours x $300, plus $60). Defendants and their
attorney of record Homan, Stone & Rossi by Ted L. Travis are ordered to pay
Plaintiffs within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Moving Party
to give notice.  
LEGAL STANDARD
If a party to whom
interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses
without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (b), 2031.300(b).) Moreover,
failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).)
Failure to verify a
response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
If the court finds that a
party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion, the court “shall impose
a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2031.300(c).) Sanctions may be awarded even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (CRC Rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
DISCUSSION
Here, the court
finds that Defendants failed to serve responses to the discovery requests after
several extensions to do so. (See generally the respective declarations of
Donald T. Dunham.) Therefore, all objections to the requests are waived.
Furthermore, monetary sanctions are warranted. Plaintiffs’ counsel requests
$1,560 for each motion, representing three hours incurred (one hour to draft,
one hour to review any opposition and draft a reply, and one hour to attend
hearing) at counsel’s hourly rate of $300, plus the $60 filing fee. The request
for monetary sanctions is granted in a reduced amount because the motions are
unopposed and because this is a straightforward matter involving a single
hearing. Therefore, the court grants Plaintiff Nguyen’s request in the total amount
of $1,110 (3.5 hours x $300, plus $60) and Plaintiff Ha’s request in the total amount
of $810 (2.5 hours x $300, plus $60). 
CONCLUSION
 
The court grants the motions to
compel discovery. Defendants are ordered to serve complete, verified responses,
without objection, within 20 days of this order.  
The court grants Plaintiff
Nguyen’s request for monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,110 (3.5
hours x $300, plus $60) and Plaintiff Ha’s request for monetary sanctions in
the total amount of $810 (2.5 hours x $300, plus $60). Defendants and their
attorney of record Homan, Stone & Rossi by Ted L. Travis are ordered to pay
Plaintiffs within 30 days of this order.
