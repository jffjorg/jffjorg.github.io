  Case Number:  24PSCV01460    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Trebar Financial Services, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Trebar Financial Services, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from an equipment financing agreement.
In May 2019, Plaintiff Trebar Financial Services, Inc. (Trebar) entered into a
written equipment financing agreement with Defendant Diwan Transport, Inc.
(Diwan Transport) in which Trebar agreed to provide $123,569.00 in financing
for a 2020 Freightliner. In support of the agreement, Defendants Baljit Singh
Khinda, Narinder Singh, Tajinder P. Kaur, and Sukhraj Singh (collectively, the
Singhs) executed personal guaranties. In August 2023, Diwan Transport allegedly
breached the agreement by failing to make payments due.
On
May 7, 2024, Trebar filed a complaint against Diwan Transport, the Singhs, and
Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of promissory
note, (2) breach of guaranty, and (3) account stated. On June 29, 2024,
Trebar’s process server served Narinder Singh and Kaur with substitute service
in Upland. On July 1, 2024, Trebar’s process server served Diwan Transport and Singh
Khinda with substitute service and Sukhraj Singh with personal service in San
Bernardino.
On August
19, 2024, the court entered default against Diwan Transport and the Singhs
after they failed to file a timely answer. On the same day, the court granted
Trebar’s applications for writs of attachment against Diwan Transport and the
Singhs.
On August
22, 2024, Trebar submitted the present application for default judgment. A case
management conference/OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for October 9,
2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Trebar
seeks default judgment against Diwan Transport and the Singhs in the total amount
of $99,563.01, including $92,897.71 in damages, $2,604.75 in interest, $2,747.95
in attorney fees, and $1,312.60 in costs. Because the court finds Trebar has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Trebar’s application for
default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Trebar’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
