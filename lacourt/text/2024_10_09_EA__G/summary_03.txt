And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on Faviola Ponce's demurrer to a date to be determined. The demurrer is based on the entire complaint, and Faviola Ponce's counsel has not provided any declaration describing whether meet and confer efforts were made with Marco Ponce's counsel. The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, and therefore, a continuance of the hearing is appropriate. Faviola Ponce's counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Marco Ponce's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least 9 court days before the next scheduled hearing.
