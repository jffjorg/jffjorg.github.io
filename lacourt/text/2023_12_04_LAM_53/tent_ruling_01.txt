[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant John Stich (“Defendant”) to serve responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, numbers 1-53, and
(2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $1,260.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with the Requests for Production of Documents by mail and
email on November 4, 2022.  (Rodriguez
Decl., Exs. 1-2.)  Defendant did not
serve timely responses and had not served responses as of the date that
Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶¶ 10, 12.)  Defendant has not
filed opposition papers or other evidence with the court establishing that
responses have been served.
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $660 ((1.5
hours x $400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions
to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 14.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez’s motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents.

Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, the court orders defendant John
Stich (1) to serve on plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez full and complete verified
responses, without objections, to plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, numbers 1-53, that comply with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2031.210 through 2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff
Juan Cruz Rodriguez all documents and things in defendant John Stich’s
possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those requests, within
20 days of the date of service of this order.¿ 
The court orders defendant John Stich to
pay sanctions to plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez in the amount of $660 within 30
days of the date of service of this order. 
The
court orders plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  December 4, 2023
