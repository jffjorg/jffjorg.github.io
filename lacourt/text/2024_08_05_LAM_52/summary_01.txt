And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by plaintiff Peter Alexan Enterprises Inc. dba RA Consulting. The plaintiff is seeking to limit discovery in the case, but the court finds that the motion does not clearly explain what order the plaintiff is seeking. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for the protective order and that the discovery sought by the defendant is necessary to investigate her PAGA claims.

The court denies the plaintiff's motion for a protective order and orders the plaintiff and its counsel to pay the defendant $2,925 in sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff and its counsel did not act with substantial justification in moving for the protective order and that the motion failed to identify what protective order the plaintiff sought. The court also finds that the plaintiff's objections to discovery are meritless and that the defendant has proposed reasonable ways to mitigate the invasion of privacy.
