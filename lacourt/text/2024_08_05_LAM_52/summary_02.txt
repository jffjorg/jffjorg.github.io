And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is vacating the default of defendant Avedis Avedissian due to insufficient proof of service. The plaintiff, Key Star Capital Fund III, L.P., requested entry of default of defendants Light Days Hospice, Inc. and Avedis Avedissian, but the clerk entered the defaults without the plaintiff requesting entry of default judgment. The proof of service attests to substituted service on Avedissian at a commercial mail receiving agency, but the plaintiff did not demonstrate that this was the only address reasonably known for Avedissian. Additionally, the plaintiff did not submit a declaration of diligence attesting to attempts to personally serve Avedissian. As a result, the judge is continuing the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to October 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
