  Case Number:  20VECV00029    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  T 20VECV00029
Consolidated with 20VECV00049 Adler v. Van Rijs
 
Motion for
reconsideration is granted.  After
reconsideration, the order of 9/16/2024 dismissing the consolidated action is
vacated.
 
The court
issued a Final Statement of Decision on 4/4/2024 on the claims of Plaintiffs
against defendant Financial Bonanza, LLC. 
Given that no action is being taken by plaintiffs to substitute in a
representative for Adrian Van Rijs (deceased) and there is no estimate whether
that action will ever be undertaken, the court finds that it is proper to issue
a separate judgment in this case on the defaulted defendant, and therefore, the
court will issue Judgment against defendant Financial Bonanza, LLC according to
the Final Statement of Decision.
 
Proposed
Judgment
 
Judgment is
in favor of plaintiffs LeRoy Albert Lewis, Trustee, Marsha Stern Nevada
Irrevocable Spendthrift Trust and against Financial Bonanza, LLC in the amount
of $2,079,865.68 plus attorney fees per noticed motion and costs per Memorandum
of Costs.
 
Judgment will
be in favor of defendant Financial Bonanza, LLC and against plaintiff Kenneth
Adler.  Plaintiff Kenneth Adler will receive
nothing on his complaint against defendant Financial Bonanza, LLC.
 
The court will hold Proposed Judgment for 10 days (plus 5 days for
mailing) for any objections.
