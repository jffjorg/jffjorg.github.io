And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for reconsideration and vacates the order dismissing the consolidated action. The court finds that it is proper to issue a separate judgment against Financial Bonanza, LLC, as no action has been taken to substitute a representative for Adrian Van Rijs (deceased) and there is no estimate of when this might happen. The proposed judgment is in favor of the plaintiffs, LeRoy Albert Lewis, Trustee, and Marsha Stern Nevada Irrevocable Spendthrift Trust, against Financial Bonanza, LLC, in the amount of $2,079,865.68 plus attorney fees and costs. The judgment is also in favor of Financial Bonanza, LLC against plaintiff Kenneth Adler, with Kenneth Adler receiving nothing on his complaint against Financial Bonanza, LLC. The proposed judgment will be held for 10 days, plus 5 days for mailing, for any objections.
