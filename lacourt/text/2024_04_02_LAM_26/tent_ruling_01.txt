Prevent Retaliation in violation of FEHA, (9) Failure to Accommodate in
violation of FEHA, (10) Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in
violation of FEHA, and (11) Wrongful Termination in violation of Public Policy.
On September 26,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions
against Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC (“Surgery Center”).  On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
amended motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against Defendant Surgery
Center.  On December 19, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a second amended motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against Defendant
Surgery Center.  On January 11, 2024,
Defendant Surgery Center filed an opposition. 
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  
On January 30,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion in part and denied in part.  
On March 8, 2024, Defendant
Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center filed a statement regarding its compliance with the
January 30, 2024 Order and attached its further responses. 
On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition to Defendant’s March 8, 2024 statement of compliance.  
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to
any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .
.”  Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery . . . .”
“Nevertheless, absent unusual
circumstances, such as repeated and egregious discovery abuses, two facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful.”  (Lee v. Lee (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.)  “Even where
nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘ “...’should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citations.] ‘ “...
[¶] The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary
to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he
seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to
accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.’ ” ’
[Citations.]”  (Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
“A trial court has broad
discretion when imposing a discovery sanction.” 
(Lee, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p.1559.)  “In exercising this discretion [for
nonmonetary sanctions], a variety of factors may be relevant, including, 1) the
time which has elapsed since [the discovery requests] were served, 2)
whether the party served was previously given a voluntary extension of time, 3)
the number of [the discovery requests] propounded, 4) whether the unanswered
questions sought information which was difficult to obtain, 5) whether the
answers supplied were evasive and incomplete, 6) the number of questions which
remained unanswered, 7) whether the questions which remain unanswered are
material to a particular claim or defense, 8) whether the answering party has
acted in good faith, and with reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior
orders compelling discovery and the answering party's response thereto, 10)
whether the party was unable to comply with the previous order of the court,
11) whether an order allowing more time to answer would enable the answering
party to supply the necessary information, and, 12) whether a sanction short of
dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction.”  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 796–797.)
 
Discussion
            Defendant’s
statement regarding its compliance with the January 30, 2024 Order filed
on March 8, 2024 shows that it served on Plaintiff its code-compliant responses
without objections to Requests for Production, Set One, Nos. 61, 63, 65-72,
74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106, 1071, 108, 115, 116, 118, and 119 with the temporal
limitation of January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2021, along with responsive
documents.  (3/8/24 KJSC Statement.)  Defendant attached as Exhibit A copies of its
responses at issue.  (Id.)  As to requests Nos. 1, and 3-6, the Court
ordered Defendant to provide a privilege log identifying any documents withheld
or redactions made.  On February 29,
2024, Defendant also served on Plaintiff a privilege log identifying redactions
made to the responsive documents produced, including the patient records
responsive to Nos. 1, and 3-6, which Defendant attached as Exhibit B as a true
and correct copy of its privilege log. 
(3/8/24 KJSC Statement.)  Defendant states that it provided unique identifiers to the patient
records with bates numbers KJSC 000443-000726 so that Plaintiff may identify
which documents correspond to a specific patient.  (Id.) 
Defendant also explains that the parties did not file a joint statement
due to Plaintiff’s counsel’s unavailability at the time of filing.  
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to meet the February 29,
2024, deadline to avoid issue sanctions. 

 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to comply
with the January 30, 2024 Order to provide further responses to RPD Nos. 1, 3-6,
61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106, 107, 108, 115, 116, 118, and 119.  Plaintiff states there were no written
responses to RPD Nos. 1, 3-6, and all written responses relating to remaining
RPDs were not code compliant as Defendant stated that discovery was ongoing and
reserved the right to change its answers rather than producing all documents.  In some instances, Defendant agreed to produce
all documents only “if they exist” making it unclear if and when any documents
would ever be produced.  Also, where
Defendant stated it will produce all documents, Plaintiff states that either
zero documents were produced or Defendant produced a portion of documents in a
disorganized production with pages missing without specifying which bates
labeled documents respond to which request. 
Finally, Plaintiff states that Defendant’s motion for protective order
(“MPO”) seeking relief from responding to RPD One on grounds of patient and
business privacy and relevance was denied in June 2023, and August 1, 2023, and
the Court ordered complete responses without objections.  However, Plaintiff points out that Defendant
produced a privilege log stating that it is still withholding documents —
despite agreeing to produce all documents — based on privacy and lack of
relevance and other waived and overruled objections rather than on attorney
work product.  Thus, Plaintiff argues
that issue sanction no. 1-23 is warranted. 
 
Failure to Comply with the January 30, 2024 Order
On January 30,
2024, the Court ordered Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC to provide a
code-complaint response including a privilege log identifying any documents
withheld or redactions made as to Request for Production, Set One No. 1, and
3-6 and further provide responsive documents with only redactions that have
been stipulated or identified and supported with a privilege log within twenty
(20) days of notice of that order, where Defendant’s failure to do so would
result in issue sanction 1 being granted. 
The Court also ordered Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC to
provide a code-complaint response to Request for Production, Set One Nos. 61,
63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106 107, 108, 115, 116, 118, and 119 with the
temporal limitation of January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2021 without
objection and provide responsive documents within twenty (20) days of notice of
this order, where Defendant’s failure to do so would result in issue sanctions
2-23 being granted.  The Court denied
Plaintiff’s request for issue sanctions 24-29. 
Finally, the Court ordered the parties to file a joint statement no
later than March 8, 2024, identifying whether Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery
Center complied with the order and attaching Defendant’s further
responses.  
Plaintiff shows that issue
sanction 1 to RPD no. 1, 3-6 is warranted because Defendant failed to comply
with the Court order by (1) failing to provide any written responses to RPD
nos. 1, 3-6; (2) failing to include the last 4 digits of the actual patient ID
number, making it unclear whether the records produced are actual patient
records or whether Defendant accurately matched the surgery record with the
anesthesia record to the same patient when renumbering, redacting all remaining
non-personally identifying information (Gevorkian Decl., Exhib. 9); (3) failing
to produce records for the years 2018, 2020, 2021 despite evidence that
confirming surgeries were continued (id. ¶ 9); and (4) failing to
produce records identified in RPD nos. 1, 3-5, such as Time-Out checklists,
nurse logs, and other documents.  (Opp.
pp. 7-10.)  
Plaintiff also sufficiently
explains that issue sanctions nos. 2-23 are warranted because Defendant failed
to provide complete code compliant responses by February 29, 2024.  Specifically, Plaintiff shows that (1) written
response to RPD Nos. 61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100-101, 103, 106-108, 115-116, 118-119
were not code compliant as Defendant stated that it would produce all documents
only “if they exist,” without indicating whether the documents would be
produced and/or what documents it was withholding; (2) Defendant did not
produce any documents as to RPDs nos. 66-69, 74, 75-76, 100, 106 and 118; (3) Defendant
failed to provide certain documents that it indicated it would provide in
response to RPD no. 101 and 108 and also improperly withheld information on
grounds of privacy and relevance; and (4) failed to produce any documents as to
RPD nos. 107, 115, and 119 despite the Court’s finding that the response
stating “no documents exist” was not credible.  Plaintiff concludes that all issue sanctions
are warranted because Defendant’s disorganized document production contains
missing pages and fails to comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280(a), which
requires the responding party to specify which bates labeled documents in its
production respond to which request.  The
Court agrees that Defendant’s responses are deficient and fail to comply with
the directives in the January 30, 2024 order.
Thus, issue
sanctions 1-23 are warranted.
            Issue Sanction: One
            RPDs
1, and 3-6 requested various information regarding surgery patients of Dr.
ElAttrache from January 1, 2018 to the date of production.  In response to each of these requests, Defendant
Surgery Center responded stating that “Defendant will comply with this request
and produce all non-privileged documents in its possession, custody, or
control. See KJSC 000443-726.” 
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 7; Nesbit Decl. ¶ 17, Exh. I.)  Plaintiff contends that the response is
non-compliant as it is raising privilege and may be withholding documents based
on privilege, some redactions of documents were overbroad, and that there are
gaps in the documents produced and more documents should have been produced.  Plaintiff therefore seeks an issue and
evidentiary sanction finding that “[i]t be established that during Plaintiff’s
tenure, Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache regularly and needlessly induced his patients
under total general anesthesia an hour or more before their surgery actually
began and that Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC is precluded from
introducing evidence to the contrary at trial.” 
            “[T]wo facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be
willful.”  (Lee v. Lee (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.)  Moreover,
“[e]ven where nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘ “...’should be
appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’
[Citations.] ‘ “... [¶] The sanctions the court may impose are such as are
suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the
objects of the discovery he seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which
are designed not to accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose
punishment.’ ” ’ [Citations.]”  (Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
            Here, the August
1, 2023 Order is silent as to whether any privilege was waived.  As set forth in the August 1, 2023 Order
Defendant Surgery Center did respond to some of the 205 propounded RPDs on July
10, 2023 after the protective order had been denied.  (Gevorkian 7/24/23 Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2.)  This July 10, 2023 response to some of the
RPDs on July 10, 2023 included general objections based on privilege.  
            Waivers of
privilege are generally prescribed by statute. 
For example, as
explained in Korea Data Systems Co. v.
Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513 and People ex rel.
Lockyer v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th, 1060 a
preliminary objection in response to an entire discovery request was sufficient
to prevent a waiver of attorney client privilege.  In Korea Data Systems Co., the Court
of Appeal addressed whether a failure to comply with the specificity
requirements of making a claim of privilege – i.e., concurrently
producing a privilege log – could result in the waiver of attorney client
privilege.  The Court of Appeal concluded
that the trial “court erred in finding the attorney-client privilege waived by
the untimely filing of a privilege log.” 
(Korea Data Systems Co., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p.1516.)  The Court of Appeal further noted that
“[w]hile the code calls for more specific responses than were originally
provided, and while we recognize the use of ‘boiler plate’ objections as were
provided in this case may be sanctionable, the appropriate sanction is not a
judicially imposed waiver of the attorney-client privilege.”  (Ibid.)  
            In People ex rel. Lockyer,
the Court similarly concluded that “[b]ecause the [opposing party] timely
objected on the grounds of privilege, they preserved these objections, regardless
of whether the objections were sufficiently detailed in their response or
privilege log and the court, as a matter of law, could not find that they
had waived these privileges.”  (People
ex rel. Lockyer v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1060,
1074–1075, [italics added].)  
            In sum, Korea Data Systems Co. and
People ex rel. Lockyer stand for the proposition that boiler-plate
objections – objections merely stating attorney client privilege – and a
failure to concurrently produce a privilege log do not result in waiver of the
attorney client privilege. 
            Thus, the general objections based
on privilege in the July 10, 2023 response was sufficient to preserve applicable
and stated privileges to the remaining RPDs that the Court Ordered responses to
in the August 1, 2023 Order.  However,
the responses to RPDs No. 1, 3-6 are not code compliant as no privilege log was
provided.  
            To provide a code-compliant response
as ordered, Defendant Surgery Center
was required to provide a privilege log and identify the specific privilege
available.  (See CCP §
2031.240(b)(1-2), [“b) If the responding party objects to the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the
response shall do both of the following: (1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made. (2) Set forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for,
the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular
privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the
information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with
Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.”] [Italics added.].)  Similarly, any over redaction must be
supported by a privilege log for each redaction to the extent it goes beyond
the redaction of personal identifying information except for the last four
digits of patient records/patient identification numbers.
            To the extent, that the records are
incomplete, it is unclear whether the documents do not exist, or if documents
have been withheld based on privilege but not yet identified in a privilege
log.  Regardless, Plaintiff fails to show
that the document production is incomplete. 
(See e.g., Nesbit Decl. ¶ 19, as Exhibit J [Bowdry Depo. at
pp.53:24-54:7].)  
            As the responses are not code
compliant as no privilege log was produced to support any unspecified claim of
privilege, Defendant Surgery Center did not comply with the Court’s August 1,
2023 as to RPDs 1, and 3-6.  However, at this
instance, the failure to provide a code complaint response does not appear
willful as required for non-monetary sanctions. (Lee, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p.1559.)  Accordingly, the instant motion is continued
as to Issue and Evidentiary Sanction 1 and Defendant Surgery Center must
provide a code-complaint response including a privilege log identifying any documents
withheld or redactions made as to RPDs No. 1, and 3-6.  Failure to do so will result in the Court
determining that the failure to comply is willful and issue and evidentiary
sanctions are warranted.
 
            Issue Sanctions 2-24
            Plaintiff seeks
issue and evidentiary sanctions 2-24 on the basis that Defendant Surgery Center
did not comply with the August 1, 2023 Order as to the responses to RPDs Nos.
61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106 107, 108, 115, 116, 118, 119 and 152.  However, as the Court’s August 1, 2023 Order
did not order a response to RPD No. 152, Defendant Surgery could not fail to
comply with the August 1, 2023 Order with any response to that request.  (Order
8/1/23 at pp.4:11-17, 14:9-11.)  Accordingly,
the corresponding issue and evidentiary sanction no. 24 is plainly not
warranted.  
            As
to the remaining RPDs and the request for issue and evidentiary
sanctions, Plaintiff contends that Defendant Surgery Center’s responses are
improperly including objections.  Each
response to RPDs Nos. 61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106 107, 108, 115,
116, 118, and 119 provide that:
After
a reasonable and diligent inquiry, Defendant is unable to comply with this
request because Plaintiff has refused to clarify and/or narrow the time and
scope of this request o as so phrased, Defendant is unable to locate or
identify documents responsive to this request without having to expend
substantial time and resources to do so. Defendant is willing to
further meet and confer with Plaintiff to understand and narrow the time and
scope of this request to determine if there are documents that are reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence related to the
allegations in Plaintiff’s lawsuit.
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 7; Nesbit Decl. ¶ 17, Exh.
I, [Bold and Italics Added].)          
            Defendant Surgery
Center’s responses are improper as it is objecting based on the burden it would
take to respond and Defendant Surgery Center was ordered to provide a response
without objection.  (Order 8/1/23.)  The Court agrees that the requests are
overbroad as no time frame is specified as to any of these
RPDs and thus seeking all documents from the Surgery Center’s conception from
at least before 1997 to today.  Even
Plaintiff’s evidentiary sanctions are limited to the relevant time period.  However, to the extent that it was not
reasonably possible to respond to any ordered RPD, it was incumbent on
Defendant Surgery Center to request a limitation from the Court at the hearing
or through a reconsideration motion. 
Further, Defendant Surgery Center could have requested relief through a
writ.  It was not proper for Defendant
Surgery Center to merely assert objections in violation of the August 1, 2023
Order.  
            Thus, given that
Defendant Surgery Center appears to have willfully violated the August 1, 2023
Order by asserting objections to RPDs Nos. 61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103,
106 107, 108, 115, 116, 118, and 119, non-monetary sanctions would be
warranted.  However, given that the
requests had no temporal limitation making them unreasonable to respond to, the
Court will continue this motion as to issue and evidentiary sanctions 2-23 for
Defendant to properly respond and provide responsive documents without
objection to RPDs Nos. 61, 63, 65-72, 74-76, 100, 101, 103, 106 107, 108, 115,
116, 118, and 119 with the temporal limitation of January 1, 2014 through
December 31, 2021.
 
Conclusion and ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for issue sanctions 1-23 is GRANTED, in part.  This Motion is continued to April 30, 2024, a
8:30 a.m. as discussed herein.           
Moving Parties are to give notice and
file proof of service of such.

plaintiff’s motion for issue Sanctions against Defendant CEDARS-SINAI
  MEDICAL CENTER


 Procedural
BackgroundOn March 23,
2022, Plaintiff Kristina Holman (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant wrongful
termination action against Defendants Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC,
Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation, and Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic
Clinic.  On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants
Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC, Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe
Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Cedar Sinai Medical Care Foundation, and
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic, a Medical Group Inc.  The SAC asserts eleven causes of action for
(1) Retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 1102.5, (2) Retaliation in
violation of Labor Code § 232.5, (3) Retaliation in violation of California
Business and Professions Code § 510, (4) Discrimination on the Basis of Age in
violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”), (5) Discrimination
on the Basis of Disability in violation of FEHA, (6) Failure to Prevent Discrimination
in violation of FEHA, (7) Retaliation in violation of FEHA, (8) Failure to
Prevent Retaliation in violation of FEHA, (9) Failure to Accommodate in
violation of FEHA, (10) Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in
violation of FEHA, and (11) Wrongful Termination in violation of Public Policy.On December 8,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amended motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions
against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”) for failure to obey
court order re Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two.  On January 17, 2024, Defendant CSMC filed an
opposition.  On January 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.On January 30,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion in part and continued the hearing to
April 2, 2024. On November 13,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amended motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions
against Defendant CSMC for failure to obey court order re Plaintiff’s Request
for Production of Documents, Set One.  On
January 25, 2024, Defendant CSMC filed an opposition.  On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.On February 4,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion in part, denied in part, and
continued the hearing to April 2, 2024. To date, no
joint status report was filed as directed in the January 30, 2024 and February
4, 2024 orders. Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to
any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .
.”  Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery . . . .”“Nevertheless, absent unusual
circumstances, such as repeated and egregious discovery abuses, two facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful.”  (Lee v. Lee (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.)  “Even where
nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘ “...’should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citations.] ‘ “...
[¶] The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary
to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he
seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to
accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.’ ” ’
[Citations.]”  (Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)“A trial court has broad
discretion when imposing a discovery sanction.” 
(Lee, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p.1559.)  “In exercising this discretion [for
nonmonetary sanctions], a variety of factors may be relevant, including, 1) the
time which has elapsed since [the discovery requests] were served, 2)
whether the party served was previously given a voluntary extension of time, 3)
the number of [the discovery requests] propounded, 4) whether the unanswered
questions sought information which was difficult to obtain, 5) whether the
answers supplied were evasive and incomplete, 6) the number of questions which
remained unanswered, 7) whether the questions which remain unanswered are
material to a particular claim or defense, 8) whether the answering party has acted
in good faith, and with reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior orders
compelling discovery and the answering party's response thereto, 10) whether
the party was unable to comply with the previous order of the court, 11)
whether an order allowing more time to answer would enable the answering party
to supply the necessary information, and, 12) whether a sanction short of
dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction.”  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 796–797.) Discussion            On
January 30, 2024, the Court ordered Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,500.00 to Plaintiff Kristina Holman
by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of notice of that order.  The Court continued Plaintiff’s request for
Issue Sanctions 1-15 to April 2, 2024. 
The Court also ordered Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to serve further,
verified, code compliant responses as to Request for Production, Set Two Nos.
60-65, 69, 70-75, 77, 78, 80, 81, 87, and 90-93 without objection – except as
to attorney client privilege – within twenty (20) days of notice of that order
and produce the respective responsive documents within thirty (30) days of
notice of that order.  The Court noted
that any claim of attorney-client privilege must be supported by a privilege
log specifically identifying any withheld documents and sufficient information
to support the claim of attorney-client privilege, and that Defendant’s failure
to do so will result in the requested issue sanctions being entered against
Defendant.  The Court also ordered
the parties to file a declaration within thirty (30) days of notice of the
order identifying whether Defendant complied with the order and including the
further responses and any privilege log.On February 4,
2024, the Court ordered Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to pay monetary sanctions in
the amount of $4,500.00 to Plaintiff Kristina Holman by and through counsel, within
thirty (30) days of notice of that order. 
The Court also denied Plaintiff’s request for Issue Sanctions 7 and
9.  The Court continued Plaintiff’s
request for Issue Sanctions 1-6, 8, 10-13 to April 2, 2024 at 8:30 am.  The Court also ordered Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center to serve further, verified, code compliant responses as to Request for
Production, Set One Nos. 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 42, and 51 with
the temporal limitation of January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2021, without
objection and provide responsive documents no later than March 6, 2024, where
Defendant’s failure to do so would result in the imposition of the remaining
requested issue sanctions against Defendant.  The Court ordered Plaintiff and Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center to file a joint statement no later than March 11, 2024,
identifying whether Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center complied with the
instant order and attaching Defendant’s further responses.              Here,
the parties have not filed the joint statement identifying whether
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center complied with the instant order and
attaching Defendant’s further responses. 
Thus, the Court is unable to determine whether Defendant has complied
with the January 30, 2024 and February 4, 2024 orders, and will continue the
hearing to allow the parties to do so.   Conclusion and ORDERBased on the foregoing, the Court
CONTINUES the motion to April 30, 2024 to allow the parties to file a joint
statement.             Moving Parties are to give notice and
file proof of service of such. DATED:  April 2, 2024                                                          ___________________________Yolanda Orozco                                                                                    Judge
