```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for a protective order filed by the Kous, who are seeking to prevent their depositions due to their health conditions. The Kous' treating physicians have submitted letters stating that they are not fit to undergo depositions due to their health conditions. The judge finds that the Kous have established good cause for the protective order and that any alleged risk of prejudice to Cross-Defendant Mayer is outweighed by the Kous' health and wellbeing. The judge also awards the Kous $1,620 in sanctions, to be paid by Cross-Defendant Mayer and his counsel, jointly and severally. The judge instructs Cross-Defendant Mayer to pursue discovery without delay, including taking the deposition of Ming Shin Kuo, if he so wishes.
