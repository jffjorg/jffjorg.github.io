And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a hearing on a demurrer and the plaintiff's opposition. The court has sustained the demurrer as the plaintiff's opposition lacks sufficient analysis and relevant citations, and the complaint is predicated on the Perpetrator's conduct rather than vicarious liability. The court notes that the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed Roe High School as a party. The ruling also addresses a mistake in the caption of the SAC and the applicability of the Gifts Clause to AB 218. The court concludes that it would have overruled the demurrer but for the plaintiff's failure to address the mistake in the caption.
