[1] Though the court
notes service was improper as Plaintiff personally served the summons
and complaint, which is impermissible as he is a party to the action. (See
California Code of Civil Procedure § 414.10 [Any person 18 years of age or over
and not a party to the action may serve the summons and complaint].) Thus, a
plaintiff may not serve the summons and complaint.


[2] The declaration is
largely dedicated to what appears to be Plaintiff’s attempt at obtaining
counsel, which took place sometime in April 2022.
