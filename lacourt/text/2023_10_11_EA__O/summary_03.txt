And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's application for default judgment against a defendant corporation and its individual officer. The plaintiff, YCT LOGISTICS, INC, alleges that the defendants, SHOE REPUBLIC LA, INC and DAVID LI, hired them as a freight forwarder agent but failed to pay invoices totaling $178,421.01. The plaintiff seeks default judgment against the corporation for $188,840.66.

The Judge denies the application for default judgment without prejudice because the individual defendant, DAVID LI, has not been dismissed. The Judge also denies the application with prejudice because the complaint does not adequately allege alter ego and disregard of the corporate form, as required to pierce the corporate veil and hold the individual defendant liable.

The Judge notes that the complaint merely recites the factors used to assert alter ego, but does not provide sufficient facts to support this claim. The Judge cites several cases that require a plaintiff to plead and prove a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and individual defendants to succeed in a claim based on disregard of the corporate form.
