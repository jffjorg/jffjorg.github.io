And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by John Doe, a plaintiff who alleges that the Roe School District was negligent and failed to prevent a sexual assault that occurred in 1978. The defendant has filed a demurrer and a motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a claim against the district. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint to address the defendant's concerns. The judge has also found that the motion to strike is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained. The judge's ruling means that the plaintiff's case has been dismissed, and the plaintiff cannot continue to pursue a claim against the district.
