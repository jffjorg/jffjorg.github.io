Legal
Standard
 
RFAs are
different from other civil discovery tools such as depositions,
interrogatories, and requests for documents because while most of the other
discovery procedure primarily assist counsel prepare for trial, RFAs are aimed
at “setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.” (St.
Mary v. Superior Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 774, 775, quoting Cembrook
v. Superior Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 423, 429.) 
 
C.C.P.
section 2033.280 then provides that if a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules
apply: 
 
(a) The party to whom the
requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party’s failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this
order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant seeks an order deeming matters served in the
Request for Admission (RFA), Set one, as admitted by Plaintiff, which was
propounded upon Plaintiff on June 21, 2023 with a response on or before July
26, 2023. 
 
The RFA seeks admission of the following: 
 
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: 
Please admit that COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
was not negligent in any way towards you. 
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: 
Please admit that no action or
inaction on the part of COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, represented a substantial
factor in any injuries which you are claiming in this matter. 
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: 
Please admit that you have no
facts to support your cause of action for “Motor Vehicle” set forth in
your Complaint. 
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 4:
Please admit that you have no facts to support your cause of
action for “Emergency Vehicle vs. Ped” set forth in your Complaint.
 
(Motion p. 5, see also Ex. A, pp. 11-12 of 31 of PDF,
emphasis and underline added.) 
 
Despite service of the RFA via
mail on June 21, 2023 (See POS p. 13 of 31), despite an electronic courtesy
copy sent on July 26, 2023 (Ex. B), despite a courtesy notification on July 12,
2023 that responses were soon due, and despite a voluntary meet and confer effort
on July 31, 2023, Plaintiff has not responded to the RFAs. Rather, on July 12,
2023, Plaintiff responded to Defense Counsel via email with “Plaintiffs
Despondent Decree Responsive to Defendants Discovery for Evidence,” which
despite its incomprehensibility, clearly indicates it does not answer the RFAs.
And to the extent that Plaintiff has attempted to file an opposition (entitled
‘Declaration’) that again does not answer the RFAs. And to the extent that
Plaintiff may state he served responses, his own 10/03 declaration undermines a
showing of timely responses as it is dated 10/03/2023, but responses were due
July 2023. And even if his responses were timely, they do not respond to the
RFA as Plaintiff objects on irrelevant grounds such as hearsay, “not verified
by client,” and citation to Evidence Code section 352. 
 
As noted by Defendant, Plaintiff
has elected to represent himself in this instant action. It is well established
that a litigant appearing in propria persona is entitled to the same
consideration than other litigants and attorneys. (County of Orange v. Smith
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444.) Plaintiff’s decision to not respond to
RFAs, which admits no fault on part of Defendant, nullifies Plaintiff’s entire
action. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
