[1] Plaintiff initially
named Roe High School as a co-defendant in this action. Subsequent to the
initial filings, Plaintiff has agreed to a voluntary dismissal of Roe High
School as a party to this litigation.   


[2] The court, in conclusion, sustained
the demurrer for the following reason: “Plaintiff’s Opposition includes
minimal, if any, discussion or response to a great majority of Defendant’s
points. Rather, Plaintiff’s opposition is replete with citations to authority
that bear no relevance, or, if they do, Plaintiff has not advanced a sufficient
analysis.[2]
And then in opposition, Plaintiff appears to change the factual nature of the
action by attempting to assert vicarious liability via acts of the District’s
employees/other teachers whereas the complaint is predicated upon the
Perpetrator’s conduct. In sum, both the opposition and complaint do not contain
specific, factual allegations to support any of the causes of action.” (See
June 30, 2023 Ruling.) 
 


[3] Note: The SAC’s caption also
states that a “seventh” COA for IIED is being asserted, but the body makes no
mention of an IIED COA. The MTS references this mistake, but the opposition to
the MTS does not address it. 
 


[4] For reasons that need not be addressed in this
ruling, the court would have overruled the demurrer as statutory interpretation
does not support the argument that the Gifts Clause is applicable to AB 218. 


[5] Had an answer been filed, the MTS could have also
been interpreted as a judgment on the pleadings. (Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc. (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 340, 342-343.)
