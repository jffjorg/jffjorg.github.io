Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendant SHOE
REPUBLIC LA, INC in the total amount of $188,840.66. (See JUD-100 form and
CIV-100 form.) For clarity, default judgment is not sought against the
individual Defendant Li. However, David Li, has not been dismissed. (See CCP section 585; see also Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1800.) (Only Does 1 through 10 were dismissed on 2/15/2023.) For
that reason, the application is denied without prejudice, pending his
dismissal. 
 
To the extent
that Plaintiff seeks default judgment against the corporate and
individual Defendant—considering that the declaration filed in support of the
default judgment application makes reference to alter ego allegations (Tsang
Decl., p. 1) and David Li has not been dismissed—the application would be denied
with prejudice as the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support
piercing the corporate veil. The allegations (Complaint ¶33) are merely a recitation of all the factors used
to assert alter ego. (See Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th
486, 512-513 [alter ego test host of factors].) Thus, as the test for a default
judgment is that there be a well-pled complaint, but here, alter ego is merely
conclusory, the complaint is not well-pled. application. (See Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 272-286; see also Vasey
v. California Dance Co. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 742, 749 [“In order to prevail
in a cause of action against individual defendants based upon disregard of the
corporate form, the plaintiff must plead and prove such a unity of interest and
ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the
individuals do not exist, and that an inequity will result if the corporate
entity is treated as the sole actor. [Citations]. Respondent's pleadings
and the evidence he presented at the default hearing fell far short of meeting
these requirements.”].) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, should Plaintiff seek default solely against the corporate
defendant, the application is denied without prejudice as Defendant David Li is
to be dismissed. Should Plaintiff seek default judgment against both the
corporate and individual defendant, the application is denied with prejudice
as the complaint is not well-pled.
