And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a hearing regarding a motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Nada Violet Lahoud, to special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and form interrogatories. The motion was filed by the defendant, Nicole Sedlock, et al., and the judge has denied the motion without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the defendant failed to file a joint statement, as required by the court's rules, which would have provided a detailed breakdown of the discovery requests and responses. The judge's ruling essentially means that the case will proceed without the further responses being compelled at this time, but the defendant can re-file the motion if they choose to do so.
