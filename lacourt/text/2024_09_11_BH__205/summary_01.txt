Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by plaintiff Joseph Hazani to amend the judgment and file an amended complaint past the 20-day deadline imposed by the court. The plaintiff claims that a "transmission error" prevented him from filing the amended complaint on time. The court had previously sustained a demurrer to the original complaint, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend. The plaintiff's motion is not supported by a declaration, but the court will grant the motion due to the short delay, lack of prejudice to the defendant, and the policy to resolve cases on their merits. The plaintiff's amended complaint must be filed by September 16, 2024, and the defendant will have 30 days to respond.
