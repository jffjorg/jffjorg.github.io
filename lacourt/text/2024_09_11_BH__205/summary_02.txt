And here is the summary in English text:

The case is a trade secret misappropriation case between KSFB Management, LLC, Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein LLP, and Galway Holdings LP. The case involves a dispute over a potential merger between KSFB Management, LLC and Galway Holdings LP, and a subsequent dispute between KSFB Management, LLC and the Former Partners. The motion is to dismiss the case for forum non conveniens, or to compel arbitration and stay the action pending arbitration.

The court has previously denied a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order in the New York action. The court has also granted judicial notice of various documents, including a notice of removal, a notice of motion to dismiss, and a memorandum of law in support of a motion to dismiss.

The court finds that the forum selection clause in the NDA is mandatory and requires KSFB to litigate its claims in New York. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable against Galway, despite it not being a signatory to the agreement, due to equitable estoppel. The court grants Galway's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending completion of arbitration.
