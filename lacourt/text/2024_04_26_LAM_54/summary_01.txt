And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to acknowledge partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of $70,000.00. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff should apply the security deposit to the judgment, but the plaintiff maintained that the deposit has already been applied to unpaid rent from October and November 2023. The judge found no authority requiring the defendant to apply the security deposit to the judgment and therefore declined to order a partial satisfaction of judgment.
