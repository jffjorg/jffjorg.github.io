BACKGROUND
 
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiffs Robert
Green, et al. filed a complaint against Defendant SRHT Property Management
Company, Skid Row Housing Trust, and Hart Limited Partnership, asserting causes
of action for breach of the warranty of habitability, violation of Civil Code §
1942.4, and private nuisance. Tenant Plaintiffs allege their units, owned and
managed by Defendants, are uninhabitable due to infestations, mold and plumbing
issues. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)
 
Defendants move for summary judgment
against Defendant Juan Aispuro. On May 19, 2023,
Defendant SRHT served Plaintiff Aspuiro with Requests for Admission, Set One.
(Cain Decl. ¶3.) Aispuro did not serve responses and did not ask for an
extension to respond. (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant subsequently moved to deem the RFA’s
admitted as to Plaintiff Aispuro. (Id.¶ 6.) This Court granted Defendant’s
motion on September 21, 2023. (Id. ¶ 7.) On November 11, 2023, Defendants SRHT
PMC and HART, LP served Plaintiff Aspuiro with Requests for Admissions, Set
One. No responses were ever served by Plaintiff Aspuiro. Defendants
subsequently moved to deem the RFA’s admitted, which was granted on January 25,
2024. 
 
Defendants assert that no triable issues of fact remain because Aispuro
has legally admitted no liability against Defendants. Plaintiff Aispuro does
not oppose this motion to show a triable issue of fact.
 
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.
