Hearing Date: April 26, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Acknowledgement of
Partial Satisfaction of Judgment
Moving Party: Defendant Chol Enterprises, Inc. 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 740 South Broadway
Associates, LLC
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION IS DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Under CCP §
724.030, a judgment creditor is required to immediately file an acknowledgment
of satisfaction of judgment with the court when a money judgment is satisfied.
If the judgment creditor fails to do so, the judgment debtor may follow the
procedures outlined in CCP §§
724.050 and 724.110 to obtain such an acknowledgment or a court-entered
satisfaction of judgment.
 
Defendant moves for an order requiring Plaintiff file an acknowledgement
of partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of $70,000.00 out of
$161,572.19. $100,000.00 of the judgment amount is for past unpaid rent.
Defendant asserts that it paid Plaintiff a $70,000.00 security deposit at the
start of Defendant’s tenancy. Defendant represents that Plaintiff has refused
to refund the deposit and requests the Court apply the deposit to the judgment.
The lease allows the security deposit to be used for unpaid rent. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that the deposit has been applied to
unpaid rent from October and November 2023 and should not be applied toward the
judgment. In reply, Defendant states that the amount owed for October and
November 2023 is disputed and therefore the Court should apply it to the
judgment.
 
The Court declines to order a partial satisfaction of judgment.
Plaintiff cites no authority, and the Court can find no requirement, that
Defendant apply the security deposit to judgment.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
