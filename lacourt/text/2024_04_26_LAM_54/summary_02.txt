Here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The defendants, Skid Row Housing Trust, SRHT Property Management, and Hart Limited Partnership, have moved for summary judgment against plaintiff Juan Aispuro. The defendants argue that Aispuro has failed to respond to requests for admission, which has resulted in his admissions being deemed. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that Aispuro has not produced substantial responsive evidence to raise a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.
