And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with 30 days' leave to amend. The judge found that the complaint is uncertain and fails to identify any causes of action or demand a judgment. The plaintiff alleged that co-workers made comments about him and that he was "black balled" from the company, but the complaint does not specify what causes of action he is asserting or what relief he seeks. The judge noted that a demurrer for uncertainty is properly sustained where the complaint is so vague or uncertain that the defendant cannot reasonably respond. The defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint was granted, and the meet and confer requirement was satisfied. The judge's ruling is subject to change after the hearing on September 17, 2024.
