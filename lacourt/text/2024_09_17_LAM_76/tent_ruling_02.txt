Discussion
 
Defendant Universal Protection
Service LP dba Allied Universal Protection Services moves for judgment on the
pleadings as to the Complaint. On a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the
same rules applicable on demurrer apply. (County
of Orange v. Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 21, 32-33.)            “Presentation
of extrinsic evidence is . . . not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)
 
“A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed (Code Civ. Proc., §§
430.30, 430.70). The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action [citation].” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905 [200 Cal. Rptr.
497].)


(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
            Defendant
basically argues that the Complaint is uncertain because it does not identify
any causes of action, nor does it demand a judgment. 
 
A demurrer for uncertainty is properly
sustained where the complaint is so vague or uncertain that the defendant
cannot reasonably respond, i.e., when the defendant cannot determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts are directed against the
defendant. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616; Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial,
supra, ¶ 7:85.)  Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and strictly construed “because ambiguities can
reasonably be clarified under modern rules of discovery.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)
 
            Here, the
Complaint truly fails for uncertainty, as it cannot be ascertained what causes
of action Plaintiff is asserting, nor what relief Plaintiff seeks.
            
            The motion
for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED as to the entire Complaint with 30
days’ leave to amend.
