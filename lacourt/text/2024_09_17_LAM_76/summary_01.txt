And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the City of Los Angeles acting by and through the Department of Water and Power. The defendant's motion for terminating sanctions is deemed "off-calendar" as it was filed after a previous minute order cancelled the hearing and ordered all discovery motion hearing reservations to be cancelled and taken off calendar. The judge has also continued the hearing on the defendant's motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents to October 16, 2024. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to resolve the outstanding disputes, and if they cannot be resolved, they must file a joint separate statement regarding the outstanding disputes by October 4, 2024. The judge will reserve its ruling on the request for monetary sanctions until the further hearing.
