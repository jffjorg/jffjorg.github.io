 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Adam C. Phillips,
Esq. (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Nancy Ruiz (“Plaintiff”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on October 1, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been a breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship precluding Counsel’s ability to effectively
represent Plaintiff in this matter. 
(MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons,
Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing Plaintiff in this action.  
Counsel properly served Plaintiff at her
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by mail (return receipt
requested) within the past 30 days of filing the motion.  
As for future hearing dates, a Status Conference
re: Private Mediation/Discovery Issues is set for November 14, 2024; the Final
Status Conference is set for March 5, 2026; and the Trial is set for March 16,
2026.  Thus, there is sufficient time for
Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  The order electronically
lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
