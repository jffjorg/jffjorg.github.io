  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel 



 
Defense counsel, Na’il Benjamin
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Aneaka English
(“Defendant”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on October 7, 2024.  Counsel has filed the notice of motion
(MC-051) and declaration (MC-052) forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362.  However, Counsel has not filed a proposed
order (MC-053) form.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been an irreparable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship stemming from Defendant’s failure
to communicate and cooperate in the representation, such that the deterioration
of the relationship makes it unreasonably difficult for Counsel to effectively
represent Defendant and creates a conflict of interest.  Counsel also states that Defendant has
emailed opposing counsel stating that she would be hiring new counsel to
represent her interests.  (MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw
from representing Defendant in this action. 

Counsel properly served Defendant at her
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by email within the past 30
days of filing the motion.  Plaintiffs’
counsel was also served with the motion by mail. 
As for future hearing dates, there are three
motions to compel further responses set for November 8, 2024 and a motion to be
relieved as counsel set for November 15, 2024. 
The Final Status Conference is set for September 4, 2025 and the Jury Trial
is set for September 15, 2025.  Thus,
there is time for Defendant to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  Counsel is ordered
to electronically lodge a proposed order (MC-053) form for the Court’s
signing.  The order will become effective
upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Defendant.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
