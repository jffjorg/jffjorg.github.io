The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel discovery responses from the defendants, I Guard Services, Inc. and United Protective Services, Inc. The plaintiff had filed two motions to compel initial responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff served the discovery requests on the defendants on July 22, 2024, but did not receive responses. The judge has ordered the defendants to provide verified responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice of this order.

The plaintiff had also requested sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $2,250 per motion. The judge has granted the requests for sanctions, but reduced the amount to $200 per motion. The defendants are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $400 to the plaintiff by and through counsel within 20 days of notice of this order.
