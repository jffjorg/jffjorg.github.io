And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery responses filed by the Defendants. The Defendants have filed 9 discovery motions against the Plaintiffs, seeking to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. The Judge has granted the unopposed motions to compel responses, ordering the Plaintiffs to provide verified responses without objections within 20 days. The Judge has also granted the Defendants' request for sanctions, ordering the Plaintiffs to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $600 each. The Judge has also ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the costs of the motions. The Judge has noted that the motions are relatively simple and identical, and therefore reduced the amount of sanctions from the amount requested by the Defendants.
