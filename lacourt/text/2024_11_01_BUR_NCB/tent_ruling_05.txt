[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses 



 
There are 9 discovery motions on calendar.

On July 26, 2024, Defendants Madelaine
Dawn La Voie dba Cherie Miller & Associates and Lynee Lissa La Voie (“Defendants”)
filed 3 motions to compel initial responses from Plaintiff Barron De Sanctis for:
(1) Form Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories
(“SROG”), set one; and (3) Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set
one.  On July 26, 2024, Defendants filed
3 motions to compel initial responses from Plaintiff Hrag Julian Karlubian for:
(1) FROG; (2) SROG; and (3) RPD.  On July
26, 2024, Defendants filed 3 motions to compel initial responses from Plaintiff
Powdered Jelly Donut Investments, LLC for: (1) FROG; (2) SROG; and (3) RPD.
On November 21, 2023, Defendants served on
each of the Plaintiffs the discovery requests. 
Defendants state that despite good faith efforts to meet and confer,
Defendants have not received responses from Plaintiffs.  
Defendants’ unopposed motions to compel
responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290
and 2031.300.  Plaintiffs Barron De
Sanctis, Hrag Julian Karlubian, and Powdered Jelly Donut Investments, LLC are each
ordered to provide verified responses to Defendants’ discovery requests,
without objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Defendants request sanctions against each
Plaintiff and their attorney in the amount of $1,325 per motion (= 2 hours to
prepare the motion + 3 anticipated hours for the reply and to attend the
hearing, at $265/hour).  The requests are
granted but in the reasonable sum of $200 per motion, as these motions are
relatively simple and identical motions to compel initial responses.  Plaintiff Barron De Sanctis and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $600 to Defendants, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.  Plaintiff Hrag Julian Karlubian and his
counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $600 to Defendants, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.  Plaintiff Powdered Jelly Donut
Investments, LLC and its counsel of record, jointly
and severally, are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $600 to
Defendants, by and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
