Significant Statements:
  - "A public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if (1) the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury; (2) the dangerous condition caused the injury; (3) the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred; and (4) that either (a) a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the condition, or (b) the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition in time to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition."
  - "While Defendant's employee did not have actual notice of a dangerous condition, there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether he had constructive notice of the conditionâ€”i.e., whether the 'condition existed for such a period of time and was of such an obvious nature that the public entity, in the exercise of due care, should have discovered the condition and its dangerous character.'"
  - "The Court finds that there are triable issues of material fact, such that the motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, for summary adjudication is denied."

Summary in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Javier Mejia against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority. The lawsuit stems from an incident where Mejia slipped and fell on the steps of a bus due to a liquid substance. The defendant argued that Mejia failed to establish the existence of a dangerous condition and that they did not have notice of the condition. However, the judge found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether a dangerous condition existed and whether the defendant had constructive notice of the condition. The judge also denied the defendant's motion based on the plaintiff's argument that the defendant failed to produce essential evidence and engaged in spoliation of evidence, although the judge did not make a determination on this issue at this time.
