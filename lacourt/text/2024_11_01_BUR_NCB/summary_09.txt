And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas for production of business records filed by the plaintiff, Christopher Vincent Tate. The plaintiff alleges that he slipped and fell on the defendant's property due to a dangerous condition, and is seeking discovery of the defendant's business records. The defendant has issued unlimited deposition subpoenas for production of the plaintiff's medical history, which the plaintiff argues is overbroad and seeks records from outside of California.

The judge has granted the motion to quash the subpoenas in part, limiting the scope of discovery to 5 years prior to the incident and only requiring the production of insurance policies issued. The judge has also limited the scope of discovery of medical, billing, and radiology records to 10 years prior to the incident and to the body parts that are alleged to be at issue in this action.

The judge has also ordered the defendant to comply with the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act when seeking to subpoena out-of-state providers. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $1,000 in sanctions and $60 in filing fees.

The judge's decision is based on the principle that while a plaintiff is not obligated to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a specific physical, mental, or emotional injury, they may not withhold information which relates to any physical or mental condition which they have put in issue by bringing this lawsuit. The judge has also cited the case law on the scope of discovery in personal injury cases, holding that a plaintiff suing for personal injuries waives the physician-patient privilege to some extent, but this does not make discoverable all of a plaintiff's lifetime medical history.
