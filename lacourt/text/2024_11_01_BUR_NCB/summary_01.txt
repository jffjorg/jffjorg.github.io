This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik in the case of andrew bergman, et al. v. isaac blocher, et al. (Case No. 21GDCV01353). The ruling concerns a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Na'il Benjamin, defense counsel for Defendant Aneaka English. Benjamin seeks to withdraw from representing English due to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, citing English's failure to communicate and cooperate in the representation, and her statement that she will hire new counsel. The court grants the motion, allowing Benjamin to withdraw as counsel, and orders him to lodge a proposed order for the court's signing. The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on English.
