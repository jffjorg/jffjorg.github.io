  order RE:
motion for summary adjudication 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Heriberto Aguilar (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that on April 14, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contact with
Defendant Ford Motor Company (“FMC”) regarding a 2022 Ford F150 vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that the warranty contract contained various warranties, including but not limited to the bumper-to-bumper
warranty, powertrain warranty, emission warranty, etc.  Plaintiff alleges that the defects and
nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves during the applicable
warranty period, including but not limited to, transmission defects, infotainment
defects, and climate control defects. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to promptly replace the vehicle
or make restitution.  
Plaintiff
alleges that he delivered the subject vehicle to Defendant Galpin Ford
(“Galpin”) for substantial repairs on at least one occasions.  Plaintiff alleges that Galpin had a duty to
use ordinary skill in storage, preparation, and repair of the subject vehicle,
but Galpin breached its duty.  
The complaint, filed February 5, 2024,
alleges causes of action for: (1) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(D); (2)
violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(B); (3) violation of Civil Code, §
1793.2(A)(3); (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civil
Code, §§ 1791.1, 1794, and 1795.5); (5) fraudulent inducement – concealment;
and (6) negligent repair against Galpin.   
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On February 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary adjudication as to FMC’s 7th
affirmative defense for release, merger, discharge, and/or accord and
satisfaction.  This motion was initially
set for August 23, 2024.  On August 12,
2024, FMC filed an opposition brief. 
On August 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed another set of motion for summary adjudication papers.  This motion included the hearing date of
November 1, 2024.  
On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Joint Stipulation to Continue the Hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Adjudication, stating that the parties agreed to continue the hearing date of
November 1, 2024 for 45 days to allow Defendants to depose Plaintiff prior to
opposing Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication filed on August 13,
2024.  The parties lodged a proposed
order regarding the stipulation to continue the hearing to December 16, 2024
(Monday), but the proposed order was rejected by the Clerk of the Court as Department
B hears law and motion matters on Fridays. 
DISCUSSION
            Based on the parties’ stipulation,
the parties seek to continue the hearing date of the motion for summary
adjudication by 45 days, so that it may be held after Plaintiff’s deposition
(currently scheduled for November 4, 2024) and to provide sufficient time for
Defendant to file an opposition brief.  
            In light of the parties’
representations in the stipulation, the motion for summary adjudication is
continued.  The operative moving papers
shall be the papers filed on August 13, 2024 and not the motion papers filed on
February 29, 2024.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff Heriberto
Aguilar’s motion for summary adjudication is continued to December 20, 2024 at
8:30 a.m.  The parties’ opposition and
reply briefs shall be filed and served pursuant to code.   
Plaintiff
shall
provide notice of this order.
