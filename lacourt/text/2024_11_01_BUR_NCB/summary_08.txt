And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Adam C. Phillips, Esq. (Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Nancy Ruiz. Counsel has filed the necessary forms and has properly served plaintiff at her last known mailing address. The judge has determined that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which precludes Counsel from effectively representing plaintiff. As a result, Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing plaintiff and obtain substitute counsel. The judge has scheduled future hearings, including a status conference and trial dates, and has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel.
