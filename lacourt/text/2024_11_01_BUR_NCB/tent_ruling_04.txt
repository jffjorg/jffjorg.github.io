[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to enforce settlement agreement
  and enter judgment purSUant to CCP § 664.6 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Modern HR, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that it is an outsourced human resources provider that works with many industries
all over the country.  It alleges that in
December 2021, it entered into a contract with SA Hospital Acquisition, LLC
(“SAH”), which was owned by Defendants Lawrence Feigen and Jeffrey
Ahlholm.  Plaintiff alleges that under
its agreement with SAH, SAH agreed to use Plaintiff’s HR services and Feigen
and Ahlholm each personally guaranteed SAH’s payment and performance
obligations under the agreement.  Plaintiff
alleges that SAH began having difficulty submitting timely and complete
payments to Plaintiff and, after discussing the issues with Defendants,
Plaintiff continued to provide services and even advanced its own funds to meet
SAH’s payroll demands.  Plaintiff alleges
that in April 2022, Feigen and Ahlholm convinced some of their associates to
make payments to Plaintiff on SAH’s behalf, including Defendant Kris Smolinski who
paid $300,000 to Plaintiff by credit card. 
Plaintiff alleges that SAH continued to fail meeting its financial obligations.  On May 2, 2022, the parties executed a
Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the parties’ payment and reimbursement
schedule, but SAH failed to make the first $500,000 payment on May 3,
2022.  On May 10, 2022, SAH signed a
letter of intent (“LOI”) to sell South City Hospital to American Healthcare
Systems.  In late March 2023, Smolinski
initiated a chargeback on his $300,000 payment, claiming it was not an
authorized payment.  
 The
complaint, filed April 19, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) money lent; (3) breach of contract; and (4) breach of contract
(third party beneficiary).   
B.    
Motion
on Calendar
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter judgment against
Defendants Lawrence Feigen and Jeffrey Ahlholm. 

The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff moves to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter judgment
against Defendants Feigen and Ahlholm pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
            In
support of the motion, Plaintiff provides the declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel Sasha Frid.  Ms. Frid provides a copy
of the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release effective August 19, 2024, and a
copy of the executed Stipulated Judgment. 
(Frid Decl., ¶¶2-3, Exs. 1-2.)   The
Settlement Agreement states in section 1.a that in exchange for a “standstill
agreement until September 30, 2024, which would temporarily suspend all legal activities,
until October 15, 2024, Defendants agree to pay Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
($250,000) to Modern HR on or before August 23, 2024 (the ‘Settlement Deposit
Payment’).”  (Settlement Agreement, §
1.a.)  Section 1.b states that in
“exchange for the releases set forth below between Defendants and Modern HR,
Defendants agree to pay One Hundred Fifty Thousand ($150,000) to Modern HR on
or before October 15, 2024 (the ‘Final Settlement Payment’) ….”  (Id., § 1.b.)  Defendants agreed:
In
consideration for the above and concurrently herewith, Defendants Jeffrey
Ahlholm and Lawrence Feigen agree to enter into a Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment (“Stipulation”) in the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($150,000.00) less any interim payments made under this Settlement Agreement,
in the form and content attached hereto as Exhibit B. Modern HR agrees to hold
the Stipulation and not execute upon it unless or until Defendants have
breached this Settlement Agreement for failure to make any of the payments set forth
in paragraphs 1(b) above. Further, in the event of default, Modern HR shall
provide written notice of the default pursuant to section 14 of this Settlement
Agreement. Upon receipt of the Notice of Default, Defendants Jeffrey Ahlholm
and Lawrence Fiegen shall have ten (10) business days to cure.
(Settlement Agreement, § 1.g.)  Section
9 states that the parties agree that in any action or proceeding to enforce the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs.  (Id., §
9.) 
            The
Stipulated Judgment states: 
IT
IS HEREBY STIPULATED by and between
MODERN HR, INC. (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants LAWRENCE FEIGEN and JEFFREY
AHLHOLM that judgment in the above-entitled action and in the form of the
Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation, attached here to as Exhibit “A”, or such
other form required by the Court, be entered in favor of MODERN HR and against
Defendants, in the sum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00),
less any payments already received by MODERN HR (the “Judgment”).  
(Stipulated Judgment at p.2.)  
Ms. Frid states
that Defendants failed to make the $250,000 Settlement Deposit Payment by the
August 23, 2024 deadline.  (Frid Decl., ¶4.)  Counsel states that she contacted defense
counsel on September 3, 4, and 5, 2024 to inform him that the $250,000
Settlement Deposit Payment was past due, but defense counsel did not
respond.  (Id.)  She states that she contacted him on
September 9, 2024 and defense counsel responded on September 10, 2024, stating
that he was awaiting a response from Defendants.  (Id., Ex. 3.)  Ms. Frid seeks attorney’s fees in the amount
of $7,175 (= 2 hours on the motion + 2.5 anticipated hours on the reply and to
attend the hearing at $1,250/hour, plus 2 hours spent by associate Danielle
Novelly at $775/hour).  (Id.,
¶5.)  
Plaintiff argues
that Defendants breached their obligations under the Settlement Agreement by
failing to pay the $250,000 Settlement Deposit Payment by August 23, 2024 and failing
to pay the $150,000 Final Settlement Payment, such that Stipulated Judgment
should be entered for a total amount of $400,000, plus interest and attorney’s
fees.  
However, in
enforcing the terms of the Settlement Agreement and entering the Stipulated
Judgment, the Court can only enforce the agreement subject to the express terms
stated in the Settlement Agreement.  A
settlement is enforceable under CCP § 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all
material terms.  (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)  If the court determines that the parties
entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the section 664.6
motion and enter a formal judgment “pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.”  (Id. at 1182-83 [citing CCP §664.6].)  
While Plaintiff
seeks judgment in the total amount of $400,000, the Stipulated Judgment signed
by the parties only states that judgment shall be entered in the amount of
$150,000 (less any payments made by Defendants).  The Settlement Agreement states that
Defendants’ payment of the $250,000 Settlement Deposit Payment would
temporarily suspend all legal activities until October 15, 2024; there is no
provision of what happens if this particular term is breached—other than the inapplicability
of the temporary suspension of all legal activities.  In contrast, in the event that Defendants
fail to make the $150,000 Final Settlement Payment, section 1.g comes into
effect (as it specifically pertains to a breach of paragraph 1.b)—that is,
notice of the default must be provided and then the Stipulated Judgment may be
entered.  
Thus, at this time, the Court
denies the motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as specifically requested
by Plaintiff by way of this motion—that is, Plaintiff’s request that judgment
be entered against Defendants in the amount of $400,000, plus attorney’s fees
in the amount of $7,175, and interest in the amount of $4,794.52, for a total
judgment of $411,969.52. As discussed above, Plaintiff’s requested relief
exceeds the scope of the Settlement Agreement and the terms of the Stipulated
Judgment executed by the parties.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Plaintiff Modern HR, Inc.’s motion
to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter judgment against Defendants
Lawrence Feigen and Jeffrey Ahlholm is denied without prejudice to a motion to
enter judgment in the amount called for by the settlement agreement.   
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
this order.
