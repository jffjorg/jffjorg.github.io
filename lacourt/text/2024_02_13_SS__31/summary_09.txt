Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, in a case involving a dog bite and a dispute over indemnification, apportionment of fault, and/or contribution. Defendant Ze'ev Patrick Waismann seeks leave to file a cross-complaint against co-defendant San Gabriel Valley Humane Society (SGVHS), alleging that SGVHS failed to disclose information about the dog's aggressive behavior. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint is permissive, not mandatory, and grants the motion, ordering Waismann to file the cross-complaint within 10 days. The Court notes that the motion does not appear to be a strategic attempt to undermine SGVHS's motion for summary judgment and that the facts do not support an inference of deliberate delay.
