And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The defendant's counsel claimed that they had made diligent efforts to obtain verified responses from the defendant, who had been unreachable, and that this was excusable neglect. However, the judge found that this was not excusable neglect, as the defendant had refused to participate in the litigation and had not made any effort to respond to discovery requests. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.300 and 473(b) to reach this decision. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to submit written arguments or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
