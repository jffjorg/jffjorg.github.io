And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in the case of Rosanna Cosio and Rodel Cosio (plaintiffs) versus 419 N. Mountain View Terrace, LLC and Lito Desalesain (defendants). The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to constitute causes of action for negligence and premises against Lito as an individual. The court finds that the defendants did not meet and confer with the plaintiffs prior to filing the demurrer, as required by law. The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs have 20 days to revise their complaint to address the defects pointed out by the defendants. The court notes that the plaintiffs did not oppose the motion, and therefore are presumed to have conceded on the point. The defendants are ordered to give notice, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement.
