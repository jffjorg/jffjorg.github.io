And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery responses filed by CalTrans against Plaintiff David Haven. The court agrees with CalTrans that it is entitled to discovery and that the Plaintiff's failure to respond is not justified. The court orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to CalTrans' discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The court also awards sanctions to CalTrans in the amount of $660, to be paid by the Plaintiff. The court declines to impose sanctions on the Plaintiff's counsel, noting that it is unclear whether counsel has the ability to contact the Plaintiff. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
