And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Chandra Bouchard, must complete her deposition and that the plaintiffs are entitled to monetary sanctions. The judge found that Bouchard's counsel's instructions to her not to answer questions during her deposition were unjustified and that Bouchard's refusal to answer questions was equivalent to an outright refusal to participate in her deposition. The judge also found that Bouchard's counsel did not provide sufficient justification for the refusal and that the plaintiffs' request for sanctions was reasonable. The judge awarded the plaintiffs $2,600 in attorney's fees, $856.63 in transcript fees, and $60 in motion filing fees, and ordered Bouchard and her counsel to pay a total of $3,516.63 in sanctions within 20 days. The judge also encouraged the parties to meet and confer to try to reach an agreement and to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing.
