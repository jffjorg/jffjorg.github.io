And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Posh Management, Inc. dba Paradise La UnCut. The plaintiff's request is denied because they used outdated forms (CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2007]) and did not properly authenticate their medical records and bills. The plaintiff's counsel did not receive medical treatment or have personal knowledge of the plaintiff's damages. The judge orders the plaintiff to resubmit a new default judgment package using the current judicial council forms (CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023] and JUD-100 [Rev. January 1, 2024]) and authenticating their records by the next hearing date. Failure to comply may result in sanctions, including monetary penalties and/or dismissal.
