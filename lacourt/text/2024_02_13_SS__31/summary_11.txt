And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a request for default judgment against Issac Albert Sandoval, who was incorrectly sued as John Doe. The Plaintiff, Juan De Jesus Isaguirre, seeks damages arising from a motor vehicle v. bicycle collision. The Judge has granted the request for default judgment in the amount of $400,000 for general damages and $834.36 for costs. The Judge reduced the general damages from $2 million to $400,000 due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support the higher amount. The Judge also declined to grant special damages due to the lack of specificity in the statement of damages. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
