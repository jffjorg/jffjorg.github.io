And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ruth Zapeta Vargas v. Robert Young, et al. The defendants have moved for summary adjudication against the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and prayer for punitive damages. However, the defendants have failed to file an answer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, despite having filed a demurrer. The judge has reviewed its docket and confirmed that no answer was ever filed. Therefore, the judge has continued the hearing to allow the defendants to file a responsive pleading and has ordered them to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 20 days. The judge has also prohibited the withdrawal of the motion for summary adjudication without leave.
