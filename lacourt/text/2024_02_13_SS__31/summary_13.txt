And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the allegations and prayer for punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argues that the allegations are irrelevant, false, or improper and that the plaintiff has not stated a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The court agrees and finds that the allegations are conclusory and do not rise to the level of conduct warranting punitive damages. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate how they can amend the complaint to cure the defects. As a result, the motion is granted without leave to amend.
