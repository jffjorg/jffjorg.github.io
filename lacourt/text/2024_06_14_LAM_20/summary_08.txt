English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment on all matters due to triable issues as to whether the bar was also insured. The Judge finds that the bar and restaurant have changed names over time only for marketing purposes, and that the entire business was marketed as the "Onyx Lounge" at the time of the loss. The Judge also finds that there is only one lease for the entire business, and that the address on the insurance policy is the mailing address for the entire premises. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff's insurance agent confirmed that the limits and figures provided included the bar, and that a July 2019 underwriting inspection included photos of both the outside and inside of the bar area. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's principal testified that when he communicated figures such as revenues upon which the insurance premium would be based, these included the figures for the bar.
