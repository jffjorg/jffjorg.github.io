And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for default judgment against Louie Castro, defendant in a fraud and breach of fiduciary duty case. The plaintiff, Goldstone, established an online resale platform called Secret Sauce with John Miller and Michael Schneider, but Castro and Schneider conspired to oust Goldstone and strip the company of its assets. The plaintiff had previously filed an application for default judgment, but it was denied due to incomplete forms. The plaintiff has now submitted a new form and provided evidence of damages, including lost income and attorney's fees incurred to regain control of the company.

The judge is granting the motion for default judgment, but with the condition that the plaintiff submits an updated JUD-100 form specifying that any payment made on the judgment against Schneider will reduce Castro's obligation and vice versa. This is to prevent double recovery, as the judgment against Schneider also concerns the same injury. The judge notes that attorney's fees are not typically recoverable as damages in fraud cases where a defendant is a fiduciary, but there is an exception for the "tort of another" exception, which allows a party to recover fees incurred in defending or prosecuting an action due to the tort of another. In this case, the plaintiff's attorney's fees were incurred as a result of Castro's fraud and breach of fiduciary duties, and are therefore recoverable as damages.
