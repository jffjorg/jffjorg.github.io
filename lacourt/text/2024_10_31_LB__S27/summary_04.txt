Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mateo Lopez vs. Mahir Marwan Waber and Waber Consultants, Inc. The Court has found that the motion to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted is substantively moot because the defendants have since served responses in substantial compliance with the rules. However, the Court has also found that the defendants' failure to timely respond to the RFAs warrants the imposition of sanctions. The Court has awarded $750 in sanctions against the individual defendant, Mahir Marwan Waber, and ordered him to pay the sanctions within 20 days. The Court has also denied the plaintiff's request for attorney fees in connection with the motion. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative or appear remotely at the hearing.
