And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on Transom's motion for summary judgment, which was scheduled for October 31, 2024. The Judge notes that Transom served additional documents on October 25, 2024, which are not in the court's e-filing system. The Judge wishes to review all papers served by all parties before ruling on the motion. The Judge presumes that the parties wish to preserve their right to have the motion heard at least 30 days prior to trial, so they are given time to engage in settlement discussions and/or trial preparation in the event the motion is denied. The hearing on the motion is continued to November 14, 2024, and the trial and FSC dates are also continued. The parties are ordered to ensure that all papers served are filed properly within the next week.
