And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants in a case involving a minor plaintiff who was sexually assaulted by another student at a school. The defendants argue that the individual defendants are immune from liability, that the plaintiff failed to allege constructive notice that the perpetrator was dangerous, and that the complaint lacks specificity. The plaintiff argues that the individual defendants are liable for the assault and that the complaint adequately alleges facts showing that the defendants knew or should have known of the perpetrator's propensity for abuse. The judge denies the motion, finding that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a claim for dangerous condition of public property and that the defendants are liable for the assault. The judge also notes that the legislature's change from "and" to "or" in the statute indicates an intention to change the law's effect. The case will proceed to a hearing on October 31, 2024.
