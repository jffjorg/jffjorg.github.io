S27 8:30 a.m. October 31, 2024Moving Party: Petitioner, Martha CortesOpposing Party: None filedNotice: OK1. Background FactsPlaintiffs, Ulises Cortes and Dolce Cortes (a minor by and through her GAL, Martha Cortes) filed this action against Defendants, City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, Jesus Cortes, and Ilda Cortes for damages arising out of a trip and fall. Ulises, while holding Dolce, tripped and fell on a city sidewalk adjacent to Jesus and Ilda’s property. Dolce suffered a concussion, hematoma, and chipped tooth as a result of the fall, but has completely recovered from her injuries.2. Petition to Approve Settlement of MInorThe Corteses have agreed to settle all claims with Plaintiffs for the total amount of $105,000. If the settlement is approved, $5000 will be apportioned to Dolce and the other $100,000 will be apportioned to Ulises. Because Dolce is a minor, Plaintiffs seek court approval of the settlement.If the settlement is approved, $1096.30 will be used for medical expenses, $1250 for attorneys’ fees, and $135 for costs of suit, leaving a balance of $2481.30 (this appears to be an error in the petition, and the correct amount should be $2518.70), which will be placed in a blocked account.Petitioner, in explaining why $100,000 is being apportioned to Ulises and only $5000 to Dolce, states only, “The plaintiffs involved in this matter had differing injuries and duration of injuries from this traumatic event. Thus, the global settlement of $105,000.000 is to be distributed amongst the two Plaintiffs matter (sic) based on past medical specials, future specials, and extent and duration of injury.”The Court, at the hearing, wishes to hear about Ulises’s injuries so it can determine whether the apportionment is fair and reasonable.If the Court is satisfied that the apportionment is reasonable, and if the amount is corrected on all paperwork, the Court will approve the settlement.Pursuant to CRC 7.952, Petitioner and Plaintiff must appear at the hearing unless their appearance is excused. Plaintiff is three years old, and therefore the Court excuses her from appearing at the hearing.DATED: October 31, 2024 _____________________________________MARK C. KIM Judge of the Superior Court
