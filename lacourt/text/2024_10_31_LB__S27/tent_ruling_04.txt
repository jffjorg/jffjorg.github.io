S27 8:30 a.m. October 31, 2024Moving Party: Plaintiff, Mateo LopezOpposing Party: Defendants, Mahir Marwan Waber and Waber Consultants, Inc.Notice: OKPlaintiff filed this lawsuit on 10/03/23. Plaintiff filed proof of service of the summons, complaint, and related matters on Defendants on 12/04/23 and 1/09/23. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on 1/16/24, and proof of service of the FAC on 3/19/24.Plaintiff propounded RFAs on the individual defendant on 6/04/24. On 8/02/24, having not received responses, Plaintiff filed this motion to deem RFAs admitted and for imposition of sanctions.On 10/18/24, Defendants filed timely opposition to the motion. Defendants contend the motion is substantively moot because they have now served responses in substantial compliance with the Code. They contend their failure to timely respond was due to the fact that they had not yet retained counsel,which they recently did. They therefore argue they are entitled to relief from their failure to respond and no sanctions should be imposed.Any reply to the opposition was due on or before 10/24/24. Plaintiff has not filed reply papers.The Court finds the motion is substantively moot. The only remaining issue is whether or not to impose sanctions. CCP §2033.280(c), unlike the companion sections regarding interrogatories and documents demands, makes imposition of monetary sanctions absolutely mandatory when a party fails to timely respond to requests for admissions.The Court finds imposition of sanctions is appropriate for three reasons. First, as noted above, imposition of sanctions is absolutely mandatory. Second, Defendants’ contention in opposition to the request is that, per §2033.280(a), they are entitled to relief from their failure to serve timely responses; that code section, however, contemplates an affirmative motion for relief, not an argument made in opposition to a motion to deem the requests admitted. Third, Defendants have offered no explanation for their failure to retain an attorney between the time they were served with the complaint (in December of 2023 and January of 2024), or even the FAC (in March of 2024), and the time they actually answered (in August of 2024).Plaintiff seeks imposition of sanctions in the amount of $1500 against the individual defendant, Mahir Marwan Waber. Plaintiff’s attorney declares he has billed four hours to prepare the moving papers at $300/hour, and will bill another hour to prepare for and appear at the hearing. The Court awards two hours of attorney time to prepare this basic discovery motion. No reply was filed and time for hearing should be minimal; the Court therefore awards .5 hours in connection with the hearing. The Court awards a total of 2.5 hours at the requested rate of $300/hour, or $750 in sanctions.Defendant Waber is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through his attorney of record, in the total amount of $750, within twenty days.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar. If a party submits on the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting on the tentative. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.DATED: October 31, 2024 _____________________________________MARK C. KIM Judge of the Superior Court
