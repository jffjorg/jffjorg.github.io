And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively approved the petition to approve the settlement of minor Dolce Cortes, who suffered a concussion, hematoma, and chipped tooth as a result of a trip and fall incident. The settlement amount is $105,000, with $5000 apportioned to Dolce and $100,000 apportioned to her father, Ulises Cortes. The Court notes that the apportionment seems unfair, with $100,000 being allocated to Ulises and only $5000 to Dolce, and wishes to hear more about Ulises's injuries at the hearing to determine if the apportionment is reasonable. If the Court is satisfied that the apportionment is reasonable and the paperwork is corrected, the Court will approve the settlement. The Court also excuses Dolce, who is three years old, from appearing at the hearing.
