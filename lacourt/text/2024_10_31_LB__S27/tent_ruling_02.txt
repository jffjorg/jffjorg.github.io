S27 8:30 a.m. October 31, 2024Moving Party: Cross-Defendant, Transom Symphony OpCo, LLCOpposing Party: Defendant and Cross-Complainant, Conair CorporationNotice: OKTransom filed this motion for summary judgment on 8/19/24, setting it for hearing on 10/31/24. Conair filed timely opposition papers on 10/15/24. Reply papers were due on or before 10/25/24. On 10/25/24, Transom filed two documents: responses to objections, and responses to the separate statement. On 10/28/24, Conair filed an opposition to Transom’s motion to strike and to Transom’s introduction of new evidence with the reply papers.It is clear that Transom served documents on 10/25/24 that, for whatever reason, are not in the Court’s e-filing system. At a minimum, it appears Transom served a motion to strike and served additional evidence, neither of which is in the court file. It seems like Transom also served reply points and authorities.The Court wishes to review all papers served by all parties prior to ruling on the motion. Notably, the motion is scheduled for hearing only slightly more than 30 days prior to trial. The Court presumes the parties wish to preserve their right to have the motion heard at least 30 days prior to trial, so they have time to engage in settlement discussions and/or trial preparation in the event the motion is denied.The Court is continuing the hearing on the motion, and is also continuing the FSC and trial dates. If any of the below dates are not acceptable to any party to this action, Counsel must meet and confer in good faith. Counsel must mutually agree to a hearing date for the motion within the next month, and an FSC and trial date within six weeks after the hearing date on the motion. Counsel must submit a stipulation and proposed order with the new dates, which the Court will process so long as the stipulation comports with the above.The hearing on the motion is continued to Thursday, 11/14/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The parties must ensure all papers that were served on one another are filed property within the next week.The trial date is continued to Monday, 12/16/24. The FSC is continued to Thursday, 12/12/24. Both dates are at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.Transom is ordered to give notice.Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at thehearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
