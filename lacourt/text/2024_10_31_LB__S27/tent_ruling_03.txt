Background FactsPlaintiff, LBCM, Inc. filed 23LBCV00100 against Defendants, Gangitano Law, PC and Patrick Anthony Gangitano for legal malpractice. 23LBCV00100 arises out of Defendants’ advice and representation of Plaintiff in connection with business transactions that give rise to the events at issue in related case 22LBCV00071. On 6/0823, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to stay 23LBCV00100 pending the outcome of 22LBCV00071, finding any ability of LBCM to recover in 23LBCV00100 depends on LBCM first sustaining damage in 22LBCV00071. The Court carved out an exception which permitted Plaintiff to conduct records only discovery while the stay was imposed.2. Motion to Compel Compliance with Deposition SubpoenaPer CRC 3.1346, when moving to compel a non-party to comply with a deposition subpoena, all moving papers must be served on the non-party by personal service.
