  - "It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”"

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Infinity Construction & Design and Ran Neuman, defendants in a lawsuit brought by Seth and Erin Grahame-Smith. The Grahame-Smiths alleged negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of written agreement, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and breach of oral agreement against the defendants. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it failed to state sufficient facts and that certain claims were time-barred. The Judge rejected the defendants' arguments, finding that the complaint adequately stated the claims and that the defendants' reliance on extrinsic evidence was impermissible. The Judge also found that the Grahame-Smiths did not learn of the defendants' illegal and negligent work until September 24, 2021, and therefore the claims were not time-barred. The demurrer is overruled and the defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
