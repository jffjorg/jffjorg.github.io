The Grahame-Smiths alleged negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of written agreement, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and breach of oral agreement against the defendants. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it failed to state sufficient facts and that certain claims were time-barred. The Judge rejected the defendants' arguments, finding that the complaint adequately stated the claims and that the defendants' reliance on extrinsic evidence was impermissible. The Judge also found that the Grahame-Smiths did not learn of the defendants' illegal and negligent work until September 24, 2021, and therefore the claims were not time-barred. The demurrer is overruled and the defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.

## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to **overrule** the demurrer filed by Defendants Infinity Construction & Design and Ran Neuman. 

The Plaintiffs, Seth and Erin Grahame-Smith, allege various claims against the Defendants, including negligence and breach of contract. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs' claims failed because:

* The contract relied upon by Plaintiffs is incomplete.
* Ran Neuman was not personally involved in the alleged wrongdoing.
* The claims are time-barred.

The judge rejected these arguments. Regarding the incomplete contract, the judge stated that they cannot take judicial notice of a contract when its provisions are disputed. Regarding Ran Neuman's involvement, the judge found that this is a factual dispute that cannot be resolved on a demurrer.  Finally, the judge found that the Plaintiffs' claims were filed within the applicable statute of limitations because they allege they did not discover the harm until 2021.

The Defendants are now required to file an answer to the Plaintiffs' complaint within 20 days.
