And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion to Strike references to punitive damages filed by Defendant LA Rentals Live LLC. Plaintiff Rafael Ayala alleged that Defendant violated various laws, including Civ. Code § 1942.4, and committed acts of negligence, nuisance, and breach of warranty of habitability. Defendant argued that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that demonstrate despicable conduct, and therefore, punitive damages are not warranted. The judge disagreed, finding that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to indicate malice with regard to Defendant's intentional failure to do repairs at the subject premises. The Motion to Strike is denied.
