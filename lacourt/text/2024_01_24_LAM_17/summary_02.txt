And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC). The plaintiff filed the SAC on October 3, 2023, after the court's deadline for filing on September 28, 2023. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to file on time is a curable defect, but the court has discretion to strike the SAC under Code of Civil Procedure section 472(a). The judge rules that the SAC must be stricken, but does so without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to correct the defect. The ruling is effective January 24, 2024.
