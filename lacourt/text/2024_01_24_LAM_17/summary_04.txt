Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion for an order to preserve evidence, finding that the proposed order is too broad and would impose enterprise-wide obligations on every single employee, officer, or executive of every Defendant to preserve any and all documents from the beginning of time to the present. The judge concludes that there is no evidence of spoliation and that there are remedies available to the Plaintiffs in the event that evidence is destroyed.

The judge also grants Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc.'s motion to strike the Plaintiffs' FAC, finding that the reference to undetermined products is improper and violates the toxic tort pleading requirements.
