 Case
  No.:  23STCV08440  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 24, 2024




 
Plaintiffs’
motion for an order for the preservation of evidence is DENIED.
 
On 4/17/2023,
Plaintiffs Jose Guadalupe-Soto Rodriguez and Sara Sanchez (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed suit against 39 Defendants, alleging: (1) negligence; (2)
strict liability—warning defect; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for a reciprocal order for the preservation of evidence. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
argues that a reciprocal order for the preservation of evidence should be
entered as to all product supply records, i.e., all records regarding the sale,
distribution, supply, delivery, and/or receipt of all stone slabs, as well as
other records that are relevant to this case. Plaintiff contends that all such
supply records are critical evidence in this case and that “unless ordered to
preserve all such records parties and other persons and entities may and likely
will destroy such evidence, either inadvertently in the ordinary course of
business or intentionally to attempt to avoid liability.” (Motion, 1:10-11.) 
 
The inherent
authority of trial courts to order the preservation of evidence in civil cases
derives from Code of Civil Procedure § 187: “When jurisdiction is, by the
Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or
judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.
 
Here,
Plaintiffs argue that following in support of this motion:
 
-        
“Most of the plaintiffs in the stone
countertop fabricator silicosis cases worked as fabricators, i.e., they cut,
ground and polished stone slabs to make stone countertops. Fabricators work
indoors in countertop fabrication shops. Stone slabs are typically delivered to
fabrication shops by truck and are stored outside. Prior to fabrication, a
worker called the “cutter” removes any plastic wrap protecting the surface of
the slab and any labeling before cutting the slab to the dimensions desired by
the customer. The slab is then brought into the fabrication shop where the
fabricator cuts, grinds, and polishes the slab. The fabricator therefore does
not know the identity of the manufacturer of the slabs that he fabricates
unless he happens to see logos or brands on the delivery truck or the slabs
before plastic packaging is removed by the cutter. Because fabricators often do
not know the identity of the manufacturer of the slabs they fabricate, it is
critical that paper and electronic records regarding the purchase and supply of
the stone slabs be preserved as evidence in these cases.” (Motion, 4: 3-13.) 
 
-        
“Most of the stone countertop
fabrication shops are small businesses run by immigrants who are not
sophisticated and who will likely conclude that the best way for them to avoid
liability and any problems is simply to destroy whatever supply records they
have. It is therefore critical, when a subpoena is served on any business that
employed or hired plaintiffs or a contractor that ordered stone slabs, that an order
requiring the recipient of the subpoena not to destroy the supply records
requested be concurrently served on the recipient with the subpoena.” (Id.
at p. 4: 14-19.) 
 
-        
“[B]ecause plaintiffs’ employers are
not defendants in these cases and cannot be sued in these cases due to workers’
compensation exclusivity, they are not parties to this litigation and therefore
do not have the duty of a party to the case not to destroy evidence.” (Id.
at p. 4: 20-22.)
 
-        
“California appellate courts have held
that there is no cause of action for spoliation of evidence, so Plaintiffs in
these cases have no adequate legal remedy against any employer or other
business that destroys supply records that are necessary for Plaintiffs to
prove their case against defendants and for the defendants to ascertain their
proportionate liability to Plaintiffs for causing their injuries.” (Id.
at p. 4: 22-26.)
 
After review,
the Court finds that, in light of the scope and nature of the obligations
created by the order, the requested evidence preservation order cannot be
entered. 
 
The proposed
order calls for the preservation of “All WRITINGS regarding the fabrication of
stone countertops,” “All WRITINGS regarding the purchase, sale, distribution,
supply, and/or receipt of natural and artificial stone products. . .”, as well
as multiple other overly broad categories of writings, unlimited by time or any
other metric. Thus, Plaintiffs’ proposed order would impose enterprise-wide
obligations on every single employee, officer, or executive of every Defendant
to preserve any and all documents from the beginning of time to the present
relating to their business operations, regardless of whether those documents
have any bearing on the issues in this litigation. As noted by Defendants,
“…the proposed preliminary injunction does not even attempt to tie any party or
non-party’s purported preservation obligations to the Plaintiffs, to any
particular employers or suppliers, to any particular time frame, or even to any
geographical region.” (Opp., 2: 15-17.)
 
            In
order to justify such an extreme request, there would have to be evidence that
that parties are failing to abide by their legal duties to preserve evidence.
However, here, Plaintiffs seek this order as a prophylactic. Plaintiffs are
correct that “[a]side perhaps from perjury, no act serves to threaten the
integrity of the judicial process more than the spoliation of evidence.” (United
Medical Supply Co. v. United States (Fed. Cl. 2007) 77 Fed. Cl. 247, 259.)
However, here, there is no evidence of spoilation, and there are remedies
available to Plaintiffs in the event that there is spoilation. 
 
            Moreover,
such a request is not enforceable. “It is well established that injunctions are
not effective against the world at large.” (People ex rel. Gwinn v. Kothari
(2000). 83 Cal. App. 4th 759, 765.) 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for an order for the preservation of evidence is denied.

 
It is so ordered.

Dal’s motion
to strike is GRANTED. 
 
On 4/17/2023,
Plaintiffs Jose Guadalupe-Soto Rodriguez and Sara Sanchez (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed suit against 39 Defendants, alleging: (1) negligence; (2)
strict liability—warning defect; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium. 
 
            Now,
Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc. (Dal) moves to strike Plaintiff’s FAC. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Dal
moves to strike the generalized product identification language “[a]nd other
stone products to be identified through the course of discovery,” on the
grounds that it violates the toxic tort pleading requirements.
 
            The
Court agrees. 
 
Under Brockrath, “[a]
plaintiff must allege facts albeit as succinctly as possible, explaining how
the conduct caused or contributed to the injury.” (Id. at p. 78.)
Specifically, a plaintiff must plead the following in his or her toxic tort
complaint: 1) That he or she was exposed to each of the toxic materials claimed
to have caused a specific illness; 2) Each product that allegedly caused the
injury; 3) That as a result of the exposure, the toxins entered his body; 4)
That he suffers from a specific illness, and that each toxin that entered his
body was a substantial factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating
that illness; and 5) That each toxin he absorbed was manufactured or supplied
by a named defendant. (Id. at p. 80.) 
 
As such, a
reference to undetermined products is improper: “[t]he law cannot tolerate lawsuits
by prospecting plaintiffs who sue multiple defendants on speculation that their
products may have caused harm over time through exposure to toxins in them, and
who thereafter try to learn through discovery whether their speculation was
well-founded.” (Id. at p. 81.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Dal’s motion to strike is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
