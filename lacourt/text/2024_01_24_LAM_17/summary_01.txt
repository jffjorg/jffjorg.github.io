And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving the Jeffrey S. Marks Separate Property Trust and others (Plaintiffs) against the Harb Family Trust and others (Defendants). The Plaintiffs filed a verified second amended complaint (SAC) alleging declaratory relief, quiet title, and injunctive relief related to a private alleyway. The Defendants, Fusion Investments, LLC, filed a demurrer arguing that the SAC does not state a claim.

The judge agrees with Fusion that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to show abandonment of the easement, which is required for their claims. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' own SAC alleges that the alleyway is being used, including the southern portion, which contradicts their claim of abandonment.

The judge sustains Fusion's demurrer with 15 days leave to amend. This means that the Plaintiffs will have one more opportunity to revise their complaint to include sufficient facts to state a claim. If the Plaintiffs fail to do so, their claims may be dismissed.
