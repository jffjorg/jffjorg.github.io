TENTATIVE RULING
 



BRETT GAGNON, an
  individual, and in 
a directive
  capacity on behalf of GEMINON PROPERTIES, LLC
 
        
  vs.
 
ARSALAN HAMIDI 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV30718 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: January 24, 2024 



 
 
            Defendant’s
motion to strike is GRANTED. 
 
On 9/20/2022,
Plaintiff Gagnon filed suit as an individual and
in 
a directive
capacity on behalf of Geminon Properties, LLC (Plaintiff) against Arsalan
Hamidi (Defendant). On 6/5/2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC) alleging: (1) breach of operating agreement; (2) breach of fiduciary
duties; (3) constructive fraud; (4) constructive trust; (5) conversion; (6)
cessation; and (7) declaratory relief. 
 
            Now,
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff’s SAC. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s SAC must be struck because it is untimely. In support,
Defendant notes that:
 
The Court, on
September 13, 2023, sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint with 10 days’ leave to amend. The last day for Plaintiff to file its
SAC was September 28, 2023. However, Plaintiff waited until October 3, 2023 to
file the SAC. As such, the SAC is a pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the Court’s order and should therefore be stricken in its entirety.
 
            (Motion,
3: 6-9.)
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute that the SAC was untimely filed, though
he offers a timeline to show how counsel came to file on the incorrect day. Plaintiff
contends that it would be unjust to dismiss Plaintiff’s entire action without giving
Plaintiff the opportunity to correct a curable defect, and that the Court has
discretion to accept the late-filed SAC pursuant to CCP section 472(a). 
 
            After
review, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s SAC should be stricken. Plaintiff
violated a Court ordered deadline to file, and cannot avoid penalty for such an
action. This ruling is without prejudice, and thus Plaintiff is not being
deprived an opportunity to correct a curable defect. (Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to strike is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
