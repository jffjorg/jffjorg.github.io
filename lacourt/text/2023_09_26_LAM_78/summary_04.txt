The judge also grants the motion to change venue, finding that San Bernardino County is a proper venue because the contract was entered into and to be performed in Ontario, where the subject warehouse is located. The judge notes that the defendants failed to provide evidence of when the summons in the San Bernardino case was served on the plaintiff, and orders the parties to appear at the hearing prepared to discuss the date of service. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law.
