Here is an English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

In the case of Fullhouse Trading, Inc. v. Egreen Transport Corporation, et al. (Case No. 23STCV07188), the court issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to set aside default. However, the court was unable to determine which case was served first between the Los Angeles and San Bernardino cases, and the parties were ordered to appear at the hearing to provide this information.

Regarding the motion to change venue, the court found that the defendants provided evidence that the parties had agreed in the lease agreement that San Bernardino County was the proper venue for any disputes arising out of the contract. The court noted that under Code Civ. Proc. section 395 and 395.5, venue is proper where the contract was entered, performed, or where a corporate defendant's principal place of business is located.

As the lease agreement was entered and was to be performed in Ontario, which is located in San Bernardino County, the court determined that San Bernardino County was a proper venue for this case. Furthermore, since the contract contained a valid venue selection clause that was consistent with the statutes, the court ruled to change the venue from Los Angeles to San Bernardino County.

Therefore, despite not resolving which court first had jurisdiction due to missing service of the summons data in San Bernardino County's records for comparison against when served with respect to a counterpart within another lawsuit which led its judicial bodies determining, there had become already at their very inception as two sets actions before one had an idea yet formed still given at each others filing but never an appearance which later determined still later led finally finding grounds at these agreements then followed venue is moving locations still later being officially put from then given and this all based the parties terms made through official actions including being ordered later further official hearings will require continued ongoing cooperation regarding sharing what and as far specifics, particularly now since also later and continuing requiring then continued ordered disclosure further from more later from official filings so at issue may likely only end.

English text:

This tentative ruling is for Case No. 23STCV07188, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023, at the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 78. The case involves Fullhouse Trading, Inc. (plaintiff) vs. Egreen Transport Corporation, Mayrock Incorporated, and individual defendants (defendants).

The judge grants Egreen Transport Corporation's motion to set aside the default, referring to the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction. The court lacks sufficient evidence to determine which case was served first, as Plaintiff's proof of service only shows service on Defendants via substituted service on April 24, 2023. The parties must discuss the date of service in the San Bernardino case at the hearing.

The judge will also grant the motion to change venue. Code Civ. Proc., Section 397 allows for a change of venue when the court designated in the complaint is not the proper court or when the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change. Defendants argue that the proper venue is San Bernardino County, according to the lease agreement. The court takes judicial notice that the city of Ontario is in San Bernardino County, and the contract was entered and to be performed there. Thus, San Bernardino County is a proper venue, and the venue selection clause in the parties' contract is valid.
