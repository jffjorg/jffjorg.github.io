Plaintiff Brian Neman alleges that in April 2017, he entered into a written agreement with Defendants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi to buy a commercial building for $1,000,000. (FAC ¶9.) Although Plaintiff delivered $1,000,000, Defendants failed to deliver the property by the promised date and refused to return the funds according to the agreement. (FAC ¶¶10-14.) PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed his Complaint.On April 3, 2019, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).On September 25, 2019, Defendants answered.On October 3, 2019, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff.On November 12, 2020, Cross-Defendant answered the Cross-Complaint.On March 14, 2022, Cross-Complainants filed an amended Cross-Complaint naming Jorge Yamzon, Albert Arana, and Commercial Real Estate Brokerage, Inc. dba Remax Commercial & Investment Realty as Roes 1-3.On March 30, 2022, Cross-Complainants filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint. (“FAXC”).On May 23, 2022, Commercial Real Estate Brokerage, Inc. answered the Cross-Complaint.On June 20, 2022, Cross-Complainants filed an amended Cross-Complaint naming Ausencio Rene Luna dba VIP Real Estate Firm as Roe 4.On September 20, 2022, Cross-Complainants filed an amended Cross-Complaint naming EP2 Ontario Inc. as Roe 5.On November 1, 2022, Jorge Yamzon and EP2 Ontario Inc. answered the Cross-Complaint.On January 13, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed an amended Cross-Complaint naming VIP ENT Inc. and Alfonso Guerrero as Roes 6-7.On June 15, 2023, VIP ENT Inc. answered the Cross-Complaint.On August 28, 2023, Cross-Complainants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi filed the instant motion to compel VIP ENT, Inc. to respond to Form Interrogatories.On August 29, 2023, Brian Neman was dismissed from this action.DISCUSSION Cross-Complainants move for orders compelling VIP ENT, Inc. to respond to form interrogatories and imposing sanctions. Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.260, subd. (a).)If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified, objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any response within the statutory time period.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.)Here, Cross-Complainant’s counsel served VIP ENT, Inc. (“VIP”) with the first set of form interrogatories on July 14, 2023 by emailing the requests to VIP’s counsel, Marcus Gomez. (Kohrs Decl., ¶2.) Gomez has not responded to an email in two months and does not return phone calls. (Id., ¶3.) VIP has not served responses. (Motion, p.3.) Because VIP failed to file any response to Cross-Complainant’s form interrogatories, the motion is granted.                                                     Cross-Complainants’ requests that sanctions in the amount of $2,491 be imposed against VIP’s Counsel of Record. Since the motion is unopposed, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $760 for two hours of attorney time and filing fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 2023.010 and 2023.030, as well as CRC 3.1348.DATED: September 26, 2023 ____________________________ Hon.
