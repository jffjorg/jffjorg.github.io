However, the judge denies CRI's motion to compel all communications between Dillon and Golovacheva, finding it too broad.

The judge declines to impose sanctions on either party, suggesting they could have resolved the issues through more productive communication.  The ruling encourages both parties to avoid similar situations in the future.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.

The Court orders SNI to provide supplemental responses to requests for production numbers 16 and 17, and to provide a privilege log if necessary. The Court also orders Dillon to provide supplemental responses to requests for production numbers 18, 19, 21, 22, and 23, and to provide a privilege log if necessary.

The Court declines to award sanctions to either party. The Court notes that the parties should have been able to resolve their disputes between themselves, and that the Court does not expect to see similar motions in the future.

The ruling is based on the Plaintiff's allegations that SNI and Dillon failed to provide complete and responsive answers to the requests for production, and that the requests are relevant and necessary to the Plaintiff's claims. The Court finds that the requests are not unduly burdensome or overbroad, and that the defendants have not shown good cause for failing to provide the requested documents.

The ruling is a tentative one, and the parties have five court days to object and request a hearing.
