And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.

The Court orders SNI to provide supplemental responses to requests for production numbers 16 and 17, and to provide a privilege log if necessary. The Court also orders Dillon to provide supplemental responses to requests for production numbers 18, 19, 21, 22, and 23, and to provide a privilege log if necessary.

The Court declines to award sanctions to either party. The Court notes that the parties should have been able to resolve their disputes between themselves, and that the Court does not expect to see similar motions in the future.

The ruling is based on the Plaintiff's allegations that SNI and Dillon failed to provide complete and responsive answers to the requests for production, and that the requests are relevant and necessary to the Plaintiff's claims. The Court finds that the requests are not unduly burdensome or overbroad, and that the defendants have not shown good cause for failing to provide the requested documents.

The ruling is a tentative one, and the parties have five court days to object and request a hearing.

## Case Summary:  Creative Resonance, Inc. v. Sound Nutrition, Inc.

**Case Number:** 21STCV40546
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 78

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Creative Resonance, Inc. (CRI)
* **Defendants:** 
    * Sound Nutrition, Inc. (SNI)
    * Sound (ABC), LLC
    * Don Dillon
    * Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (law firm)
    * Robert Kornegay
    * Zachary Myers (including Does 1-10)

**Case Background:**

This lawsuit involves allegations of breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent misrepresentation, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy. 

Roberto Capodieci, a food scientist, developed patents for food processing and assigned them to CRI. He later co-founded SNI with Don Dillon, promising $1.5 million to CRI in exchange for the patents. The agreement stipulated that CRI would transfer a tenth patent once SNI reached $5 million in sales.

CRI alleges that Dillon and Wilson Sonsini, the law firm Dillon recommended, fraudulently induced Capodieci to sign the agreement. They claim SNI failed to disclose UCC-1 filings for transferred assets and listed CRI's $1.5 million debt as a liability.  SNI ultimately transferred its assets to Sound ABC, a company solely owned by Dillon, and to Treadstone, another entity owned by Dillon, effectively leaving CRI without any recourse.

**Procedural History:**

* **November 3, 2021:** CRI filed the Complaint.
* **November 29, 2021:** CRI filed a First Amended Complaint.
* **January 26, 2022:** Wilson Sonsini filed its Answer.
* **March 22, 2022:** SNI filed its Answer.
* **May 27, 2022:** CRI filed a Second Amended Complaint.
* **September 27, 2022:** CRI dismissed its fourth cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation against Kornegay and Myers.
* **January 13, 2023:** CRI filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC).
* **February 15, 2023:** SNI, Sound ABC, and Wilson Sonsini filed Answers.
* **June 22, 2023:** CRI filed motions to compel further responses to Requests for Production (Set Two).

**Court Ruling:**

* **GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART:**  CRI's motions to compel further responses from both SNI and Dillon. 

**Specific Findings:**

* **SNI:** Ordered to provide supplemental responses to Requests Nos. 16 and 17 (communications between SNI and Anastasiia Golovacheva, an SNI employee, regarding CRI and Capodieci) and a privilege log if needed. Request No. 15 (all communications between Golovacheva and anyone at SNI related to SNI) was denied as overly broad.
* **Dillon:** Ordered to provide supplemental responses to Requests Nos. 21, 22, and 23 (documents related to the formation and operations of Sound Foods, a company Dillon is connected to) and a privilege log if needed. Request Nos. 18 and 19 were denied. Request No. 20 was also denied as overly broad.

**Sanctions:**

* Declined by the Court due to the parties' partial successes and the belief that the issues could have been resolved through further communication.

**Case Number:** 21STCV40546

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**People-Names:** Roberto Capodieci, Don Dillon, Anastasiia Golovacheva, Robert Kornegay, Zachary Myers

**Company-Names:** Creative Resonance, Inc. (CRI), Sound Nutrition, Inc. (SNI), Sound (ABC), LLC, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Armanino, LLP, Treadtone Capital Trust

**Places:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 78

**Dates:** November 3, 2021 - September 26, 2023

**Events:** Plaintiff Creative Resonance, Inc. (CRI) filed a complaint against Defendants Sound Nutrition, Inc. (SNI), Sound (ABC), LLC, Don Dillon, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Robert Kornegay, and Zachary Myers for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent misrepresentation, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy. The dispute arises from Defendants' failure to pay $1.5 million to CRI for the transfer of patents.

**Money:** $1.5 million

**Acts:** Defendants SNI, Dillon, and Wilson Sonsini fraudulently induced CRI to transfer patents. SNI failed to list the $1.5 million owed to CRI as a liability in financial statements. SNI made a general assignment of all its assets to Sound (ABC), LLC, which exists solely to liquidate SNI's assets and distribute the proceeds to Dillon.

**Intentions:** Plaintiff seeks to compel Defendants SNI and Dillon to provide further responses to Requests for Production (Set Two).

**Facts:** CRI transferred nine patents to SNI and would transfer a tenth patent once SNI achieved $5 million in gross sales. CRI relied on Dillon and Wilson Sonsini to draft agreements consistent with Dillon's promise to pay $1.5 million to CRI. Wilson Sonsini failed to inform CRI whether the firm had filed UCC-1 filings for the assets transferred to SNI.

**Disputes:** Plaintiff alleges that SNI and Dillon have not provided complete or adequate responses to Requests for Production (Set Two).

**Laws:** Code of Civil Procedure, section 2031.310

**Significant Statements:** The Court granted Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendants SNI and Dillon to provide further responses to specific Request for Production (Set Two) numbers. The Court did not award sanctions to either party and encouraged the parties to resolve matters between themselves in the future.
