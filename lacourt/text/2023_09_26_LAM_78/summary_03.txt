And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant, Don Dillon, and another defendant, Sound Nutrition, Inc., to provide further responses to certain requests for production.

The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The defendant, Sound Nutrition, Inc., is ordered to provide supplemental responses to certain requests for production, including requests related to communications between the company and its former executive assistant, Anastasiia Golovacheva. The defendant, Don Dillon, is also ordered to provide supplemental responses to certain requests for production, including requests related to the formation of a new company, Sound Foods.

The judge declines to award sanctions in this case, finding that both parties acted reasonably in making and opposing the motion. The judge notes, however, that the parties may have been able to resolve their disputes through meet and confer discussions rather than filing motions.
