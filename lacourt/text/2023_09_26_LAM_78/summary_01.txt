And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by cross-complainants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi to compel cross-defendant VIP ENT Inc. to respond to form interrogatories. VIP ENT Inc. has failed to serve a timely response to the interrogatories, and the judge has ordered the company to serve verified responses without objections within 10 days after the date of this order. The judge has also granted a request for sanctions against VIP ENT Inc.'s counsel, imposing sanctions in the amount of $760 for two hours of attorney time and filing fees. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260 and 2030.290, which govern the service of interrogatories and the imposition of sanctions for failure to respond. The judge has also cited two California court cases, Leach v. Superior Court and Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court, to support its ruling.
