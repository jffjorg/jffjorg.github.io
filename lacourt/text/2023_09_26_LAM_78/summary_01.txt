The tentative ruling, written by Judge Jill Feeney, grants the motion to compel VIP ENT Inc. to respond to form interrogatories and imposes sanctions in the amount of $760 against VIP ENT Inc.'s counsel. The case involves a breach of contract dispute between Plaintiff Brian Neman and Defendants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi, who failed to deliver a commercial building and refused to return the purchase price of $1,000,000.
