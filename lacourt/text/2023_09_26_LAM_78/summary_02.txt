The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named:  "llama3-8b-8192":
Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 21STCV24826
* Hearing Date: September 26, 2023
* Department: 78 Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 78

**Parties**

* Plaintiffs: STEVEN ALEXANDER LITTAUA, et al.
* Defendants: STEPHEN TRISTAN COPEN, et al., including Naghmeh Makhani and 611 Gayley Avenue, Los Angeles 90024

**Background**

* Plaintiffs brought an action for unlawful entry, wrongful eviction, constructive eviction, tenant harassment, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, false imprisonment, private nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unlawful retention of security deposit, and unfair competition.
* The lawsuit arose from Defendants' allegedly illegal eviction of Plaintiffs from their apartment at 611 Gayley Avenue, Los Angeles 90024.

**Ruling**

* **Motion for Pretrial Discovery of Defendants' Financial Condition**: GRANTED
	+ The court finds that Plaintiffs have established a substantial probability of prevailing on their claim for punitive damages against Defendant Copen, and therefore, the discovery is permitted.
* **Motion for Protective Order**: DENIED
	+ The court finds that Plaintiffs' discovery requests are not improper or overbroad, and therefore, the protective order is denied.
* **Sanctions**: DENIED
	+ The court finds that Defendants were substantially justified in filing the motion for a protective order, and therefore, sanctions are denied.

**Findings**

* Defendant Copen's conduct, including forcibly evicting Plaintiffs from their unit, constitutes malice sufficient to support a demand for punitive damages.
* Defendant Makhani's conduct, including preventing Littaua from returning to his home and locking him in a bathroom, constitutes malicious conduct sufficient to support a demand for punitive damages.
* 611 Gayley Avenue, Los Angeles 90024, is liable for Copen's and Makhani's actions.

**Orders**

* Plaintiffs' motion for orders permitting pretrial discovery of Defendants' financial condition is granted.
* Defendant's motion for a protective order is denied.
