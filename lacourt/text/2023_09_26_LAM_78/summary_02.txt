The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for financial discovery of the defendants' financial condition, finding that it is very likely that the plaintiffs will prevail at trial on a claim for punitive damages against the defendants. The judge has denied the defendants' motion for a protective order, finding that the defendants have not shown good cause to justify the relief sought.

The judge has also granted the plaintiffs' motion to permit pretrial discovery of the defendants' financial condition, finding that the plaintiffs have established a substantial probability that they will prevail on their claim for punitive damages.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for sanctions, finding that the defendants were substantially justified in filing the motion.
