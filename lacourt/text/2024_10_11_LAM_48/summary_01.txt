And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the motion to quash service of summons filed by Respondent Joel Haggin. The motion claimed that Respondent was not served, did not appear in the action, and never received proper notice. However, the judge finds that Respondent appeared at a previous hearing on October 3, 2023, and agreed to arbitration, making it clear that Respondent has made a general appearance and is subject to the Court's jurisdiction. The judge concludes that there is no merit to Respondent's argument and denies the motion to quash.
