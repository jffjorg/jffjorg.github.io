  CASE NO.: 23STCP02068
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO
  QUASH 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 11, 2024



 
On June 27, 2024, Respondent
Joel Haggin filed a motion to quash service of summons.  Petitioner Dr. Roy Lubit (derivatively on
behalf of 7760 Romaine, LLC and 1159 Formosa, LLC) filed an ex parte application
to advance the date of the hearing on the motion.  On October 7, 2024, the Court granted the ex
parte application and advanced the hearing on the motion to quash to October
11, 2024.  Defendant did not appear at
the October 7, 2024 ex parte hearing.
The
motion contends that Respondent “was not served, has not appeared in this
action and never received proper notice.  He is not subject to the arbitration panel.”  That is incorrect.  Joel Haggin appeared at the October 3, 2023
hearing on Petitioner’s petition to compel arbitration.  At that hearing, “[t]he parties represent[ed]
to the Court that they agree to arbitration.” 
(Oct. 3, 2023 Minute Order.)
Joel
Haggin has made a general appearance. 
There is no merit to any argument that he was never served and that the
Court lacks jurisdiction over him.
The
motion to quash is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all
parties in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the
Court are required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management
Conference) is also on calendar.
