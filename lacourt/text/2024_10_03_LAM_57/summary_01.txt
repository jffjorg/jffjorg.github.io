And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions for summary judgment filed by the plaintiffs, Eastwood International Logistics and Shanghai Yuda Logistics, against the defendant, DB Shipping. The plaintiffs had argued that there were no disputed issues of material fact on their claims, but the defendant presented a declaration from its owner, Dennis Wang, which raised triable issues about whether the "account stated" between the parties was the result of fraud and whether the person who executed a settlement agreement on behalf of the defendant had the authority to do so. The judge found that the defendant had carried its burden of showing the existence of disputed issues of material fact and therefore denied the motions for summary judgment. The judge also overruled the plaintiffs' objections to the defendant's declaration and did not consider the defendant's late-filed oppositions, which diverged from the initial oppositions.
