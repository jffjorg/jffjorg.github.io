Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber denies Defendant WARF Productions, LLC's motion to deem the truth of matters in Requests for Admissions propounded to Plaintiff RESPECT THE SHOOTER, LLC and to Cross-Defendant Mansour Bennouna. The motion is denied because Defendant failed to pay additional filing fees and because the responses to the Requests for Admissions were provided after the deadline and consisted only of objections. The Judge also notes that combining multiple motions into one motion is improper and unfair, as it manipulates the Court's reservation system and deprives the Court of filing fees. As a result, the motion is denied, and Defendant is ordered to pay an additional $60 in filing fees within 5 days of the date of this order.
