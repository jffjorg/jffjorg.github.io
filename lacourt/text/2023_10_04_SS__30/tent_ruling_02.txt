 Case Number:  19STCV29124    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  30 BEHZAD PILTAN vs FARZANEH GOHARCHIANMotion to Disqualify CounselTentative:  Plaintiff’s Motion is DENIED. Moving party is ordered to give notice.Discussion:  Disqualification is the proper remedy when unmitigable damage is caused by dissemination and use of  protected or privileged information. (See Rico v. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 807, 819.)  Disqualification is a drastic course of action. It should only occur where the misconduct will have a "continuing effect" on the judicial proceedings.  In the case at bar, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing that misconduct occurred.  Even if misconduct has occurred as alleged by Plaintiff, the Court does not find that it will have a continuing effect on the judicial proceedings. Sheller v. Sup. Ct. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1697, 1711.
