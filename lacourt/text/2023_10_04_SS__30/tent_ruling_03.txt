The request for sanctions is granted. Each Plaintiff is ordered to pay a monetary sanction in the amount of $361.65 to Defendant, within 30 days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.Discussion:  Defendants’ counsel testifies that he sent a deposition notice to Plaintiff Gabriella Nateras and Plaintiff Kelly Vitale on June 19, 2023, setting a deposition for July 25, 2023. (Martin Decl., ¶23.) On or about July 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s attorney advised that the Plaintiffs would be unable to appear. (Id., ¶25.)  The Court finds that this is not a valid objection. Thus, Plaintiff has waived any objections. The evidence shows that Plaintiff did not appear despite a proper deposition notice. Defendant’s motions are granted.Sanctions are mandatory in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Here, the Court does not find that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in failing to appear for the deposition. The Court awards $361.65 in sanctions for two hours of attorney time at a rate of $150 per hour plus $61.65 in filing fees, for each motion.
