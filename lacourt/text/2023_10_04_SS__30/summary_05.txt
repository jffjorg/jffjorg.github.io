And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from October 24, 2023 to February 20, 2024. The defendant's motion was based on the fact that the plaintiffs have refused to respond to written discovery, and motions for terminating sanctions are pending. The court will hold a trial setting conference in early December to consider the rulings on the terminating sanctions. The judicial assistant is to calendar a date for the conference, and the moving party is to give notice.
