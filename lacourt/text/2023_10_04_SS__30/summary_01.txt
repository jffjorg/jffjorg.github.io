The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the expedited petition to approve a compromise. The petition, filed on behalf of Scarlet Galvan, has been continued due to several deficiencies. The petition must be corrected to include a doctor's report with a diagnosis of the claimant's injuries or prognosis for recovery, as well as a report of the claimant's current condition. Additionally, the petition must correct an incorrect figure for total medical expenses paid and clarify where the remaining balance of settlement will be placed, as it cannot be placed in a trust. The Judicial Assistant will file a calendar of the hearing within 60 days, and the moving party will be notified.
