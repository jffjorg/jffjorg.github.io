The ruling continues the hearing because the petition contains several deficiencies:

1. The box in Item 18b was incorrectly checked.
2. A doctor's report is missing, which should include a diagnosis of the claimant's injuries, prognosis, and current condition.
3. Item 13(a) contains an incorrect figure for "total medical expenses paid."
4. The petition states that the settlement proceeds will be placed in a trust, which is prohibited for expedited minor compromises.
