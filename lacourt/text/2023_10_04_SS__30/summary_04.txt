## English Summary 

The judge has reviewed a motion filed by Defendant SHIRIN TOWFIGH, M.D. to postpone (abate) the current case, citing a related lawsuit against different parties (Davol, Inc. and C.R. Bard, Inc.) in California. 

The judge determined that the two lawsuits are not closely enough related to warrant postponing the current case. Specifically, the judge highlighted that the parties involved and the specific legal claims made are different in each case.  Therefore, the judge denied the motion to abate. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the ruling!

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to abate the action. The defendant argued that the rule of another action pending should apply, citing a complaint in another action that names the same parties as this action. However, the judge found that the causes of action differ between the two actions, and therefore a judgment in the earlier action would not become res judicata in this later action. The judge relied on the California Court of Appeal's decision in Bush v. Super. Ct. (1991) 10 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1384. The defendant is to give notice of the ruling, and the motion is denied.
