And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to abate the action. The defendant's motion was based on a complaint in another action, but the judge ruled that the same parties and causes of action must be involved for a plea in abatement to apply. Since the defendants and causes of action differ in this case, the motion is denied. The judge relied on the case law of Bush v. Super. Ct. (1991) 10 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1384 to support the ruling.
