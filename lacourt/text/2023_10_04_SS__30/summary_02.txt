The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Disqualify Counsel filed by Plaintiff Behzad Piltan against Defendant Farzaneh Goharchian. The Judge has denied the Motion, stating that the Plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing that misconduct occurred and that even if misconduct did occur, it would not have a continuing effect on the judicial proceedings. The Judge references two California court cases, Rico v. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Sheller v. Sup. Ct., to support its decision. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
