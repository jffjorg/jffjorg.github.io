 Case Number:  22STCV20578    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  31 TENTATIVE   Plaintiff’s  motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records (Pitchess  Motion) is CONTINUED. Counsel for Plaintiff must serve timely notice of this  continuance on the LAPD Pitchess Motion Unit. Defendants and the Custodian of  Records may file and serve their opposition no later than 9 court days before  the continued hearing. Any additional reply by Plaintiff must be filed and  served no later than 5 court days before the hearing.   Legal Standard   There is a special two-step procedure for securing  disclosure of peace officer personnel records.  (Warrick v. Superior  Court (City of Los Angeles Police Dept.) (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1011,  1019.)  First, the party seeking disclosure must file a motion that  identifies the peace officer, the agency in possession of the records, a  description of the records, who is seeking the records, as well as time and  place of the hearing.  (Evid. Code, §1043(b)(1).)  The motion must be  accompanied by a declaration showing “good cause” for disclosure of the  records; setting forth the materiality of the records; and stating upon  reasonable belief that the governmental agency has the requested  documents.  (Evid. Code, §1043(b)(3).)    The Evidence Code §1043(b) “good cause”  declaration must be sufficiently specific “to preclude the possibility of [the  movant] simply casting about for any helpful information.”  (People v.  Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226.)  However, an attorney declaration  based upon information and belief and containing hearsay may be used to  evidence good cause in support of a Pitchess motion.  (Haggerty  v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1086.)  The moving  party need show only a “plausible factual foundation” for discovery—i.e., a  scenario of officer misconduct that might occur or could have occurred.  (Warrick,  supra, 35 Cal.4th at 1026.)  All that is required is the presentation of a  scenario that might have or could have occurred; i.e., a “relatively low  threshold.”  (Uybungco v. Superior Court (San Diego Police Dept.)  (2008) 163 Cal. App. 4th 1043, 1048; see also Blumberg v. Superior Court  (2011) 197 Cal. App. 4th 1245, 1248 (the good cause requirement of section  1043(b) “embodies a ‘relatively low threshold' for discovery’ [citation], under  which a defendant need demonstrate only ‘a logical link between the defense  proposed and the pending charge’ and describe with some specificity ‘how the  discovery being sought would support such a defense’”).)    Second, if the court finds good cause, then an in  camera hearing must be held.  (Slayton v. Sup.Ct. (Slayton) (2006)  146 Cal.App.4th 55, 61.)  After personally examining the records in  camera, the trial court shall order disclosure of peace officer personnel  records that are “relevant to the matter involved in the pending  litigation.”  (Evid. Code §1045(a); People v. Mooc, supra, 26  Cal.4th at 1226.)  If disclosure is ordered, the court must also order  that the disclosed information may not be used “for any purpose other than a  court proceeding pursuant to applicable law.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §1045(e);  see Alford v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1039–1040.)    Discussion Evidence Code section 1043(a) states: “In any case in which discovery or disclosure is sought  of peace or custodial officer personnel records or records maintained pursuant  to Section 832.5 of the Penal Code or information from those records, the party  seeking the discovery or disclosure shall file a written motion with the  appropriate court or administrative body upon written notice to the  governmental agency that has custody and control of the records, as  follows: (1) In a civil action, the written  notice shall be given at the times prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section  1005 of the Code of Civil Procedure.” In turn, Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b)  states: “all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16  court days before the hearing…. The moving and supporting papers served shall  be a copy of the papers filed or to be filed with the court. However, if the  notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the  hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if the place of mailing and  the place of address are within the State of California.”   There is no proof of  service attached to the motion showing the governmental agency that has custody  and control of the records (LADP Pitchess Motion Unit) was served with  the motion. The proof of service on the motion only shows service on  Defendants. However, in opposition, Defendant City points out that the motion  was served by mail on the LAPD Pitchess Motion Unit on September 29,  2023. (Kelleher Decl., ¶ 7.) In order to have timely  served by mail, the motion should have been served on September 28, 2023, the  latest (16 court days, plus 5 calendar days before the hearing). Plaintiff’s  counsel’s explanation that the motion was postmarked on September 28, 2023, but  due to USPS being closed after 5 p.m., it was not picked up until the next day  is irrelevant. The fact remains that the motion was not served by mail on the  LAPD Pitchess Motion Unit until September 29, 2023.    As  such, the motion must be continued.   Conclusion   Plaintiff’s  motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records (Pitchess  Motion) is CONTINUED. Counsel for Plaintiff must timely serve notice of this  continuance on the LAPD Pitchess Motion Unit. Defendants and the Custodian of  Records may file and serve their opposition no later than 9 court days before  the continued hearing. Any additional reply by Plaintiff must be filed and served  no later than 5 court days before the hearing.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice.In addition, the joint stipulation to advance the hearing on Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Exhibits from the Public Record is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Exhibits is continued to October 30, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.Clerk to give notice.
