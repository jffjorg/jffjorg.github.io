The transfer is reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including Thayer's age, financial situation, and desire to complete the proposed transaction. The transfer agreement complies with California Insurance Code section 10136 and the transfer is not contravening any applicable statute or court order. The judge also finds that Thayer understands the terms of the transfer agreement and has not waived her right to cancel the transfer. The transfer is approved, and the petition is granted.
