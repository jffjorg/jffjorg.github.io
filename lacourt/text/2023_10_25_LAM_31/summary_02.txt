**Summary**
The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and grants Defendant's demurrer with respect to the second cause of action for "Violation of the United States Constitution." The judge holds that Heck v. Humphrey (1994) 512 U.S. 477, 486-487 bars claims challenging the constitutionality of an arrest, prosecution, and eventual conviction, and that Plaintiff's second cause of action is not wholly based on a theory of wrongful conviction.
