And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the application of Bradley A. Cosman to appear as counsel pro hac vice to represent the court-appointed receiver must be continued. The reason for this is that the application does not comply with the requirements of California Rule of Court 9.40, specifically the requirement that proof of service by mail be provided to the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office. As a result, the application is continued to November 8, 2023, at 8:30 a.m., to allow counsel to file the necessary proof of service.
