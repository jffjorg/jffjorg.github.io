And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the defendant's motion to transfer, which is incorrectly styled as a motion to transfer "venue". The relief sought by the defendant is not a change in venue, but a transfer from one district to another within the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The court notes that a motion for an intra-county transfer must be filed in Department 1, in accordance with Los Angeles Superior Court local rule 2.3(b)(2) and Code of Civil Procedure section 394, subdivision (a).
