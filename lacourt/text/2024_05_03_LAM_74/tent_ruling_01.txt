  Case Number:  22STCV11417    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  74 Angel Basulto v. Antelope Valley Medical Center, et al.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Transfer Venue
 
BACKGROUND
            The court denies without
prejudice defendant’s motion to transfer, which defendant incorrectly styles as
a motion to transfer “venue.” The relief defendant seeks is not a change in
venue, but instead a transfer from one district of Los Angeles County Superior
Court to another district of Los Angeles Superior Court. (See Witkin, Cal.
Proc., § Actions 841(1), (3) and 845(4); see also Ventura Unified School
Dist. v Superior Court (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 811, 814-815). A
motion for an intra-county transfer from one district to another must be filed
in Department 1. (Compare Los Angeles Superior Court, local rule 2.3(b)(2) with
Code of Civ. Proc. 394, subd. (a).)
