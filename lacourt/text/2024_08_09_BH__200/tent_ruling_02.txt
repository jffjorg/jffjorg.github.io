[1] The second motion for sanctions was decided by order
filed April 24, 2024 – just five days prior to the assignment of this case to
the undersigned on April 29, 2024. This bench officer had previously issued a
tentative ruling concerning the second motion in advance of the hearing on June
21, 2024 – erroneously believing it had not been decided already. That
tentative ruling is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Court raises its having
done so now because the Court’s view of this first sanctions motion is informed
by the same considerations in its prior review of this matter – and the
underlying conduct and relief overlap at least in part with what was at issue
in the second motion. 


[2] In addition, the Court takes judicial notice that
Judge Recana’s tentative ruling on this first motion was to deny it.
