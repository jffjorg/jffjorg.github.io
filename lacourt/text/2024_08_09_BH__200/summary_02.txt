The Judge's tentative ruling is related to a first motion for sanctions, which was decided by order on April 24, 2024. The Judge notes that the Court had previously issued a tentative ruling concerning a second motion for sanctions, which was decided by order on the same day. The Judge takes judicial notice that Judge Recana's tentative ruling on the first motion was to deny it. The Court's view of the first sanctions motion is informed by its prior review of the matter, and the underlying conduct and relief overlap at least in part with what was at issue in the second motion.
