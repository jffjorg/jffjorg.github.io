I.INTRODUCTION 
 
On February 8, 2022, Plaintiff Svetlana Dreyfuss
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Spire Hospitality, LLC, AWH
Burbank Hotel, LLC, Los Angeles Marriot Burbank, Los Angeles Marriot Airport
Hotel, Grill Concepts Management, Inc., The Daily Grill Burbank, and Does 1
through 100 alleging two causes of action for (1) General Negligence and (2) Premise
Liability. Plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell while at the premises
located at 2500 N. Hollywood Way. Burbank, CA 91505. 
 
On December 13, 2022, Defendant Grill Concepts
Management, Inc., dba The Daily Grill Burbank, erroneously sued as Grill Concepts
Management, Inc and The Daily Grill Burbank, (“Defendant”) filed an Answer. 
 
On May 2, 2023, Defendant filed three Motions to
Compel, one related to form interrogatories, one to special interrogatories and
one to requests for production of documents. As of January 26, 2024, no
oppositions had been filed, but Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration on
January 24, 2024, indicating that he spoke with Plaintiff on January 23, 2024,
and she intends to provide immediate responses to the propounded discovery
without objection. Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
on January 25, 2024.
 
The Motions to Compel all involve the same legal
principles, which the Court will address here only in reference to the interrogatories,
but which apply equally to the requests for production of documents.
 
                
II.LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ The statute contains no time limit for a motion
to compel where no responses have been served.¿ All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served.¿ (Leach v.
Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)¿Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿  
 
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subd. (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . .
. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿ 
 
Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel
responses to interrogatories against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
             
III.DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant moves to compel
Plaintiff to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Defendant propounded Form
Interrogatories on Plaintiff on December 12, 2022. (Abbasi Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s
counsel office stated they were having difficulty with email, February 15, 2023
was agreed to as the date of service for the previously propounded discovery. (Id., ¶ 5.) No responses were received on
March 17, 2023; Defendant followed up with a meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶ 6.) As of April 25, 2023, no
responses have been provided. (Id.,
¶7.) Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that they have been contacted Plaintiff on
January 23, 2024, and will provide verified, objection free responses “immediately.”
(Fink Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
Defendant is entitled to responses. Plaintiff has failed to
provide responses to the Form Interrogatories that were served on December 12,
2022, and again on February 15, 2023. As stated above, under CCP §§ 2030.290,
when a party fails to provide responses to timely propounded discovery, a party
may move for an order compelling responses. 
 
Defendant requests sanctions of $1,005.00 to cover 5.4 hours
of attorney time at $175.00 per hour and a $60.00 filing fee for each of the three
discovery motions.  Given
the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses,
and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions,
three in this matter, the Court sets sanctions in the total reasonable amount
of $1,180, 
 
             
IV.CONCLUSION 
 
Defendant’s Motions to Compel Responses are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is to provide responses to Plaintiff’s
form interrogatories, special interrogatories and requests for production
within 20 days of this ruling.  Plaintiff
is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,180 to Defendant’s counsel within 20 days of
this ruling.

matter, you should assume that others might appear at the hearing to

hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final
order or place the motion off calendar.
