And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel Defendant Diego Eduardo Chiguil Chan's responses to Plaintiff Eun Chu Kim's first set of form interrogatories, as well as a request for monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff filed the motion on December 19, 2023, after Defendant failed to respond to the interrogatories. The Defendant opposed the motion, claiming that they had served verified responses to the interrogatories on January 18, 2024. The Court finds that the motion to compel is now moot, as verified responses were provided. However, the Court grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65, as Defendant's failure to respond to the interrogatories was a misuse of the discovery process.
