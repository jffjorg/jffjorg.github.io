And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Hussein Saleh, attorney of record for Plaintiff Maria Vega, seeking to be relieved as counsel. The motion is based on a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Judge finds that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and that the Plaintiff has sufficient time to find other counsel or plan to represent herself. The Judge intends to conditionally grant the motion, but notes that Counsel has not complied with the Court's request to file a new proposed order granting the motion. The Judge will grant the order once the proposed order is corrected.
