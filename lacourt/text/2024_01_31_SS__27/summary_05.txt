**Significant Statements**
```
- "The purpose of the statutory stay [required pursuant to section 1281.4] is to protect the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by preserving the status quo until arbitration is resolved."
- "In the absence of a stay, the continuation of the proceedings in the trial court disrupts the arbitration proceedings and can render them ineffective."
- "Lifting of the stay is not appropriate because allowing discovery to proceed against Defendant Lyft by Plaintiff Lore in this forum may subject the parties to inconsistent rulings should a discovery dispute arise."
```
Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Lore's motion to lift the stay of the action against Defendant Lyft, citing the potential for inconsistent rulings and the need to preserve the status quo. The Judge finds that lifting the stay would impede the arbitrator's jurisdiction and that discovery can be sought in the arbitration proceedings.
