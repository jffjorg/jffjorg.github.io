      CASE NO.: 21STCV31494
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept. 27
1:30 p.m.
January 31, 2024




 
 
 
 
Hussein
Saleh, attorney of record for Plaintiff, seeks to be relieved on grounds that
there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted.  (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.
Moreover, on November 20, 2023, a Notice of Change of Handling Attorney within
the same firm was filed. Trial in this matter is set for May 6, 2024, which
gives Plaintiff sufficient time to find other counsel or plan to represent
herself.  Thus, no prejudice has been
shown.   
The
Court will conditionally grant Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
Counsel has not complied with the Court’s request that Counsel file a new
proposed order granting the motion. (11-30-2023 Minute Order.) The proposed
order filed on November 30, 2023 incorrectly lists the date of the hearing as
November 6, 2023. Therefore, counsel must correct the filed order.  Upon that happening, the Court will grant the
order, to be effective upon legal notice being provide to Plaintiff. 
 
Dated: January 31, 2024
