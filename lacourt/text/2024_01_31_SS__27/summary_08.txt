The Judge's tentative ruling is on Defendant Kyle Amundsen's motion for leave to file a first amended answer to the complaint. The motion is granted, allowing Defendant to file an amended answer within 20 days. The amended answer will include an additional affirmative defense, specifically Civil Code section 3333.4(a)(2), (3), which allows Defendant to assert all possible defenses to the action. The Judge notes that the trial date has been continued to April 23, 2024, and that the opposition to the motion was never filed. The Judge also observes that Defendant is only adding one affirmative defense and that Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The ruling is subject to change if other parties submit opposition or appear at the hearing.
