I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
is an action arising from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on December
7, 2021. On February 6, 2023, Plaintiff Eun Chu Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Diego Eduardo Chiguil Chan (“Defendant”) and DOES
1 to 20, alleging a single cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
On
July 7, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint. 
On
December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion to compel
Defendant’s responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s first set of form
interrogatories (the “Motion”).[1]
Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions “against Defendant in the amount of
$2,061.65 if [the] motion is opposed or $1,061.65 if [the] motion is
unopposed.” (Motion, 2:6-8.)  
On
January 18, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the Motion, to which
Plaintiff replied on January 25, 2024. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
“Within 30 days after service of
interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall
serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on
motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response,
or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for
response.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.260, subd. (a).) “If the party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party
to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) “The party propounding
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  
On motion, a party may be relieved from
its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides
that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.  Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery process includes
making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a
motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction
against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney
advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a). A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771.)
III.    DISCUSSION  
          Plaintiff’s
counsel, Howard B. Kim (“Kim”), declares that on August 9, 2023, he
electronically served Plaintiff’s first set of form interrogatories on
Defendant. (Kim Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit 1.) Plaintiff’s counsel granted defense
counsel a two-week extension to respond to such discovery, which extended the
response date to September 22, 2023. (Id., ¶ 3; Exhibit 2.) Counsel
declares that no responses to the discovery have been received. (Id., ¶
4.) 
          In
support of the opposition, Defendant’s counsel, M. Reza Lajevardi, Esq.
(“Lajevardi”), declares that Defendant served verified responses to Plaintiff’s
form interrogatories on January 18, 2024 (Lajevardi Decl., ¶ 3; Exhibit B.) Counsel
declares that there is a “high caseload of over eighty cases due to high
turnover and management changes at [counsel’s] firm.” (Id., ¶ 5.) 
          In
support of the reply, Kim declares that Defendant served verified responses to
Plaintiff’s first set of form interrogatories on January 18, 2024. (Kim Reply
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
          Analysis
          Because
verified responses were provided to the interrogatories that are the subject of
Plaintiff’s motion to compel, that issue is now moot. [2]
 
          The
issue of sanctions, however, is still appropriate to be addressed.  In this regard, because Defendant failed to provide
timely interrogatory responses, Plaintiff had to file a motion to compel.  Under these circumstances, sanctions are appropriate.  (See CCP section 2023.030; California
Rule of Court 3.1384).   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65. 

IV.     CONCLUSION
         The court finds the motion to compel moot and GRANTS the request
for sanctions in the amount of $1061.65, to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel
within 20 days of the date of notice of this order. 
 

Moving party is ordered to give notice.
