And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motions to set aside the defaults entered against Poke Pub Corp and June Choe are granted. The Plaintiff, Alejandro Diaz, filed a complaint alleging that the defendants violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act by not providing wheelchair-accessible outdoor dining tables at their restaurant in Long Beach, CA. The Plaintiff failed to serve the defendants with the summons and complaint, and default was entered against them. The defendants, Poke Pub Corp and June Choe, moved to set aside the default, claiming that they were not served with the summons and complaint. The Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to make reasonable attempts to serve the defendants, and that the person who allegedly served the defendants was not authorized to do so. Therefore, the Judge granted the motions to set aside the default, and ordered the defendants to serve and file their answers within 10 days of the ruling.
