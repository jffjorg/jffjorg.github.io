[1] On December
14, 2023, the parties signed and filed a stipulation and order to shorten the
notice period to 45 days, which the Court signed. (Stipulation and Order
(12/14/23); see McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112,
114 [absent consent of the parties, courts may not shorten notice period for
summary judgment motions].) 


[2] On April 4, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue the hearing on the motion for
summary judgment from April 11, 2024 to April 23, 2024. (Minute Order (4/4/24);
see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3) [hearing on motion must be heard
at least 30 days before trial, “unless the Court for good cause orders
otherwise.”])


[3] Plaintiff’s
opposition states Plaintiff is responsible for the common area, but the Court
infers this was a typo and that Plaintiff meant Defendant. (Opp., 3:22-24.)
