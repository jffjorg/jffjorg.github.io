And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling considers a stipulation and order signed on December 14, 2023, which shortened the notice period for a motion for summary judgment. The judge also granted an ex parte application to continue the hearing on the motion from April 11, 2024 to April 23, 2024. The plaintiff's opposition states that the plaintiff is responsible for the common area, but the judge infers that this was a typo and that the plaintiff meant the defendant. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 437c, subdivision (a)(3), which requires hearings on motions for summary judgment to be held at least 30 days before trial, unless the court orders otherwise. The judge also cites McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112, which holds that absent consent of the parties, courts may not shorten the notice period for summary judgment motions.
