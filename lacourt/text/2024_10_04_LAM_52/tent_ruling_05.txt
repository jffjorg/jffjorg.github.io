 Case Number:  24STCV19760    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative
Ruling: 
            Defendants’ Motion to Strike
Portions of Complaint
Defendants Robert Artura, Building Worx,
Inc., and Luxe Home Design, Inc. move to strike several portions of the
complaint by plaintiffs Danny Izumi and Mariko Izumi.
Defendants move to
strike the targeted portions of the complaint on the basis that plaintiffs do
not allege sufficient facts to support punitive damages.  Courts may strike allegations related to
punitive damages where the facts alleged “do not rise to the level of malice,
oppression or fraud necessary” to recover punitive damages under Civil Code
section 3294.  (Turman v. Turning Point
of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64.)  
Plaintiffs allege
sufficient facts to recover punitive damages. 
They allege they hired Robert Artura’s company, Building Worx, Inc. to
do a home improvement project.  (Comp.,
¶¶ 14, 16.)  Plaintiffs agreed to pay
Building Worx, Inc. a percentage of the project’s cost as a “Contractor’s Fee.”  (¶¶ 18-19.) 
They allege Artura “sought to have bills from subcontractors inflated so
that the subcontractors would work on Artura’s properties for free or at a
reduced cost.”  (¶ 48.)  Artura allegedly did this to “ ‘mark-up’ the
services provided by those subcontractors.” 
(¶ 49.)  Plaintiffs allege they
“relied on the fraudulent billing submitted.” 
(¶ 52.)  A reasonable trier of
fact could conclude these facts constitute fraud as required for punitive
damages under Civil Code section 3294.    
Defendants argue
the plaintiffs do not allege facts “demonstrating” the fraudulent billing or
intent to defraud.  (Motion, p. 4.)  “The plaintiff is required to plead only
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts.” 
(C. W. Johnson & Sons, Inc. v.
Carpenter (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 165, 169.)  
Regarding
“fraudulent billing” (Comp., ¶ 52), the facts discussed above explain the basis
for that characterization.  Plaintiffs
allege Artura artificially increased the subcontractors’ bills for the project
so that his company would get paid more for its Contractor’s Fee.  (¶¶ 18-19, 47-51.)  Furthermore, Artura allegedly got the
subcontractors to provide a kickback to him in the form of “work on Artura’s
properties for free or at a reduced cost.” 
(¶ 48.)    
As for intent, plaintiffs
need not allege additional facts “demonstrating” it.  Intent is an allegation of ultimate
fact.  (Perkins v. Superior Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6; Rosin v. Superior Court (1960) 181
Cal.App.2d 486, 490.)  Moreover, for
fraud, “the only intent by a defendant necessary to prove a case of fraud is
the intent to induce reliance. 
…  [L]iability is affixed not only
where the plaintiff's reliance is intended by the defendant
but also where it is reasonably expected to occur.”  (Lovejoy v. AT&T Corp. (2001)
92 Cal.App.4th 85, 93.)  One should
reasonably expect that submitting artificially inflated bills to clients will
result in the clients relying on those bills and paying more money than the services
truly cost.

Defendants Robert Artura, Building Worx,
Inc., and Luxe Home Design, Inc.’s motion to strike portions of the complaint
