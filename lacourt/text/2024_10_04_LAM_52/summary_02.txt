And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one by the defendants, Farmers Group, Inc., et al., to compel plaintiff Maureen Martinez to answer 14 deposition questions, and another by defendant Jeff Sharp to compel a deposition of Maureen Martinez. The judge rules that the defendants' motion is granted, ordering Maureen Martinez to appear for deposition within 20 days and answer the 14 questions. The judge also orders Maureen Martinez and her counsel to pay $3,500 in sanctions for unsuccessfully opposing the motion.

As for Jeff Sharp's motion, the judge rules that it is also granted, ordering Maureen Martinez to appear and testify at a deposition by Jeff Sharp within 20 days. The judge finds that Maureen Martinez's objections to the deposition questions were not justified, and that she must answer the questions and testify at the deposition.

The judge also addresses the issue of attorney-client privilege and tax return privilege, finding that Maureen Martinez's objections to certain questions were not justified and that she must answer the questions. The judge concludes that Maureen Martinez's failure to answer the deposition questions and her attempts to avoid testifying at a deposition were unreasonable and warrant the imposition of sanctions.
