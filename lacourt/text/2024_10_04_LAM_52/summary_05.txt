And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Robert Artura, Building Worx, Inc., and Luxe Home Design, Inc., have moved to strike several portions of the complaint filed by plaintiffs Danny Izumi and Mariko Izumi. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts to support punitive damages. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support punitive damages, including allegations of fraudulent billing and intent to defraud. The court concludes that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that these facts constitute fraud as required for punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294. Therefore, the defendants' motion to strike is denied, and they are ordered to answer within 20 days.
