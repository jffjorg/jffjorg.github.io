And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication brought by General Motors, LLC (defendant) against Beth Gregorian (plaintiff). The defendant is seeking to dismiss the plaintiff's claims alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and breach of implied warranty of merchantability.

The plaintiff assumed a lease of a vehicle from Joseph Sola and made lease payments to GM Financial Leasing. The lease agreement was an "as-is" condition, which means that the plaintiff accepted the vehicle in its present condition without any warranties.

The defendant argues that the plaintiff has no standing to bring the causes of action because she is not a "buyer" under the Song-Beverly Act. However, the court rejects this argument, finding that the plaintiff's assumptions of the lease from Sola and her subsequent lease payments to GM Financial Leasing establish her standing.

The defendant also argues that the subject vehicle was not a "new" vehicle, but the court concludes that it was a "new" vehicle within the meaning of Civil Code section 1793.22.

The court grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's fourth cause of action, which alleges breach of implied warranty of merchantability, because the lease agreement was an "as-is" condition.

The court denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's fifth cause of action, which alleges fraud, because the defendant has not met its burden of showing that it had no duty to disclose information to the plaintiff.

The court will continue the hearing on the motion with respect to the plaintiff's first, second, and third causes of action to February 20, 2025, and the parties may file further briefing on or before February 12, 2025.
