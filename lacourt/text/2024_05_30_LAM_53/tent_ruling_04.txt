Order
  RE:
 
plaintiff’s ex parte motion for judgment and
  interlocutory order granting plaintiff authority to sell real property
  without partition 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Robbin Oshita,
conservator of the Estate of Alvin Johnson, Jr.       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Ex Parte Motion for Judgment and
Interlocutory Order Granting Plaintiff Authority to Sell Real Property
            Plaintiff Robbin Oshita, conservator of the
Estate of Alvin Johnson, Jr., moves the court for an order (1) entering default
judgment and an interlocutory order authorizing the plaintiff to immediately
sell the subject property without the appointment of a referee, and (2) directing
that the sales proceeds of the defendants be held in escrow, post-closing,
pending plaintiff’s further allocation of expenses, costs, and attorney’s fees.

            The
court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte
order must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing
competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate
danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  The court therefore denies the relief
requested by plaintiff on an ex parte basis. 
However, the court exercises its discretion to deem plaintiff’s ex parte
application to be a request for entry of interlocutory judgment of partition by
default.  
The court sets an Order to Show Cause re entry of interlocutory
judgment of partition by default for hearing on July 1, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
It appears to the court that appointing a referee to sell the real
property at issue would be desirable and helpful in order to ensure that the
sale price of the property is maximized to ensure that all parties to the
action are treated fairly.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 873.010, subd. (a); Richmond v. Dofflemyer (1980) 105
Cal.App.3d 745, 755.) 
The court orders plaintiff Robbin Oshita, conservator of the Estate of
Alvin Johnson, Jr., to lodge with the court, no later than June 24, 2024, an
appropriate, proposed interlocutory judgment that includes, but is not limited
to, the following: (1) a determination of the interests of the parties in the real
property that is the subject of the complaint, (2) an order of partition of the
property by sale, and (3) an order that the court shall appoint a referee to sell
the property as ordered by the court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 873.010.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
872.720, subd. (a).)  
The court orders plaintiff Robbin Oshita, conservator of the Estate of
Alvin Johnson, Jr., to file a statement proposing the name and contact
information of a referee to be appointed by the court pursuant to section 837.010,
and to attach a copy of the CV or resume of the proposed referee and a
statement of the hourly rate charged for their services, no later than June 24,
2024. 
The court orders plaintiff Robbin Oshita, conservator of the Estate of
Alvin Johnson, Jr., to file a request for dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought (i.e., Doe defendants 1-20) as required by California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(7), no later than June 24,
2024.  
            The court orders that the Case
Management Conference set for September 9, 2024, is vacated.
 
 
 
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 30, 2024
