MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Dennis Herrera, on
behalf of himself, the State of California, and others similarly situated and
aggrieved        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement and Request for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and class representative Dennis Herrera, on behalf of
himself and the conditionally certified settlement class (“Plaintiff”), (1)
seeks final approval of the Class Action and PAGA Settlement Agreement (the
“Settlement Agreement”) entered into by and between Plaintiff and defendant
Signature Flight Support LLC (“Defendant”), and (2) requests that the court
award attorney’s fees in the amount of $395,280 and costs in the amount of
$13,000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  (Ardestani Decl. filed July 18, 2023 (“2023
Ardestani Decl.”), Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement.)  Plaintiff and Defendant have agreed to settle
this action for the amount of $1,185,840. 
(Ardestani Decl., ¶ 8.)
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.769, subdivision (g) provides that the court must
conduct an inquiry into the fairness of a proposed class action settlement
prior to final approval.  The trial court has broad powers to determine
whether a proposed settlement is fair.  (Mallick v. Superior Court
(1979) 89 Cal. App. 3d 434, 438.)  The standard for approval of class
settlements in California is that the settlement be fair, reasonable, and
adequate for class members overall.  (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996)
48 Cal. App. 4th 1794, 1801.)  To determine the
fairness of a settlement, the court must consider certain factors, as set forth
in Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 244-45,
disapproved by Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware, Inc. (2018) 4 Cal.5th
260 on other grounds.  “[A] presumption of fairness exists where: (1)
the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation
and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act
intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the
percentage of objectors is small.”  (Id. at p. 245.)
The court already determined, on Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary
approval of the Settlement Agreement, that the Settlement Agreement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable.  (Jan. 11, 2024
Order, p. 4:13-16.)  In addition to the
factors discussed in connection with Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary
approval, Plaintiff has presented evidence establishing that the claims
administrator has not received any objections, requests for exclusions, or
workweek disputes.  (Singh Decl., ¶ 10.)
Based on the facts set forth above, and based on the reasoning and
findings set forth in the court’s January 11, 2024 order granting preliminary
approval of the Settlement Agreement, the court finds that Plaintiff has
established that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, and
reasonable.  In light of the fact that
there are no objections to the Settlement Agreement, the court finds that it is
appropriate to approve it.  The court
further finds that the $100,000 settlement amount for the claims brought under
the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (Labor Code, § 2698, et
seq.), of which 25 percent will be paid to aggrieved employees and 75 percent
will be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, is fair, adequate,
and reasonable.  (2023 Ardestani Decl.,
Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, § 1.34; Ardestani Decl., ¶ 12.)
The court also approved
conditional certification of the class for purposes of settlement in its order
granting preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement.  (Jan. 11, 2024 Order, p. 3:10-15.)  Because Plaintiff does not contend that the
class should not be certified or that the court should reconsider its
preliminary determination, the court finds that it is appropriate to certify
the class for settlement purposes. 
(Mot., p. 4:4-5 [“Nothing has changed to require reconsideration of the
Court’s certification of the Settlement Class”]; Dunk, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1807, fn. 19 [finding
that the court may use a lesser standard to determine the appropriateness of a
settlement class for settlement purposes].)
Finally,
the court notes that Plaintiff requests the court award (1) an enhancement
award in the amount of $10,000 to Plaintiff, (2) costs in the amount of $13,500
to the claims administrator, and (3) attorney’s fees in the amount of $395,280
and costs in the amount of $13,000 to class counsel. 
The
court finds that Plaintiff’s declaration, filed in support of Plaintiff’s
motion for preliminary approval, is sufficient to establish that his requested
enhancement payment of $10,000 is fair and reasonable, and within the amount
provided for by the Settlement Agreement. 
(Herrera Decl. filed July 18, 2023, ¶¶ 4-5; 2023 Ardestani Decl., Ex. 1,
Settlement Agreement, § 3.2.1.)  The
court therefore finds it appropriate to approve the award.
The
court finds that the request for costs to be paid to the claims administrator,
CPT Group, Inc., is sufficiently supported by the declaration of Laura Singh,
and is within the amount provided for by the Settlement Agreement.  (Singh Decl., ¶ 14; 2023 Ardestani Decl., Ex.
1, Settlement Agreement, § 3.2.3.)  The
court therefore finds it appropriate to approve the award.
As
to Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees, the court finds that Plaintiff has
established (1) a lodestar figure of $307,315, and (2) facts supporting a
multiplier of 1.29.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .  The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the
community for similar work.  The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal citations
omitted].)  The primary factor for determining the fairness of fees is
“whether the fees bear a reasonable relationship to the value of the attorneys’
work.”  (Robbins v. Alibrandi (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 438,
451.)  Courts have adopted a practice of cross-checking the lodestar
against the value of the class recovery because the award is then “anchored” in
the time spent by counsel.  (Lealao v. Beneficial California, Inc. (2000)
82 Cal.App.4th 19, 45.)   
Plaintiff’s counsel attests to the education, experience, and
qualifications of the attorneys who worked on this matter.  (Ardestani Decl., ¶¶ 29-36.)  The court finds that the hourly rates charged
by the attorneys are reasonable given their education, qualifications, and
experience.  (Ibid.; Ardestani
Decl., ¶ 37 [setting forth hourly rates of counsel].)  Plaintiff’s attorneys expended 329.7 hours
litigating this case, representing fees incurred to draft pleadings, conduct
discovery, engage in mediation, and negotiate and draft settlement
documents.  (Ardestani Decl., Ex. 2
[legal time report]; Ardestani Decl., ¶¶ 28, 40.)  The court finds that these hours were
reasonably expended.  Thus, the court
finds that Plaintiff has established a lodestar figure of $307,315.  (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 40.)  The court further finds that the facts
presented in counsel’s declaration support a lodestar multiplier of
approximately 1.29.  (Ardestani Decl., ¶¶
41-44.)  
Thus, the court finds Plaintiff has supported his request for
attorney’s fees in the amount of $395,280 (representing 33.33 percent of the
gross settlement award), which is within the amount provided for by the
Settlement Agreement, and therefore finds it appropriate to approve Plaintiff’s
request for $395,280 in attorney’s fees. 
(2023 Ardestani Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, § 3.2.2.)
The court finds that the request for litigation costs in the amount of
$13,000 is sufficiently supported by the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel,
Sepideh Ardestani, and is within the amount provided for by the Settlement
Agreement.  (2023 Ardestani Decl., Ex. 1,
Settlement Agreement, § 3.2.2; Ardestani Decl., § 45.)  The court therefore finds it appropriate
to approve the award.
