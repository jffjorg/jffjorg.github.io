And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge overrules Defendant Valvoline, Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Anne Heiting's first cause of action for violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Cal. Pen. Code, § 631). The court finds that Plaintiff has pleaded facts establishing that Defendant violated Penal Code section 631, subdivision (a), by pleading facts showing that Defendant "aid[ed] ... or conspired with" InContact to engage in the allegedly wrongful acts alleged in the Complaint.

The court sustains Defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for violations of the California Unauthorized Access to Computer Data Act (Cal. Pen. Code, § 502(e)) because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Plaintiff did not allege facts establishing that she has suffered damage or loss because of the alleged violation of Penal Code section 502, subdivision (c).

The court grants Plaintiff 20 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint that cures the defects in the second cause of action. The court orders Defendant Valvoline, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
