And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's ex parte motion for judgment and interlocutory order authorizing the sale of the subject property without partition. Instead, the court deems the motion to be a request for entry of interlocutory judgment of partition by default. The court sets an Order to Show Cause re entry of interlocutory judgment of partition by default for hearing on July 1, 2024. The court also orders the plaintiff to lodge a proposed interlocutory judgment and to file a request for dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought. The court further orders the plaintiff to file a statement proposing the name and contact information of a referee to be appointed by the court. The court directs the clerk to give notice of this ruling.
