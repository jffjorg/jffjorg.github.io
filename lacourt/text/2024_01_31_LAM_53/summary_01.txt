And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Sommer Ray Beaty's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 16th cause of action for economic interference. The 16th cause of action alleges that defendant hired Eli Zoe to breach a contract with plaintiffs Anthony Aiello and Anthony's Worldwide Promotions, LLC, and that plaintiffs suffered damages from expected revenue.

The court finds that the facts alleged do not state a cause of action for economic interference, but rather a cause of action for interference with contract. However, the contract at issue was determined to be void ab initio by the Labor Commissioner, so the court finds that plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for interference with contract.

The court grants plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to allege the facts they seek to recover damages for, specifically that defendant denied them future economic benefits and took their Instagram page. The court orders defendant to give notice of this ruling and grants plaintiffs 20 days to file a First Amended Complaint that cures the defects in the 16th cause of action.
