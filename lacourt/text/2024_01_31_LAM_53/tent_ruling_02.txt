The court also notes that Plaintiffs did not allege the existence of a contract
between Plaintiffs “and a third party” and instead have alleged the
existence of a contract between Plaintiffs and Defendant.  (Winchester Mystery House, LLC, supra,
210 Cal.App.4th at p. 596 [emphasis added].) 
However, Defendant cannot be held liable for interfering with her own
contract.  (Applied Equipment Corp. v.
Litton Saudi Arabi Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 514 [“the tort cause of
action for interference with contract does not lie against a party to the
contract”].)
