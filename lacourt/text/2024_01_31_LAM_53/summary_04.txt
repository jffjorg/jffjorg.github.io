Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to vacate a default judgment entered in favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendant claimed not to have been served with the summons and complaint, but the court found that the Proof of Service established a presumption that service was properly made. The Defendant did not present evidence disputing the facts stated in the Proof of Service, and therefore did not meet his burden to show that service was not effectuated. The court concluded that the Defendant did not meet his burden to show that he is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). As a result, the court denied the motion and lifted the stay of the execution of the judgment of possession and writ of possession.
