And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to stay the civil action pending the conclusion of the criminal action against him. The defendant, Eric Bruget, is accused of grand theft by an employee or agent and seeks to stay the civil action to protect his right against self-incrimination. The court considered the factors relevant to determining whether to stay the action, including the interests of the parties, the convenience of the court, and the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation.

The court found that the defendant may be substantially burdened in defending against the civil action due to the overlap with the criminal action, and that a stay of the civil action would be in the public interest. However, the court did not grant the defendant's request to stay the action in its entirety, but instead stayed the action only as to the defendant, pending the conclusion of the criminal action.

The court also ordered a joint report to be filed by the parties regarding the status of the criminal action and a status conference to be held to discuss the stay of the action.
