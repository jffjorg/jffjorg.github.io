MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Andrew Troyan     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Santee Collection LLC
Motion to Vacate Default Judgment
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Andrew Troyan (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order
vacating the judgment for unlawful detainer by default entered in favor of plaintiff
Santee Collection LLC (“Plaintiff”) and against Defendant on December 20, 2023,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.[1]
 Defendant contends that this relief is
warranted because he was not served with the summons and complaint.  (Troyan Decl., ¶ 3.) 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his
or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. 
Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer
or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).) 
The Proof of Service of Summons filed by Plaintiff on December 13,
2023 states that the summons, complaint, and other case management documents
were served on Defendant on November 17, 2023 by posting and mailing copies
thereof pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45.  (POS-010 filed Dec. 13, 2023, ¶¶ 3, 5; Nov.
15, 2023 Application and Order to Serve Summons by Posting for Unlawful
Detainer, p. 2 [ordering that Defendant may be served by posting a copy of the
summons and complaint on the premises in a manner most likely to give actual
notice to defendant, and by immediately mailing, by certified mail, a copy of
the summons and complaint to defendant at his last known address].)  The Proof of Service is signed by a
registered process server, and therefore “‘establishes a presumption, affecting
the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return.’”  (Fernandes v. Singh (2017) 16
Cal.App.5th 932, 940 [emphasis in original]; Evid. Code, § 647].)  
The court finds that Defendant has not met his burden to produce
evidence showing that service of the summons and complaint was not effected on
him in order to rebut the presumption of the facts stated in the Proof of
Service and therefore has not shown that the court should vacate the default
judgment on the ground of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390 [“Because of the statutory presumption, defendant was
thus required to produce evidence that he was not served”]; Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
Defendant has submitted only his declaration, in which he states that
he “was not able to file an answer to the complaint [for] unlawful detainer
because [he] was not served . . . .” 
(Troyan Decl., ¶ 3.)  However,
Plaintiff was not required to personally serve the summons and complaint on
Defendant.  On November 15, 2023, the
court ordered that Plaintiff was permitted to serve Defendant by posting a copy
of the summons and complaint on the premises in a manner most likely to give
actual notice to Defendant, and by immediately mailing, by certified mail, a
copy of the summons and complaint to Defendant at his last known address.  (Nov. 15, 2023 Application and Order to Serve
Summons by Posting for Unlawful Detainer, p. 2.)  Thus, Plaintiff was required only (1) to post
the summons and complaint on the premises in a manner most likely to give
actual notice to Defendant, and (2) to have a copy of the summons and complaint
be forthwith mailed, by certified mail, to Defendant at his last known
address.  (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 415.45, subd. (b).)  Service of
the summons in the manner set forth by section 415.45 is deemed complete on the
10th day after posting and mailing.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.45, subd. (c).)  
Here, Defendant’s declaration does not rebut the facts stated in the
Proof of Service.  Specifically,
Defendant does not present evidence disputing that, on November 17, 2023, (1) the
summons and complaint were posted on the premises in a manner most likely to
give him actual notice, or (2) the summons and complaint were mailed, by
certified mail, to his last known address. 
(POS-010 filed Dec. 13, 2023, ¶ 5.) 
Defendant therefore has not presented evidence showing that service was
not effected and deemed complete as of 10 days after the posting and mailing of
the summons and complaint in the manner set forth by section 415.45.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.45, subds. (b),
(c).) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant did not meet his burden to show
that Plaintiff did not properly serve the summons and complaint on Defendant, and
therefore has not met his burden to show that he is entitled to relief pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  (Hearn
v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th
1193, 1205 [“A party seeking relief under section 473 bears the burden of
proof”].)  
The court therefore denies
Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b).) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Andrew
Troyan’s motion to vacate default judgment. 
            The court orders that (1) the stay
of the execution of the judgment of possession and writ of possession issued by
the court in its January 16, 2024 order is lifted, and (2) the judgment of
possession and writ of possession may be executed by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Office. 
            The court directs the clerk to
deliver a copy of this order to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
The court orders plaintiff Santee Collection LLC to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  January 31, 2024
