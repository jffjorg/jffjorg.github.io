BACKGROUND
            On March 20, 2024, plaintiff Janet
Patricia Martin (“Martin”), by and through her personal representative, Julie
Casarez (“Casarez”) initiated this action against defendants 24HR Homecare LLC
(“24HR Homecare”) and Krystal Alexander (“Alexander”), alleging the following
causes of action: (1) financial elder abuse; (2) conversion; (3) breach of
fiduciary duty; and (4) negligence.
            24HR Homecare now demurrers to the
entire complaint on the ground that sufficient facts have not been alleged
against it to constitute a cause of action. Plaintiff opposes. 
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            A demurrer
can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading
under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  “To survive
a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” 
(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.)  For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. 
(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966–967.)  A demurrer “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”  (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)
A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained
only where the pleading is defective on its face. (City of Atascadero v.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445,
459.) “If substantial facts which constitute a cause of action are averred in
the complaint or can be inferred by reasonable intendment from the matters
which are pleaded, although the allegations of these facts are intermingled
with conclusions of law, the complaint is not subject to demurrer for
insufficiency.” (Krug v. Meeham (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 274, 277.)

 
DISCUSSION
A.   
Vicarious Liability re: The First Through Third
Causes of Action
24HR
Homecare argues that plaintiff is unable to maintain the first through third
causes of action against it on the ground that the complaint does not
sufficiently allege that vicarious liability applies. 
“[A]n
employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within
the scope of the employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial
Hospital (1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 296.)  The nexus required for respondeat superior
liability – that the tort be engendered by or arise from the work – is to be
distinguished from “but for” causation. The fact that the employment brought
the tortfeasor and victim together in time and place is not enough. The
incident leading to injury must be an outgrowth of the employment.” (Lisa
M., supra, 12 Cal.4th at 293-294.) “The conduct of an employee falls within
the scope of his or her employment if the conduct either: (1) is required by or
incidental to the employee's duties, or (2) it is reasonably foreseeable in
light of the employer's business.” (Montague v. AMN Healthcare, Inc.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1515, 1521.)
“The
employer is liable not because the employer has control over the employee or is
in some way at fault, but because the employer's enterprise creates inevitable
risks as a part of doing business. Under this theory, an employer is liable for
‘the risks inherent in or created by the enterprise.’” (Bailey v. Filco,
Inc. (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 1552, 1559.)
As
alleged in the complaint, Alexander was employed by 24HR Homecare to provide in
home care services. (Compl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff, who was 88 years old, needed a
caregiver to provide home care services to assist in the following activities
of daily living: “bathing, dressing, feeding, exercising, personal hygiene and
grooming, transferring, ambulating, positioning, toileting and incontinence
care, assisting with medication, housekeeping, meal planning and preparation,
laundry, transportation, correspondence, making phone calls, shopping for
personal care items or groceries, and companionship.” (Id. ¶ 16.)
Plaintiff had entered into a contract with 24HR Homecare in October 2020 to
provide home care services, and these services were provided from October 5,
2020 to until Martin’s death on July 20, 2022. (Id. ¶ 14-15.) 
From May
2021 to October 2021, Alexander made 76 ATM withdrawals each in the amount of
$1,000 for her own personal use from Martin’s bank account by using Martin’s
debit card. (Id. at ¶ 16.) Also, from December 2021 to March 2022,
Alexander made 19 ATM withdrawals each in the amount of $1,000 for her own
personal use from Martin’s bank account. (Id. at ¶ 17.) It is alleged
that Alexander was acting in the course and scope of her employment when she
made these withdrawals. (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 33, 37.) Plaintiff further
alleges that the defendants conspired to defraud Martin by taking advantage of
her vulnerability. (Id. at ¶ 22.) 24HR Homecare is alleged to have
assisted in this theft by failing to: (1) implement policies and procedures on
handling a client’s funds and refusing to accept gifts, (2) train and supervise
Alexander, (3) report the criminal activity once it was discovery, and (4) by
employing Alexander. (Id. at ¶ 32.) Because Martin was completely
dependent on Defendants for all activities of daily living, defendants should
have properly trained, supervise, discipline, and/or terminate Alexander to
stop the financial elder abuse and should have known that Alexander was unfit
to serve as Martin’s caregiver. (Id. at ¶¶ 34, 37.) 
In
consideration of these allegations, the Court finds that sufficient facts have
not been alleged to support a theory of vicarious liability against 24HR
Homecare based on Alexander’s alleged thefts. While the nature of the service
agreement to provide home care services to Martin gave Alexander access to
Martin, it must be shown that “[t]he incident leading to injury [was] an
outgrowth of the employment.” (Lisa M., supra, 12 Cal.4th at 293-294.) The
complaint fails to allege that assistance with financial errands was a provided
service or that Martin was obligated to pay Alexander directly for the services
provided, which may explain why Alexander possessed Martin’s debit card.
Furthermore, the complaint alleges that the Alexander stole from Martin’s bank
accounts for her own personal use. There are no allegations to suggest that
Alexander committed the theft in the interest of 24HR Homecare. “An act serving
only the employee’s personal interest is less likely to arise from or be
engendered by the employment than an act that, even if misguided, was intended
to serve the employer in some way.” (Insurance Co. of N. Am. V. Federal
Express Corp. (9th Cir. 1999) 189 F.3d 914, 921-923.) While this particular
allegation does not completely undermine a theory of vicarious liability, it
does not help. Therefore, additional allegations are necessary to support a
theory of liability against 24HR Homecare. 
Accordingly,
because the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support a theory of
vicarious liability against 24HR Homecare, the demurrer is sustained as to the
first through third causes of action with leave to amend. In the interest of
judicial economy, the court declines to address the remaining arguments raised
against these causes of action. 
 
B.    
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligence
24HR
Homecare also demurs to the fourth cause of action for negligence on the ground
that it has not been sufficiently alleged to constitute a cause of action
against it. In particular, 24HR Homecare argues that the complaint fails to
allege that a duty exists between parties in order to have prevented Alexander
from stealing from Martin. (Demurrer at pg. 14.) 
The
elements of negligence are duty, breach, causation, and damages.  (Ladd
v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.)
In
consideration of this argument, the court is not persuaded by this argument. As
alleged in the complaint, the parties entered into a service agreement to
provide home care services. (Compl. ¶¶ 14-15.) It is further alleged that 24HR
Homecare failed to: (1) implement policies and procedures on handling a
client’s funds and refusing to accept gifts, (2) train and supervise Alexander,
(3) report the criminal activity once it was discovery, and (4) by employing
Alexander. (Id. at ¶¶ 32, 42.) Also, Alexander was alleged to be unfit
to perform home care services for elderly persons, and despite this, 24HR
Homecare employed Alexander to provide services to Martin. (Id. at ¶
42.) Effectively, based on these allegations, the fourth cause of action is a
claim for negligent hiring, supervision and retention. 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is overruled as to the fourth cause of action.

days of this order.
