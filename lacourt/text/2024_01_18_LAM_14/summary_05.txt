And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a legal malpractice case filed by Akbarnejad against Safaie, Arya Law Center PC, and Brian T. Stuart. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to pursue a civil action and intentionally dismissed the case without client consent. The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action and is uncertain. The judge ruled that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action (professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty) is overruled, but the demurrer to the third cause of action (fraud) is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The judge also granted the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint. The plaintiff has properly pled claims for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, but has not satisfied the rules of fraud pleading. The plaintiff is entitled to make one more attempt at satisfying the rules of fraud pleading.
