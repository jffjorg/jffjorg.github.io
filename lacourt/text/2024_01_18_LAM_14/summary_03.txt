And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling. The Plaintiffs had moved to compel further responses to requests for production, which the court had previously deemed moot because supplemental responses had been served. The Plaintiffs argue that the supplemental responses did not provide everything they wanted, but the court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to provide new facts or evidence that would justify a different result. The court also notes that the Plaintiffs have not disputed that a new set of responses was served after the motion was filed, which supersedes the prior set and renders the motion moot. The court further finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for their failure to produce the new evidence or different facts earlier. The court also addresses the Plaintiffs' arguments about the relevance and admissibility of "me too" evidence, finding that the court has not made a substantive ruling on that point and has not barred the discovery or admission of any such evidence. Finally, the court notes that the Plaintiffs have the option of issuing a deposition subpoena for Ms. Gopaldas, a key witness, and that the court has the power to order her appearance and impose sanctions if she fails to comply.
