  Case Number:  18STCV05452    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  14 Medex Express Caregivers v. California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Case Background
 
Plaintiff
claims its predecessors bought a marijuana business from Defendant in 2008.
Defendant went to prison for several years. When Defendant got out, Defendant
started a new business with the exact same name and using the exact same tax
certificate as the business he allegedly sold. Plaintiff, the current owner and
operator of the previous business, objects to the starting of what it considers
a copycat business.
 
On
April 12, 2021, Plaintiff (alternatively referred to as “MedX Express”) filed its
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Declaratory Relief and (2) Conversion
against Defendants Virgil Edward Grant III (“Grant”), MedX Now, Inc. (“Second
MedX”), and DOES 2-20. 
 
On
June 11, 2021, Defendants Grant and Second MedX filed their joint Answer.
 
On
February 23, 2022, this court ordered the case bifurcated, with a bench trial
on the first cause of action to precede a jury trial on the second cause of
action.
 
Bench
trial on the first cause of action proceeded from May 16-20, 2022. After
further discussion with counsel, the court issued a statement of decision on
August 16, 2022. The court found that (1) Plaintiff properly bought the entire
business from Defendant Grant, including the name, (2) Plaintiff did not buy
the tax certificate from Defendant Grant, instead opting to change the
corporate form and obtain their own tax certificate, which they now use.
 
On
December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed its verified Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
for (1) Declaratory Relief, (2) Conversion, (3) Possession of Personal
Property, (4) Replevin, (5) Unfair Competition, and (6) Larceny against
Defendants Grant, Second MedX, and DOES 2-50. 
 
On
January 17, 2023, Defendants Grant and Second MedX filed their joint Answer.
 
On
April 14, 2023, counsel agreed to waive jury on the remaining claims.
 
Bench
Trial on the remaining claims is currently set for April 8, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
Attorney Mark S. Hardiman (“Schwam”)
now seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendants Grant and Second
MedX. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED, effective upon the filing
of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Hardiman
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
served by mail at an address that was confirmed current within the past 30 days
via internet records search. 
 
            Counsel Hardiman
indicates that he and his firm wish to withdraw because their fees have not
been paid.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motion is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
order upon the client.
