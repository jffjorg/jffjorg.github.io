And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motions filed by the plaintiff to compel defendants to serve initial responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to award sanctions, are continued to February 28, 2023. The motions were not timely filed and served, and the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient notice to the defendants. The plaintiff had until December 22, 2023 to file and serve the motions, but they were served on December 26, 2023 and January 8, 2024. The judge finds that the defendants have not had sufficient statutory notice to respond and must be given that time.
