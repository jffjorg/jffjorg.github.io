And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant Horacio F. Montoya's motion for relief from the Court's November 16, 2023 order for the partition of the property located at 854-645 1/2 East 50th Street, Los Angeles, California 90011. Defendant argues that the order was wrong because of various reasons, including the need for repairs, the mortgage, and the lack of sale. However, the judge finds that these arguments are not new facts and could have been presented at the original hearing for the motion. The judge also notes that the delay in the sale of the property appears to be a result of Defendant's own conduct, not an inability to find a buyer. Therefore, the judge denies Defendant's motion.
