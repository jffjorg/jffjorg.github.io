And here is a summary in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the plaintiffs (Ibiere N. Seck and Seck Law, P.C.) against the defendant (Brian T. Dunn, A Professional Law Corporation) in a dispute over a fee sharing agreement. The defendant, Cross-Complainants, have alleged claims for fraud, conversion, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. The court has sustained the demurrer to the fifth claim (breach of fiduciary duty) without leave to amend, and to the remaining claims with leave to amend. The court has found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint do not state a cause of action for fraud, conversion, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. The court has also found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint do not plead a fiduciary duty, and that the unjust enrichment claim is not a cause of action.
