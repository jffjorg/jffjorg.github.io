Defendant Horacio F. Montoya moves for relief from the
Court’s November 16, 2023 order for the partition of the property located at
854-645 1/2 East 50th Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 (the “Property”),
which Defendant and Plaintiff Lesbia Lucrecia Montoya (“Plaintiff”) own as
joint tenants.
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff and Defendant each own a 50 percent share of the
Property as joint tenants.
 
On July 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action, stating
claims for (1) partition; (2) accounting; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; and (4)
unjust enrichment. The complaint was verified.
 
On November 16, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
for partition of the Property pursuant to the stipulation of the parties (the
“November 16 Order”). On January 24, 2024, the Court entered an interlocutory
judgment of partition of the Property and appointed Blake C. Alsbrook (the
“Referee”) as referee to complete the partition sale of the Property.
 
            On
June 28, 2024, the Court granted the Referee’s ex parte application for an
order directing the Clerk of the court to issue a writ of possession in favor
of the Referee and against Defendant and all occupants residing at the Property
(the “June 28 Order”).
 
            On
June 25, 2024, Defendant filed this motion, which is styled as an appeal and
seeks relief from the November 26 Order. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant’s motion is called in different parts of the
motion an appeal and as a motion to strike the sale of the Property. The motion
states that it seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure, section 904.1 – the
statute governing grounds for appeal – on the basis that the Court’s November
16 Order was wrong. To the Court’s knowledge, Defendant has not followed the
procedures for filing an appeal – and in any event, the Court is not able to
consider appeals of its own judgments.
 
Defendant’s motion could be characterized as a motion for
reconsideration, and the Court will consider it as such.
 
Within ten days of service of an order, a party may move for
reconsideration based on new facts, circumstances, or law. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) The moving party shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd .(a).) “[T]he party seeking reconsideration must provide not
only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Glade v. Glade (1995)
38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.) The legislative intent was to restrict motions
for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court some fact
or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason for not
offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th
1494, 1500.) 
 
“If those requirements have been met to the satisfaction of
the court but the court is not persuaded the earlier ruling was erroneous, the
proper course is to grant reconsideration and to reaffirm the earlier ruling.”
(Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)
 
“If a court at any time determines that there has been a
change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may
do so on its own motion and enter a different order.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (c).)
 
            Defendant
argues that the November 16 was wrong because (1) the property has many repairs
to be made which would increase its market value if completed; (2) the property
has a mortgage of $497,840.00, for which Defendant is solely responsible; and
(3) the property has been on the market for more than three months and has not
sold. None of these arguments provide a basis for reconsideration.
 
Knowledge of the mortgage was available to Defendant at the
time of the order – in fact, Defendant first informed the referee of the
mortgage shortly after the order and refused to provide the Referee with
financial information about it. (Alsbrook Declaration in Support of Ex Parte
Application for Writ of Possession (“Alsbrook Decl.”) ¶ 9.) The Referee also
learned shortly after his appointment that Defendant was occupying the Property
– which would give him access to knowledge of any defects in need of repair.
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 4.) Finally, the Referee has received an offer to buy the
Property. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 12.) The Referee represented in his ex parte brief
that the offer was for a purchase price of $660,000.00. (Ex Parte Application
for Writ of Possession at p. 2:19-25.) The Referee declared that it was
Defendant’s continued residence at the Property that was delaying the sale.
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
Defendant’s first two arguments could have been presented at
the original hearing for the motion, and are therefore not new facts. The delay
in the sale of the Property appears to be a result of Defendant’s own conduct,
and not a result of an inability to find a buyer.
 
The Court therefore denies Defendant’s motion.
