## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a legal dispute between Margarita Isais de Rodriguez (Plaintiff) and Utopia Management, Inc. and Rochelle Kiner (Defendants). 

Plaintiff is a former tenant who alleges that Defendants neglected dangerous conditions in the property she rented, ultimately leading to a fire that destroyed the property and her belongings. 

The court finds that Plaintiff's claim for lost wages is valid because it stems from property damage and is therefore not barred by the statute of limitations. However, the court sustains Defendants' demurrer (a formal objection to the lawsuit) regarding Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because it is time-barred.

The court also denies Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, finding that Plaintiff's allegations sufficiently support a claim that Defendants acted maliciously.

As for the English text summary, here is a brief overview of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has considered the demurrers filed by the defendants, Utopia Management, Inc. and Rochelle Kiner, and the motions to strike certain allegations in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Margarita Isais de Rodriguez, alleges that she was a tenant in the Subject Property owned and managed by the defendants, and that she was subjected to multiple substandard and dangerous conditions, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, faulty water heater, and an electrical fire that destroyed the premises and her personal belongings.

The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff's claim for lost wages is timely, as it is based on property damage rather than personal injury. However, the Judge has sustained the demurrer as to the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as it is subject to the two-year statute of limitations for personal injuries.

The Judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the allegations related to punitive damages, as the plaintiff has adequately pled malicious conduct by the defendants.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is a mixed bag, with some claims allowed to proceed and others dismissed.

**English Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants, Utopia Management, Inc. and Rochelle Kiner, in a case brought by the plaintiff, Margarita Isais de Rodriguez. The case stems from alleged negligence and substandard conditions at a property managed by the defendants where the plaintiff was a tenant, culminating in an electrical fire that destroyed her belongings.

The judge overrules the demurrer regarding the plaintiff's claim for lost wages, finding that it is based on property damage and therefore falls under the three-year statute of limitations. However, the judge sustains the demurrer regarding the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, finding it is a personal injury claim subject to a two-year statute of limitations, and denies leave to amend.

The judge denies the motion to strike the claim for loss of income, but grants the motion to strike allegations of emotional and physical distress. The motion to strike punitive damages is denied, as the judge finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged malicious conduct by the defendants.

**Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:**

The judge issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' (Utopia Management, Inc. and Rochelle Kiner) motions to dismiss parts of the lawsuit and strike certain claims brought by the plaintiff (Margarita Isais de Rodriguez), a former tenant. The judge OVERRULED the demurrer related to the plaintiff's claim for lost wages.  The judge reasoned that because the lost wages stemmed from damage to the property (the fire), the three-year statute of limitations for property damage applied, not the two-year limit for personal injury. The judge SUSTAINED the demurrer related to the plaintiff's claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED), because that is considered a personal injury and is therefore time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The judge DENIED the motion to strike the claim for lost income, for the same reason as the demurrer was overruled. The Judge GRANTED the motion to strike claims related to emotional and physical distress, consistent with the IIED ruling. The Judge DENIED the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged facts that, if proven, could show the defendants acted with malice. In summary, the plaintiff's case can proceed, but she cannot claim damages for emotional distress or physical injury, only for lost wages and property damage, and she may pursue punitive damages.

## Case Summary: Isais de Rodriguez v. Utopia Management, Inc. et al.

**Case Number**: 23STCV06861
**Hearing Date**: September 18, 2023
**Dept**: 32

**Plaintiff**: Margarita Isais de Rodriguez

**Defendant**: Utopia Management, Inc. and Rochelle Kiner

**Background**: 

* Plaintiff was a tenant in a property owned and managed by Defendants from March 2019.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendants were aware of dangerous and substandard conditions in the property, such as faulty appliances, electrical issues, and structural problems.
* Despite Plaintiff's complaints, Defendants allegedly failed to address these issues.
* In September 2020, an electrical fire caused by faulty wiring, installed by an unqualified electrician hired by Defendants, destroyed the property and Plaintiff's belongings.
* Plaintiff alleges this fire was a direct result of Defendants' negligence and failure to address previous complaints. 

**Disputes**: 

* **Statute of Limitations**: Defendants argue Plaintiff's claim for lost wages is time-barred because it is based on personal injury. The judge disagrees, finding that the claim is based on property damage and is therefore subject to a three-year statute of limitations.
* **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: Defendants argue Plaintiff's claim for emotional distress is time-barred because it is a personal injury claim. The judge agrees and sustains the demurrer to this claim without leave to amend.

**Judge's Rulings**:

* **Demurrer**: *Sustained* as to the Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claim without leave to amend. *Overruled* as to the negligence claim regarding lost wages.
* **Motion to Strike**: *Granted* as to allegations of emotional and physical distress. *Denied* as to loss of income and punitive damages. 

**Key Legal Points**:

* The statute of limitations for property damage claims is three years.
* The statute of limitations for personal injury claims is two years.
* Punitive damages may be awarded in cases of oppression, fraud, or malice.
* Loss of income based on property damage is considered a special damage.



**Note**: This is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling. The final ruling may be different. 


## English Summary

The judge is leaning towards dismissing the plaintiff's claim for emotional distress because it is considered a personal injury claim and is therefore outside the statute of limitations. However, the judge is upholding the plaintiff's claim for lost wages because it's tied to the property damage caused by the fire, which falls under a different statute of limitations.


The judge is also allowing the plaintiff to continue pursuing punitive damages because the defendant's actions appear to have been malicious. This means the plaintiff could potentially be awarded more money if they are successful in proving the defendants acted recklessly and intentionally caused harm.

**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 23STCV06861
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Dept:** 32

**Margarita Isaís de Rodríguez** (Plaintiff) v. **Utopia Management, Inc., et al.** (Defendants)

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has considered the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants and has issued the following tentative ruling.

**Demurrer**

1. **Negligence**: The demurrer is OVERRULED as to Plaintiff's claim for lost wages. The Court finds that the claim is timely under the three-year statute of limitations for property claims, as the alleged lost wages stem from the destruction of property rather than personal injury.
2. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to the seventh cause of action. The Court finds that the claim is subject to the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims and that the alleged emotional distress is a personal injury.

**Motion to Strike**

1. **Loss of Income**: The motion to strike is DENIED as to loss of income. The Court finds that the claim is properly pled and is based on property damage.
2. **Emotional and Physical Distress**: The motion to strike is GRANTED as to allegations of emotional and physical distress. The Court finds that the claim is subject to the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.
3. **Punitive Damages**: The motion to strike is DENIED as to punitive damages. The Court finds that the claim is properly pled and that the alleged malicious conduct by the defendants supports a reasonable inference that they acted in conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights and safety.

**Conclusion**

The defendants' demurrers are SUSTAINED in part without leave to amend, and the motions to strike are GRANTED in part without leave to amend.

**Next Steps**

The parties are directed to file a notice of intention to move to set aside this tentative ruling and to provide the Court with any additional arguments or evidence they may have in support of their positions.
