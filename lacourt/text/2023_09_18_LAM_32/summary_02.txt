**Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is leaning towards denying the Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion for sanctions against the Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas. The motion stems from the Defendant including the Plaintiff's real name in court filings, which Plaintiff argues violated a protective order. The Judge's tentative ruling finds that the Defendant's counsel's failure to redact the Plaintiff's name was a clerical error and not an intentional violation of the court order. The Judge also cautioned the Plaintiff against engaging in what the Judge perceived as gamesmanship, noting that the Plaintiff had narrowly avoided sanctions in a previous discovery dispute.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge tentatively DENIES the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the Defendant.  The Plaintiff, Jane Doe, had accused the Defendant, Luis Diaz Rojas, of intentionally violating a protective order by including her real name in court documents.  These documents were exhibits (proofs of service) attached to motions related to discovery.  The Defendant's lawyer stated that the inclusion of the name was an inadvertent error, as the original discovery was served *before* the protective order was issued, although the *motions* including them were filed *after*. The Judge believes the error was clerical and not intentional.  Therefore, the Judge finds that sanctions are not justified. The Judge also warns the Plaintiff against "gamesmanship," noting that the Plaintiff herself had recently avoided sanctions for failing to respond to discovery.
