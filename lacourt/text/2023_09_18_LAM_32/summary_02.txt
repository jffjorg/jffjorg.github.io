And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the Defendant. The Plaintiff seeks sanctions for the Defendant's alleged intentional violation of a court order by including the Plaintiff's real name in court filings. The Defendant claims that the inclusion of the Plaintiff's real name was an inadvertent error. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions, finding that the Defendant did not intentionally violate a court order. The Judge has also cautioned the Plaintiff against engaging in gamesmanship, pointing out that the Plaintiff narrowly avoided sanctions in the underlying discovery motions after failing to respond to discovery.
