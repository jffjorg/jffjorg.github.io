**Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is leaning towards denying the Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion for sanctions against the Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas. The motion stems from the Defendant including the Plaintiff's real name in court filings, which Plaintiff argues violated a protective order. The Judge's tentative ruling finds that the Defendant's counsel's failure to redact the Plaintiff's name was a clerical error and not an intentional violation of the court order. The Judge also cautioned the Plaintiff against engaging in what the Judge perceived as gamesmanship, noting that the Plaintiff had narrowly avoided sanctions in a previous discovery dispute.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge tentatively DENIES the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the Defendant.  The Plaintiff, Jane Doe, had accused the Defendant, Luis Diaz Rojas, of intentionally violating a protective order by including her real name in court documents.  These documents were exhibits (proofs of service) attached to motions related to discovery.  The Defendant's lawyer stated that the inclusion of the name was an inadvertent error, as the original discovery was served *before* the protective order was issued, although the *motions* including them were filed *after*. The Judge believes the error was clerical and not intentional.  Therefore, the Judge finds that sanctions are not justified. The Judge also warns the Plaintiff against "gamesmanship," noting that the Plaintiff herself had recently avoided sanctions for failing to respond to discovery.

### English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling

The Judge has made a tentative ruling regarding Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion for sanctions against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas. The case involves an alleged sexual assault, and the Plaintiff had previously failed to respond to discovery requests, narrowly avoiding sanctions. The Defendant then filed motions related to the Plaintiff's failure to respond, which included documents with the Plaintiff's real name despite a protective order. The Defendant claims this was an inadvertent mistake. The Court finds that the Defendant did not intentionally violate the protective order and thus does not warrant sanctions. Furthermore, the Court cautions the Plaintiff against engaging in gamesmanship by seeking to sanction the Defendant without evidence of intentional wrongdoing. The Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is therefore denied.

**Case Number:** 22STCV41020
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Plaintiff:** Jane Doe
**Defendant:** Luis Diaz Rojas

In December 2022, Jane Doe filed a lawsuit against Luis Diaz Rojas for alleged sexual assault. In July 2023, Rojas filed three motions due to Doe's failure to respond to discovery requests. The court ordered Doe to respond within 30 days and denied sanctions. Rojas' motions were sealed due to exhibits containing Doe's real name, despite a protective order granted in February 2023.

Doe then filed a motion for contempt and monetary sanctions, accusing Rojas of violating the court's protective order by including her real name in court filings. Doe's motion was filed on August 23, 2023, and Rojas filed his opposition on September 1, 2023.

**Legal Standard:**

* Contempt sanctions (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1209 et seq.): Disobedience of a lawful court order constitutes contempt.
* Monetary sanctions (Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5): A judicial officer can impose up to $1,500 for violation of a court order without good cause.

**Discussion:**

* The court finds that Rojas made a clerical error, not an intentional violation.
* Doe is cautioned against gamesmanship, as she narrowly avoided sanctions in the discovery motions and seeks to sanction Rojas without evidence of intentional violation.

**Conclusion:**

* Doe's motion for sanctions is denied.
