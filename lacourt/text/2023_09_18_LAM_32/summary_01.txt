And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants, Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim, in a lawsuit against Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC. The lawsuit involves breach of contract, trespass, conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The court previously entered a judgment in which the defendants were ordered to pay a total of $0 because the $34,000 of damages was completely offset by security deposit. On the cross-complaint, the cross-defendant Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC was ordered to pay $92,000 in damages, plus $19,156.10 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $111,156.10.

The defendants argue that they are the prevailing parties because they obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. However, the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of California Civil Code section 1717 because both parties partially prevailed. The court concludes that the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees is denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees. The defendants argue that they are the prevailing parties because they obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. However, the judge finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code section 1717 because both parties partially prevailed. The plaintiff successfully established a breach of contract and obtained an award of $34,000, although this award was offset. The defendants, on the other hand, obtained their own award of $92,000. The judge concludes that this is "good news and bad news as to each of the parties," and each side may "legitimately claim some success in the litigation." Therefore, the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of Section 1717, and the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees is denied.
