And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants, Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim, in a lawsuit against Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC. The lawsuit involves breach of contract, trespass, conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The court previously entered a judgment in which the defendants were ordered to pay a total of $0 because the $34,000 of damages was completely offset by security deposit. On the cross-complaint, the cross-defendant Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC was ordered to pay $92,000 in damages, plus $19,156.10 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $111,156.10.

The defendants argue that they are the prevailing parties because they obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. However, the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of California Civil Code section 1717 because both parties partially prevailed. The court concludes that the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees is denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees. The defendants argue that they are the prevailing parties because they obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. However, the judge finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code section 1717 because both parties partially prevailed. The plaintiff successfully established a breach of contract and obtained an award of $34,000, although this award was offset. The defendants, on the other hand, obtained their own award of $92,000. The judge concludes that this is "good news and bad news as to each of the parties," and each side may "legitimately claim some success in the litigation." Therefore, the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of Section 1717, and the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees is denied.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion for attorneys' fees.

summary: |
  This is a tentative ruling regarding the Defendant's/Cross-Complainant's motion for attorney's fees following a court trial. The Judge is considering whether either party "prevailed" sufficiently to warrant awarding attorney's fees based on a contract clause and California Civil Code section 1717. The Judge's current inclination is to deny the motion, finding that neither party truly "prevailed" as both achieved partial success in the litigation.

English Text Summary of Tentative Ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendants' (Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim) motion for attorney's fees.  Although the Defendants won a judgment of $111,156.10 on their cross-complaint against the Plaintiff (Crocker & Towne), the Plaintiff also successfully proved a breach of contract and was awarded $34,000 (though this was offset by the security deposit). Because both parties had some success in the litigation, the judge determined that *neither* party was the "prevailing party" under California Civil Code Section 1717, which governs the award of attorney's fees in contract disputes. The judge used case law to support the idea that when both sides win and lose on different aspects, there's often no prevailing party for fee purposes. The motion is therefore denied.
