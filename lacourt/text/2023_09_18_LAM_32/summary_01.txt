And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants, Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim, in a lawsuit against Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC. The lawsuit involves breach of contract, trespass, conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The court previously entered a judgment in which the defendants were ordered to pay a total of $0 because the $34,000 of damages was completely offset by security deposit. On the cross-complaint, the cross-defendant Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC was ordered to pay $92,000 in damages, plus $19,156.10 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $111,156.10.

The defendants argue that they are the prevailing parties because they obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. However, the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of California Civil Code section 1717 because both parties partially prevailed. The court concludes that the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees is denied.
