     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’/cross-complainants’ motion for attorneys’ fees




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff Crocker
& Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC filed this action against Defendants Ki Whan
Pak and Jennifer Kim. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on
November 18, 2021, asserting breach of contract, trespass, conversion, fraud,
and unjust enrichment. On September 3, 2021, Defendants filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff for breach of contract, unlawful retention of security
deposit, unjust enrichment, and conversion.
            The matter came on for a court trial
from May 2-4, 2023, after which the Court entered judgment: (1) for Plaintiff
Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC against Defendants Ki Whan Pak Jennifer
Kim; and (2) for Cross-Complainants Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim against Cross-Defendant
Crocker & Towne Wholesale Mart, LLC. (June 20, 2023 Judgment § 5.) On the
complaint, Defendants Pak and Kim were ordered to pay a total of $0 because the
$34,000 of damages was completely offset by security deposit. (Id., §
6(a).) On the cross-complaint, Cross-Defendant Crocker & Towne was ordered
to pay $92,000 in damages, plus $19,156.10 in prejudgment interest, for a total
of $111,156.10. (Id., § 6(c).) 
            On August 18, 2023, Defendants and
Cross-Complainants Ki Whan Pak and Jennifer Kim filed the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Crocker filed its opposition on
September 5, 2023. Defendants filed their reply on September 11, 2023.  
LEGAL STANDARD
 “In
any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she
is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Defendants move for attorneys’ fees
under Civil Code section 1717 because the leases at the center of the dispute
contain identical attorneys’ fees provisions: “If any Party or Broker brings an
action or proceeding to enforce the terms hereof or declare rights hereunder,
the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or
appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees.” (Olson Decl.,
Ex. A.) Defendants contend they are the prevailing parties because they
obtained a net monetary recovery of $111,156.10. 
Under Section 1717, “the party prevailing
on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action
on the contract. The court may also determine that there is no party prevailing
on the contract for purposes of this section.” (Civ. Code, § 1717(b)(1).) “The
prevailing party determination is to be made only upon final resolution of the
contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party
ha[s] succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.” (Mustachio
v. Great Western Bank (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1150.) Therefore, the
prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 is not necessarily
the prevailing party under Civil Code section 1717. (McLarand, Vasquez &
Partners, Inc. v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
1450, 1456.)
Under Section 1717, the Court has discretion
to find that neither party prevailed. “Typically, a determination of no
prevailing party results when both parties seek relief, but neither prevails,
or when the ostensibly prevailing party receives only a part of the relief
sought. In other words, the judgment is considered good news and bad news as to
each of the parties.” (Deane Gardenhome Assn. v. Denktas (1993) 13
Cal.App.4th 1394, 1398, internal citations omitted.) This occurs in cases where
“the opposing litigants could each legitimately claim some success in the
litigation” or where “ultimately no relief was awarded to any party.” (Hsu
v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th 863, 875.)
Here, both parties partially prevailed.
Plaintiff successfully established a breach of contract and obtained an award
of $34,000. Although this award was offset, Plaintiff still prevailed in
proving a breach of contract over Defendants’ dispute. Defendants, on the other
hand, obtained their own award of $92,000. This is “good news and bad news as
to each of the parties,” and each side may “legitimately claim some success in
the litigation.” (See Deane Gardenhome Assn., supra, 13 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1398; Hsu, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 875.) Therefore, the Court finds
that there is no prevailing party for purposes of Section 1717. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for attorneys’
fees is DENIED.
