And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the Defendant's Demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint is overruled, and the Defendant's Motion to Strike is denied. The Plaintiff, Orlando Garcia, has standing to bring this action and has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Unruh Civil Rights Act, and California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA). The Plaintiff visited the Defendant's business, Maytag Coin Wash, and encountered difficulties using the sink, door, and change machines due to the Defendant's failure to comply with disability access laws. The Defendant's Demurrer argued that the Plaintiff lacked standing and failed to allege facts detailing how he was injured by the Defendant, but the Court disagrees with these arguments. The Motion to Strike was based on the Defendant's contention that the Plaintiff failed to meet the pleading requirements for high-frequency litigants and that the Plaintiff is not automatically granted standing under the ADA as a tester, but the Court finds these arguments unpersuasive.
