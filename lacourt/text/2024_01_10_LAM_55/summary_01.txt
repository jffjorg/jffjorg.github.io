And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by Defendant ABC Unified School District and has made the following tentative rulings:

* Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED as to the 1st cause of action for violation of Labor Code §1197.5 and DENIED as to the 2nd cause of action for sex status discrimination (in violation of Government Code §12940, et seq.) and the 8th cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of Government Code §12940(k).
* Defendant's Motion for Separate Trial of Plaintiff Montenegro's Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Claims is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §1048(b).

The Court finds that the 1st cause of action for violation of Labor Code §1197.5 is not timely because Plaintiffs did not file a claim with ABC School District before filing suit. The Court also finds that equitable tolling may apply to some of the time period. The Court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 2nd and 8th causes of action because Plaintiffs' allegations are timely.

The Court grants the motion for separate trial of Plaintiff Montenegro's Disability Claims because they are factually and legally distinct from the rest of the claims in the case. The Court finds that trying the Disability Claims separately will avoid confusion and ensure a fair trial.
