And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) against John Doe J.R., who is seeking damages for childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred at George Washington Preparatory High School in 2005-2006. LAUSD argues that Section 340.1, which allows victims of childhood sexual abuse to revive lapsed claims, is unconstitutional and creates an illegal gift of public funds. The judge disagrees, finding that Section 340.1 is constitutional and does not create an illegal gift of public funds. The judge also rejects LAUSD's argument that Section 340.1 violates its due process rights. As a result, the judge denies LAUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings in its entirety.
