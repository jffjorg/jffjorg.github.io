 This is a lemon law action.  The parties have settled this matter and have agreed that Plaintiff Rogelio Badajoz is the prevailing party, who may move for fees and costs by motion.  Plaintiff now seeks $80,311 in fees and $4,079.18 in costs and expenses.  (See Civ. Code § 1794(d).)    The breakdown of this request is shown below.   Defendant General Motors LLC contends that both the number of hours and hourly rates are excessive.   The Court will reduce the rate of Barry to $600; the rate of Rabieian to $400; the rate of Pascal to $300; the rate of Kim to $300; the rate of Lara to $300; and the rate of Shumake to $300.  This represents a total deduction of $14,437.50.   Next, the Court will further reduce the lodestar figure by $16,305, which represents excessive time spent on (1) noncompensable fraud claims, (2) discovery matters, (3) motions in limine, and (4) the instant Motion. With regard to costs and expenses, the Court will only deduct $272.54 associated with travel, which the Court considers an overhead expense.   In sum, the Motion is granted in part.  The Court awards $49,568.50 in fees and $3,806.64 in costs/expenses.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
