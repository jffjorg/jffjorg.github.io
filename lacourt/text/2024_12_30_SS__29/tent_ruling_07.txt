23STCV23541
Demurrer of Cross-Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to Cross-Complaint
 
Tentative
The demurrer is overruled
Background
On September 28, 2023, Ashley Jackson and
Kenneth Watson (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Spalding
Mortuary, Inc. (“Spalding”), Cedars-Sinai Health Ventures, and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence arising out of the alleged mishandling
of Rita Wilson’s (“Decedent”) remains from July 25 to August 9, 2023.  
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiffs requested dismissal
of Cedars-Sinai Health Ventures. 
On February 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint against Spalding and Does 1 through 50.
On March 5, 2024, Spalding filed an answer to
the complaint, as well as a cross-complaint against Cedars-Sinai Health
Ventures and Roes 1 through 20. Spalding requested dismissal of Cedars-Sinai
Health Ventures from the cross-complaint on May 7, 2024. 
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiffs amended the complaint
to name Cedars Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”) as Doe 1.
After obtaining leave, Spalding filed an
amended cross-complaint on September 16, 2024, against CSMC and Roes 1 through
20. 
On September 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Spalding, CSMC, and Does 1 through 50.
On October 9, 2024, Spalding filed an answer
to the SAC. 
On October 25, 2024, CSMC filed an answer to
the SAC.
On November 22,
2024, CSMC filed this demurrer to Spalding’s cross-complaint. Spalding filed an
opposition on December 16. CSMC filed a reply on December 20.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e),
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial [2024], ¶ 7:40.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)  All reasonable inferences must
be drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Id. at p. 105.)
A complaint must contain a “statement of facts constituting
the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1); see
also C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
872 [“the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action”].)  Ordinarily, a complaint “is
sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  Ultimate facts are
those upon which “the right to recover depends” and are “essential” to the
cause of action.  (Estes v. Eaton
Corp. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 636, 643 fn. 2; see also 1 Weil & Brown, supra,
¶ 6:124.)
A plaintiff is required to plead only “the essential facts of
[its] case” that are sufficient “to acquaint a defendant with the nature,
source and extent of [the] cause of action.” 
(Doe, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 550.)  Mere boilerplate or pleading of legal
conclusions is not sufficient.  (Id.
at p. 551 fn. 5.)  But a plaintiff need
not allege “each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of
plaintiff’s proof” at trial.  (C.A.,
supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 872.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer, the parties
must meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  That
requirement is satisfied here.  (Raphelt Decl.,
¶ 3.)
Request for Judicial Notice
The Court grants CSMC’s requests for judicial
notice of Plaintiff’s SAC. 
Discussion
CSMC demurs to the causes of action for indemnity,
contribution, and declaratory relief in Spalding’s cross-complaint under Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f). 
 
Plaintiffs’ claim arises from the mishandling of
Decedent’s remains. (SAC, ¶ 19.) Plaintiffs assert claims of breach of contract
and breach of the covenant of the good faith and fair dealing against Spalding,
and for negligence against both Spalding and CSMC.
 
Indemnity
 
“The elements of a cause of action for indemnity are (1) a showing
of fault on the part of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the
indemnitee for which the indemnitor is . . . equitably responsible.”¿ (Bailey
v. Safeway, Inc. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 206, 217.)¿Breach of contract is
not a cognizable claim on which to base equitable indemnity.¿ (BFGC
Architects Planners, Inc. v. Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119
Cal.App.4th 848, 852-853.)¿ For the doctrine of equitable indemnity to apply,
the proposed indemnitee must plead some basis for tort liability against the
proposed indemnitor, which generally is based on a legal duty owed by the
proposed indemnitor to the underlying injured party.¿ (Ibid.)¿
 
Reviewing the cross-complaint, the Court finds Spalding has
provided sufficient facts to support a claim of indemnity against CSMC. Spalding
alleges that Decedent’s remains decomposed while under the control of CSMC. (Cross-complaint,
¶ 5.)
 
In the alternative, CSMC demurs on the
ground of uncertainty.  Demurrers for uncertainty are “disfavored” and will be
sustained “only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.”  (A.J. Fistes
Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  A complaint need not be “a model of clarity”
and must only contain sufficient allegations to put the defendants on notice of
the claims against them.  (Ibid.)  As the Court of Appeal has observed, “where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, … ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; see also 1 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024) ¶¶7:85-7:86.)
 
Here, the cross-complaint is not
incomprehensible; CSMC can reasonably respond. 
That is particularly true given that CSMC presumably has access to the
critical facts, including what whether it exercised control over Decedent’s
remains and, if so, what occurred during that period.
 
Accordingly, CSMC’s demurrer to the indemnity cause of action is overruled.
 
Contribution
 
A claim for contribution requires allegations of (1) “a money
judgment,” (2) “rendered jointly against two or more defendants in a tort
action,” (3) “in accordance with the principles of equity,” (4) “after one
tortfeasor has, by payment, discharged the joint judgment or has paid more than
his pro rata share thereof,” (5) without intentional injury by the tortfeasor.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 875, subds. (a)-(d).) 

 
The Court has reviewed the cross-complaint and finds that Spalding
has alleged sufficient facts to support its allegations that CSMC could be at
fault for the failure to adequately care for Decedent’s body such that Spalding
and CSMC may share equitable distribution of the loss to Plaintiffs. While CSMC
contends Plaintiffs’ SAC asserts a different timeline, the Court takes judicial
notice of the document only, not the truth of the matters asserted therein.
For the same reasons stated above, the Court does not find that
the cross-complaint is uncertain.
 
Accordingly, CSMC’s demurrer to the contribution cause of action
is overruled.
 
Declaratory Relief
 
“The existence of an ‘actual controversy relating
to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,’ suffices to maintain
an action for declaratory relief.”¿ (Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin
Corp.¿(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 605.)
 
As set forth above, Spalding has provided sufficient facts to
support there is an actual controversy as to matters in dispute, including the time
period during which CSMC either did or did not have possession and care of Decedent’s
body.
 
For the same reasons stated above, the Court does not find that
the cross-complaint is uncertain.
 
Accordingly, CSMC’s demurrer to the declaratory relief cause of
action is overruled.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed
by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
