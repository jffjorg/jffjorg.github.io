```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for deemed-admitted orders, as the plaintiffs failed to respond to the defendants' Requests for Admission. The court notes that the plaintiffs' failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that a monetary sanction should be imposed. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to be deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission, and has also ordered the defendants to pay additional filing fees. The court has also noted that the defendants filed a single motion for what should have been twelve motions, which is a misuse of the discovery process and will result in additional filing fees being imposed.
