And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Edward Mkhchyan, in his lawsuit against Alex Trucks, LLC. The plaintiff had filed three motions to compel the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant failed to respond to these requests, despite promises to do so in the future.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel, ordering the defendant to serve written, verified, code-complaint responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's requests for sanctions in part, ordering the defendant and its counsel to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,755.

The plaintiff filed his complaint on July 14, 2022, and the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests. The plaintiff filed the motions to compel on November 13, 2024, and the defendant opposed them. The plaintiff replied to the oppositions and the judge has now ruled in his favor.
