Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
served Defendant with form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production on October 3, 2023.  (Ayvazyan Decl. ¶ 3 & Exhs. 1.)  More than a year later, when Plaintiff still
had not received any responses from Defendant, Plaintiff filed these three
motions to compel.  
In
opposition, Defendant stated that it would serve responses.  That, of course, is not a sufficient answer
to the motion.  Plaintiff is entitled to
responses, not promises of responses to come in the future.
Accordingly,
the motions to compel are GRANTED.
The
requests for sanctions in connection with the motions are GRANTED IN PART.  Defendant has unsuccessfully opposed the
motions to compel, Defendant has not acted with substantial justification, and
there are no other circumstances
that make the imposition of sanctions unjust. 
In light of the relatively straightforward nature of these motions, and
the economies of scale associated with preparing parallel discovery motions,
the Court sets sanctions for each motion in the amount of $585, calculated
based on 1.5 hours of attorney time for each motion, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $350 per motion, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Ayvazyan Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC to serve written,
verified, code-complaint responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories (Set Two) within 15 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC to serve written,
verified, code-complaint responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) within 15 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC to serve written,
verified, code-complaint responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Production (Set Two) within 15 days of notice.
The Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s requests for monetary
sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Alex Trucks, LLC and counsel of
record Ford Walker Haggerty & Behar LLP, jointly and severally, to pay
monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff (through counsel)
in the amount of $1,755 ($585 per motion multiplied by three motions) within 30
days of notice.
Moving party to give notice.
