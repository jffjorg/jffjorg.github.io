 Case Number:  23STCV07677    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Torres v. MV Transportation
23STCV07677
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Lillian Sedaghat
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
On April 7, 2023, Marco Antonio Torres
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against MV Transportation, Inc. for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on September 14, 2021.
On May 12, 2023, MV Transportation, Inc.
(“Defendant”) filed an answer.
On December 5, 2024, Lillian Sedaghat (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted
at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by
either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. 
 
The Court finds
proof of service is untimely. Counsel filed and served the motion 16 court days
before the hearing (on December 5).  As
service was by mail, however, five additional days are required for service;
for service to be timely, the motion must have been served by no later than November
30.
 
Further, no
proof of service was filed as to the declaration and proposed order.
 
Additionally, Counsel’s
declaration is unsigned.
 
Lastly, the
proposed order is blank with no required information provided.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
