The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) to Spalding Mortuary, Inc.'s cross-complaint. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that Spalding's cross-complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action.

The cross-complaint alleges indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief against CSMC. The Judge found that Spalding has provided sufficient facts to support its allegations of indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The Judge also found that the cross-complaint is not uncertain and that CSMC can reasonably respond to the allegations.

The Judge noted that the parties must meet and confer before filing a demurrer and that the requirement is satisfied in this case. The Judge also granted CSMC's request for judicial notice of the Second Amended Complaint (SAC).

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is in favor of Spalding Mortuary, Inc. and against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
