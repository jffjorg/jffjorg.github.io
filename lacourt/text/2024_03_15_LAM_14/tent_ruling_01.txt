(b) A statement, which may be based
on information and belief, whether the dwelling is a homestead and the amount
of the homestead exemption, if any, and a statement whether or not the records

tax assessor indicate that there is a current homeowner's exemption or disabled
veteran's exemption for the dwelling claimed by the judgment debtor or the
judgment debtor's spouse, the judgment creditor has the burden of proof that
the dwelling is not a homestead. If the records of the county tax assessor
indicate that there is not a current homeowner's exemption or disabled
veteran's exemption for the dwelling claimed by the judgment debtor or the
judgment debtor's spouse, the burden of proof that the dwelling is a homestead
is on the person who claims that the dwelling is a homestead.
(2) If the application states the
amount of the homestead exemption, the person claiming the homestead exemption
has the burden of proof that the amount of the exemption is other than the
amount stated in the application.
(b) The court shall determine
whether the dwelling is exempt. If the court determines that the dwelling is
exempt, the court shall determine the amount of the homestead exemption and the
fair market value of the dwelling. The court shall make an order for sale of
the dwelling subject to the homestead exemption, unless the court determines
that the sale of the dwelling would not be likely to produce a bid sufficient
to satisfy any part of the amount due on the judgment pursuant to Section
704.800. The order for sale of the dwelling subject to the homestead exemption
shall specify the amount of the proceeds of the sale that is to be distributed
to each person having a lien or encumbrance on the dwelling and shall include
the name and address of each such person. Subject to the provisions of this
article, the sale is governed by Article 6 (commencing with Section 701.510) of
Chapter 3. If the court determines that the dwelling is not exempt, the court
shall make an order for sale of the property in the manner provided in Article
6 (commencing with Section 701.510) of Chapter 3.”
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor filed their application for an order for sale on August 24, 2023. On
October 26, 2023, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor moved this court for an order
extending the time to hear an OSC re: Sale of Dwelling, pursuant to Section
704.770(a). This court granted the motion and set an OSC re: Sale of Dwelling for
December 11, 2023. That OSC has been twice continued and is now set on the
current date.
 
            
 
            The
application contains all of the required elements under Section 704.760. It
states that the records of the county tax assessor indicate a homeowner’s
exemption recorded by the Judgment Debtor, that those same records contain no
recorded homestead declaration, that the only other lien on the property is a
recorded deed of trust securing a loan in the amount of $367,140.25, and a
statement that the judgment is not based on a consumer debt.
 
            However,
there is no record in the court’s file that Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor has
ever served notice on the Judgment Debtor pursuant to Section 704.770(b). The
mandatory form prescribed by the Judicial Council is Form EJ-180. In the
absence of proper service of notice, the court cannot grant and order for sale
of the property.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because there
is no proof of service pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 704.770(b),
the court cannot order sale of the property at this time. Therefore, the OSC
re: Sale of Dwelling is DISCHARGED.
