The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Alexander Habrich and 3761444 Canada, Inc. (Cross-Complainants) and Spinning Gold, LLC and others (Cross-Defendants). The Cross-Complainants filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) seeking compensatory damages and to enforce their rights to foreclose upon collateral. The SACC relates to a film production that was stopped due to lack of financing, resulting in total losses for the investors. The Cross-Defendants objected to requests for production, citing privilege, vagueness, confidentiality, and burden. The Judge has ordered the Cross-Defendants to produce a privilege log and complete their production within 30 days. The Judge has also granted the Motions to Compel, requiring the Cross-Defendants to identify which documents correspond to each request. Counsel are encouraged to appear remotely by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
