And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action case between Durant McLeod and California Physicians' Service. The Defendant seeks to seal paragraph 15 of the Plaintiff's initial Complaint, which allegedly reveals protected health information in violation of HIPAA and CMIA. The Judge rules that the Motion to Seal is granted in part, as the paragraph identifies five individuals, but only two of them have protected health information related to fraudulent medical payments. The Judge orders that the names of these two individuals and their financial advisor be redacted to protect the confidential information. The sealing is narrowly tailored and necessary to protect the information from public disclosure.
