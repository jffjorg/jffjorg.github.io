```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrers to the plaintiff's complaint are sustained. The plaintiff, Babak Zarabian, alleges that the defendants cut him out of a partnership deal related to the "Zanna" family of corporate entities. The defendants argue that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to support the claims. The judge notes that the complaint is premised on an oral agreement to partner and invest in a cannabis venture, which allegedly occurred on or around May 16, 2018. However, the judge takes judicial notice of the California Secretary of State's records, which show that the defendants' companies were formed in 2019, making it unclear how they could have entered into an oral contract and fiduciary relationship in May 2018. The judge has granted the defendants' demurrers, but has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint.
