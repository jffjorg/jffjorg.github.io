The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Neil Asnen's motion to appear pro hac vice in a case between Datalot, Inc. and Digital Media Solutions, LLC. Asnen is a lawyer licensed to practice in New York and New Jersey, but not in California, and is seeking to appear in a California court on behalf of the defendant.

The ruling notes that no oppositions to the motion were filed and that Asnen has provided the required information, including his residence and office address, his admission dates, and his status as an active member of the New York and New Jersey bars. The ruling also notes that Asnen has been retained to appear in a particular cause pending in a California court and that he is not a resident of California, regularly employed in California, or regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities in California.
