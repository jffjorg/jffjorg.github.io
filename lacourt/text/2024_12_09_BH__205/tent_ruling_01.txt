  Hearing Date:  December 9, 2024
  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO VACATE 
  COURT ORDER, RECONSIDER COURT 
  ORDER AND QUASH SERVICE OF THE 
  SUMMONs and complaint
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a legal malpractice case.  Plaintiff Michael Sapir alleges his former
attorney, Ed W. Pilot failed to timely file a complaint, within the applicable
statute of limitations.    
On
January 3, 2024, the Court held a case management conference (“CMC”) and an OSC
hearing on why sanctions should not be imposed for Plaintiff’s failure to file
a proof of service.  Plaintiff did not
attend the hearing, and accordingly, the Court dismissed the action without
prejudice.   Plaintiff filed a motion to
vacate the dismissal, which this Court granted on August 20, 2024.   
Defendants
Edward Pilot and Edward Pilot, PC then filed a motion to vacate or reconsider
the Court’s August 20, 2024 order and to quash the service of the summons and
complaint.  The Court granted the motion
on the ground that Plaintiff’s motion to vacate was not made “within a
reasonable time” as required by Code Civ. Proc. § 473. 

This
hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of the Court’s order granting
Defendants’ motion to vacate or to reconsider the Court’s August 20, 2024
order.  Plaintiff argues that he had
insufficient funds to retain counsel, and accordingly, he could not file his
motion to vacate any earlier than he did. 

REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendants
request judicial notice of (1) the court file in the action, Second Site LLC
vs. Paul Scott et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number BC723513,
including the Register of Actions; (2) the face page of a Trial Brief filed on
August 1, 2024 demonstrating Mr. Sapir was represented by counsel, Keith
Berglund and Russell Miller; (3) the court file in the action, Michael Sapir
vs. Robert L. Starr, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number
BC514774, including the Register of Actions, and (4) the court file in the
action, Second Site LLC vs. Selan Law Firm, A Professional Corporation, et
al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number 21STCV03174, including the
Register of Actions.  The Court denies
the request as there is no clear explanation of the relevance of these
documents to the present motion.  
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The Court overrules Objection Nos. 2-7, and
sustains Objection No. 1, to the Declaration of Michael Sapir.  The Court overrules Objection No. 1 and
sustains Objection Nos. 2-3 to the Declaration of Gary Kurtz.
LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(a):
 
When an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
As stated by the court in Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499, a court
acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is
not based upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.” There is a
strict requirement of diligence, meaning the moving party must present a
satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.)
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
timely.  The motion was due 10 days after
service upon Plaintiff of written notice of entry of the order.  The order granting Defendant’s motion for
reconsideration was issued on October 15, 2025.  The order was served by mail, which adds five
days to the 10 day period.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1013(a).)  Thus, a motion for
reconsideration is timely if filed on or before October 30, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his motion for reconsideration
on October 30, 2024. 
However, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is not based on new facts. 
Section 1008 requires that a motion for reconsideration must be “based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law.”  This language in the statute “requires that
the party seeking reconsideration provide both newly discovered evidence and an
explanation for the failure to have produced such evidence earlier.”  (Robbins v. Los Angeles Unified School
District (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 313, 317; Mink v. Superior Court
(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342 (“[T]he party seeking reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”)  
Plaintiff explains that the reason for his
delay in filing his motion to vacate default was because he had insufficient
funds to hire counsel.  But this fact was
known to Plaintiff, and there is no explanation provided as to why it was not
raised earlier.  Counsel explains why it
was not raised in opposition to Defendant’s motion for reconsideration, but
there is no explanation as to why the argument was not raised in the original
motion to vacate, particularly given the pre-existing authorities that required
the motion to vacate be made within a reasonable time.
Plaintiff cites two cases in support of his
position that he can raise previously known facts so long as there is a
satisfactory explanation for the failure to do so.  Neither case supports his position.  In Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, the trial court had granted
summary adjudication on statute of limitations ground.  In the hearing on defendant’s motion for
summary adjudication, the defendant contended the action accrued on January 17,
1977, while the plaintiffs contended the action accrued on January 31, 1977.
The trial court agreed with defendant and dismissed the action.  However, the plaintiffs later discovered that
an intervening weekend and holiday rendered January 20, 1987, as the date the
statute ran.  The Court of Appeals
concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to reconsideration, since all
parties were operating under the mistaken assumption that if the statute were
triggered on January 17, 1977, it ran on January 17, 1987.  The intervening weekend and holiday, although
a pre-existing fact, was not known to the plaintiffs at the time of the
hearing.  Here, Plaintiff’s lack of
resources to hire an attorney was certainly known to him at the time of the
original motion to vacate.  
In Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, the Court of Appeal held that the
trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by granting defendant’s motion
for reconsideration because defendant presented a legal principle based on a
case that was available and could have been provided to the trial court prior
to the initial ruling.  Baldwin stands
for the proposition that parties applying for reconsideration of a prior order
on the basis of “different law” pursuant to § 1008,
must make the same showing of diligence required of those seeking
reconsideration on the basis of “different facts.”  Baldwin has no application here.  Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is not
based on new law.  
Defendants
seek sanctions pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(d).  Subdivision (d) provides that “[a] violation
of this section may be punished as contempt and with sanctions as allowed by
Section 128.7.”  Section 128.7, in turn,
allows a court to impose sanctions against parties and attorneys who file
papers in court frivolously or for an improper purpose. (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7, subd. (b).) 
There
are strict procedural steps that must be met before a court imposes section
128.7 sanctions. “A motion for sanctions under [section 128.7] shall be
made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the
specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b).” (§ 128.7, subd. (c)(1),
italics added.) The notice of motion must be served on the other party at least
21 days before the motion is filed. (Id.) If the other party does not
withdraw or correct the challenged conduct, the motion may then be filed, and
the court may consider the motion for sanctions. (Id.)
These
same procedural requirements apply to a request for monetary sanctions
under section 1008. (Moofly
Productions, LLC v. Favila (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 993, 997 (holding
“the requirements of section 128.7 do apply to sanctions imposed under section 1008,
subdivision (d)”
and reversing trial court’s sanction award under § 1008 for failure
to comply with 21-day “safe harbor” of section 128.7).)
Here,
the procedural requirements of sections 1008,
subdivision (d) and 128.7 were not
met.  Defendants requested sanctions in their
opposition, not in a “separate[]” motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd.
(c)(1).)  And they neither served a
motion for sanctions 21 days before they filed the sanctions motion nor gave Plaintiff
the opportunity to withdraw his motion for reconsideration. (Ibid.)  Thus, Defendants did not meet the requirements
for obtaining sanctions under § 1008.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
