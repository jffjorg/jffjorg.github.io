And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge is considering a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff MICHAEL SAPIR, who claims that he had insufficient funds to hire counsel and could not file a motion to vacate the dismissal of the action without prejudice earlier. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's motion is not based on new facts, but rather on previously known facts. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff's argument does not meet the requirements of Code Civil Procedure section 1008, which requires a satisfactory explanation for the failure to provide the evidence or different facts earlier. The Judge denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
