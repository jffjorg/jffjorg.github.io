And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that both the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication must be denied due to improper notice. The judge found that the notice of the motions was not properly served on all parties, as the defendants did not manifest affirmative consent to receive electronic service and the plaintiff did not serve the moving papers on the defendants' counsel. The judge also noted that it is not possible to continue the hearing to provide the required 75-day notice period and 30-day notice before trial. The judge has ordered that the parties be notified of the tentative ruling and that they may submit on it by contacting the courtroom via email.
