And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the parties. The first motion was filed by the defendant, Sandra Mariana Vidal, seeking to trifurcate the trial into three phases: one for equitable issues, one for legal issues, and one for punitive damages. The judge granted the motion, finding that it would be efficient to try the equitable issues first.

The second motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Sima Ashrafi and Mohammad Ali Nateghi, seeking to permit the late designation of expert witnesses. The judge denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs did not meet the requirements for granting such a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.720. The judge also ordered the plaintiffs to pay $1,810 in sanctions to the defendant for the unsuccessful motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' conduct and the relevant laws and cases. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to timely designate their expert witnesses and did not demonstrate excusable neglect or mistake. The judge also found that the defendant would be prejudiced by the plaintiffs' late designation of experts and that the plaintiffs did not act with substantial justification.
