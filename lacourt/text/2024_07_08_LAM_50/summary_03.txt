And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff, Xiang Hao Cui, sought to compel the defendants to provide further responses to discovery requests served on February 18, 2023. However, the court finds that the defendants' amended responses, served on October 4, 2023, are sufficient and that the plaintiff's motion is denied.

The court also denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's motion was made without substantial justification. However, the court grants the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, ordering the plaintiff to pay $4,338.50 to the defendants within 30 days of the date of the order.

The court finds that the defendants' counsel incurred reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, in connection with the opposition to the plaintiff's motion. The court orders the plaintiff to pay the defendants' counsel for these expenses, which amount to $4,338.50.
