The judge also found that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally unconscionable and that it is not substantively unconscionable. The judge noted that the arbitration agreement provides that all claims shall be resolved through arbitration and that the parties intend that this procedure shall be the exclusive means of resolving all claims. The judge also noted that the arbitration agreement is not overly broad in its scope and that it does not require the plaintiff to arbitrate claims that are unrelated to her employment with the defendant.
