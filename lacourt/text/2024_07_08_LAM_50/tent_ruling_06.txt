Center, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[a]ccording to Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities
Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394 [58
Cal. Rptr. 2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061] (Rosenthal), the party moving to compel arbitration bears the burden of
establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate, and the party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence any fact necessary to its defense. The role of the trial court is to
sit as a trier of fact, weighing any affidavits, declarations, and other
documentary evidence, together with oral testimony received at the court’s
discretion, to reach a determination on the issue of arbitrability…Thus,
the trial court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing before, not after,
ruling on appellant’s motion to compel arbitration.” Here, there is no issue of
an evidentiary hearing being held after the Court’s ruling on the instant
motion. Thus, the Court does not see how Hotels Nevada is applicable here.
