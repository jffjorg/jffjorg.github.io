And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge discloses that 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. The judge believes that this experience will not cause her to be biased in this case, but if any party disagrees, they must file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by July 16, 2024. The hearing on the status conference re completion of mediation or ADR has been continued to August 27, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
