The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Pamela Renee Mendoza, et al vs. General Motors, LLC, et al.

Judge Beaudet has disclosed that she purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without litigation. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but if anyone believes otherwise, they have until July 16, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The hearing on the status conference will be continued to August 27, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
