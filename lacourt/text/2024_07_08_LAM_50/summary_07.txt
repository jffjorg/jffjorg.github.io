And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take back the truck and refund the purchase price without litigation. Judge Beaudet does not believe her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but she is disclosing her potential bias in case it is relevant. The judge is continuing the Case Management Conference to September 4, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file a statement of disqualification. The plaintiff is ordered to notify any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service with a courtesy copy delivered to the court. Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of service to file and serve a statement of disqualification.
