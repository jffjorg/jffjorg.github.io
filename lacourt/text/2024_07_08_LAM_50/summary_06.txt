And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration in a case where the parties are disputing the arbitrability of the agreement. The Judge notes that the party moving to compel arbitration bears the burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. The Judge also mentions that the Court of Appeal in Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Center, Inc. held that the trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on a motion to compel arbitration. However, in this case, the Judge does not see how this holding is applicable, as there is no issue of an evidentiary hearing being held after the Court's ruling on the motion.
