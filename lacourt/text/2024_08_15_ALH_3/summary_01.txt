And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

This Tentative Ruling addresses two motions: a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Chris Prussak of Prussak, Welch, & Avila, and a motion to compel responses to discovery filed by Plaintiff Violeta Martin. The Court grants both motions. The motion to be relieved as counsel is granted because Prussak was not authorized to file an answer on behalf of Welch Law & Associates, and there is no prejudice to the defendant. The motion to compel responses to discovery is granted because Welch Law Firm failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests. The Court also imposes a monetary sanction of $143.91 on Welch Law Firm, payable within 20 days, for failing to serve timely responses to discovery requests.
