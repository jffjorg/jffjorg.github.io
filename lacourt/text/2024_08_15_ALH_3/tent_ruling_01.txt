          Motion to
be Relieved
          On December
14, 2023, Chris Prussak of Prussak, Welch, & Avila filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel for defendant Welch Law & Associates (“Defendant”). Mr.
Prussak declares that his firm mistakenly filed an answer on the Defendant’s
behalf. There can be no prejudice to Defendant by relieving Mr. Prussak of any
purported representation if Mr. Prussak was not authorized to file an answer or
appear on its behalf. Therefore, notwithstanding the error in the notice of
motion which identifies Defendant as an individual or the failure to include a
declaration or proposed order on Judicial Council Forms MC-052
and MC-053 (which appear inapplicable in these unusual circumstances), Mr. Prussak’s motion is GRANTED. (See
People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [absent showing of
prejudice, attorney’s motion for withdrawal should be granted].)   
Counsel is ordered to give notice to
Defendant and all parties who have appeared in this action.
Motion to Compel
On January 24, 2024, plaintiff Violeta
Martin (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion for an order compelling defendant Welch
Law Firm to provide verified responses to Request for Production, Set One and
Request for Form Interrogatories – General, Set One. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) 
Welch Law Firm did not oppose the motion
and it is undisputed responses were not served. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
is GRANTED and Welch Law Firm is ordered to serve verified responses without
objections to Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Form
Interrogatories – General, Set One within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) The Court finds evidence of
neither. 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Welch Law Firm in the amount of $143.91,
to be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order, consisting of .5 hours at
counsel’s hourly rate of $450 and $68.91 for the cost to file this motion.
Moving party to give notice. 
           
Dated
this 15th
day of August, 2024
