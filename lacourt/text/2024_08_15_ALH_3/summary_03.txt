And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to stay the proceedings in this action until the resolution of two petitions for a writ of mandate pending before the Court of Appeal. The defendant, Montebello Unified School District, filed a demurrer arguing that the plaintiffs did not present a timely pre-litigation claim and that the Legislature's retroactive elimination of the claim presentation element through AB 218 is unconstitutional and violates Article XVI, ยง 6 (referred to as the "Gift Clause"). The defendant also filed a motion for an order staying this action until the resolution of the writ petitions. The judge notes that the Court of Appeal has already issued an opinion in West Contra Costa rejecting the argument about the unconstitutionality of AB 218, but that a ruling in Roe #2, which addresses a dispositive issue directly underpinning this current litigation, is pending. The judge concludes that a brief stay is unlikely to prejudice either party, given that the alleged abuse occurred around 20 years ago, and that the stay will expire at the end of three months or the day the Second District Court of Appeal issues its ruling in Roe #2, whichever occurs earlier.
