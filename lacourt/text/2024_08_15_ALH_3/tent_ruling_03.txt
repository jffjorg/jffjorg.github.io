         Jane Does, B.U. and S.V.,
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Montebello
Unified School District (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 on May 31, 2024,
Plaintiffs allege that they were groomed, sexually assaulted, and sexually
molested by a teacher employed by Defendant in or around 2004 and 2005. 
On July 8, 2024, Defendant filed a
demurrer on the grounds that Plaintiffs did not present a timely pre-litigation
claim and the Legislature’s retroactive elimination of the claim presentation
element through AB 218 is unconstitutional and violates Article XVI, § 6
(referred to as the “Gift Clause”). 
On July 15, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order staying this action until the resolution of two petitions
for a writ of mandate pending before the Court of Appeal in West Contra
Costa USD v. Superior Court (First District Case No. A16934) (“West
Contra Costa”) and Roe #2 v. Superior Court (Second Appellate
District, Div. 6, Case No. B334707) (“Roe #2”), respectively. Both cases
involve the question of whether AB 218 violates the Gift Clause of the
California Constitution and address a dispositive issue directly underpinning
this current litigation. Defendant and Plaintiff both filed requests for
judicial notice court of records. The requests are GRANTED. (Evid. Code, § 352,
subd. (d).) 
“[T]he power to stay proceedings is
incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of
the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for
counsel, and for litigants.” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8 Cal.5th
111, 141 [citing Landis v. North American Co. (1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254].)
“[A] stay gives effect to the general rule that a court ordinarily has inherent
power, in its discretion, to stay proceedings when such a stay will accommodate
the ends of justice.” (People v. Bell (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 323.)  
On July 31, 2024, the First District Court
of Appeal issued its opinion in West Contra Costa and held that AB 218
did not violate the Gift Clause because it did not create new substantive
liability for the alleged wrongful conduct, but only waived a condition that
the state had imposed on its consent to suit. Therefore, one of the two writ
proceedings has already concluded. 
As for the status of the proceedings in
Roe #2, the Second District Court of Appeal ordered the real
parties in interest to file an “informal response” in letter form by April 22,
2024, and for the petitioner school district to file an “informal reply” by May
17, 2024. The Court of Appeal also issued a stay order on June 26, 2024, at the
petitioner’s request, staying trial proceedings in the superior court pending
resolution of the writ petition. Given the “informal” briefing schedule, it is
likely that a ruling will be issued soon. 

Decisions of every division of the
Court of Appeals are binding on this court and where appellate decisions are in
conflict, “the court exercising inferior jurisdiction can and must make a
choice between the conflicting decisions.” (Auto Equity Sales v. Superior
Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455-456.) While the First Appellate District
has issued its ruling in West Contra Costa rejecting the argument about
the unconstitutionality of AB 218, if the Second Appellate District issues a
conflicting ruling, this court would have the benefit of the Second Appellate
District’s reasoning and have the discretion to choose between the two. The
Court additionally notes that this case was only recently filed on March 31,
2024, and that a brief stay is unlikely to prejudice either party, given that
the alleged abuse occurred around 20 years ago. 
Accordingly, the Court enters an order
staying the action. The stay will expire at the end of three months or the day
the Second District Court of Appeal issues its ruling in Roe #2,
whichever occurs earlier. The case management conference scheduled for November
15, 2024, remains on calendar, as does Defendant’s demurrer. 
Moving party to give notice.
