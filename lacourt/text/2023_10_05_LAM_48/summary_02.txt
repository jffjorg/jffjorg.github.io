And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Philmar Parties is denied. The motion was filed out of time, but the court will allow it to proceed. The court also found that the cross-complaint filed by the Moi Parties is not barred by collateral estoppel and that the Release Agreement is not facially unenforceable under contract principles. The court also denied the Philmar Parties' argument that the PSA and LOI are unenforceable due to a failure of consideration and performance. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further submissions are made by the parties.
