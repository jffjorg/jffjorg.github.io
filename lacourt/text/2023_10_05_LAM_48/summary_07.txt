And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has decided to continue the hearing on Michael Schrage's motion for restitution, seeking the return of $107,142.97 levied by Leonard Schrage on Michael's life insurance policy with Pacific Life Insurance Company. The court cannot determine at this time who has the rightful claim to the funds, as the record is incomplete and raises questions about the owner and status of the policy. The Receiver, Byron Z. Moldo, has filed a declaration raising these questions and the court has ordered the parties to file supplemental declarations and exhibits regarding the claims to the funds. The hearing is continued to a later date, and parties may submit on the tentative ruling without appearing in court unless there is a companion hearing.
