  CASE NO.: 21STCV27084
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT
  ON THE PLEADINGS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 5, 2023



 
On July 22, 2021, Philip Lawrence and Philmar Studios Inc.
(“Philmar Parties”) filed this action against Patrizio Moi, Moi Productions Inc.,
and The Record Plant Inc. (“Moi Parties”).
On November 29, 2021, the Moi Parties
filed an answer and cross-complaint against the Philmar Parties.  On January 18, 2022, the Philmar Parties filed
an answer to the cross-complaint.
On July 21, 2023, the Philmar Parties
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The Philmar Parties’ request for judicial
notice of records from Case No. 18STCV08191 is granted.  In doing so, the Court takes judicial notice of
the existence, legal effect, and arguments advanced in the documents, and not the
truth of the contents as fact.  (Day v.
Sharp (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914 [“‘[A] court cannot take judicial
notice of hearsay allegations as being true, just because they are part of
a court record or file.  A court may take
judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file, but can
only take judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in documents such as orders,
findings of fact and conclusions of law, and judgments.’”]; Bach v. McNelis
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 852, 864-865 [a court “may not judicially notice the truth
of assertions in declarations or affidavits filed in court proceedings.”].)
The Moi Parties’ request for judicial
notice of the Notice of Non-Related Case is denied as unnecessary because that document
is already part of this case’s record.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On
December 11, 2018, the Moi Parties filed Case No. 18STCV08191 against the Philmar
Parties, alleging breach of agreements entered into in January 2017 and February
2018.  (See Motion at pp. 1-2; RJN Ex. B.)
On
or November 8, 2020, The Record Plant entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement
(“PSA”) with Philmar, under which Philmar agreed to transfer certain assets to The
Record Plant.  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 8 &
Ex. 1.)
On
November 15, 2020, Philmar and Moi Productions entered into a Letter of Intent in
Connection to a Proposed Settlement and Release of All Claims for PhilMar Studios
Inc., Moi Productions Inc. and Jabari Inc. (“LOI”).  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 9 & Ex. 2.)
On
April 27, 2021, the Philmar Parties entered into a Release of Claims Agreement (“Release
Agreement”).  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 11 &
Ex. 3.)
On
August 17, 2021, the Court in Case No. 18STCV08191 denied the Moi Parties’ motion
to enforce settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.4.  (RJN, Ex. C.)
On
August 1, 2022, Case No. 18STCV08191 was dismissed with prejudice.  (RJN, Ex. H.)
DISCUSSION
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity
Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) 
Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal
sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  The Court “must
accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does not consider conclusions
of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or facts that
are judicially noticed.”  (Stevenson Real
Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220.)
A.        The Motion Is Untimely, But the Court
Will Permit It.
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings must be brought before the later of the Court
entering a pretrial conference order or 30 days from the date the action is initially
set for trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(e).)  At the December 29, 2021 Case Management
Conference, the Court initially set an April 24, 2023 jury trial.  On September 9, 2022, the Court entered a Trial
Preparation Order.  After the judges on this
case were reassigned, on April 6, 2023, the Court entered another Trial Preparation
Order.  The Philmar Parties did not bring
this motion until July 21, 2023.
The
Philmar Parties also purport to bring a non-statutory motion for judgment on the
pleadings.  (Motion at p. 10.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 438, which created
a statutory basis for motions for judgment on the pleadings, was enacted in 1994.  The Philmar Parties have “cited authority in support
of nonstatutory motions for judgment on the pleadings which either pre-dates 1994,
relies on case authority that pre-dates the enactment of section 438, or simply
does not address the issue.”  (Tung v.
Chicago Title Company (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 757.)  Although the Tung court did not decide
the issue of whether nonstatutory motions for judgment on the pleadings are still
viable post-section 438, it cautioned that “trial judges should think twice before
becoming ensnared in addressing them on the merits on the eve of trial where, especially
like here, the operative pleading has never been challenged before.”  (Id. at pp. 758-759.)
However,
section 438, subdivision (e) allows a motion under that section at a different time
if “the court otherwise permits.”  Here, the
trial dates have been vacated and have not yet been reset.  Therefore, due to the procedural posture of this
case, the Court will allow the motion.
B.        Collateral Estoppel Does Not Bar the Cross-Complaint.
The
Philmar Parties argue the cross-complaint is barred by collateral estoppel due to
the ruling on the motion to enforce settlement in Case No. 18STCV08191.  Res judicata precludes the re-litigation of a
cause of action that previously was adjudicated in another proceeding between the
same parties, or parties in privity with them. 
(Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles
(2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.)  “Res
judicata applies if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the
merits; (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding;
and (3) the parties in the present proceeding or parties in privity with them were
parties to the prior proceeding.”  (Ibid.)
Res
judicata is “an umbrella term, encompassing both the primary aspect of claim preclusion
and the secondary aspect of issue preclusion.” 
(Cal Sierra Development, Inc. v. George Reed, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th
663, 671.)  “ ‘Issue preclusion prohibits
the relitigation of issues argued and decided in a previous case, even if the second
suit raises different causes of action.  [Citation.]  Under issue preclusion, the prior judgment conclusively
resolves an issue actually litigated and determined in the first action.  [Citation.] 
There is a limit to the reach of issue preclusion, however.  In accordance with due process, it can be asserted
only against a party to the first lawsuit, or one in privity with a party.  [Citation.]’ 
[Citation.]”  (Id. at pp. 671-672.)
“While
it is true that res judicata will only bar relitigation of the same cause of action
by the same parties, the question of whether a cause of action is identical for
purposes of res judicata depends not on the legal theory or label used, but on the
‘primary right’ sought to be protected in the two actions.  The invasion of one primary right gives rise to
a single cause of action.  [Citation.]  Moreover, the ‘cause of action’ is based on the
harm suffered, as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant.”  (Johnson v. American Airlines, Inc. (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 427, 432.)
The
cross-complaint seeks “a declaratory judgment that: (1) PSA, LOI, and Release Agreement
are binding and enforceable agreements; (2) Cross-Defendants must complete the transfer
of PhilMar’s assets to The Record Plant; and (3) the releases set forth in the Release
Agreement are valid and enforceable,” and alleges breach of the PSA.  (Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 18, 21.)
Both
the motion to enforce settlement in Case No. 18STCV08191 and the cross-complaint
in this action involve the validity of the PSA and LOI.  However, the manner of determining the agreements’
validity is different in each action.
In
Case No. 18STCV08191, the Court found that the PSA could not be enforced pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.4 because it “does not reference this litigation,
let alone contain any provision suggesting that it was intended to resolve this
litigation.”  (RJN, Ex. C at p. 3.)  The Court did not find the PSA unenforceable as
a separate, non-settlement contract.
Similarly,
the Court stated that the LOI “is not a settlement agreement.” (RJN, Ex. C at p.
3.)  The Court found that the LOI left certain
material terms of the settlement unresolved, made clear that the settlement terms
still must be negotiated, did not definitively release the plaintiffs’ claims, and
did not provide that the Court may retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.  (RJN, Ex. C at pp. 3-4.)  The Court did not consider the validity of the
LOI outside the context of the motion to enforce.
Additionally,
nothing in Case No. 18STCV08191 involved the Philmar Parties’ alleged breach of
the PSA or the Moi Parties’ claims for promissory fraud and promissory estoppel.
Because
the prior case’s order did not finally resolve the same claims on the merits, the
motion is denied on this ground.
C.        It Is Not Clear That the Moi Parties Cannot
Enforce the Release Agreement.
The
Philmar Parties argue that the Moi Parties did not sign the April 27, 2021 Release
Agreement.  (Motion at p. 7.)
The
Release Agreement attached to the cross-complaint identifies Jabari McDavid, Jabari’s
Inc., Philip Lawrence, and PhilMar Studios Inc. as parties.  (Cross-Complaint, Ex. 3 at p. 1.)  The Release Agreement includes a mutual release
through which the parties “hereby fully and forever release and discharge Larence,
McDavid, Moi, MP Inc.[,] Jabari’s[,] and PhilMar Studios” from all claims.  (Cross-Complaint, Ex. 3 at pp. 2-3.)  Jabari’s, Moi, and MP Inc. agreed to dismiss with
prejudice the dispute as to Lawrence and PhilMar Studios Inc., and any damages caused
to Moi and MP Inc. by Lawrence were deemed fully and finally forgiven and discharged.  (Cross-Complaint, Ex. 3 at p. 3.)  It contains signatures dated April 27, 2021 from
Philip Lawrence, Patrizio Moi as “Power of Attorney for Jabari’s Inc.,” and Patrizio
Moi as “Power of Attorney for Jabari McDavid.” 
(Cross-Complaint, Ex. 3 at p. 7.) 
It also contains handwritten fields for August 28, 2021 signatures from Patrizio
Moi and Patrizio Moi as “CEO for Moi Productions Inc.”
Regardless
of the propriety of the August 28, 2021 signatures (see Motion at p. 7), the Court
cannot conclude, at this stage, that the Moi Parties are not intended third-party
beneficiaries who can enforce the Release Agreement.  “The governing substantive principle is that a
nonparty who claims benefits under the contract is entitled to do so as long as
the claimed benefit does not flow to him as a mere incident of the agreement,
but is one the contracting parties intended to confer.”  (Rodriguez v. Oto (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th
1020, 1028.)  The Release Agreement here specifically
provides for releases and benefits for the Moi Parties.
The
motion is denied on this ground.
D.        The PSA and LOI Are Not Facially Unenforceable
Under Contract Principles.
The
Philmar Parties argue that the LOI and PSA fail because a condition precedent did
not occur.  (Motion at p. 8.)  According to the Philmar Parties, “It was the
clear intention of the Parties that the transaction set forth in the PSA/LOI was
not to become effective (and could not, as the terms were too indefinite) until
the long-form settlement agreement was executed.”  (Ibid.)  They contend that “no such Settlement Agreement
was ever consummated (and the settlement with Jabari does not count),” and the cross-complaint
does not allege that any such longform agreement ever came into existence.  (Ibid.)
The
Philmar Parties invert the conditions.  The
LOI states: “PROVIDED THAT the terms set forth in the Purchase agreement [PSA] AND
the terms set forth here below are fully satisfied, Philmar and Moi shall enter
into a settlement agreement (the ‘Settlement Agreement’).”  (Cross-Complaint, Ex. 2.)  Thus, the execution of a settlement agreement
was conditioned on satisfaction of the PSA and the LOI.  The motion is denied on this ground.
The
Philmar Parties argue that the PSA and LOI are unenforceable due to a failure of
consideration and performance.  (Motion at
pp. 8-9.)  They contend that “the consideration
for those agreements cannot be the settlement of claims by and between the Moi and
Philmar Parties” because the Court in Case No. 18STCV08191 ruled that the PSA and
LOI are not settlement agreements.  (Id.
at p. 9.)  The PSA provides for the transfer
of assets in exchange for $1.00.  (Cross-Complaint,
Ex. 1.)  The Court cannot conclude, at this
stage and on this motion, that this consideration is unconscionable and equivalent
to a lack of all consideration.  (See Motion
at p. 9.)  The Philmar Parties also argue
that the cross-complaint does not include any allegation that the Moi Parties paid
$58,9186.00 within 14 days, as required by the LOI.  (Id. at pp. 9-10.)  The LOI actually states, “Within fourteen days
from the complete consummation of the transaction, which includes the transfer of
the lease to Moi ALL all terms set forth below, Moi agrees to reimburse Philip Lawrence
in the amount of $58,981.69.”  (Cross-Complaint,
Ex. 2 at p. 2.)  At this stage, the Court
cannot determine whether Moi also breached the LOI or if his performance was not
yet due.  The motion is denied on this ground.
In
Reply, the Philmar Parties argue that the claims for promissory fraud and promissory
estoppel fail due to a lack of justifiable reliance.  (Reply at pp. 6-7.)  These arguments were not included, or even referenced,
in the motion.  The Court will not consider
brand new arguments on reply.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
