  CASE NO.: 21STCV40885
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 5, 2023



 
Scott
C. Lee, counsel of record for Defendants CNN Logistics Inc. and Julian Rebiga, seeks
to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration
states that they are suffering communication breakdowns that make it unreasonably
difficult to carry out the employment effectively.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until December 18, 2023, and there
is no prejudice to Defendants.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on CNN Logistics
Inc., Julian Rebiga, and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for CNN Logistics Inc. is scheduled for 12/04/2023 at 9:00
a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  CNN Logistics Inc. must retain new counsel by
that date or the Court will strike its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
