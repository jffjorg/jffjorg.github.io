  CASE NO.: 23STLC01831
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ORDER
  FOR DISCHARGE 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 5, 2023



 
On April 13, 2020, Walter Omar Aliaga filed Case No. 20STCV14129
against Kenneth Management Group Inc. (“Kenneth”).  On June 23, 2022, Law Offices of Jack D. Josephson
(“Law Offices”) filed a notice of attorney lien.  Aliaga dismissed that case due to settlement on
May 2, 2023.
On March
20, 2023, Kenneth filed this interpleader action against Aliaga and Law Offices.
On
August 28, 2023, Kenneth filed a motion for discharge and dismissal.  The request for judicial notice is granted.
“An
interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the stakeholder
and the claimants to determine the stakeholder’s right to interplead, and the other
among the claimants to determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded.  [Citation.] 
As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to
whether the suit is properly one for interpleader, i.e., whether the elements of
an interpleader action are present.  [Citation.]”  (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Pietak
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612-613.)
“When
a person brings an interpleader action, a two-step procedure is generally followed.  First, it is determined whether the plaintiff
may bring the suit and force the claimants to interplead.  Second, if it is so determined, then the court
will discharge the plaintiff from liability and ‘the action may proceed for the
determination of the rights of the various claimants to the property which is then
in the custody of the court.’”  (City of
Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1126-1127.)  “Interpleader confers rights only concerning discharge
of the stakeholder and then leaves the conflicting claims to the fund for proper
later resolution.”  (Id. at p. 1128.)
Kenneth
states that it claims no interest in the $16,000 settlement funds and cannot resolve
the conflicting demands of Aliaga and Law Offices.  Kenneth has deposited the funds with the Court.
Kenneth
also seeks attorney fees and costs of $4,641.29 from the funds.  The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its
costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred, paid out of the funds deposited by
the stakeholder.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6;
UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The Court finds that the requested attorney fees
are excessive, and a reasonable amount of attorney fees is $1,485.00 (3 hours at
$495).  The $1,206.29 in costs is reasonable.
The
unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Kenneth is DISMISSED
from this action.  The action is not terminated
with respect to Aliaga and Law Offices.
Aliaga
and Law Offices are restrained from instituting or prosecuting any other action
against Kenneth with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties to this
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).)
Kenneth
is awarded a total of $2,691.29 in attorney fees and costs, to be paid from the
deposited funds.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
