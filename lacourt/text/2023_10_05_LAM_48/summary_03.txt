Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motions to be relieved as counsel for Scott Lee, who is representing CNN Logistics Inc. and Julian Rebiga. The motion was made due to communication breakdowns that make it difficult for Lee to effectively represent his clients. The judge has also scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for CNN Logistics Inc. as the company cannot represent itself in court. The order requires CNN Logistics Inc. to retain new counsel by December 4, 2023, or the court will strike its answer and place it in default.
