And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The plaintiff, Vanessa Huerta, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Alal, LLC, alleging a single cause of action for civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) due to the defendant's violations of the Labor Code. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's PAGA claims are asserted individually and in a representative capacity, and that the Arbitration Agreement excludes only representative PAGA claims. The court found that the Arbitration Agreement clearly excludes all PAGA claims, and that the plaintiff is seeking only civil penalties, not damages. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
