  CASE NO.: BC579623
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION FOR RESTITUTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 5, 2023



 
On
March 12, 2019, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff Leonard Schrage
and against Defendants Michael Schrage and Joseph Schrage.
On
September 2, 2021, the Court of Appeal reversed Leonard’s monetary judgment against
Michael.  Remittitur issued on January 11,
2022.
On
August 16, 2022, the Court granted Michael’s motion for restitution because there
is now no monetary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Michael Schrage.  The Court ordered Leonard to return the property
taken to satisfy the prior judgment.
On
September 8, 2023, Michael filed another motion to restitution, seeking (in part)
the return of $107,142.97 levied by Leonard on Michael’s life insurance policy with
Pacific Life Insurance Company.  Leonard filed
an opposition, and a week later, Receiver Byron Z. Moldo filed a declaration.
Michael
received a letter dated October 27, 2020 from Pacific Life, stating that Pacific
Life had received a Notice of Levy Under Writ of Execution.  (Motion, Ex. 6.)  A loan totaling $107,142.97 was processed on Michael’s
life insurance policy.
Leonard
argues that the Receivership Estate owns the life insurance policy.  The Receiver has reviewed the Quickbooks file
for Sage Management Company and discovered that it paid premiums for Michael’s policy
in 2012, 2013, 2013, and 2015.  (Moldo Decl.
¶ 7.)  The Receiver notes that Michael’s motion
does not include the actual insurance policy, and there are questions about why
the money was paid as a loan and whether the policy remains in effect.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 11.)  The Receiver believes that the Receivership Estate
may have a claim to either the benefits of the policy or the cash surrender value.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 12.)
Despite
Michael’s objection to the Receiver’s declaration, the Receiver has a duty to the
Receivership Estate.  The Receiver’s investigation
raises questions as to the owner and status of the policy.  Based on the incomplete record, the Court cannot
at this time determine the rightful claimant to the $107,142.97 that was levied.
Accordingly,
the Hearing on Motion for Order Judgment of Restitution and Return of Pacific Life
Insurance Funds and All Other Personal Property is CONTINUED to ____________.
No
later than five Court days before the hearing, Michael, Leonard, and the Receiver
may file supplemental declarations and exhibits regarding the claims to the funds
and why the funds were distributed as a loan instead of a payout.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
