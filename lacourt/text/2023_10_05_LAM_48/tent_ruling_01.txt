[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL
  DEPOSITION OF THIRD-PARTY WITNESS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 5, 2023



 
On
November 20, 2020, Plaintiff Xing Wu filed this legal malpractice action against
Defendants Roseann Frazee and Frazee Law Group.
On
May 18, 2023, Defendants served a Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance and
Production of Documents and Things on non-party William Niu, for a deposition on
June 14, 2023.  (Falcon Decl. ¶ 5.)  On June 2, 2023, Niu served objections.  (Falcon Decl., Ex. C.)
On
July 6, 2023, the appeal concluded in the underlying action that gave rise to this
malpractice action.  (Falcon Decl. ¶ 9.)
On
August 14, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to compel Niu’s deposition.
A
party may move to compel a non-party’s compliance with a subpoena that requires
the attendance of a witness.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1987.1.)  Unlike a motion to compel a party’s
deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, the movant is not required
to show good cause or include an accompanying meet and confer declaration.
Defendants
seek an order to compel Niu’s appearance at deposition and are not seeking to enforce
production of the requested documents.  Niu’s
objections to the deposition are overruled.
The
unopposed motion is GRANTED.  William Niu
is ordered to appear for deposition within 15 days.
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
William Niu is ordered to pay sanctions of $820.00 (4 hours at $190/hour
plus $60 filing fee).  (See Falcon Decl. ¶
12.)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
