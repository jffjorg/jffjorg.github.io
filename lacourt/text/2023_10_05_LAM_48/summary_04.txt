And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants in part Plaintiff Heliodoro Ibarra's motion to compel further responses to Defendant General Motors LLC's request for production of documents. Plaintiff seeks further responses to requests 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, and 35, which request documents related to defective vehicles, similar complaints, and technical service bulletins. The Judge finds that Defendant's objections are overruled and grants the motion for requests 13, 14, 15, and 16, which are relevant to the defects and repairs alleged by Plaintiff.

However, the Judge finds that the motion is not well-argued and that Defendant has already agreed to produce certain documents, specifically those related to technical service bulletins and recalls. The Judge grants the motion only to the extent that Defendant must produce the documents it agreed to produce.

The Judge also orders Defendant to provide verified, supplemental responses within 30 days and denies the request for sanctions.
