And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' unopposed motion to compel the deposition of William Niu, a third-party witness. Niu had served objections to the deposition, but they were overruled. The motion was granted because the defendants had served a deposition subpoena on Niu and were not seeking to enforce the production of documents. Niu is ordered to appear for deposition within 15 days and to pay sanctions of $820.00.
