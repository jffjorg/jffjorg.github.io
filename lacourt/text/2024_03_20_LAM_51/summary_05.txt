The court has reviewed the complaint and finds that it lacks any factual allegations to support the claim. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, and the court has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice. The court will afford the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard at the hearing to explain any possible way to amend the complaint and state a cause of action.
