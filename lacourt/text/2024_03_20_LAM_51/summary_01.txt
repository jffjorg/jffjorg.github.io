And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside/vacate the default judgment entered on January 10, 2024. The defendant's counsel had mistakenly calendared the trial date and the defendant did not appear, leading to the entry of the default judgment. The judge determined that CCP § 473(b) does not provide relief for a judgment after trial on the merits, citing the case of Shayan v. Spine Care & Orthopedic Physicians (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 167. The judge found that the defendant had actual knowledge of the trial date and failed to appear, and therefore did not meet the requirements for relief under CCP § 473(b).
