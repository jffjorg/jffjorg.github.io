Significant Statements:
  - "The court therefore has authority in certain circumstances to amend a judgment against a corporation (or other entity) to add as a judgment debtor the entity's nonparty 'alter ego' who controlled the underlying litigation."
  - "It is not necessary that alter ego doctrine be alleged or proved in the underlying lawsuit."
  - "The court may also narrowly focus on 'certain inequitable uses of the corporate form for specific purposes' where disregarding the corporate form is appropriate while leaving it intact for all other purposes."

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's decision on a motion to amend a judgment. The case is Pearl Beta Funding, LLC v. Lonewolf Insurance Services, et al., case number 23STCP00079. The plaintiff, Pearl Beta Funding, LLC, is seeking to amend the judgment to include Tatanisha Leer and the Wyoming LLC as judgment debtors.

The judge has granted the motion in part, finding that the Wyoming LLC was created to shield Judgment Debtors' assets, namely the SJC Property, from Judgment Creditor. The court has also found that Judgment Debtor Stefan Joseph Leer knew about the judgment against him and attempted to conceal assets.

The court has denied the motion to amend the judgment to add Tatanisha Leer as a judgment debtor, as there is no evidence that she is a judgment debtor or that Judgment Creditor seeks her separate property. The court has also denied the motion to amend the judgment to add Tatanisha Leer as a judgment debtor under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA), as there is no evidence of fraudulent transfer.

The court has granted the motion to amend the judgment to include the Wyoming LLC as a judgment debtor, as there is evidence of a suspicious string of entity formation and property transfers after Judgment Creditor's judgment and settlement agreement with Judgment Debtors.
