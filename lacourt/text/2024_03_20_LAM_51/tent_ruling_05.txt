STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff in pro per Denis M. Bey filed
a Complaint against Defendants Terence Baine, Daniel Rivera, and Lann Niemeyer
(Defendants) for unlawful detainer. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff is
the owner of property located at 2287 Sunset Plaza Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90069. Plaintiff
apparently filed a Writ of Possession on September 1, 2023.
 
On January 16, 2024, Defendant Makaha Properties, LLC, as
Trustee of the Sunset Plaza Drive Trust #2287, UDT 03/11/19, erroneously sued
as Terence Baine (Makaha) filed an Answer.

Judgment on the Pleadings. Oppositions were due on or before March 7, 2024. As
of March 15, 2024, there are no oppositions filed with the court.
 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Trust,
Affidavit Adverse Claim of Title and Reversion of Ancestral Estate, and Writ of
Quo Warranto.
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Default Notice.
 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Writ of Error.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Judgment on the
Pleadings 
 
A defendant may move for judgment
on the pleadings if (i) the court does not have jurisdiction of the subject of
the cause of action alleged in the complaint, or (ii) the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action alleged in the
complaint. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 438(b)(2), and subd. (c).) “The
standard of review for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as
that for a general demurrer: We treat the pleadings as admitting all of the
material facts properly pleaded, but not any contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law contained therein. We may also consider matters
subject to judicial notice.” (Dunn v.
County of Santa Barbara (2006) 135 Cal. App. 4th 1281, 1298.)¿ 
 
The grounds for a demurrer must
appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a); Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint states a cause of
action. (Ibid.)¿ 
 
A demurrer
assumes the truth of all factual, material allegations properly pled in the
challenged pleading. (Blank v. Kirwan,
supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.) No matter how unlikely or improbable, the
plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on
the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.¿ App. 3d 593, 604.) But this does
not include contentions; deductions; conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to facts of which a
court may take judicial notice.¿ (Blank,
supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.)¿ 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
As with demurrers and motions to strike, and subject to
enumerated exceptions, the parties are required to meet and confer prior to
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings.2 (CCP §
439, § 430.41, § 435.) However, this is not required for unlawful detainer
actions. (CCP § 439(d)(2).)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Defendant’s request
for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452(h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 23,37.) Where, as here, judicial notice is requested of a legally operative document—like a
contract—the court may take notice not only of the fact of the document and its
recording or publication, but also facts that clearly derive from its legal effect. (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743,
754-55.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Makaha contends Plaintiff’s Complaint for unlawful detainer
fails because it is devoid of any factual allegations and Makaha is the owner
of the subject property. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
Here, the court has reviewed the Complaint and agrees with
Makaha that it fails to allege facts supporting Plaintiff’s claim for unlawful
detainer. Plaintiff’s attachment indicates a Writ of Possession from a foreign
entity for the subject property dated December 2, 2022. (Compl. Exhibit A.) However,
Makaha provided two grant deeds from June 9, 2022 and June 10, 2022 indicating
that Plaintiff does not own the subject property. Even assuming that Plaintiff
is the landlord, there are no other facts alleged in the Complaint indicating
that Plaintiff complied with the requirements of CCP § 1161 or otherwise
supporting Plaintiff’s claim.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings.
 
Leave to Amend 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be granted with
or without leave to amend. (CCP § 438(h)(1).) Leave to amend should be granted
“if there is any reasonably possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action.” (Virginia G. v. ABC
Unified School Dist. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852.) “[D]enial of leave
to amend constitutes an abuse of distraction if the pleading does not show on
its face that it is incapable of amendment.” (Ibid.)  
 
The Court is just as puzzled as moving party to discern
what cause of action is alleged. Moreover. the Court questions the
authentication of the documents filed by Plaintiff. No opposition was filed.
The Court cannot currently conceive of any possible way to amend the complaint.
Nonetheless, the Court will afford Plaintiff an opportunity to be heard at the
hearing. Accordingly, unless Plaintiff can explain any reasonable possibility
to state a cause of action at the hearing, the Court will deny leave to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED with leave to amend.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
