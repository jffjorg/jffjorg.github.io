The court is not persuaded by Plaintiffâ€™s unconstitutional argument. Defendant
is correct that arbitration agreements are regularly enforced because they
bypass the judicial system altogether and are not unconstitutional jury
waivers. (Grafton Partners v. Superior
Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955.) As such, the court declines to further
develop this argument and will instead focus on the unconscionability argument.
