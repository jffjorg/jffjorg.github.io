STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On March 16, 2022, Plaintiff Cal26 Property Group, LLC
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant Kambiz Barzi Tehrani
(Defendant) with causes of action for: (1) Intentional Tort (Conversion), and
(2) General Negligence. According to the Complaint, Defendants used a locksmith
to break into Plaintiff’s premises and steal cash from an ATM.
 
On May 26, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On July 28, 2023, the court held a Post-Mediation Status
Conference. At that hearing, pursuant to oral stipulation, the court set a
Final Status Conference for December 13, 2023 and Trial for January 8, 2024.
 
On December 13, 2023, the court held a Final Status
Conference. Defendant did not appear.
 
On January 8, 2024, the matter came on for trial. Defendant
did not appear. The matter proceeded as an uncontested trial. 
 
On January 9, 2024, the second day of trial was held. 
 
On January 10, 2024, the court entered judgment after court
trial after Defendant did not appear at trial.
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to
set aside/vacate default judgment. Plaintiff’s opposition was due on of before
March 7, 2024. As of March 13, 2024, there is no opposition on filed with the
court.
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs.
Defendant has not filed a motion to tax costs.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).)¿¿ 
¿ 
The court has broad discretion to vacate the entry of
default, default judgment or a dismissal, but that discretion can be exercised
only if the defendant establishes a proper ground for relief, by the proper
procedure and within the set time limits. Pursuant to CCP section 473(b), a
motion to set aside/vacate cannot be brought more than 6 months after the entry
of default and must be made within a “reasonable time.”¿ 
¿ 
CCP section 473(b) provides that when an application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of dismissal and is
accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, the court shall set aside a dismissal
entered against the attorney’s client, unless the court finds that the default
or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) “The court shall, whenever
relief is granted based on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the
attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties.”¿ 
¿ 
Where an “attorney¿affidavit of fault” is filed, there is
no requirement that the¿attorney's¿mistake, inadvertence, or neglect be
excusable. Relief¿must¿be granted even where the default or dismissal resulted
from¿inexcusable¿neglect by defendant's¿attorney. (Robert E. Weil, et al.,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial ¶ 5:495 (2018).)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends that the court must set aside the default
judgment because Defendant’s counsel mistakenly calendared trial and
Defendant’s motion is timely. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
CCP § 473(b) provides relief for defaults, default
judgments, and dismissals. It does not provide relief for judgment after trial
on the merits. (Shayan v. Spine Care
& Orthopedic Physicians (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 167.) In Shayan, the parties moving to set aside
judgment had actual notice of the trial date and failed to appear. (Id. at p. 169.) The court proceeded with
trial, heard evidence, and rendered judgment. (Ibid.) The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that 473(b)
did not provide the relief sought by the moving parties. (Id. at p. 170.)
 
Shayan is
particularly instructive for the case here. First, Defendant had actual
knowledge of the trial date on July 28, 2023. Defendant failed to appear at
trial and the court proceeded to hear evidence and render a judgment. Defendant
seeks relief under 473(b), however, Shayan
instructs that 473(b) does not apply to this situation. Defendant has not
provided other authority allowing the relief sought.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion to set
aside/vacate default judgment.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default Judgment is
DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
