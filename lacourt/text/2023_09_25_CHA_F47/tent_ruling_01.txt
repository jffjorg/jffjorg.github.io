SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Plaintiff L.A. Tire Tech, Inc. (Plaintiff) is an on-site
fleet maintenance, repair, roadside service, tire company and provides safety
inspections and certifications required by clients and customers, such as Defendant
SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC (Defendant).
 
Defendant is a supplier of landscape, hardscape,
irrigation, and related supplies providing supplies to business owners,
contractors and others in the landscaping business or needing
landscape/hardscape or irrigation supplies. Defendant’s operations, to which Plaintiff
provided services, were generally divided into two different divisions,
commonly referred to as the hardscape and irrigation divisions.  Each division was managed by separate
individuals and each division had vehicles and equipment assigned to it that
required the fleet services of Plaintiff. 

 
Defendant operated a fleet of approximately 158
commercial trucks, trailers, forklifts, yard equipment that were used in its
business.  Plaintiff provided Defendant with
a full range of fleet maintenance, inspection, and repair services from brakes,
to engines, tires, alignment, and total
vehicle service, maintenance, inspection, and repair.  Commercial trucks and vehicles of the nature
utilized by Defendant require regular maintenance and certification to operate
on state highways, which were included in the services provided by Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s services were typically provided
on-site at Defendant’s various business locations including emergency roadside
services when required, for which Plaintiff was available 24/7.  
 
This action involves the alleged unpaid charges for
services provided by Plaintiff to Defendant’s  Hardscape Division.  Plaintiff contends that at the time that Defendant’s
hardscape division terminated Plaintiff’s services, the total amount of all
invoices for services performed and which allegedly remain unpaid is
approximately $236,000.
On 6/26/22, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories,
Set 1, on Defendant.  (Motion to Compel
(MTC) Cohen Decl. ¶3, Ex.2).  On the same
date, 5 sets of Requests for Admissions were served on Defendant.  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶3, Ex.3-7).  After numerous requests for extensions of
time to respond were granted, on 11/11/22, Defendant served responses to the Requests
for Admissions and Form Interrogatories. 
(MTC Cohen Decl. ¶¶4-8, Ex.8-17). 
Plaintiff found certain of the responses to be evasive, inadequate, insufficient
and non-code compliant; therefore, meet and confer efforts ensued which
resulted in supplemental responses and the production of documents.  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶¶9-11, Ex.18-26).  Plaintiff found certain of the supplemental
responses to still be deficient which led to further meet and confer efforts
and Defendant agreeing to supplement its response to Form Interrogatory
17.1(d).  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶12,
Ex.27-28).  On 4/7/23, Defendant served
another supplemental response to Form Interrogatory 17.1(d).  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶13, Ex.29).  Plaintiff found the 4/7/23 response to be
deficient and again met and conferred with Defendant.  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶¶14-18, Ex.30-33).  No further responses were received.  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶16).
 
On 8/18/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order compelling Defendant  to
provide further responses to Form Interrogatories-General, Set 1, No.
17.1(d).  Additionally, Plaintiff
requests that sanctions in the amount of $3,435.00 be imposed against Defendant
and/or Defendant’s counsel.  No
opposition or other response to the motion has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2030.300(c) provides: 
 
“Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.”
 
The instant motion is untimely.  Defendant served its last supplemental
response to Form Interrogatory 17.1 by mail on 4/7/23.  (MTC Cohen Decl. ¶13, Ex.29).  Therefore, a motion to compel further
responses had to be filed and served no later than 50 days after 4/7/23 (45
days + 5 days for service of the responses by mail).  Since the 50th day fell on
Saturday, 5/27/23, the deadline was extended to the next court day, Tuesday,
5/30/23 (because of the Memorial Day holiday). 
Plaintiff did not file and serve the instant motion until 8/18/23.  Plaintiff does not state that the parties
agreed to extend the time to notice a motion to compel further responses and
the meet and confer communications between the parties do not evidence any such
extension.  (See Motion,
generally; MTC Cohen Decl. ¶¶13-18, Ex.30-33). 
  
 
As such, the Court is without jurisdiction/authority to
do anything other than deny the instant motion. 
See Vidal Sassoon, Inc. (1983) 147 CA3d 681, 683, 685; Sexton
(1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1409-1410.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
