## English Summary

The judge has denied Plaintiff L.A. Tire Tech, Inc.'s motion to compel Defendant SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC to provide further responses to certain interrogatories. 

The motion was untimely filed, meaning it was served more than 45 days after Defendant's last supplemental response to the interrogatories.  

California law requires that a motion to compel further responses be filed within 45 days of the last supplemental response, unless the parties agree in writing to extend that deadline. The judge found no evidence of an agreement to extend the deadline in this case.
