And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion for Leave to Intervene filed by Oak River Insurance Company is granted. Oak River Insurance Company, as the worker's compensation carrier for the employer of Plaintiff Mario Ochoa, is permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff in this action. The motion is based on California Labor Code Section 3853, which requires the employer or compensation carrier to give notice to the employee of an action brought by the employee or employer. Oak River Insurance Company has attached a copy of the proposed complaint in intervention and has shown that it has paid worker's compensation benefits to and on behalf of Plaintiff. Since Plaintiff and the defendants have not opposed this motion, the judge has granted the motion.
