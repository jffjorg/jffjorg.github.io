And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Kevin C. Brazile's tentative ruling grants in part the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against Defendant General Motors, LLC. The Plaintiff, Miguel Hernandez, seeks monetary, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions against the Defendant for its failure to comply with the November 15, 2023 Court Order to produce its PMK deposition within 30 days. The Defendant failed to schedule a deposition and only offered one or two dates for multiple plaintiffs, which demonstrates a lack of good faith. The Court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00, which is reduced from the requested amount of $2,067.85. The Court also finds that issue and/or evidentiary sanctions are not warranted because the Defendant has attempted to schedule a deposition. The Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is granted in part, and the Defendant is ordered to give notice.
