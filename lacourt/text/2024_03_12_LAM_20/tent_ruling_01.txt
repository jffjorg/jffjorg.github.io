Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,200.00.                                                 Moving party to give notice.  BACKGROUND            This is a lemon law action. On August 18, 2023, Plaintiff Miguel Hernandez filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant General Motors LLC for (1) fraudulent concealment, (2) breach of express warranty under Commercial Code § 2-313, (3) violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and (4) violation of Civil Code § 1750 et seq. A demurrer to the SAC was sustained on October 18, 2023.             On November 15, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel PMK deposition. The Court ordered the deposition to take place within 30 days.             On December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for sanctions.            On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.            On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  DISCUSSION            Plaintiff seeks monetary, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions against Defendant for its continuing and willful failure to comply with the November 15, 2024 Court Order to produce its PMK within 30 days after the hearing date. Applicable Law            The Court may, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney and after opportunity for hearing, may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).) Conduct subject to sanctions includes, but is not limited to, persisting over objection and without substantial justification in an attempt to obtain information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible discovery, using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified purpose, failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or making an evasive response to discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (a), (b), (d), (f).)  The purpose of discovery sanctions is not to punish. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1193.) “Furthermore, the sanction chosen should not provide a windfall to the other party, by putting the prevailing party in a better position than if he or she had obtained the discovery sought and it had been favorable.” (Ibid.)  “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal¿(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing¿Deyo¿v.¿Kilbourne¿(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793;¿Newland v. Superior Court¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613.)  Evidence or issue sanctions may be imposed only after parties violated discovery orders compelling further responses, except in exceptional circumstances, including where there was sufficiently egregious misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery, or a prior discovery order would be futile. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct.¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1428.) “The discovery statutes thus ‘evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.’ (Citation.) To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co.¿(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.) Application to Facts            It is undisputed that Defendant did not schedule a deposition within 30 days of the November 15, 2023 order. In fact, it appears that Defendant has not scheduled a deposition of its PMK to date. Defendant asserts that it offered nine different deposition dates to Plaintiff’s council which were not accepted. Defendant offered its first date on December 28, 2023, which was after the 30 day deadline. Defendant only offered one date of January 18, 2024. Subsequently, Defendant offered only one date each time it proposed a date. For example, on January 2, 2024, Defendant offered January 4, 2024; on January 4, 2024, Defendant offered January 25, 2024; etc. (Pappas Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant falsely claims it offered dates for the PMK deposition when it simultaneously offers several cases. For example, Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant offered two dates of availability for 17 different cases. This is shown in an attached exhibit of an email sent by Defendant’s counsel. (Reply, Exhib. 2.)             The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions because Defendant failed to offer dates for deposition of its PMK within 30 days of the November 15, 2023 order, and Defendant’s tactic of offering only one or two dates for multiple plaintiffs demonstrates a lack of good faith. This is sufficient to constitute discovery abuse and Defendant provides no evidence to show that it was substantially justified in its actions. However, the Court finds that issue and/or evidentiary sanctions are not warranted because Defendant has reached out to Plaintiff and attempted to schedule a deposition. Monetary sanctions are sufficient to curb the discovery abuse.Plaintiff requests $2,067.85 in total monetary sanctions, consisting of 7 hours of anticipated work (4 hours motion, 3 hours to review opposition and reply and to attend hearing) at $285 per hour. Plaintiff also requests the motion e-filing fee of $72.85. The Court reduces the request to $1,200.00, which it finds to be reasonable.             CONCLUSION            The Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00.            Moving party to give notice.
