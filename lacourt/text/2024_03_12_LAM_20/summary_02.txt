And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel arbitration. The arbitration agreement is enforceable, and the parties actually entered into an arbitration agreement. The agreement does not require the plaintiffs to pay unreasonable costs or fees, and it provides for neutral arbitrators, more than minimal discovery, and a written award. The agreement does not violate California law governing the costs that may be imposed on an employee in arbitration. The court finds that even if Quinones did not explicitly sign the Employment Transition Letter, there is an implied-in-fact agreement to arbitrate. The court also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable and that the degree of procedural unconscionability is insufficient to render the entire agreement unenforceable.
