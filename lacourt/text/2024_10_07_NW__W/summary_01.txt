Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of person(s) most qualified at defendant General Motors LLC. The plaintiff, Janelle Seitz, filed a complaint against General Motors LLC for breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, and violation of the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The plaintiff leased a new 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 on February 28, 2022, but alleges that the vehicle has not been in a merchantable condition, is not safe, and does not conform to quality and safety guidelines.

The defendant, General Motors LLC, opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer, and that the motion seeks to compel irrelevant testimony and information. The judge found that the meet and confer efforts were sufficient and that the defendant's objections were not fatal to the motion. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00 for spending time preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and attending the hearing.
