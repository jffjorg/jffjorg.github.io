DENIED.
 
On
October 27, 2023, Defendant Seth Meyers served  Requests for Admission, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, on Plaintiffs George Heinen and Jordan Saunders. The
Form Interrogatories, Set Two, contain only Interrogatory Number 17.1, which
relates to Plaintiffs' responses to the RFAs. As of May 3, 2024, when the
present motions were filed, both Plaintiffs had not provided discovery
responses at issue. Defendant now moves the Court to deem the RFAs admitted and
compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories.
Saunders
Discovery
Plaintiff
Jordan Saunders, currently appearing in pro per, did not file an opposition or
any documents showing that responses were served prior to the hearing.
Defendant’s RFA, Set One, to Saunders is deemed admitted. Saunders is ordered to
serve complete and full responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two,
without objection within 30 days of today.
 
Defendant
requests sanctions in the amount of $960.00 per motion. Given the simplicity of
the issues, the Court grants sanctions in the total amount of $960. Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions of $960 to Defendant within 30
days of today’s date.
Heinen Discovery
Plaintiff
George Heinen was initially represented by Robert Gibson. On April 10, 2024,
the Court granted Gibson’s motion to withdraw as counsel.  On June 12, 2024, a substitution of attorney
was filed, and Plaintiff is now represented by Kirk Schenck. In his opposition,
Heinen attached copies of discovery responses served on Defendant prior to the
hearing. The Court examined the responses and noted that they were verified,
fully responded to, and contained no objections. Thus, the present motions
against Heinen are moot.
Regarding sanctions, Heinen’s new counsel alleges that Heinen
had provided discovery responses to the RFAs upon request by prior counsel, but
inexplicably, prior counsel failed to provide discovery responses to Defendant.
Plaintiff and current counsel have done all they could to respond to discovery (Heinen
Decl., ¶¶ 5-8, and Ex. A), and request the Court, if it is so inclined, to
issue sanctions only against Plaintiff’s prior counsel, Gibson.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff Heinen and his current
counsel of record, Kirk Schenck, have known about the present motion since at
least the middle of April 2024; however, the substitution of attorney was not
filed until June 12, 2024, and Schenck did not enter the case on Heinen’s
behalf until that date.  In any event, Heinen
has shown that he emailed his prior counsel responses to the discovery requests
at issue on December 11, 2023. (Exhibit A to Heinen Decl.) Thus, the delay
seems to have been caused by Plaintiff’s former counsel and sanctions against
prior counsel may be appropriate. However, Plaintiff’s prior counsel was not
served with the motion, opposition or any other filing notifying him that
sanctions are requested against him. The Court does not find it appropriate to
issue sanctions against Gibson without first giving him an opportunity to be
heard.
