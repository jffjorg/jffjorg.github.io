MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 6/27/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV04875 DIANAWATI MENJIVAR
vs JOYCE LAI, et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Joyce Lai
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS
GRANTED. 
 On February 8, 2021,
Plaintiff Diannawati Menjivar filed the present Complaint against Defendant
Joyce Lai. On the same day, Plaintiff filed another complaint against Defendant
Travis Saksrudd, case number 21STCV04878. On August 12, 2022, Defendant Saksrudd
filed his answer. On November 28, 2022, Defendant Lai filed her answer.
Defendants then filed cross-complaints against each other for indemnity and
declaratory relief. On December 16, 2022, the Court issued an order granting
Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate this action with the matter of Menjivar v.
Saksrudd, et al., 21STCV04878, and set trial for December 4, 2023. Pursuant
to a written stipulation between the parties, the Court continued the trial to
the current trial date of July 23, 2024. Defendant Lai now moves the Court to
continue the trial date to January 2025.
The reason for the
present motion is to allow more time to complete discovery, including,
specifically Plaintiff’s deposition and Independent Medical Examination (IME).
Furthermore, the parties agreed to a mediation on October 24, 2024, and all
parties signed a stipulation to continue the trial to sometime three months
after the mediation. Although the case was filed on February 8, 2021,
Defendants Lai and Saksrudd filed their answers in mid to late 2022. 
In consideration of the
consolidation and cross-complaints, as well as that the case has only been
continued one other time and all parties signed a stipulation to continue the
trial, the Court finds good cause to continue the trial.  The Court is not convinced the parties need 3
months from mediation (and, further, the Court is not certain why the parties
did not set mediation until October).  Nonetheless,
the Court continues the Trial to January 6, 2025,
at 8:30 a.m, and the Final Status Conference to December 20, 2024, at 10:00
a.m.  All case-related deadlines will
follow the new trial date.
