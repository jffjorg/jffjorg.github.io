Here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to continue the trial date to January 6, 2025. The motion was filed by Defendant Joyce Lai, who seeks more time to complete discovery, including the Plaintiff's deposition and Independent Medical Examination (IME). The Court has considered the consolidation of the case, the cross-complaints filed by the Defendants, and the parties' agreement to a mediation on October 24, 2024. Although the Court is not convinced that the parties need three months from the mediation to complete discovery, it has found good cause to continue the trial date. The Court has also set a Final Status Conference for December 20, 2024.
