Legal Standard 
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time. Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (a).) A plaintiff may
make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without
leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020,
subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number,
but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action
and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd.
(a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Discussion
On May 24, 2023,
Plaintiff Avick Sanchez Partida and Joana Ornelas (“Plaintiffs”) filed their
Complaint. On September 11, 2023, Defendants served an initial set of written
discovery, including Requests for Production of Documents and Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff Avick Partida. Plaintiff received
several extensions, with the final one being March 19, 2024. However, responses
still have not been provided. Defendants now move the Court to compel
responses.
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff Partida failed to serve timely initial responses. Plaintiff did not
file an opposition nor any other document showing that responses were served
prior to the hearing. Thus, the present motions are granted. Plaintiff Partida
is hereby ordered to serve full and complete responses to Defendants’ Form
Interrogatories and Requests for Production, Set One, without objection within
30 days of today.
Defendants request
sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 for each motion. In consideration of the
duplicate nature of the motions, simplicity of the issues, and the lack of
opposition, the Court exercises its discretion and lowers the sanction to a
total amount of $1,300 for both motions. Consequently, the Court sanctions
Plaintiff Partida in the amount of $1,300. Plaintiff and his counsel are ordered,
jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1,300 to Defendants within 30 days
of today’s date.
