And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted and compel initial responses to form interrogatories. The defendant served the RFAs and form interrogatories on the plaintiffs, but the plaintiffs did not provide responses. The judge grants the motion to deem the RFAs admitted and compel initial responses from the plaintiff Jordan Saunders, ordering him to provide responses within 30 days. The judge also grants sanctions in the amount of $960 to the defendant.

The judge denies the motion to deem the RFAs admitted and compel initial responses from the plaintiff George Heinen, as Heinen has already provided responses to the RFAs. The judge notes that Heinen's prior counsel failed to provide discovery responses, but does not grant sanctions against the prior counsel without giving them an opportunity to be heard.
