 Case Number:  21STCV20963    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2023    Dept:  61 Plaintiff George Castro’s Motions
to Compel Further Responses to Form and Special Interrogatories from Defendant
County of Los Angeles are GRANTED as to Form Interrogatory No. 209.2. Defendant shall produce
information concerning cases initiated in or after 2018, filed by current or
former employees of the Probation Department, asserting claims for FEHA
disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, or failure to engage in the
interactive process. The motions are otherwise DENIED. No sanctions are
awarded.
 
I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
Plaintiff George Castro (Plaintiff) moves to
compel further responses from Defendant County of Los Angeles (Defendant) to
Form Interrogatories No. 209.2 and 217.1 and Special Interrogatories No. 39,
40, 43, 66, 67, and 68.  
Form Interrogatory No. 209.2 seeks
information concerning litigation filed by employees of Defendant’s Probation
Department against it within the last ten years, including case numbers and
contact information for litigants and attorneys. Defendant served an initial
response with only objections, including undue burden, and in a supplemental
response reiterated the undue burden objection as to Plaintiff’s proposed
narrowing of the scope of the interrogatory to only five years and for
“similar” actions. (Separate Statement at pp. 2–3.) Form Interrogatory No.
217.1 sought facts and evidence justifying Defendant’s denials of requests for
admission, for which Plaintiff contends that responses as to Requests for
Admission No. 2, 6, 8–10, 15, 16, 18–20, 24–26, and 34 are inadequate.
(Separate Statement at pp. 16–20.)
For the special interrogatories at issue,
Defendant initially responded by reference to Code of Civil Procedure §
2030.030’s limitation to 35 special interrogatories. (Separate Statement at pp.
2–14.) Defendant provided supplemental responses, however, to which Plaintiff
takes issue. These interrogatories sought information concerning Defendant’s
reasons for failing to provide Plaintiff with a chair, for failing to return
him to a previous assignment, and sought information concerning who took over
that assignment and who supervised Plaintiff in the position.
Plaintiff has failed to meet and confer
concerning the special interrogatories. The original responses, which consisted
of objections based on Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.030, were served on July
5, 2022, and supplemental responses were served on October 7, 2022. (Xie Decl.
¶¶ 6–9.) After much meeting and conferring on these responses, including an
IDC, the supplemental responses at issue were served on July 10, 2023. (Xie
Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. 7.) Despite the fact that this supplement constituted the
first provision of substantive responses without reliance on Code of Civil
Procedure § 2030.030, Plaintiff’s counsel states, “I determined that Plaintiff
has exhausted the meet and confer process at this time.” (Xie Decl. ¶ 15.)
There has thus been no conference between the parties on the merits of these
responses or the objections asserted therein. Plaintiff in reply contends that
Defendant refused an extension of time in which to file the present motion, but
presents no evidence or information concerning this request or any other
meet-and-confer efforts that preceded this motion. (Reply at p. 1.) The motion
is therefore DENIED as to the special interrogatories.
The same objection pertains to Form
Interrogatory No. 217.1. Plaintiff takes no issue with the supplemental
responses to this interrogatory, served on July 7, 2023, which concerned RFAs
No. 36–41. (Xie Decl. Exh. 7.) But neither did Plaintiff take any issue with
Defendant’s responses as they concerned RFAs No. 2, 6, 8–10, 15, 16, 18–20,
24–26, and 34, as is demonstrated by the absence of this interrogatory from the
parties’ IDC materials. (See 1/10/2023 and 1/11/2023 IDC Separate
Statements.) The motion is therefore DENIED as to Form Interrogatory No.
217.1.
This objection does not apply, however, to
Form Interrogatory No. 209.2. Defendant raised its undue burden objection in
its initial responses, and only repeated the objection in supplemental
responses, despite Plaintiff’s offers to narrow the scope of the interrogatory
from the preceding ten years of litigation to five, and to limit the scope of
cases to those similar to the FEHA disability claims now remaining in this
case. The parties have conferred on the character of this request and
Defendant’s objection.
“The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.020, subd. (a).) “[T]he party opposing discovery has an
obligation to supply the basis for this determination,” and to provide evidence
“showing the quantum of work required.” (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.) Defendant here presents the declaration of Chereise
Martin, administrative service manager for the Los Angeles County Probation
Department and assigned as manager of the Office of Litigation Management.
(Martin Decl. ¶ 2.) Martin states that the department does not have a system or
tool that allows the search of lawsuit information sought by Plaintiff’s
interrogatory, and that it would have to perform a manual review of approximate
500 complaints (estimating about 100 complaints filed against the probation department
per year) to determine if responsive information existed. (Martin Decl. ¶¶
4–5.) At an estimated 10 minutes per case review, it would take over 80 hours
to provide the responsive information that Plaintiff seeks. (Martin Decl. ¶ 5.)
Defendant’s showing is
unpersuasive. First, the information sought by Plaintiff is relevant to the
subject matter of this litigation. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) Evidence of
the experiences of other employees may be relevant to show discriminatory intent
or policy. (See Pantoja v. Anton (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 87, 115.) Martin’s estimate of 10 minutes per complaint to be
reviewed is excessive. While it may take 10 minutes to process the requested
information for a complaint that is responsive to the interrogatory, it
ought not to take near so much time to determine that a complaint is not
responsive. A determination of “similarity” need not involve in-depth review of
the underlying facts of a complaint, but may be determined, as Defendant
acknowledges in its interrogatory response, by seeing whether a complaint is
one for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, or failure to engage
in the interactive process under FEHA. (Separate Statement at pp. 2–3.) Such a
review is more appropriately conducted by Defendant’s Office of Litigation
Management by reference to the cases it has on file, than by plaintiffs, who
have access only to court records.
The motion is therefore GRANTED
as to Form Interrogatory No. 209.2. Defendant shall produce information
concerning cases initiated in or after 2018, filed by current or former
employees of the Probation Department, asserting claims for FEHA disability discrimination,
failure to accommodate, or failure to engage in the interactive process. The
motions are otherwise DENIED.
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $1,321.60 sanctions for the special
interrogatories motion and $1,115.1 for the form interrogatories motion,
representing a total of 5.9 hours at $413 per hour. (Xie Decl. ¶ 2.) No
sanctions are awarded.
