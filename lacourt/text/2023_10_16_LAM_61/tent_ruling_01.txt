Defendants to provide notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY FEES
“Except as
attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are
entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1021.) 
 
“In any action on a
contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) “[T]he party
prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in
the action on the contract.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
Defendants Danna
Munch, Trilar Management Group, and Arbor Ridge Venture, LLC (Defendants) seek
$428,260.00 in attorney fees and $6,385.00 in costs. (Motion at p. 2.) The
motion is based on the lease agreement executed by Plaintiff Stephanie Greene
(Plaintiff) on August 9, 2018. (Motion Exh. A.) The agreement provides for
attorney fees to be awarded to the prevailing party “[i]n any legal action
brought . . . to enforce this Agreement or relating to the Residence.” (Ibid.)
 
The fee lodestar is
supported by the declaration of Harry Safarian, who provides the qualifications
of the ten attorneys, one paralegal, and one law clerk who performed work on
this action. (Safarian Decl. ¶ 5.) Together these identified individuals
performed 910.6 hours of work at rates ranging from $75 to $850 per hour.
(Safarian Decl. ¶ 7.) Most of the work (572.40 hours) was performed by
attorney Kitty Xie at an hourly rate of $350, and the total average rate is
$465.31 per hour. (Safarian Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff
in opposition contends that she is financially unable to pay any fee award, as
she receives $873 per month from social security, and is without other income
or property. (Opposition at pp. 1–2.) 
However, financial hardship is not a permissible consideration when evaluating
a request for contractual attorney fees. “While
we recognize that an award of contractual attorney fees may be subject to
equitable considerations, we nonetheless conclude a losing party's financial
condition should not be considered in setting the amount of such an award.” (Walker
v. Ticor Title Co. of California. (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 363, 373.) 
The motion is for
the most part well-supported. However, certain fees identified in the hourly
logs presented with the motion are unreasonable. There is one 1.2 hour
($1,020.00) charge for preparing a summary judgment motion which was never
filed, entered on June 12, 2023. (Safarian Decl. Exh. B at p. 7.) The charges
also include $6,135.00 for 16.1 hours of work preparing and defending motions
to compel which were taken off calendar, as well as $3,605.00 for 10.3 hours of
work bringing a motion to compel a second IME, which was also taken off
calendar. The requested lodestar is therefore reduced by $10,760.00.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED in the amount of $417,500.00 in fees and $6,385.00 in costs.
