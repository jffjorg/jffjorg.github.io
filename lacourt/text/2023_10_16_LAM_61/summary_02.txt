And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff George Castro's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 209.2, which seeks information about cases initiated in or after 2018 filed by current or former employees of the Probation Department, asserting claims for FEHA disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, or failure to engage in the interactive process. The judge finds that Defendant County of Los Angeles's objection to the interrogatory is unpersuasive, as the information sought is relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and Defendant's Office of Litigation Management can easily search for the requested information.

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 39, 40, 43, 66, 67, and 68, as well as Form Interrogatory No. 217.1, due to Plaintiff's failure to meet and confer on the merits of the responses.

The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith.
