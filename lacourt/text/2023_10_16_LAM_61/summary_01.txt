And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $417,500.00 in fees and $6,385.00 in costs. The motion is based on the lease agreement executed by the plaintiff on August 9, 2018, which provides for attorney fees to be awarded to the prevailing party. The fee lodestar is supported by the declaration of Harry Safarian, which shows that the defendants' attorneys spent 910.6 hours on the case at rates ranging from $75 to $850 per hour. The plaintiff in opposition argued that she is financially unable to pay any fee award, but the court ruled that financial hardship is not a permissible consideration when evaluating a request for contractual attorney fees. The court reduced the requested lodestar by $10,760.00 due to certain unreasonable fees identified in the hourly logs.
