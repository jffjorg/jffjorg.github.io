  Hearing Date:  April 30, 2024
  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
  Plaintiff's motion TO vacate
  DISMISSAL
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
This
is an unlawful detainer action.  Plaintiff
855 Moraga Properties, LLC owns the property located at 855 Moraga Drive #6 Los
Angeles, CA 90049 (the “Property”). 
Defendant Kristie Capozzoli leased the Property from Plaintiff.  Plaintiff claims Defendant has failed to pay
rent for the months of October to November 2023.  
The
court set a trial date on the unlawful detainer action for March 27, 2024 at
9:00 a.m.  At the date of trial,
Plaintiff appeared in person, but Plaintiff’s counsel appeared by phone.  Plaintiff’s counsel requested a continuance
of the trial.  The Court denied the
request and dismissed the case.
This
hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal.  Plaintiff submits the declaration of counsel
which avers that the failure to appear in person was due to counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect in failing to ensure that an attorney from
counsel’s law firm could appear for the trial. 
While an attorney was originally scheduled to appear for the trial, that
attorney later notified the office at 4:27 p.m. on March 26, 2024 that he was
unavailable for this appearance.  The
firm had approximately 50 court proceedings scheduled for March 27, 2024, and
counsel was not able to find another attorney to appear in person for the
trial.  As such, counsel scheduled for an
attorney to appear remotely and request a continuance, but the request was
denied.  There was no opposition filed as
of the posting of this tentative ruling. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both
discretionary and mandatory relief are available to parties when a case is
dismissed.  Discretionary relief is
available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).) 
Alternatively, mandatory relief is available
when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 
(Id.)  The purpose of the
attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden
of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to
avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th
61, 64.)  Mandatory relief is
available even if counsel’s neglect was inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los
Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–517.)  
An application for discretionary or mandatory
relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v.
IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)
“[W]hen relief under section
473 is available, there is a
strong public policy in favor of granting relief and
allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Any doubt in
applying section 473, subdivision (b), must be resolved in favor of the party
seeking relief.  (Bonzer v. City of
Huntington Park
(1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 1474, 1477-1478.)  
Where relief is promptly sought and no prejudice would be
done to the opposing party, only very slight evidence is required to justify
the setting aside of a default.  For
this reason, orders denying relief under section 473 are carefully scrutinized
on appeal. ( Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal..4th 975, 980; Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227,
233.)
DISCUSSION
The mandatory relief provision of §473(b)
refers to both “default judgment or dismissal”.  The inclusion of “dismissal” by the
Legislature was intended to “put plaintiffs whose cases are dismissed for
failing to respond to a dismissal motion on the same footing with defendants
who are defaulted for failing to respond to an action.”  (Jackson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals,
Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 166, 175.).  
However, although the language of the
mandatory provision, on its face, affords relief from unspecified ‘dismissals’ caused
by attorney neglect, “our courts have, through judicial construction, prevented
it from being used indiscriminately by plaintiffs’ attorneys as a ‘perfect
escape hatch’ to undo dismissals of civil cases.”  (Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee
v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency
(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 961, 967.)  
Courts have construed the provision as reaching only dismissals
that are “procedurally equivalent to a default.”  (Jackson, 32 Cal.App.4th at
174.)  Dismissals that are sufficiently
distinct from a default, thereby falling outside the scope of the mandatory provision, include “dismissals for
failure to prosecute, dismissals for failure to serve a complaint within three
years, dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations and voluntary
dismissals entered pursuant to settlement.” (Leader v. Health
Industries of America Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.)  
Here,
the dismissal was due to a scheduling error, and therefore, mandatory relief is
available.  Plaintiff’s counsel submits a
declaration stating that his office failed to
schedule an attorney to appear at the trial. 
(Minassian Decl., ¶4.)  As
Plaintiff has timely sought relief from the dismissal pursuant to an attorney affidavit
of fault, it is entitled to mandatory relief. 
The March 27, 2024 dismissal is vacated.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’
motion to vacate dismissal under Code Civ. Proc. §473(b).  The action is reinstated.  The Court sets a case management conference
for May 6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
