And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the complaint filed by Defendant Michael Brown in an unlawful detainer action. The complaint alleges that Defendants failed to pay rent and that a notice to pay rent or surrender possession was served. The demurrer argues that the complaint is devoid of specific allegations and that the cause of action for unlawful detainer fails to state any facts evincing all requisite requirements. The court finds that the demurrer is untimely and lacks merit. The court concludes that the plaintiff has properly alleged all essential elements of a cause of action for unlawful detainer and that the defendant's demurrer is without basis. The court overrules the demurrer and allows the case to proceed.
