                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
SHAHIN KHAJAYI, 
 
                        Defendant.


 
  Case No.: 
  23SMCV01184
 
  Hearing Date:  April 30, 2024
  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO vacate
  DISMISSAL
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
This is an unlawful detainer action.  Plaintiff Huili Guo (“Landlord”) is the owner
of real property located at 1937 S. Beverly Glen Blvd, Apt 20, Los Angeles, California
(the “Property”).  Landlord leased the
Property to Defendant Shahin Khajavi (“Tenant”).  However, Khajavi does not live on the
Property; instead, the Property is occupied by his ex-wife (Nazgol Hemmatian)
and his son.  Landlord claims Khajavi has
failed to pay rent due on the lease.  
Plaintiff
filed a request to enter default judgment which was rejected by the Clerk’s
Office on October 24, 2023 due to a lack of signatures.  On the same date, Plaintiff re-submitted the
package with signatures and received notification that the packet was accepted
and filed with the Court.  
The
Court set an OSC for November 20, 2023 as to why the case should not be
dismissed for failure to file a default/default judgment package.  That hearing was continued to February 15,
2024.  On February 15, 2024, the Court
dismissed the action without prejudice, concluding that Plaintiff had not
complied with the prior court order to file a default package.   
This
hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal.  Plaintiff argues that he submitted the
default package on October 24, 2023, and there was therefore no basis for the
Court’s dismissal of his Complaint.   
LEGAL
STANDARD
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both
discretionary and mandatory relief are available to parties when a case is
dismissed.  Discretionary relief is
available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).) 
Alternatively, mandatory relief is available
when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 
(Id.)  The purpose of the
attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden
of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to
avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th
61, 64.)  Mandatory relief is
available even if counsel’s neglect was inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los
Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–517.)  
An application for discretionary or mandatory
relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v.
IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)
“[W]hen relief under section
473 is available, there is a
strong public policy in favor of granting relief and
allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Any doubt in
applying section 473, subdivision (b), must be resolved in favor of the party
seeking relief.  (Bonzer v. City of
Huntington Park
(1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 1474, 1477-1478.)  
Where relief is promptly sought and no prejudice would be
done to the opposing party, only very slight evidence is required to justify
the setting aside of a default.  For
this reason, orders denying relief under section 473 are carefully scrutinized
on appeal. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal..4th 975, 980; Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227,
233.)
DISCUSSION
The
Court erroneously dismissed the action, believing that Plaintiff had not
corrected the errors noted in the Clerk’s rejection of Plaintiff’s original
default package.  In fact, Plaintiff
corrected the errors on the same date as the rejection.  Therefore, the Court vacates the dismissal of
the action.  
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate dismissal under Code Civ. Proc. §473(b).  The action is reinstated.  The Court sets a hearing on Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment for May 6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
