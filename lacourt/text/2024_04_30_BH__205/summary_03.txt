And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Huili Guo, is the owner of a property in Los Angeles and is suing the defendant, Shahin Khajavi, for rent due on a lease. The court previously dismissed the action without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a prior court order. However, the plaintiff argues that they corrected the errors in the default package on the same day as the rejection. The judge has determined that the court erred in dismissing the action and has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and a hearing is set for the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment.
