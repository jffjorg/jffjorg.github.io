  Case Number:  23STCV14982    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion for Order Approval of Settlement
Pursuant to Private Attorneys General Act
 
The Motion for Order Approval of Settlement Pursuant
to Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) filed by Plaintiff Johnny Perez on 10/21/24
and 11/15/24 is granted. 
 
Background
Johnny Perez,
individually and on behalf of all other aggrieved employees (“Plaintiff”) filed
this PAGA case against Additive Circuits Technologies LLC (“ACT”), Data
Technology Printed Circuits LLC, and Winonics LLC d/b/a Bench 2 Bench
Technologies alleging that he and similarly situated employees suffered various
labor law violations by their joint employers. The Complaint alleges the sole
cause of action for Violation of PAGA.  
Plaintiff filed a Motion
re: Approval of Settlement Pursuant to PAGA. It is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard
Under PAGA, an aggrieved
employee may bring a civil action personally and on behalf of other current or
former employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code violations.¿ (Iskanian
v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 380.)¿ Under
PAGA, 75 percent of any penalties recovered go to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency (“LWDA”), leaving the remaining 25 percent for the
employees.¿ (Ibid.)¿ PAGA is intended “to augment the limited enforcement
capability of [LWDA] by empowering employees to enforce the Labor Code as
representatives of the Agency.”¿ (Id. at p. 383.)¿ A judgment in a PAGA action
binds all those, including nonparty aggrieved employees, who would be bound by
a judgment in an action brought by the government.¿ (Id. at p. 381.)¿A
superior court must “review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)¿¿ 
Though there is no
statutory or common law standard for approval of a PAGA settlement, the
standard used for approval of class action settlements is instructive. 
“[A]¿presumption¿of¿fairness¿exists
where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm's-length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.” (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.) The last factor, small percentage of objectors, is
inapplicable to PAGA claims. (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 984-985 [rejecting the argument that representative actions under
PAGA violate the due process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are
not given notice of, and an opportunity to be heard”].) Additional factors that
are useful to consider include the strength of a plaintiff’s case, the risk,
expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the amount
offered in settlement, the extent of discovery completed, and the experience
and views of counsel. (See Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 116, 128.)¿
Analysis 
A.    The
Settlement Amount and Distributions are Reasonable
The proposed $100,000.00
settlement breaks down to a net settlement of $42,590.03 following the
deduction of $33,000.00 in attorney’s fees, $11,919.97.00 in costs, a $8,000.00
incentive award, and $4,490.00 in settlement administration costs. (Motion at pp.
1-2; Scott Wheeler Decl. ¶¶ 3, 14, Exh. A at ¶ 31-33.) 
The parties propose the
standard¿distribution of 75% to the State ($31,882.50) and 25% to the aggrieved
employees ($10,627.50). (Ibid.) The parties have not provided an
estimated average payment to each employee, but the settlement provides that
each employee shall be paid on a pro rata basis. (Id., at ¶ 33(c).) The
parties gave the LWDA notice of the settlement. (Scott Wheeler Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 3.)¿

The requested attorney’s
fees are acceptable under the common fund doctrine and are substantially less
than the pre-multiplier lodestar amount of $62,252.50 that Plaintiff’s counsels
would otherwise receive for their work. (Consumer Privacy Cases (2009)
175 Cal. App. 4th 545, 557; Scott Wheeler Decl. ¶¶ 39-49.) Given the work
completed by Plaintiff’s counsels on this case (e.g., legal research,
discovery, damages analysis, mediation, etc.), the fee award is reasonable.¿¿
B.     The
Settlement is Non-Reversionary
The settlement is
non-reversionary. Mailed checks will remain valid for 180 days, after which the
value of any uncashed checks will be distributed to the California Controller’s
Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the aggrieved employee. (Scott Wheeler
Decl., Exh. A at ¶¶ 42.)
C.     The
Aggrieved Employee’s Releases are Narrow and Plaintiff’s Release is Broad
In exchange for the
settlement amount of money, Plaintiff will provide Defendant with a general
release of all PAGA, underlying, and other claims, including a waiver of Civil
Code section 1542, but aggrieved employees will only be releasing their PAGA
penalty claims.¿¿(Scott Wheeler Decl., Exh. A at ¶¶ 34-35.)
D.    The
Settlement is Presumptively Fair
The parties reached the
proposed settlement through arms-length mediation following a review of ACT’s
records and in spite ACT’s denial of liability. The parties reached this
settlement after extensive mediation efforts with an experienced mediator. (Motion
at pg. 9; Scott Wheeler Decl. ¶ 3.) Accordingly, the settlement is entitled to
a presumption of fairness.¿¿ (Clark v. American Residential Services LLC
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 785, 800 [(“The court undoubtedly should give
considerable weight to the competency and integrity of counsel and the
involvement of a neutral mediator in assuring itself that a settlement
agreement represents an arm’s-length transaction entered without self-dealing
or other potential misconduct.”].)
The terms of the
settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the gamut of
Plaintiff’s claims, ACT’s potential defenses, possible reductions in any
eventual PAGA award, and the posture of this case. (Motion at pp. 2-7, Scott
Wheeler Decl. ¶¶ 9-26; See Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008)168
Cal. App. 4th 116, 130 [“The most important factor is the strength of the case
for plaintiffs on the merits, balanced against the amount offered in
settlement.”].) The proposed fee, cost, and incentive awards appear to be
reasonable as well. Ultimately, there appears to be no other reason
countenancing denial of the motion.
Conclusion
             Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for
approval of PAGA settlement is granted. The Court will sign the proposed judgment
submitted by Plaintiff.
