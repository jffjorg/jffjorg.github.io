And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the employment discrimination case filed by Kelly Lee Salido against Royal Bank of Canada, Joanne Arago, and City National Bank. The defendant, City National Bank, has moved to compel arbitration under the Mutual Agreement for Arbitration of Disputes, which was signed by Salido when she began working for the bank. The court has taken judicial notice of six court filings submitted by the defendant.

The court has found that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable to a low level because it is a contract of adhesion, but has determined that the substantive unconscionability of the agreement is limited to one item: the scope of the agreement is too broad and encompasses claims unrelated to Salido's employment. The court has also found that the agreement lacks mutuality because it allows non-signatory third parties to enforce the agreement.

However, the court has decided to sever one provision of the agreement, which grants enforcement rights to non-signatory third parties, and has granted the motion to compel arbitration. The case is stayed pending completion of the arbitration.
