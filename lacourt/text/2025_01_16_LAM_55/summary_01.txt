Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for order approval of the settlement agreement filed by Plaintiff Johnny Perez, individually and on behalf of all other aggrieved employees, against Additive Circuits Technologies LLC, Data Technology Printed Circuits LLC, and Winonics LLC d/b/a Bench 2 Bench Technologies. The settlement agreement is based on the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and alleges labor law violations by the defendants.

The judge finds that the settlement amount of $100,000.00 is reasonable, and that the parties reached the proposed settlement through arms-length mediation. The settlement provides for 75% of the amount to go to the State and 25% to the aggrieved employees. The judge also approves the attorney's fees, costs, and incentive awards proposed by the parties.

The judge notes that the settlement is non-reversionary, meaning that uncashed checks will be distributed to the California Controller's Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the aggrieved employee. The judge also finds that the releases provided by the parties are narrow and that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness.

Based on the foregoing, the judge grants the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement and will sign the proposed judgment submitted by Plaintiff.
