Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff William Lezama
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) as to
Defendants Emmanuel Romero (“Defendant Romero”) and KAS Produce, Inc.
(“Defendant KAS Produce”).  Plaintiff
also moves to have requests for admissions (Set One) deemed admitted as to
Defendants Romero and KAS Produce.  There
are eight motions in total.  
This matter arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on May 12, 2022. On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendants alleging negligence.  
Legal
Standards
 
A.  
 Motions to Compel Responses. 
 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) 
 
The
party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days
after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to
an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If
a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or interrogatories,
the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
The
party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion to compel and the
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff served
Defendants Emmanuel Romero and KAS Produce, Inc. with Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents
and Request for Admissions (Set One) prior to the assignment of Counsel. (Woods
Decl., ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff extended the
deadline to respond to September 6, 2023. (Martinez Decl., ¶ 6.) Defendant KAS
Produce served responses on October 24, 2023. (Woods Decl., ¶ 9.)  No responses have been obtained from
Defendant Romero. (Woods Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s
motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) as to Defendant KAS Produce
are DENIED as MOOT.    
Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses
to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production
of Documents (Set One) as to Defendant Romero are GRANTED.  Responses are due in 30 days.  
 
 
 
B.   Deem
Requests for Admissions Admitted 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to requests for admissions, a “requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).” 
The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted
“unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
On October 24, 2023, Defendant KAS Produce served verified
responses prior to the hearing. (Woods Decl., ¶ 10.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to have requests for admissions (Set One) deemed admitted as to
Defendant KAS Produce is DENIED as MOOT.
No
responses have been provided by Defendant Romero.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to
have requests for admissions (Set One) deemed admitted as to Defendant Romero
is GRANTED.  The genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s motion is
admitted.   
 
C.   Sanctions 
 
Additionally,
failure to respond to discovery requests is misuse of the discovery process
subject to sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) The court is required to
award monetary sanctions against Defendant unless Defendant can show they
“acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The monetary sanction shall be in the
amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Counsel for
Plaintiff requests eight separate awards of sanctions. 
 
Sanctions as to
Defendant KAS Produce
 
The Court finds that Defendant KAS Produce acted with
substantial justification. Counsel was assigned the matter on August 22, 2023
and communicated such to Plaintiff’s counsel. (Woods Decl., ¶ 7.) The Court
finds it reasonable that Counsel would need additional time to acquire the
information necessary to answer the discovery requests. Further, Counsel
subsequently provided responses to Plaintiff. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against
Defendant KAS Produce is DENIED. 
Sanctions as to Defendant Romero 
Plaintiff requests four different sanctions as it pertains
to Defendant Romero.  For each motion
Plaintiff requests $1,311.65 in sanctions (2.0 hours preparing the motion, .5 for
reviewing the opposition, 1.5 for preparing the reply and an hour for the Court
appearance at $250.00 and $61.65 filing fee.) 
Using the lodestar method and taking into consideration the
similarity of the motions, the simplicity of the motion, and the lack of any
reply, the Court awards total reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,871.60 (5.0
hours for preparing all of the motions, 1 hour reviewing the oppositions, and
half an hour to appear at the hearing, plus reimbursement of the four filing
fees of $61.65 each.)  
The Court also finds that Counsel for Defendant Romero has met
the burden to show they are blameless for the failure to answer the discovery
requests. (Woods Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Weinkauf v. Superior Court (1966) 64
Cal.App.2d 662, 665 (burden of proof is on attorney to show it was blameless
for failure to answer interrogatories).) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant Romero is GRANTED as to Defendant
Romero only, payable within 30 days.
