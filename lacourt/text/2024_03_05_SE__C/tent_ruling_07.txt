 Case Number:  23NWCV04111    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  C Pozo v. County Records
Research Inc., Case No. 23NWCV04111
This is a real estate foreclosure
action. This is a renewed application. Plaintiff seeks a temporary restraining
order to stay foreclosure on the property known as 228 N. Hicks Avenue, Los
Angeles, California 90063.  On December 27, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s TRO on representations from Plaintiff that the property was his
primary residence and that Defendants did not contact Plaintiff to explore
options to avoid foreclosure in violation of CCP § 2923.5.  The TRO was
unopposed.  On January 31, 2024, the Court dissolved the TRO and denied a
Preliminary Injunction because Defendants produced evidence that the property
was not in livable condition at the time Plaintiff declared he was occupying it
as his primary residence.  
A party may seek ex
parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable harm,
immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c); Newsom v. Super. Ct.
(Gallagher) (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1093, 1097.)
Plaintiff has not argued
irreparable harm or immediate danger. Plaintiff asserts that injunctive relief
is proper because the matter involves land, but this is different from arguing
irreparable harm or immediate danger. (Ex parte application, pg. 4.)
Further, none of the cases Plaintiff cites in support of his assertion are
about ex parte relief.  Plaintiff also has not argued another
statutory basis for granting ex parte relief.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s ex parte application for a temporary restraining order to stay
foreclosure is DENIED.  
Moving party to give notice.
