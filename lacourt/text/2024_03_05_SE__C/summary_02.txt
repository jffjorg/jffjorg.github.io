And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a partition action case. Court-appointed referee Andrew Zimbaldi has applied ex parte to authorize the retention of a lawyer and a real estate professional to assist with the sale of a subject real property. Zimbaldi asserts that he needs immediate assistance due to the precarious health of defendant Martha Clark, who occupies the property, and that the sale process has been delayed for several months as a result. The court finds that ex parte relief is warranted to facilitate the sale of the property, and grants Zimbaldi's application.
