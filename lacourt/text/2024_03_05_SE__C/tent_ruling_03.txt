Background 
On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Realty Specialties, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for breach of contract, violation of Penal Code
§ 496, and conversion against Defendants Sher Singh Gill (Gill) and Satvinder
S. Ghotra.
On July 31, 2023, Gill served his first set of Form
Interrogatories by email based on an agreement of the parties to accept service
by e-mail. (Gevorkian Decl. re Form Interrogatories ¶ 4, Exhibit A; Gevorkian
Decl. re Special Interrogatories ¶ 4, Exhibit A; Gevorkian Decl. re Requests
for Production ¶ 4, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff was required to serve written
responses by September 1, 2023. (Gevorkian Decl. re Form Interrogatories ¶ 5;
Gevorkian Decl. re Special Interrogatories ¶ 5; Gevorkian Decl. re Request for
Production ¶ 5.) Gill argues Plaintiff failed to serve written responses. (Gevorkian
Decl. re Form Interrogatories ¶ 5; Gevorkian Decl. re Special Interrogatories ¶
5; Gevorkian Decl. re Request for Production ¶ 5.)
As of February 27, 2024, no responses as been filed.

Motions to Compel Responses 
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030. A party may
propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject
matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion 
Defendant Gill contends that Plaintiff failed to serve any
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, or Requests for
Production. (Gevorkian Decl. re Form Interrogatories ¶¶ 5-6; Gevorkian Decl. re
Special Interrogatories ¶¶ 5-6; Gevorkian Decl. re Request for Production ¶¶
5-6.)
Defendant Gill served all the discovery requests on
Plaintiff on July 31, 2023.  Plaintiff was required to respond
by September 1, 2023, but did not do so. 
Plaintiff did not request any extensions and ultimately failed to provide
discovery responses. 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motions to compel are GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to respond to the request for production of
documents and form and special interrogatories within 30 days, without
objection, including objections based on privilege or
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300 subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  For the
interrogatories, the failure to respond also waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. 
 
2.   
Sanctions 
Legal
Standard 
Misuse of the discovery process constituting conduct subject
to sanctions include “failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method
of discovery” and “failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with
an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve
informally any dispute concerning discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (d) and (i).) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) All discovery motions require a meet and confer declaration stating
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Discussion

The court is required to award monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff unless Plaintiff can show it “acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The
monetary sanction shall be in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.) Counsel for Defendant Gill requests three separate awards
of sanctions. 
 
1.   
For the Form Interrogatories:
$1,601.50
for: 1 hour preparing the motion .2 hours spent by supervising Counsel David
Almaraz reviewing and editing the instant motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours
analyzing the anticipated opposition and preparing a reply, and .5 hours by
Counsel Almaraz attending the hearing. Counsel Gevorkian hourly rate is $450.00
and Counsel Almaraz hourly rate is $ 595.00. 
2.   
For the Special Interrogatories:
$1,601.50
for: 1 hour preparing the motion .2 hours spent by supervising Counsel David
Almaraz reviewing and editing the instant motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours
analyzing the anticipated opposition and preparing a reply, and .5 hours by
Counsel Almaraz attending the hearing. Counsel Gevorkian hourly rate is $450.00
and Counsel Almaraz hourly rate is $ 595.00. 
3.   
For the Requests for Production:
$1,601.50
for: 1 hour preparing the motion .2 hours spent by supervising Counsel David
Almaraz reviewing and editing the instant motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours
analyzing the anticipated opposition and preparing a reply, and .5 hours by
Counsel Almaraz attending the hearing. Counsel Gevorkian hourly rate is $450.00
and Counsel Almaraz hourly rate is $ 595.00. 
Utilizing a lodestar
approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances including
Defendant’s lack of opposition, and the similarity of the motions to each
other, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees
and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending
motions against Defendant is $2,004.50 reflecting 3 hours incurred at $450.00
per hour and 1.1 hours at $595.00 per hour (three hours for drafting all the
motions, .6 for Counsel Almaraz reviewing and editing all the videos, and a
half hour for attending the hearing on the three motions).  Costs consist of the $60 filing fee for each motion.
