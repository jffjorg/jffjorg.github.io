And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order to stay foreclosure on the property at 228 N. Hicks Avenue in Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff had previously obtained a temporary restraining order, but it was dissolved and a preliminary injunction was denied after defendants presented evidence that the property was not in livable condition when the plaintiff claimed it was his primary residence. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not argued irreparable harm or immediate danger, and that the plaintiff's assertion of injunctive relief is not based on statutory grounds. As such, the judge denies the plaintiff's ex parte application.
