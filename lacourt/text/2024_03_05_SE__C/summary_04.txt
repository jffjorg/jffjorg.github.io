And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of South Gate has brought a public nuisance action against Delacruz, et al., seeking to abate the substandard conditions at a subject property. The City has appointed a receiver, Blake C. Alsbrook, to oversee the remediation of the property. The receiver has applied for ex parte relief to advance the motion for entry of an order, which would allow the receiver to proceed with the remediation plan, borrow funds if necessary, and retain a real estate broker to list the property for sale if necessary. The judge has granted the ex parte application, finding that the receiver has shown irreparable harm and immediate danger. The motion is advanced to today's date and continued to March 19, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. The receiver is ordered to give notice.
