The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Masai McDougall, counsel for MMC Capital Fund, Inc., Jamal Dawood, Firestone Finance Corp., White Eagle Properties Corp., Seyed Madaen, and Christine Armani, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted based on the grounds of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which is supported by the attorney's declaration. The order will take effect when the proposed order relieving counsel and proofs of service of the signed order are filed with the court. The judge notes that California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires a proposed order relieving counsel to be filed, but counsel has not done so.
