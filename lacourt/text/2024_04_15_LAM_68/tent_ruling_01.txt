SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 17, 2018, Plaintiff Brightview Assets, LTD, a British Virgin Island
Company (Brightview), file a complaint against SBE Restaurant Group, a Nevada
Limited Company (SBE), KBM Holdco, LTD., a British Virgin Island Company, and
KBM Operating LTD.., a Bahamas Company for Breach of Oral Contract, Breach Of
Implied -In fact Contract, Breach of Written Contract, Unjust Enrichment, Money
Had And Received, Accounting, and Declaratory Relief. On January 16, 201`9, the
court sustained the demurrer of SBE to the fourth cause of action without leave
to amend, and the granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claim with
20 days leave to amend. On February 27, 2019, SBE answered and filed a
cross-complaint against Brightview for Fraud, Breach of Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraudulent Concealment,
Negligent Misrepresentation, and Accounting. 
 
On
August 6, 2019, the court denied the “hearing on the motion for forum non
conveniens.” On November 15, 2021, the court entered the parties’ stipulation
to stay the case pending completion of binding arbitration. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendants
SBE Restaurant Group, a Nevada Limited Company (SBE), KBM Holdco, LTD., a
British Virgin Island Company, and KBM Operating LTD.., a Bahamas Company move
to confirm the arbitration award. On January 21, 2024, the arbitrator awarded
as follows: “1. Claimant is to take nothing on its claims as against
Respondents. 2. Respondent SBE is to take nothing on its counterclaims as
against Claimant. 3. Based upon their CCP section 998 offer which was rejected,
Respondents are jointly to take $91,177.24 in costs as against Claimant.”
Plaintiff Brightview Assets, LTD, a British Virgin Island Company (Brightview)
in response challenges the award on grounds that the arbitrator exceeded
authority in awarding $91,177.24 in costs pursuant to the rejected 998 offer.
 
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects
or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) The challenge to the
petition was timely filed within the 100-day window following the January 21,
2024, issued final award. (Eternity
Investments, Inc. v. Brown (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 739, 745.)
 
A party may move to correct an arbitration award on
grounds that “(b) The arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy
submitted...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.6.) “[A]rbitrators do not ‘exceed[ ]
their powers” within the meaning of section 1286.2, subdivision (d) and section
1286.6, subdivision (b) merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a legal or
factual issue, so long as the issue was within the scope of the controversy
submitted to the arbitrators. “The arbitrator's resolution of these issues is
what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.’” (Moshonov v. Walsh (2000)
22 Cal.4th 771, 776 accord Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1,
28; Roehl v. Ritchie (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 338, 348; Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc. v. Intel Corp. (1994) 9 Cal.4th 362, 381-383.) “It is
well settled that ‘arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely because they
assign an erroneous reason for their decision.’” (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase,
supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 28.)
 
The
agreement requires the arbitrator adhere to substantive California law and JAMS
Comprehensive Rules: “The substantive law of California and either the
California Arbitration Act or the Federal Arbitration Act together with the
JAMS Comprehensive Rules shall apply in this proceeding unless the parties
otherwise agree in writing. Should an issue arise as to whether the CAA or the
FAA applies, the parties will brief the issue and the Arbitrator will rule
thereon.” [Declaration of John K. Ly, Ex. B.] While California law provides for
cost recovery against a party rejecting a 998 offer, Brightview contends JAMS
rules contain no such provision. Brightview improperly cites unpublished United
States District Court opinion in support of the standard, which the court
cannot rely upon in any ruling. (Blade Room Group, LLC v.
Emerson Electric Co. (N.D. Cal., Dec. 11,
2019, No. 5:15-CV-01370-EJD) 2019 WL 13036321; Zamani v. Carnes (N.D. Cal.,
Aug. 25, 2009, No. C-03-00852-RMW) 2009 WL 2710108.) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.1115(a); see Rittiman v. Public Utilities
Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote
18).)
 
The arbitration award itself provides the following in support of
the cost award: “In
their closing briefing, Respondents sought ‘costs.’ Subsequent to the initial
issuance of this Award Respondents sought specific costs based on a CCP section
998 offer they had made prior to the Hearing. The Arbitrator had the parties
brief the issue and, by memo dated January 20, 2024, found that Respondents
were entitled to costs in the amount of 91,177.24.” 
 
Brightview
strenuously emphasizes the lack of any fee allocation rule within the JAMS
Comprehensive Rules. Defendants in reply specifically rebut this argument by
citation to JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures rule 24,
subdivision (f): “The Award of the Arbitrator may allocate Arbitration fees
and Arbitrator compensation and expenses, unless such an allocation is
expressly prohibited by the Parties’ Agreement. (Such a prohibition may not
limit the power of the Arbitrator to allocate Arbitration fees and Arbitrator
compensation and expenses pursuant to Rule 31(c).)” [Declaration of Diyari
Vazquez, Ex. C.]
 
While
Brightview omits acknowledgment of this rule, Brightview instead seeks to
challenge the impact of the rule by specifically challenging the lack of any
specific to Code of Civil Procedure 998 recovery provisions within the
contractual agreement itself. The argument relies on a presumption that the
omitted provision renders the parties jointly responsible for their individual
costs. Rule 24 specifically references Rule 31(c), which Defendants include for
reference, and identified as JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures
• Effective June 1, 2021. The rule states in its entirety:
 
“Except
as provided in paragraph (c) below, unless the Parties have agreed to a
different allocation, each Party shall pay its pro rata share of JAMS fees and
expenses as set forth in the JAMS fee schedule in effect at the time of the
commencement of the Arbitration. To the extent possible, the allocation of such
fees and expenses shall not be disclosed to the Arbitrator. JAMS’ agreement to
render services is jointly with the Party and the attorney or other
representative of the Party in the Arbitration. The non-payment of fees may
result in an administrative suspension of the case in accordance with Rule
6(c). 
(b)
JAMS requires that the Parties deposit the fees and expenses for the
Arbitration from time to time during the course of the proceedings and prior to
the Hearing. The Arbitrator may preclude a Party that has failed to deposit its
pro rata or agreed-upon share of the fees and expenses from offering evidence
of any affirmative claim at the Hearing.
(c)
If an Arbitration is based on a clause or agreement that is required as a
condition of employment, the only fee that an Employee may be required to pay
is the initial JAMS Case Management Fee. JAMS does not preclude an Employee
from contributing to administrative and Arbitrator fees and expenses. If an
Arbitration is not based on a clause or agreement that is required as a
condition of employment, the Parties are jointly and severally liable for the
payment of JAMS Arbitration fees and Arbitrator compensation and expenses. In
the event that one Party has paid more than its share of such fees,
compensation and expenses, the Arbitrator may award against any other Party any
such fees, compensation and expenses that such Party owes with respect to the
Arbitration.” [Vazquez Decl., Ex. H.]
 
The language of Rule 24 references employment arbitration, and the
court therefore assumes the “JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures •
Effective June 1, 2021” in fact references the subject rule. The reference to
the rule however fails to establish applicability to the subject commercial
non-employment dispute. Fee shifting statutes in employment contexts adhere to
differing standards in order to protect the rights of the employee against the
employer. The court finds no public policy argument in support of such
considerations for the subject dispute. In addition to the lack of
acknowledgment of rule 24 cited above, Brightview otherwise dismisses the
agreed upon arbitration rules regarding substantive California law. 
 
“‘Absent an express and unambiguous limitation in the contract or
the submission to arbitration, an arbitrator has the authority to find the
facts, interpret the contract, and award any relief rationally related to his
or her factual findings and contractual interpretation.’ (Citation.) This principle
extends specifically to costs: If the parties’ agreement does ‘not limit the
issues to be resolved through arbitration, the issue of [a party's] entitlement
to ... costs, as requested in his complaint, [is] subject to determination in
arbitration proceedings.’” (Heimlich v. Shivji
(2019) 7 Cal.5th 350, 358; Pilimai v. Farmers Ins. Exchange Co.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 133, 150; Cohen v. TNP 2008 Participating Notes Program,
LLC (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 840, 873 [“‘[a]n exception to the general
rule assigning broad powers to the arbitrator[ ] arises when the parties have,
in either the contract or an agreed submission to arbitration, explicitly and
unambiguously limited those powers’”]; Storm v. Standard Fire
Insurance Company (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 636, 645-646.) The determination of the
right to recovery of costs lies within the discretion of the arbitrator
pursuant to the language of the arbitration agreement. (Heimlich
v. Shivji, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 358.) 
 
Nothing
in the response establishes wrongful reliance on substantive California law,
including section 998, as provided in the contract for arbitration, thereby
constituting a basis for establishing an excess exercise of authority. Assuming
the arbitrator was also aware of Rule 31(c), as referenced in Rule 24, again, the court finds no basis of support for consideration
of the public policy implications behind rule 31. Thus, even if the employment
arbitration rule 31 applies, the court finds the arbitrator properly relied on
the contractual terms allowing for the substantive adoption of California
substantive law and JAMS Rule 24. Both provisions specifically allow the
arbitrator to impose and allocate costs. Brightview presents no basis for the
disregard of this contractual provision and rule.
 
The court
further finds a lack of support for the argument that a specifically omitted
reference to section 998 precludes recovery notwithstanding the clear basis for
allocation of fees and costs under the acknowledged JAMS governing rules, as
well as adoption of substantive California law. Again, even considering the
argument, the United States Supreme Court only specifically found no explicit
class action provisions barred arbitration. (Stolt-Nielsen
S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp.
(2010) 559 U.S. 662, 673-674, 684-686.) Later cases expanded the ruling to
ambiguous provisions. Brightview raises no substantive argument for ambiguity. (Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela
(2019) 587 U.S. 176, 185; Storm v. Standard Fire
Insurance Company, supra, 52
Cal.App.5th at pp. 645-646.) Again, cost allocation remains a specifically
incorporated item in the parties’ agreement through rule 24 and California
substantive law (e.g. section 998).
 
Finally,
the argument challenging Brightview as not entitled to any costs, as a
non-prevailing party, and the amount of costs recovered, clearly challenges the
factual findings of the arbitrator. As discussed above in the undisputed
standard governing challenges to arbitration awards, the court remains barred
from considering the factual foundation of the award. 
 
Thus, in
summary, the award remains legally available under JAMS and California law. The
arbitrator’s conclusion regarding the determination of a prevailing party and
amount based on date of accrual naturally arises from this finding. The court
therefore grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award. The court
rejects the counter-request for correction of the award.
