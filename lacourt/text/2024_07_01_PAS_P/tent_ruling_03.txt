 Case Number:  22AHCV01382    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative decision on petition to file a late claim: granted
Petitioner Mary Jane Juranek (“Plaintiff”)
applies for relief from claim filing requirements.
The court has read and considered
the moving papers, opposition and reply, and renders the following tentative
decision. A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Plaintiff commenced this action on December
23, 2022.  The Petition alleges in
pertinent part as follows: On December 30, 2020, Plaintiff, a
74-year-old pedestrian, was crossing an intersection on Pine Street and
Marguerita Avenue in Alhambra, California. As Plaintiff crossed the intersection,
she was struck by an automobile operated by Pham, a California-licensed
attorney employed with the County of Los Angeles. Due to the accident, Plaintiff
sustained serious and permanent physical injuries.     During Plaintiff's investigation, on March 11, 2021, Pham declared under penalty of perjury that she was not working or performing any work-related activities for her employer at the time of the accident.  On September 29, 2023, Pham stated in verified discovery responses that she was acting as an agent and/or employee in the course and scope of her employment as a staff attorney for the County of Los Angeles at the time of the accident.  Five days later, on October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a claim for damages with the County, which the County rejected as untimely.  On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
case number 24NNCV01092, which named Los Angeles County as a defendant.  On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff’s claims against
Pham and Los Angeles were consolidated by stipulation. On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a petition for relief from claim filing requirements or, in the
alternative, requested an order that Plaintiff’s claim was timely filed with
the County.
The County filed an opposition to
this petition on June 17, 2024, to which Plaintiff replied on June 24, 2024.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
According to proof of service on
file, Los Angeles County was personally served with the Summons, Petition, and
moving papers on April 23, 2024.  
 
B. Applicable Law
Under the Government Claims Act
(“Act”), a plaintiff bringing suit for monetary damages against a public entity
or employees thereof must first present a claim to the public entity
(“government claim”) which must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the public
entity.  §§945.4, 950.2, 950.6(a).  To be timely, a government claim for damages
must be presented to the public entity within six months of the date the cause
of action accrued.  §911.2. 
If a plaintiff fails to file a government claim within the
six-month period, he or she may apply to the public entity for permission to
file a late claim.  §911.4.  Such an application must be presented within
a reasonable time, and not later than one year after the cause of action’s
accrual.  §911.4(b).  
If the public entity denies the
application for permission to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil
petition for relief from section 945.4's requirement of timely claim
presentation prior to suit.  §946.6.  The petition must be filed within six months
after the application to the public entity is denied or deemed to be
denied.  §946.6(b). The petition must
show: (1) that an application was made to the public entity under section 911.4
and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to timely present
the claim to the public entity within the time limit specified in section
911.2; and (3) the information required by section 910.  §946.6(b).




The court shall grant relief only if it finds that (1) the
application to the public entity for leave to file a late claim was made within
a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of the claim as
specified in section 911.4(b), (2) was denied or deemed denied by the public
agency pursuant to section 911.6,  and
(3) one or more of the following is applicable: (a) the failure to timely
present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect, unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in
the defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the
requirements of section 945.4; (b) the person who sustained the alleged injury,
damage or loss was a minor during all of the time specified in section 911.2
for the presentation of the claim; (c) the person who sustained the alleged
injury, damage or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during all of
the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim and by
reason of that disability failed to present a claim during that time; or (d)
the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss died before the
expiration of the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the
claim.  §946.6(c).
 
C. Statement of
Facts
1. Petitioner’s Evidence
On December 20, 2020, Plaintiff was
severely injured when Pham struck her with her vehicle as Plaintiff crossed the
street in Alhambra, California. (Petition, p. 8.)  Plaintiff suffered the following
accident-related injuries: a traumatic brain injury and fractures to her tibia,
fibula and ankle, all requiring surgical fixation. (Id. at FN 1.)
Pham was a Staff Attorney for Los
Angeles County Child Support Services. (Nevell Decl., ¶ 4.) On March 11, 2021,
Pham declared, under oath, that she was not working or performing any
work-related activity during the accident that occurred the morning of December
30, 2020. (Petition, Exh. A-1, ¶ 7.) Pham declared that her last time working
for the County was 5:00 pm the prior evening. (Nevell Decl., ¶ 4.) Given that
Pham declared she was not acting within the course and scope of her employment
during the accident, Plaintiff and her counsel had no factual grounds to pursue
a claim against the County.  Plaintiff filed a complaint against Pham on December
23, 2022. (Nevell Decl., ¶ 5.)
On September 29, 2023, in verified
responses to written discovery, Pham declared that she was acting within the
course and scope of her employment during the accident because she was “on her
way to attend a court hearing at Central Civil West Courthouse”. (Nevell Decl.,
¶ 6.) With this information, Plaintiff and her counsel filed a claim for
damages with the County on October 4, 2023 under Government Code section 911.2.
(Id., Exh. 1-C.) 
 On November 20, 2023, the County
rejected Plaintiff’s claim as untimely on the grounds that it was not presented
within 6 months of the event or occurrence. (Nevell Decl., ¶ 7,
Ex. 1-D.) 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff submitted
an Application to Present a Late Claim under Government Code sections
911.4-912.2 and 946.6 which was denied. (Nevell Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. 1.) 
 
2. Respondent’s Evidence
On June 17, 2024, the County filed
an opposition to Plaintiff’s petition.
The County argues that Plaintiff’s
counsel was on notice that Pham was on her way to work from her house despite what
was stated in paragraph 7 of her declaration. (Opp’n. p., 2.) According to the
responses to Form Interrogatory No. 211(b), served on Plaintiff on September
29, Pham stated that:
“4. At the time of the accident I
was driving from: Home – 1013 N. Marguerita Ave. Apt. B, Alhambra, CA 91801;
5. At the time of the accident I
was driving to: Central Civil West Courthouse – 600 S. Commonwealth Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90005”
(Opp’n., pp. 3-4.)
            The County
alleges that Plaintiff’s claim is untimely because the motor vehicle vs.
pedestrian accident occurred on December 20, 2020 and Plaintiff’s claim for
damages with the County was filed on October 23, 2023 (34 months or 2-years and
10 months after the subject incident). (Opp’n., pp. 1-2.) The County also argues
that Plaintiff failed to present good cause for the delay in filing because Plaintiff
had sufficient notice of Pham’s relationship with the County and Pham did not
attempt to conceal or misrepresent any facts to the nature of her employment
with the County. (Opp’n., p. 7.)
Further, The County argues that it
will be prejudiced by a grant of Plaintiff’s petition because The County is no
longer allowed the “opportunity to investigate while evidence is fresh and
informing the entity of potential liability so it can adequately present its
budget”. (Opp’n., p. 8.)
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff applies for leave to file a late claim against the County and
advances two arguments to support her position: 1) her claim against the County
is not untimely under the delayed discovery rule because the claim accrued on September
29, 2023 when Pham disclosed for the first time that she was acting within the
course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident; and 2) Plaintiff
is entitled to relief under Government Code section 946.6 because the late
filing of her claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  The County opposes.
The Court agrees that Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under either theory.
 
1. Accrual of the claim
A cause of action accrues at the
time a claim is complete with all of its elements.  Norgart v. Upjohn, (1999) 21 Cal.4th
383, 397.  An exception to this usual
rule exists where accrual is delayed until the plaintiff discovers, or has
reason to discover, the cause of action. 
(Id.)  A plaintiff has
reason to discover a cause of action when he or she “has reason to at least
suspect factual basis for its elements.” 
(Id.)
Plaintiff’s cause of action against
the County accrued on September 29, 2023 when Plaintiff and her counsel first
discovered that Pham was acting within the course and scope of employment at
the time of the accident. (Petition, Exh. 1, ¶ 7.)
 
2. Presentation of the claim
Section 911.2 mandates that claims
based on causes of action for death and personal injury must be presented “not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  
To be timely, Plaintiff was
required to present her claim within six months of September 29, 2023, or by March
29, 2024. §911.2. Plaintiff presented her claim
to The County on October 4, 2023. The claim was timely.
 
3. The application to the
public entity for leave to file a late claim was made within a reasonable time
not to exceed six months after accrual of the claim 
Plaintiff’s claim accrued on September
29, 2023. She was required to present her application to file a late claim by
March 29, 2023. Her application was presented to The County on November 20,
2023, within six months of the accrual.
The County points out that Plaintiff’s
application was made over two years after the car accident and because of this,
the delay in filing was unreasonable. The County argues that this delay would
create prejudice if Plaintiff is granted relief. (Opp’n., p. 8.)
 
4. The application was denied
by the public agency pursuant to Gov. Code section 946.6(c)(1). 
The County denied Plaintiff’s late
claim application on November 20, 2023.  (Petition,
Exh. 1, ¶ 15).
The petition for leave to file a
late claim must be filed with the court within six months after the application
to the public entity is denied or deemed to be denied.  §946.6(b). 
The Petition was filed on April 29, 2024, within six months of the
County’s denial on November 20, 2023. 
The Petition is timely.
 
5. The failure to timely
present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect. 
Alternatively, Plaintiff contends
that her claim against the County was filed in October 2023 due to mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect because her counsel reasonably,
but mistakenly, believed that the County was not implicated in the claim
because Pham was not working as a County employee during the accident, as she
declared.
Timely compliance with the claims
presentation requirement is a mandatory prerequisite to maintaining a cause of
action against a public entity and failure to file a claim is fatal to the
claimant’s cause of action.  (Pacific
Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. County of Riverside, (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d
83, 188; San Leandro Police Officers Assoc. v. City of San Leandro,
(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 553.)  Excusable
neglect is neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person
under the same or similar circumstances. 
(Ebersol v. Cowan, (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435.)  Mere failure to discover a fact does not
constitute excusable neglect for failing to present a timely claim; the party
seeking relief must establish the failure to discover the fact in the exercise
of reasonable diligence.  (Munoz v.
State of California, (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.)  Excusable neglect is defined as an act or
omission that might be expected of a prudent person under similar
circumstances.  (Department of Water
& Power v. Superior Court, (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1294.)  
A mistake or neglect by an attorney
is imputed to the client and may not be offered by the latter as a basis for
relief.  (Mitchell v. Department of
Transportation, (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1016, 1021.)  An exception occurs when an attorney’s
neglect is that extreme degree amounting to positive misconduct by which a
petitioner was effectually and unknowingly deprived of representation. (Carroll
v. Abbott Laboratories, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 892, 898.)
The County argues that Plaintiff’s
mere failure to discover that Pham was acting within her scope as an employee
is insufficient to establish excusable neglect for Plaintiff’s failure to
present a timely claim following the December 2020 accident.
However, Plaintiff has established that
her failure to timely file her claim with the County can be excused because Pham
initially represented that she was not working for the County during the
accident. Pham stated that the last time she worked for the County was at 5:00 pm
on the prior evening. It was reasonable for Plaintiff and her counsel to rely
on Pham’s misrepresentations. Based on these misrepresentations, Plaintiff
mistakenly assumed that there was no need to file a damages claim with the
County.  Considering that Pham’s initial
statements were made in a declaration under oath, Plaintiff had no reason to
doubt the truth of Pham’s statements.  
 E. Conclusion     Plaintiff has demonstrated that her
claim against the County accrued on September 29, 2023 and that she timely filed
that claim with the County.  Alternatively,
if one assumes that the claim was not filed in a timely manner, the Court
agrees that Plaintiff’s failure to timely file her claim with the County was
the result of excusable neglect and the County has not shown that it would be
prejudiced by her failure to present a timely claim.  The petition for relief from claim
presentation requirements is granted.Dated: July 1, 2024 Judge Jared D. Moses
