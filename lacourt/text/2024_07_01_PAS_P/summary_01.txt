And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Attorney Levon Kirakosian's motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Maryam Ghukasian. The attorney seeks to withdraw due to an irretrievably broken attorney-client relationship, citing Defendant's failure to communicate with him and respond to a substitution of attorney notice. The motion is unopposed, and the Court finds that the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's interest. The next hearings in the case are a status conference and order to show cause regarding involuntary dismissal, set for July 9, 2024. Counsel is ordered to file proof of service of the order within 5 days of notice of the ruling, and will be relieved upon filing of proof of service.
