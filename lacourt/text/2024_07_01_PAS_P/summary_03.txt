And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition for relief from claim presentation requirements filed by Mary Jane Juranek (Plaintiff) against Pham and Los Angeles County (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks relief from the claim presentation requirements based on the delayed discovery rule and excusable neglect.

The court finds that the Plaintiff's claim against the County accrued on September 29, 2023, when Pham disclosed for the first time that she was acting within the course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident. The court also finds that the Plaintiff timely filed her claim with the County on October 4, 2023.

Alternatively, if the court assumes that the claim was not filed in a timely manner, it agrees that the Plaintiff's failure to timely file her claim with the County was the result of excusable neglect. The court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to discover that Pham was acting within her scope as an employee was reasonable and that Pham's initial statements were made in a declaration under oath, which made it reasonable for the Plaintiff to rely on them.

The court concludes that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that her claim against the County accrued on September 29, 2023, and that she timely filed that claim with the County. The court also concludes that the County has not shown that it would be prejudiced by the Plaintiff's failure to present a timely claim. Therefore, the petition for relief from claim presentation requirements is granted.
