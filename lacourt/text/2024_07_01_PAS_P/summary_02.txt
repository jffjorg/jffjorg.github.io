And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to stay proceedings pending the determination of the constitutionality of AB 218. The defendant argues that the retroactive application of AB 218 violates the Gift Clause of the California Constitution, which prohibits gifts of public funds. The plaintiff argues that the cases pending before the Court of Appeal are unrelated to the instant case and that the motion is premature and would cause prejudice to the plaintiff if granted. The court finds that there is too much uncertainty regarding the outcome of the cases on appeal and declines to stay the proceedings.
