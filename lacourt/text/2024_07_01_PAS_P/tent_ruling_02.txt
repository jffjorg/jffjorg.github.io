 Case Number:  22AHCV01240    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION  TO STAYI.                 INTRODUCTION             Plaintiff Jane Doe A.T., (“Plaintiff”) sues Defendant  DOE 1, a California municipal entity, on her own behalf, under California Code  of Civil Procedure section 340.1. DOE 1 was amended to the City of South Pasadena  on February 3, 2023 (“Defendant”). Plaintiff’s claim arises from an alleged childhood  sexual assault.  Plaintiff alleges that  the assault occurred in 1973 and was perpetrated by now deceased Wayne Vernon  White (“White”), at the time a law enforcement officer with the South Pasadena  Police Department. Plaintiff further alleges that she was 12 years old, and  White was at least 30 years old.              Defendant  filed a motion to stay proceedings, concurrently with a motion for judgment on  the pleadings on April 26, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to  stay proceedings on June 17, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on June 24, 2024. Before the Court  is a motion by Defendant to stay the proceedings pending a determination by one  or more appellate court of the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill  218 (“AB 218”). Following the reasoning below, the motion is DENIED. II.        LEGAL  STANDARD             CCP  Section 128(a)(8) provides that courts have the inherent power to amend and  control their processes and orders to conform to justice. (CCP § 128(a)(8).) Whether  or not to grant a stay “where the issues in [the] actions are substantially  identical is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Thompson  v. Continental Ins. Co. (1967) 66 Cal.2d 738, 746, citations omitted.)  Duplicative lawsuits are disfavored. (Bistawros v. Greenberg (1987) 189  Cal.App.3d 189, 191.) The definition of a related case includes cases that: “[i]nvolve  the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims.” (CRC 3.300(a)(1).)               Additionally,  the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction provides that when two  California superior courts have simultaneous jurisdiction over the subject  matter and parties in a case, “the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive  and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved  until such time as all necessarily related matters have been resolved.” (People  ex rel. Garamendi (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-70, citations omitted.) III.      ANALYSIS As a preliminary  matter, the Court grants the request for judicial notice.  In the accompanying motion for judgment on  the pleadings, Defendant argues that the retroactive application of AB 218  violates Article XVI, Section 6 of the California Constitution. Under the  Government Claims Act, no person may sue a public entity or public employee for  money or damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied  by the public entity.  (County of Los  Angeles v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.)  Absent an applicable exception, failure to  timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff  from filing suit against that entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit  against that entity.  (State of  California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.) Currently, claims  brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 for damages resulting from  childhood sexual abuse are exempt from the claims presentation  requirement.  (See Gov. Code, § 905,  subd. (m).)  Before the passage of AB  218, Government Code section 905, subdivision (m) limited the exception to the  claim presentation requirement to childhood sexual abuse claims arising out of  conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009.   When AB 218 became law in October 2019, it amended section 340.1 to revive  expired claims and enlarged the time to file suit.  AB 218 also (1) amended Government Code  section 905, subdivision (m) by deleting the language limiting the claim  presentation exception to claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after  January 1, 2009, and (2) added Government Code section 905, subdivision (p),  which made this change retroactive.  Defendant  challenges AB 218 as unconstitutional in that it violates California  Constitution, Article XVI, section 6, which prohibits gifts of public funds  (also referred to by the parties as the “Gift Clause”).  The Gift Clause states, in relevant part,  that the Legislature shall have no “power to make any gift or authorize the  making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual,  municipal or other corporation whatever.”   (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 7.)   “[T[he term ‘gift’ includes ‘all appropriations of public money for  which there is no authority or enforceable claim, even if there is a moral or  equitable obligation.’”  (Jordan v.  California Dept. of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [citing Conlin  v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17, 21-22 (Conlin)].)  Defendant argues  that AB 218 is a gift of public funds that violates the Gift Clause by excusing  compliance with the Government Claims Act.   Defendant does not dispute the Legislature’s authority to enlarge or  amend a statute of limitations to revive claims; instead, it argues that timely  claim presentation is a substantive element of any cause of action against a  public entity and is not merely a procedural requirement.  Therefore, Defendant contends, AB 218 is  unconstitutional because it creates liability for past acts where no right to  recovery previously existed.  Defendant  relies on California Supreme Court cases which it admits are old but insists  are still on point and therefore controlling.   In one of these cases, Chapman v. State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693,  the Supreme Court stated that “the legislature has no power to create a  liability against the state for any . . . past act of negligence.”  Subsequently, in Heron v. Riley (1930)  209 Cal. 507, 517, the Supreme Court stated that the imposition of liability  for a past act of negligence “would, in effect, be the making of a gift.”  The crux of Defendant’s  argument in favor of a stay is that there are currently two cases pending before  California Courts of Appeal that address the precise argument Defendant  advances in this case regarding the constitutionality of AB 218.  These cases, pending before the First and  Second District of the Court of Appeal, are West Contra Costa Unified School  District v. Superior Court, Case No. A169314, and Roe # 2, A Public  Elementary School District v. The Superior Court of Santa Barbara, Case No.  B334707.) Defendant declares that the  Courts of Appeal “appear poised to imminently decide” those matters.  According to Defendant, the resolution of  those matters will provide much needed certainty in the present case, conserve  time and resources, and allow settlement discussions to move forward.In opposition, Plaintiff  argues that the instant case is completely unrelated to the cases on appeal  because the parties, facts, and witnesses are distinct. Plaintiff cites a  United States Supreme Court decision for the proposition that “there is no power by a  stay to compel an unwilling litigant to wait upon the outcome of a controversy  to which he is a stranger.” Landis v. North American Co. (1936) 299 U.S.  248, 255. Given the indefinite nature of the Court of Appeal publishing a  decision on the “Gift Clause,” Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s motion is  premature and would cause prejudice to Plaintiff if granted. (Opp’n., p. 7.) In reply, Defendant  argues that factually identical matters are not a prerequisite to granting  stays. (Reply, p. 4.) Defendant maintains that it has suffered prejudice and  that the factors determining whether a stay is granted are relevant. Namely  the Farmland factors evaluate the weight of the following in granting a  stay: (1) the importance of discouraging multiple litigation designed solely to  harass an adverse party, (2) avoiding conflicts with the courts of other  jurisdictions, and (3) whether the rights of the parties can best be determined  by the court of the other jurisdiction because of the nature of the subject  matter the availability of witnesses or the stage to which proceedings in the  court have already advanced. (Farmland Irrigation Co. v. Dopplmaier  (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208, 215 and Caiafa Prof. L. Corp. v. State  Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 800, 804; Reply, pp. 2-3.)  Particularly, Defendant argues that it would be best served by a stay to  allocate insurance funds because its present insurance coverage and settlement  funds do not contain funds to compensate Plaintiff through settlement or the  payment of defense funds. (Reply p. 3, Valencia Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Lastly,  Defendant emphasizes judicial economy and the impact of the Court of Appeal’s  decision across the state. While there may be  some merit to Defendant’s contentions, the Court is unwilling to indefinitely  suspend proceedings in this action.  There  is far too much uncertainty regarding the outcome of the cases on appeal.  While Defendant believes that decisions in  those matters are imminent, that is far from guaranteed  One decision may issue in the near future while the other may issue many months down the line. Furthermore, no one can say what those  outcomes might be.  As Plaintiff notes,  there may be unpublished decisions of no precedential value.  Both courts may agree that AB 218 is constitutional.  Both courts may agree that AB 218 is unconstitutional. The courts may disagree and offer  diametrically opposed opinions, which would only create more uncertainty.  One court could issue a published opinion while the other issues an unpublished opinion.  The Court declines to stay this action given all of these uncertainties.
