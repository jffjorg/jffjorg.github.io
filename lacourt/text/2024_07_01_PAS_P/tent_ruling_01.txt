  Case Number:  19GDCV00188    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING ATTORNEY LEVON
KIRAKOSIAN’S MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS ATTORNEY OF RECORD FOR DEFENDANT MARYAM
GHUKASIAN


The Court may issue an
order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation after notice to the
client. (CCP § 284.) The attorney may
withdraw from representation as
long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's
interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Attorney Levon Kirakosian seeks to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant Maryam Ghukasian. Mr. Kirakosian asserts that
he is seeking to withdraw because the attorney-client relationship is
irretrievably broken. Specifically, he declares that Ms. Ghukasian has “stopped
communicating with Attorney” and has not responded to the substitution of
attorney sent twice, necessitating this motion. (MC-052 Item 2.) The motion is unopposed.
Mr. Kirakosian has complied with all procedural requirements, including giving
notice of this hearing to his client.
 
The next hearings in this case are a status
conference and order to show cause regarding involuntary dismissal, both on July
9, 2024. The motion was filed 2/14/24, giving Ms. Ghukasian plenty of time to
find new counsel or to oppose. Therefore, this is not a critical point in the
litigation.
 
THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL IS TO FILE
PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON PLAINTIFF WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER.
