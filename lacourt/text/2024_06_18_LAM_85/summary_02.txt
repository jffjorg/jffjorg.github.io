And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the testimony of Enriquez and Lopez, as well as the Incident Report and other documents, and has identified several discrepancies and inaccuracies. Specifically, Enriquez did not state in his Incident Report that the bag of narcotics was in the backseat of the patrol vehicle, contrary to what Lopez testified. Additionally, Lopez testified that a female deputy took her out of the patrol vehicle and into the station for booking, but the court was unable to identify this deputy. The court also found that the County's citations for several facts are incorrect. The court will consider these facts and others as it makes its final ruling in this case.
