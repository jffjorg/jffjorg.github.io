found that Enriquez stated in the Incident Report that the narcotics were “in
the backseat of the patrol vehicle” but told Lt. Colton that they were “shoved
under the driver’s seat.”  AR 155-56.  This is not true.  Enriquez wrote in his Incident Report that he
observed the bag of narcotics after Lopez stepped out of the rear of the
vehicle.  At no point did he state it was
“in the backseat.”  AR 370.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12, n. 3.
