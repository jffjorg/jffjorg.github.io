 Case Number:  23STCV31283    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
H&H Retail Owner, LLC v.
Bezel America Inc., et al.., 23STCV31283
 
Tentative decision on application
for writ of attachment: granted 




 




 
 
H&H Retail Owner,
LLC (“H&H” or “Landlord”) applies for right to attach orders against Bezel
America In., doing business as Jinya Ramen Bar (“Tenant”), Dawen Gao (“Gao”)
and Yaping Zhu (“Zhu”) for $536,877.76 which included estimated costs of
$10,000 and estimated allowable attorney fees of $20,999.85. 
The court has read and
considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and renders the
following tentative decision.  
 
A.   
Statement
of the Case
1.     
Complaint
Plaintiff H&H filed
the Complaint on December 22, 2023 against Defendants Tenant, Gao, and Zhu for
breach of lease and breach of guaranty. 
H&H is the landlord and Defendant Tenant is the tenant of real
property located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard, Suite 317, Hollywood, California,
90028 (“Premises”).  
 
a.      Lease
History
On or about February
3, 2015, Landlord and Tenant entered into a written Lease (“Lease”) of the
Premises for a term of approximately ten years. 
In connection with the execution of the Lease, Zhu and Gao
(collectively, “Guarantors”) signed the Guaranty of the Lease.  
            The
Lease was thereafter amended by the First Amendment to the Lease dated August
19, 2016 (“First Amendment”).
On or about December 3, 2020, the Lease was amended by the
Second Amendment to the Lease (“Second Amendment”), extending the Lease to
March 31, 2029.  The Second Amendment
also abated Minimum Annual Rent, Additional Rent, Percentage Rent and Marketing
Assessment Charges for the months of April, May, and June 2020, as well as 50%
of the charges for the months of November and December 2020. The foregoing
abated charges were conditioned upon Tenant’s full, faithful and punctual
performance of its obligations under the Lease and the Second Amendment.
 
b.      Lease
Terms
Section 4.2 of the Lease requires Tenant to pay Minimum
Annual Rent of $45,000 (“MAR”) in 12 equal monthly installments.  
            Section
4.4 of the lease requires Tenant to pay “Additional Rent,” which refers to all
sums of money required to be paid or reimbursed under the Lease with the
exception of MAR pursuant to Exhibit B “Defined Terms.” 
            Section
2.7 of the Lease requires Tenant to pay “Storage Rent” in the amount of $35.30
per square foot of the approximately 170 additional space leased to Tenant
(“Storage Space”).  The Storage Rent
increases by 3% of the previous year’s charge on the first day of each year
during the Lease term. 
            Section
7.3(b) of the Lease requires Tenant to its share of “Common Area Expense” in
the manner provided in Section 4.4.
            Section
6.2 of the Lease requires Tenant to pay “Utilities Charges” and “Chilled Water
Charges” in accordance with Section 4.4(a). 
            Section
8.2 of the Lease requires Tenant to pay Marketing Assessment in equal monthly
installments, and the Marketing Assessment increases by 3% starting on the
first January following the Rent Commencement Date, and on each January 1st
thereafter.       
The Second Amendment to the Lease abated MAR, Additional
Rent, Percentage Rent and Marketing Assessment Charges for the months of April
2020, May 2020 and June 2020 (the “April to June Abated Charges”), as well as
50% of the Charges for the months of November 2020 and December 2020 (“Abated
Charges”). The Abated Charges are “absolutely conditioned upon Tenant’s full,
faithful and punctual performance of its obligations under the Lease and this
Amendment” pursuant to section 3.3 of the Second Amendment. 
Section 16.1 defines the failure to pay
any MAR or Additional Rent as an event of default.  Section 16.2 requires
Landlord to provide three days’ written notice and demand to cure such default
to Tenant.  If Tenant then fails to do so, Landlord can terminate the
Lease, repossess the Premises, and pursue any other rights or remedies under
state law. 
Section 24 of the Lease allows the
prevailing party in any action based on a breach of the Lease to recover
attorney’s fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.  This includes
any costs of collecting unpaid rent from the Tenant. 
 
c.      
Default
Tenant has had an outstanding balance of amounts owed under
the Lease since approximately April 1, 2020.
On or about October 3, 2023, Landlord’s counsel served on
Tenant a Demand for Payment of Rent (“Demand Notice”) that advised Tenant that
it owes an outstanding balance of $274,279.43 and requested that the same be
paid within three days.  The Demand
Notice further informed Tenant that if Tenant does not cure the outstanding
amount within 3 days, Landlord reserves all rights to pursue all of its legal
remedies, including bringing an action against Tenant for all outstanding
amounts of rent owed under the Lease, reclaiming the Abated Charges and
accelerating the balance of the amortized rent from the First Amendment. 
Defendants have failed and refused, and continues to fail
and refuse, to comply with its obligations as outlined in the Lease and
Guaranty
As to the first and
second causes of action, Landlord seeks compensatory damages of rent owed to
date according to proof but which Landlord estimates to exceed $457,144.33,
together with interest at the maximum allowable legal rate and for compensatory
damages consisting of future rent owed for the remainder of the lease term
according to proof but which Landlord estimates to exceed $330,699.01, together
with interest at the maximum allowable legal rate. On all causes of action,
Landlord seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other relief as the court
deems proper. 
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
On February 13,
2024, Tenant and Guarantor filed their joint Answer to the Complaint.
On May 9,
2024, pursuant to written stipulation, the court continued hearing on
application for writ of attachment to June 18, 2024. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be secured
should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must make a prima
facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment against the
plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. Lease, Guaranty, and Amendments
On or about February 3, 2015, Landlord and Tenant entered into a written
the Lease for a term of approximately ten years for the Premises.  Gomez Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.   In connection with the
Lease, Guarantors signed the Guaranty of the Lease.  Gomez
Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.  Tenant agreed to pay a
MAR of $45,000 in 12 equal monthly installments due on the first of each
month.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§ 1.9, 4.2.  It would also pay Storage
Rent, Additional Rent, Common Area Expenses, Utility Charges and Chilled Water
Charges, and Marketing Assessment Charges. 
Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 17-33, Ex. A, §§ 2.7, 4.4, 7.3(b), 6.2, 6.4, 8.2.  
An event of default includes failure to
pay any of the MAR or Additional Rent, as well as failure to fully and promptly
perform any covenant or condition of the Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶12, Ex. A,
§§ 16.1(a), (c).  To enforce its rights
following a tenant’s default for failure to pay amounts owed, Landlord needs to
give written notice of the nature of the default and demand cure of such within
three days.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §16.2(a).  The period to cure a
default based on section 16(c) must be reasonable and not exceed 30 days. 
Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §16.2(c). 
If the tenant failed to cure the default,
Landlord can terminate the Lease, repossess the Premises, and continue to
recover rent as it became due notwithstanding the repossession.  Gomez
Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§ 16.3(a)-(c).  Landlord’s damages include (a) all
unpaid rent at the time of termination, (b) the amount of unpaid rent that
would have accrued at the time of an award to that effect, less any loss the
tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided, (c) the worth, at the time of
award, of unpaid rent that will accrue from the time of award to the end of the
Lease, less any loss the tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided, and
(d) any other amount necessary compensate Landlord for, inter alia,
retaking the Premises and maintaining them after default, including attorney’s
fees and costs.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A,
§§ 16.4(a)-(d).  
In August 2020, Landlord and Tenant
entered into the First Amendment to the Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶4, Ex. C. 
The Lease Term was extended so that the Expiration Date became March 31, 2028,
and Tenant agreed to pay Amortized Payments for Tenant’s Delay in the amount of
$1,737.86 per month, commencing June 1, 2016 and continuing through March 31,
2027.  Gomez Decl., ¶4, Ex. C.   
On or about December 3, 2020, Landlord
and Tenant entered into the Second Amendment to the Lease, extending it to March
31, 2029.  Gomez Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  Conditioned on Tenant’s
full, faithful and punctual performance of its obligations under the Lease and
the Second Amendment, Landlord abated MAR, Additional Rent, Percentage Rent and
Marketing Assessment Charges for the months of April, May, and June 2020, as
well as 50% of the Charges for the months of November 2020 and December 2020.  Gomez Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  If Tenant defaulted and failed to cure such
default, its right to the Abated Charges would cease and damages would include
Landlord’s recovery of any Abated Charges.  Gomez Decl., ¶37, Ex. D, §3.3.   
 
2. Notice of
Default 
Tenant first failed to pay Minimum Rent or Additional Rent
pursuant to the Lease on or about April 1, 2020 and nearly every month
thereafter through present.  Gomez Decl.,
¶8.  
On or about October 3, 2023, Landlord’s counsel served the
Demand Notice advising Tenant and Guarantors that Tenant owes an outstanding
balance of $274,279.43 and requested that the same be paid within three days.  Goodkin Decl., ¶2, Ex. F.  The Demand Notice further informed Defendants
that if Tenant did not cure the outstanding amount within 3 days, Landlord
reserves all rights to pursue all of its legal remedies, including bringing an
action against Tenant and Guarantors for all outstanding amounts of rent owed
under the Lease, reclaiming the Abated Charges and accelerating the balance of
the amortized rent from the First Amendment. 
Gomez Decl., ¶2, Ex. F.  More
than three days elapsed after the service of the Demand Notice with Defendants
failing to respond to Landlord and failing to pay the entire amounts set forth
in the demand letter. Goodkin Decl., ¶3. 
Defendants continue to fail
to comply with their obligations as outlined in the Lease and Guaranty.  Gomez Decl., ¶13; Goodkin Decl., ¶3.  Landlord is the current owner of the Premises
and holds all rights and title under the Lease. 
Gomez Decl., ¶6.  Tenant is
presently still in possession of the Premises. 
Gomez Decl., ¶7.
 
3. Damages 
At the time of the filing of this Application, Landlord is
owed $505,877.91 in past Rent due and Additional Rent for the months of and
between April 2020 and February 2024.  Gomez
Decl., ¶¶ 11, 39-41; Ex. E.  
The total amount owed was calculated by: (1) determining the
monthly amount of Base Rent ($213,498.41), Storage Rent ($28,471.19), Chilled
Water charges ($2,952.55), other Water charges ($20,510.86), Common Area
Expenses ($345,423.25), Marketing Assessment Charges ($11,870.92), Tenant Delay
Charges ($144,003.55) and Abated Charges ($33,508.68) owed between April 2020
and February 2024, (2) determining the amount of credits and payments made by
Tenant between April 2020 and February 2024, (3) adding the total amount of
Base Rent, Storage Rent, Chilled Water charges, other Water charges, Common Area
Expenses, Marketing Assessment Charges, Tenant Delay Charges and Abated Charges
owed between April 2020 and February 2024 in the total amount of $800,239.41,
and (5) offsetting the $800,239.41 owed by credits and Tenant payments in the
total amount of $294,361.50, for a total owed of $505,877.91.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 39-41. 
Section 24 of the Lease allows the
prevailing party in any action based on a breach of the Lease to recover
attorney’s fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.  This includes
any costs of collecting unpaid rent from the Tenant.  Gomez Decl., ¶43.  At the time of the filing of this
Application, Landlord’s attorney’s fees totaled more than $20,999.85.  Landlord’s counsel charges the following rates
for such services: $450.00 per hour for partners, $325.00-365.00 per hour for
associates, and $95.00 per hour for law clerks.  Landlord is seeking to include $20,999.85 in
attorney’s fees to the writ of attachment. 
Goodkin Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Landlord applies for right to attach orders
against Defendant Tenant and Defendant Guarantors in the amount of $536,877.76,
which includes $10,000 in estimated costs and $20,999.85
in estimated attorney’s fees.  Defendants
have not opposed.
 
1. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which
Attachment May Be Based
A writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a
claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).
Plaintiff Landlord’s claim stems from Tenant’s and
Guarantors’ non-payment of rent under the Lease and is for $536,877.76, which
exceeds the $500 minimum claim amount for issuing an attachment.  CCP §483.010(a).  This is a claim on which attachment may be
based.
 
2. An Amount Due
That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable 
A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be
readily ascertained by reference to the contract and the basis of the
calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated is
not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
Landlord has calculated the amounts owed under the Lease and
credited Tenant payments.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶
39-42, Ex. E.  The amount owed of $505,877.91
is readily ascertainable.
Landlord also seeks
estimated costs of $10,000 and estimated attorney’s fees of $20,999.85.  The attorney’s fees are supported by
declaration (Goodkin Decl., ¶¶ 6-7), but the costs are not, and they are
disallowed.  The readily ascertainable
amount due is $526,877.76.
 
3. Probability of
Success
A claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than
not that the plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190. 
In determining this issue, the court must consider the relative merits
of the positions of the respective parties. 
Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does
not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be
made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Landlord shows that Tenant
entered into the Lease, as amended through the Second Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4, 5, Exs. A, C, D.  In connection with the Lease,
Guarantors entered into the Guaranty of the Lease.  Gomez
Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.  Tenant breached the Lease as amended by not
paying rent beginning on or about April 1, 2020 and nearly every month
thereafter through present.  Gomez Decl.,
¶8.  
On or about October 3, 2023, Landlord’s counsel served the
Demand Notice advising Tenant and Guarantors that they owe an outstanding
balance of $274,279.43 and requested that the same be paid within three days.  Goodkin Decl., ¶2, Ex. F.  Defendants failed to respond or
cure.  Goodkin Decl., ¶3. 
            Landlord has shown a
probability of success on its claims.
 
4. Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
conduct of a trade, business, or profession is generally activity “which
occupies the time, attention and effort. . . for the purpose of livelihood or
profit on a continuing basis.”  Nakasone
v. Randall, (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 757, 764 (quoting Advance Transformer
Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 134).  “The term ‘business,’ therefore, embraces any
activity engaged in for profit or for gain.  The phrase ‘engaged in business,’ however,
generally is held to imply business activity of a frequent or continuous
nature.”  Id.  There is a distinction between one who spends
his time and effort in carrying on an activity for livelihood or profit on a
continuing basis and one who merely conserves his personal investments.  Id.
            The
Guaranty states that Guarantors have a financial interest in Tenant.  Ex. B. 
Gao is Tenant’s CEO and Zhu is Tenant’s Vice-President.  Ex. A. 
Landlord’s claim against Guarantors on their Guaranty arises out of
their conduct of a business and is a commercial claim.
 
5. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
Attachment must not be sought for a purpose other than the
recovery for the claims upon which attachment is based.  CCP
§484.090(a)(3).  Landlord seeks attachment for a proper purpose.
 
6. Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            The
applications against Guarantors state that Landlord seeks to attach all
property subject to attachment under CCP section 487.010(c).  Although it may be objectionable to simply
refer to a statute, Guarantors fail to do so.
 
E. Conclusion
The application for a right
to attach order is granted against each Defendant in the amount of $526,877.76.  No writ shall issue for any Defendant until Landlord
posts a $10,000 undertaking for that Defendant.
