```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies without prejudice the plaintiff's motion to seal via redaction records relating to the confidential settlement and compromise of the pending action. The motion lacks a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing of the records, as required by California Rules of Court (CRC) Rules 2.551. The court also finds that the parties' agreement to keep documents secret is not sufficient to seal records. The court orders that the plaintiff provide a public redacted version of the petition and order approving the compromise, as required by CRC Rule 2.551.
