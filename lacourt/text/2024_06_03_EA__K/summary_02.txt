And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied a motion to strike portions of a complaint filed by Guilmer's Trucking and Efrain Ramos Leon. The motion sought to strike specific allegations from the complaint, including claims of intentional tort, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge found that the allegations were not conclusory and that the defendants had not met their burden of showing that the allegations were not supported by the evidence. The judge also noted that the defendants had not shown any prejudice as a result of the allegedly improper allegations. The case is set for a case management conference on June 3, 2024.
