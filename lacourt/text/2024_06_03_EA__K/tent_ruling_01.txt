Legal
Standard
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rules 2.550 and 2.551
govern records sealed or proposed to be sealed by court order. “Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open.”
(CRC Rule 2.550, subd. (c).)
“A party requesting that a record be filed under seal must
file a motion or application for an order sealing the record.” (CRC Rule 2.551,
subd. (b)(1).) “The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum
and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” (Id.) “A request to seal a document. . . must
be supported by a factual declaration or affidavit explaining the particular
needs of the case.” (In re Marriage of
Lechowick (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416.)
Under CRC 2.550:
The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:
 
(1)       There exists an overriding interest that
overcomes the right of public access to the record; 
(2)       The
overriding interest supports sealing the record; 
(3)       A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced
if the record is not sealed; 
(4)       The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored;
and 
(5)       No less restrictive means exist to achieve
the overriding interest.
(CRC Rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
Additionally, “[a]n order
sealing the record must []. . . [s]pecifically state the facts that support the
findings; and [d]irect the sealing of only those documents and pages or, if
reasonably practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the
material that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each
document or page must be included in the public file.” (CRC Rule 2.550, subd.
(e)(1).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court for an order directing the sealing via redaction of (1) the settlement
amounts and/or the structuring of those settlement amounts contained within
Plaintiff’s Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action (“Petition”); (2)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s percentage-based fee; (3) any corresponding order
regarding the Petition and (4) any reference in the record (including redaction
of confidential settlement terms from the hearing transcript, if any) related
to specific dollar amounts detailed in the settlement and compromise of this
case. Plaintiff also requests that any discussion at any future hearing
regarding the settlement amounts be closed to the public or, alternatively,
discussed with all counsel at a sidebar or in chambers.
The motion is denied
without prejudice. The motion is not accompanied by a declaration
“containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing,” as per CRC Rule 2.551,
subdivision (b)(1). The motion is not accompanied by a public redacted version
of the Petition, Order Approving Petition and Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked
Account, as per CRC Rule 2.551, subdivision (b)(5) [“If necessary to
prevent disclosure, any motion or application, any opposition, and any
supporting documents must be filed in a public redacted version and lodged in a
complete, unredacted version conditionally under seal. The cover of the
redacted version must identify it as ‘Public-Redacts materials from
conditionally sealed record.’ The cover of the unredacted version must identify
it as ‘May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from
conditionally sealed record’”].
The fact that the parties agreed to keep documents secret is
not sufficient to seal records. (CRC Rule 2.551, subd. (a) [“The court must not
permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or
stipulation of the parties”]. Enforcement of a binding contractual obligation
not to disclose may be an overriding interest sufficient to justify sealing
records. (See NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV),
Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1223, fn. 46.) However, the
Second District Court of Appeal in Universal
City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273,
determined that a settlement agreement which had a confidentiality provision
could not be sealed unless there was a showing of serious injury which would
result from public disclosure. Here, there is no showing of serious injury that
would result from disclosure of the details of the settlement agreement.
