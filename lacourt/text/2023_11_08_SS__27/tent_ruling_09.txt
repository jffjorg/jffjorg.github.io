[1] The Answer of the Bhagat
Defendants set forth a general denial and raised the following four affirmative
defenses: (1) comparative fault of Plaintiff’s decedent; (2) comparative fault
of others; (3) failure to state a cause of action; and (4) failure to state
facts sufficient to justify the imposition of punitive damages. 


[2] This motion has a reservation
identification number ending in 1741. 


[3] This motion has a reservation

[4] This motion has a reservation
identification number ending in 4673. 


[5] The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
citation to City and County of San Francisco v. Strahlendorf (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1911 is inapposite to support Plaintiff’s contention that the
Bhagat Defendants have waived their right to bring a motion to strike punitive
damages. Code Civ. Proc. § 436 allows the Court to strike all or part of a
pleading at any time in its discretion. The Court therefore will consider the
Bhagat Motion to Strike. 


[6] The Court will analyze the
Bhagat Demurrer as a demurrer only. The Bhagat Defendants cannot seek to
avoid the filing fee by combining a demurrer with a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. The Bhagat Defendants should have filed a separate motion for
judgment on the pleadings if such relief was sought. In their moving papers,
the Bhagat Defendants request that the Court sustain the demurrer and besides
citing the legal standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings, make no
reasoned argument warranting such relief.
