And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike punitive damages brought by the Bhagat Defendants. The judge finds that the plaintiff's citation to a previous case is not relevant to the issue at hand. The judge will consider the motion to strike and will also analyze the Bhagat Defendants' demurrer as a demurrer only. The judge notes that the Bhagat Defendants should have filed a separate motion for judgment on the pleadings if they sought such relief. The judge will not sustain the demurrer without a reasoned argument from the Bhagat Defendants.
