I.           
INTRODUCTION
This action arises out of a
slip and fall incident that occurred at an El Super store. On June 1, 2022,
Plaintiff Maria Margarita Carranza (“Plaintiff”) filed this premises liability action
against Defendants, Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super (“El Super”) (erroneously
sued as “El Super”) and Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. (“GBS”) (erroneously
sued as Gallagher Bassett, Svcs, Inc. D1-10). 
On December 22, 2022, the
Court granted Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s complaint and allowed
Plaintiff twenty days leave to amend her complaint. (12/22/2022 Minute Order.)
On April 4, 2023,
Defendants filed their motion to dismiss. On April 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to
file an amended complaint. On July 25, 2023, the Court denied Defendants’
motion to dismiss and denied Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended
complaint (07/25/2023 Minute Order.)
On September 21, 2023, Defendants
filed this instant motion to dismiss. On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
addendum to the complaint. On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
II.          
Judicial Notice
Plaintiff requests the
Court to take judicial notice of the Ex Parte Application for Writ of
Possession. The Court finds that it is not necessary to take judicial notice of
the Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for Writ of Possession in the instant
case. The request for judicial notice is DENIED. Although the Court declines to
take judicial notice of this document, the Court nonetheless considers it as
evidence.  
III.       
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may dismiss a complaint when,
after a motion to strike the whole of the complaint is granted with leave to
amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and
either party moves for dismissal.  (CCP §
581(f)(4).)   
A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed.  (CCP § 472(a)
(emphasis added).)  “After expiration of
the time in which a pleading can be amended as a matter of course, the pleading
can only be amended by obtaining the permission of the court.”  (Leader v. Health Industries of America,
Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.) 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, ... in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding …”  (CCP § 473(a)(1) (emphasis added).)  “Assuming proper notice, the trial court has
wide discretion in determining whether to allow the amendment, but the
appropriate exercise of that discretion requires the trial court to consider a
number of factors: ‘including the conduct of the moving party and the belated
presentation of the amendment. ... The law is well settled that a long-deferred
presentation of the proposed amendment without a showing of excuse for the
delay is itself a significant factor to uphold the trial court's denial of the
amendment.’”  (Leader, supra, 89
Cal.App.4th at p. 613 (citations omitted).) 
“[F]ailure to file an amended complaint
within the time allowed by the court subjected any subsequently filed pleading
to a motion to strike, either by defendants or on the court's own motion.”  (Leader, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at p.
613.  “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435 [allowing motions to strike], or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (b) Strike out all ... of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with ... an order of the court.”  (CCP § 436.)
IV.        
DISCUSSION
Defendants seek a court order
dismissing the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to comply with
the Court’s December 22, 2022, and July 24, 2023 orders and failed to file an
amended complaint or motion for leave to file an amended complaint.  
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiff a settlement award and Defendants
refuse to provide production of documents after a subpoena was served on
October 10, 2023, and Plaintiff requests sanctions on each Defendant for
failing to produce the documents ordered. Plaintiff requests the Court to dismiss
Defendants’ motion to dismiss pending the production of documents.
On November 23, 2022, Defendants filed
a demurrer and motion to strike Plaintiff’s complaint. (Do Decl.¶3.) On
December 22, 2022, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s
complaint and allowed Plaintiff twenty days leave to amend her complaint. (Id.
at ¶4, See 12/22/2022 Minute Order.) Plaintiff failed to file an Amended
Complaint within the January 11, 2023 deadline or provide an explanation for
her failure to do so. (Id. at ¶5.) On April 4, 2023, Defendants filed
their motion to dismiss since Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint in
compliance with the Court’s December 22, 2022 order. (Id. at ¶6.) On
April 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an amended
complaint, ninety days past the January 11, 2023 deadline. (Id. at ¶7.)
On July 25, 2023, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss and denied
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and requested
Plaintiff to address her failure to file an amended
pleading within twenty days after the Court granted Defendants’ motion to
strike on December 22, 2022, and for waiting four months to seek leave to file
the amended pleading. (Id. at ¶8, See 07/25/2023 Minute Order.)
Defendants assert that Plaintiff failed to file a motion for leave to file an
amended complaint by the August 17, 2023, deadline. 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s
opposition is untimely and fails to address the substance of the motion.
Plaintiff’s claim against Defendants are not relevant for the purposes of this
motion. Based on a further review of the evidence, Defendants have met their
burden to show Plaintiff failed to amend the Complaint within the time allowed
by the Court after the Court granted Defendants’ November 23, 2022 motion to
strike the complaint.  On December 22,
2022, Plaintiff was given 20 days to amend the Complaint.  Plaintiff did not file the First Amended
Complaint on January 11, 2023. On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for
leave to amend after the January 11, 2023 deadline passed. Given Plaintiff’s
failure to timely seek leave to amend, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to amend the complaint. After Plaintiff’s failure to timely amend and
seek leave to amend the Complaint, Defendants filed the motion for
dismissal.  As such, the Court has the
power under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 581(f)(4) to dismiss
Plaintiff’s Complaint.
It appears that Plaintiff improperly
filed an addendum to the complaint first on August 7, 2023, and subsequently
again on October 9, 2023. Plaintiff’s addendum to the complaint filed on
October 9, 2023, shall be stricken because Plaintiff needed to seek leave to
file an amended complaint and the Court did not grant Plaintiff’s last request
for leave to amend in its July 25, 2023 order. Plaintiff’s statutory right to
amend the Complaint once as a matter of law terminated when Defendants filed
the November 23, 2022 Motion to Strike the complaint. Plaintiff did not address
her failure to file an amended pleading within twenty days and her four month
delay to seek leave to file the amended pleading as requested by the Court’s
July 25, 2023 order. Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that
Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied despite her failure to obey the
Court’s Order. Therefore, Plaintiff’s addendums to the complaint are stricken
because they were not filed in conformity with this Court’s order.
V.          
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s addendums to the complaint
filed on August 7, 2023, and October 9, 2023, is STRICKEN.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss is
GRANTED.
