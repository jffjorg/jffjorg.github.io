The Court has considered the defendant's motion to consolidate two cases, Case No. 21STCV11513 and Case No. 21STCV07846, which involve a common question of law and fact. The cases concern a four-vehicle accident that occurred on April 4, 2018, and both cases seek damages for motor vehicle negligence. The defendant has served all the parties to each action and has argued that consolidation is necessary to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. The Court finds that the consolidation of the two cases is proper and in the interest of judicial economy, and is inclined to grant the motion.
