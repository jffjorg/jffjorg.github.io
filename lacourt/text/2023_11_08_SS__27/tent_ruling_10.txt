I.           
INTRODUCTION
This action arises out of a
slip and fall accident that occurred on August 1, 2021, at 1010 Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff Steven
Pagliaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Tenten Wilshire LLC
(“Defendant”), Amidi Partners, LLC, Amidi Real Estate, LLC, Amidi, LLC
(“Amidi”), and Does 1-50, asserting causes of action for premises liability and
general negligence. 
On September 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Two, against Defendant. On September 19, 2023. No opposition is
filed. 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300
governs motions to compel responses to inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling demands. Pursuant to section 2031.300(a), “a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to” a demand “waives any objection to the demand, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)  “[A] motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45–day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a meet and confer
requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) 
The party making such a demand may move
for an order compelling the response to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(b).)  “The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(c).) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff served
Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, by mail. (Bassil Decl. ¶4, Ex.
A.). Defendant’s responses were due on June 9, 2023. (Mot., at p. 4.)
Defendant failed to respond to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. (Id.
at ¶5.) On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff sent Defendant a letter regarding his
failure to serve timely responses to Requests for Production, Set Two and gave
Defendant a deadline of August 29, 2023 to provide responses. (Id., Ex.
B.) On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff sent another e-mail requesting an update from
Defendant and Defendant responded to request additional time to provide
responses and Plaintiff gave Defendant a final extension until September 12,
2023. (Id. at ¶6, Ex. C.)  To
date, Defendant has not responded to these requests. (Id. at ¶7.) 
Given
that Defendant has failed to respond to Request for Production of Documents, Two,
despite receiving multiple extensions, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses to its Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, without
objections. 
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  
If a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or requests for production is filed, the Court may impose a
monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
‘         Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks sanctions against Defendant and his counsel of record in the
amount of $2,186.65. Plaintiff’s counsel charged an hourly billing rate of
$250.00 per hour. (Bassil Decl. ¶9.) Counsel has
incurred $61.55 in costs of filing the motion. (Id. at ¶8.) Counsel
claims to have spent 8.5 hours of attorney time, which includes 1 hour in
drafting May 4, 2023 letter, 1 hour in drafting August 22, 2023, letter, 1 hour
for meet and confer efforts between 05/04/23 – 09/12/23, 3 hours preparing this
motion, and anticipates spending 0.5 hours reviewing opposition and 1 hour
preparing a reply and 1 hour to appear at the hearing. (Id.) 
Defendants’ counsel’s hourly billing
rate of $250.00 per hour is reasonable. The Court finds that the several
instances of billing were not reasonably incurred. For instance, Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition so Defendants’ counsel will not incur 1 hour to review Defendant’s
opposition and 1 hour to prepare a reply. As a result, a reduction of sanctions
is warranted. The reward is reduced by 2 hours or $500.00. Accordingly, the
Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record in the total
amount of $1,685.
CONCLUSION
          Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses
to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, is GRANTED. 
Monetary sanctions are awarded to
Plaintiff against Defendant in the reduced total amount of $1,685.
