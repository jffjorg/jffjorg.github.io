Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to amend its answer to add an affirmative defense of trail immunity. The defendant filed its initial answer on October 14, 2021, but only recently discovered the grounds for the amended pleading. The proposed amended answer does not delete any allegations and only adds one affirmative defense. The defendant has complied with the procedural requirements and has demonstrated that the request for leave to amend is necessary and proper. The judge has accepted the defendant's amended answer and will allow the defendant to assert the affirmative defense of trail immunity. The parties are advised to submit their intentions to submit on the tentative ruling to the court and to be prepared to argue the matter at the hearing, if necessary.
