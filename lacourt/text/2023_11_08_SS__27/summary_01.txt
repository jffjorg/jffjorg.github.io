And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants to continue all trial-related dates, including pretrial deadlines and discovery cutoffs, to August 30, 2024. The defendants argue that good cause exists for the continuance because the plaintiff is still treating for injuries and has not completed her deposition, which is delaying their ability to complete necessary discovery and prevent them from providing a settlement demand. The plaintiff argues that good cause does not exist because the defendants have failed to pursue discovery for the past six months and have not responded to her proposed dates for a second session of her deposition.

After considering the arguments, the judge finds that good cause exists to continue all related pretrial dates to relate to the current trial date of August 30, 2024. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that she will be prejudiced by granting this extension, while the defendants have demonstrated that they will be prejudiced if they are not able to complete the deposition of the plaintiff and conduct necessary IMEs regarding the plaintiff's injuries and damages. The judge orders that all parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court, and advises that if a party submits on the tentative and does not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear and argue the matter.
