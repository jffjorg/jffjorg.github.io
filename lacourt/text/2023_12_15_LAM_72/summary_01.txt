And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant be continued. The plaintiff seeks default judgment against the defendant for violation of a loan security agreement (LSA) and requests the return of collateral and costs of suit. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not provided a summary of the case and has not sought damages or interest. The judge also notes that the defendant has defaulted on the loan and that the plaintiff has filed a complaint and served a summons on the defendant. The judge orders that the plaintiff submit a short summary of the case as required by California Rules of Court 3.1800(a)(1) and that the plaintiff provide admissible evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief requested. The judge also orders that the plaintiff provide a memorandum of costs and disbursements and a proposed form of judgment.
