Summary in English:

Judge F.M. Tavelman's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Melise Vartanians' motion for leave to amend her Complaint to add a new cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and add further facts to the Negligence cause of action. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's motion does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b), and that Plaintiff has not attached proof of service of the motion upon Defendants. The Judge notes that the trial has not yet been set, so there would be no prejudice to Defendant if Plaintiff is allowed to amend her Complaint at this time.
