And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for leave to amend their answer without prejudice. The defendants sought to add affirmative defenses of negligence per se and violation of California Vehicle Code ยง 21801 (failure to yield) to their answer. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the declaration submitted in support of the motion was not code compliant and that the motion was untimely. The judge found that the declaration was insufficient and did not address the required information, including why the amendment was necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. As a result, the motion was denied without prejudice.
