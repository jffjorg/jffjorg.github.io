[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEMURRER
 
Dept. B
8:30 a.m.
August 14, 2024



 
I.                  
BACKGROUND
 
October 16, 2020, Plaintiff, Sharon Smith
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants California Highway Patrol
(“CHP”) and Pearl Rodney (“Rodney”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for damages
arising from a motor vehicle accident. 
On April 28, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant
State of California’s, acting by and through the California High Patrol,
demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint with leave to amend. 
On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) negligence; (2) vicarious liability; (3) violation of
vehicle code 17001; and (4) negligence (Govt. Code 820(a)). 
II.               
LEGAL
STANDARD 
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal
sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding
the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (Donabedian,
116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects
that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside
the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) No
other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson
(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in
memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. &
Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
“Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face
of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are
subject to judicial notice.” (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.) In ruling upon demurrers,
judges “consider matters shown in exhibits attached to the complaint and
incorporated by reference.” (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American
Homes of California, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 659, 665.) “[A] pleading
valid on its face may nevertheless be subject to demurrer when matters
judicially noticed by the court render the complaint meritless.” (Del E.
Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604.)
Courts will not consider affidavits filed in opposition to a demurrer, but only
the pleading and judicially noticeable matters. (Knickerbocker v. City of
Stockton (1988) 199 Cal. App. 3d 235, 239.) 
III.            
DISCUSSION
Defendant State of California demurs on the ground
that Plaintiff has failed to allege she has complied with the Government Claims
Act and the claims presentation requirements. Defendant argues, in fact, the
FAC affirmatively alleges that Plaintiff’s late claim petition was denied and
is the subject of a pending motion for reconsideration. 
Government Code § 945.5 provides, “No suit for
damages may be maintained against a public entity unless the claim has been
presented to it.” Further, California Government Code § 911.2(a) states, “[a]
claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to
personal property or growing crops shall be presented as provided in Article 2
(commencing with Section 915) not later than six months after the accrual of
the cause of action.” 
“The Tort Claims Act requires that any civil
complaint for money or damages first be presented to and rejected by the
pertinent public entity [Citation]. The act creates a bond between the
administrative claim and the judicial complaint. Each theory of recovery
against the public entity must have been reflected in a timely claim. In
addition, the factual circumstances set forth in the claim must correspond with
the facts alleged in the complaint.” (Munoz v. State of California
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.) 
“A public entity cannot be sued for tort unless (1)
a timely written claim has previously been presented to the governmental
entity, (2) any late claim has been presented to the public entity and been
excused by it or the court, or (3) conditions described by Government Code
section 946.4 ... have been met.” (Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. County of Santa
Clara (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 483.) 
“The failure to timely present a proper claim ...
bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity. [Citation.]” (Gong
v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.) “The filing of a
claim is a condition precedent to the maintenance of any cause of action
against the public entity and is therefore an element that a plaintiff is
required to prove in order to prevail.” (Del Real v. City of Riverside
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 761, 767.) 
On August 15, 2023, the court continued this
demurrer and noted that the legal effect of the motion for reconsideration
currently pending in Department 16 in Stanley Mosk in the related Case No.
21STCP03992 would have a determinative effect upon the instant motion in terms
of satisfying the condition precedent claim presentation requirement.
Plaintiff’s related motion for reconsideration was set to be heard on July 9,
2024 in Department 16. 
On April 7, 2023, this case was related with
21STCP03992, and assigned to Department 31 in Spring Street.
On June 11, 2024, the court in Department 16 in
Stanley Mosk vacated the motion for reconsideration as the case was reassigned.
Now, there is no motion for reconsideration
pending. As such, the parties are ORDERED to appear at the hearing on this
demurrer as the court inquires as to whether Plaintiff intends to pursue the
motion for reconsideration. Defendant’s failure to appear may result in the
motion being taken off calendar. Plaintiff’s failure to appear may result in
the demurrer being sustained without leave to amend based on the failure to
comply with the claim presentation requirements.
IV.            
CONCLUSION 
Therefore, the hearing on the demurrer is CONTINUED.
The parties are ORDERED to appear at the hearing on this demurrer as the court
inquires as to whether Plaintiff intends to pursue the motion for
reconsideration. Defendant’s failure to appear may result in the motion being
taken off calendar. Plaintiff’s failure to appear may result in the demurrer
being sustained without leave to amend based on the failure to comply with the
claim presentation requirements.
Defendant
is ORDERED to give notice.
