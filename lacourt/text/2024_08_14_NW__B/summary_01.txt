And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the demurrer filed by the defendant, California Highway Patrol, and Pearl Rodney. The demurrer challenges the plaintiff, Sharon Smith, for failing to comply with the Government Claims Act and claims presentation requirements.

The Judge has determined that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint failed to allege that she has complied with the Government Claims Act, which requires that any civil complaint for money or damages first be presented to and rejected by the public entity. The Judge has also noted that the plaintiff's related motion for reconsideration was set to be heard on July 9, 2024, but was vacated on June 11, 2024.

The Judge has ordered the parties to appear at the hearing on the demurrer to inquire as to whether the plaintiff intends to pursue the motion for reconsideration. If the plaintiff fails to appear, the demurrer may be sustained without leave to amend based on the failure to comply with the claim presentation requirements. If the defendant fails to appear, the motion may be taken off calendar.
