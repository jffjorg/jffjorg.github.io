## English Summary:

Judge Hammock's tentative ruling largely grants Plaintiff Oscar Hernandez's motion to compel Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) to attend a deposition and produce documents. 

The Judge found that Defendant's objections to specific categories of questions were without merit, except for one category deemed too broad.  

While Defendant attempted to argue that the motion was moot due to a rescheduled deposition date, the Judge found that their objections remained valid.

The ruling requires Nissan's PMK to appear for deposition within 60 days.  Due to Defendant's actions being deemed justified, no monetary sanctions will be imposed. 

The tentative ruling allows parties to submit on the ruling without appearing at the hearing, but the Court may still modify it.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition attendance and production of documents by the defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK). The defendant had failed to produce its PMK for deposition and served "boilerplate objections" to the deposition notice. The court overruled the defendant's objections to categories 3-6 and 9, finding that they were adequately tailored to the plaintiff's vehicle and relevant to the allegations in the complaint. The objection to category 7 was sustained as too overbroad. The defendant's PMK is ordered to appear for deposition within 60 days of the ruling. The court declined to impose sanctions, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances made the imposition of sanctions unjust. The plaintiff is required to give notice of the ruling, unless waived. The court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears, despite the tentative ruling.
