And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) within 60 days. The judge overrules the defendant's objections to categories 3-6 and 9, but sustains the objection to category 7 as too overbroad. The defendant's PMK is ordered to appear for deposition and produce documents as requested. The judge declines to impose sanctions on the defendant, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification.
