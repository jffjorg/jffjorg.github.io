And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff sought reconsideration based on the recent Court of Appeal decision in Ochoa v. Ford, which they argued represented a change in law. However, the judge found that Ochoa v. Ford did not create a change in law, but rather created a split in authority with a previous Court of Appeal decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. The judge therefore adopted the reasoning of Felisilda and denied the motion. The judge suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa).
