And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff sought reconsideration based on the recent Court of Appeal decision in Ochoa v. Ford, which they argued represented a change in law. However, the judge found that Ochoa v. Ford did not create a change in law, but rather created a split in authority with a previous Court of Appeal decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. The judge therefore adopted the reasoning of Felisilda and denied the motion. The judge suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa).

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Erica Contreras' motion to reconsider the court's previous order compelling arbitration with Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC.  

The court denies the motion, finding that the arbitration provision in the sales contract is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer. The court adopts the reasoning of *Felisilda v. FCA US LLC*, which allows for nonsignatories to compel arbitration based on the express terms of the agreement. 

While acknowledging the conflicting decision in *Ochoa v. Ford*, the court believes *Felisilda* is more persuasive in this case. The court acknowledges the lack of a clear resolution from the California Supreme Court on this issue and suggests the parties consider staying the arbitration proceedings pending that court's final decision.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reconsider the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff had argued that a recent Court of Appeal decision, Ochoa v. Ford, represented a change in law that justified reconsideration of the court's order. However, the judge found that there has been no "change in law" and that the recent decision does not warrant reconsideration of the court's order. The judge also suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ochoa. The judge noted that the recent decision in Ochoa is in conflict with a previous decision, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, and that the court must choose between the two conflicting decisions. The judge ultimately adopted the ruling and rationale of Felisilda and denied the plaintiff's motion to reconsider.

English summary:
The case summary describes a tentative ruling by Judge Randolph M. Hammock in the case of Erica Contreras v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The plaintiff, Erica Contreras, purchased a 2021 Mercedes-Benz vehicle from the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, that allegedly contained defects and nonconformities. Contreras filed a lawsuit against Mercedes-Benz for breach of express and implied warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The court had previously granted Mercedes-Benz's motion to compel arbitration, and Contreras now moves for reconsideration. However, the court denies the motion, stating that there has been no change in law, only a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The court adopts the ruling and rationale of Felisilda, a previous Court of Appeal decision, and finds that the manufacturer was clearly intended to benefit from any arbitration agreement between a purchaser/lessee and the authorized dealer of the manufacturer. Therefore, the arbitration provision was enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer.

## Case Summary: Contreras v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC

**Case Number:** 21STCV33113
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 49

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Erica Contreras
* **Defendant:** Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA)

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff Contreras purchased a 2021 Mercedes-Benz vehicle from an authorized dealer.
* Plaintiff alleges the vehicle contained defects and nonconformities.
* Plaintiff sued MBUSA for breach of express and implied warranties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Compelling Arbitration:** MBUSA moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in the sales contract. 
* **Change in Law:** Plaintiff argues a recent Court of Appeal decision, *Ochoa v. Ford*, changes the law and requires reconsideration of the court's earlier order compelling arbitration.

**Court's Ruling:**

* **Motion Denied:** The court denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
* **Reasoning:** 
    * The court found Plaintiff's motion untimely.
    * The court determined that *Ochoa v. Ford* does not represent a change in law, as it creates a split in authority with *Felisilda v. FCA US LLC*, which the court previously relied upon.
    * The court adopted the reasoning of *Felisilda*, finding that the manufacturer was a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration provision in the sales contract.

**Significant Statements:**

* The court believes that it is common sense that a manufacturer would benefit from an arbitration agreement in a sales contract with an authorized dealer.
* The court acknowledges that the California Supreme Court has granted review of *Ochoa v. Ford* and may resolve the conflict in the Court of Appeal decisions.

**Recommendations:**

* The court suggests the parties stipulate to a stay of the current arbitration proceedings pending the decision of the California Supreme Court in *Ochoa v. Ford*.



**English Summary:**

In this case, the judge denied the plaintiff's request to reconsider the court's earlier decision to force the parties into arbitration. The plaintiff argued that a recent court decision, *Ochoa v. Ford*, changed the law on this issue. However, the judge found that *Ochoa* created a split in legal authority and didn't actually change the law. The judge therefore stuck with its original decision, based on a previous court case, *Felisilda*, which found that the car manufacturer was a valid party to the arbitration agreement.

The judge suggested that the parties agree to pause the arbitration while they wait for the California Supreme Court to decide *Ochoa*, which may ultimately resolve this legal conflict.

---

This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's prior order granting Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in the Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa). The court finds that there has been no change in law, only a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The court adopts the ruling and rationale of Felisilda and notes that any court's finding that the manufacturer was not intended to be a third-party beneficiary is hair splitting at best. The arbitration provision was enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer under current law and Auto Equity Sales.
