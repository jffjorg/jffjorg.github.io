And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff sought reconsideration based on the recent Court of Appeal decision in Ochoa v. Ford, which they argued represented a change in law. However, the judge found that Ochoa v. Ford did not create a change in law, but rather created a split in authority with a previous Court of Appeal decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. The judge therefore adopted the reasoning of Felisilda and denied the motion. The judge suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa).

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Erica Contreras' motion to reconsider the court's previous order compelling arbitration with Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC.  

The court denies the motion, finding that the arbitration provision in the sales contract is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer. The court adopts the reasoning of *Felisilda v. FCA US LLC*, which allows for nonsignatories to compel arbitration based on the express terms of the agreement. 

While acknowledging the conflicting decision in *Ochoa v. Ford*, the court believes *Felisilda* is more persuasive in this case. The court acknowledges the lack of a clear resolution from the California Supreme Court on this issue and suggests the parties consider staying the arbitration proceedings pending that court's final decision.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reconsider the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff had argued that a recent Court of Appeal decision, Ochoa v. Ford, represented a change in law that justified reconsideration of the court's order. However, the judge found that there has been no "change in law" and that the recent decision does not warrant reconsideration of the court's order. The judge also suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ochoa. The judge noted that the recent decision in Ochoa is in conflict with a previous decision, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, and that the court must choose between the two conflicting decisions. The judge ultimately adopted the ruling and rationale of Felisilda and denied the plaintiff's motion to reconsider.

English summary:
The case summary describes a tentative ruling by Judge Randolph M. Hammock in the case of Erica Contreras v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The plaintiff, Erica Contreras, purchased a 2021 Mercedes-Benz vehicle from the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, that allegedly contained defects and nonconformities. Contreras filed a lawsuit against Mercedes-Benz for breach of express and implied warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The court had previously granted Mercedes-Benz's motion to compel arbitration, and Contreras now moves for reconsideration. However, the court denies the motion, stating that there has been no change in law, only a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The court adopts the ruling and rationale of Felisilda, a previous Court of Appeal decision, and finds that the manufacturer was clearly intended to benefit from any arbitration agreement between a purchaser/lessee and the authorized dealer of the manufacturer. Therefore, the arbitration provision was enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer.
