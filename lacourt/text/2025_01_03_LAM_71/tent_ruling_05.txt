and her attorney, George Jawlakian, jointly and severally, is denied.
Plaintiff

          Plaintiff Alexander
Margarian (“Margarian”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed to compel Defendant
Lida Mirzakhanian (“Mirzakhanian”) (“Defendant”) to provide responses to his Form
Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROG”). 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2030.300(d), 2023(d).)
Plaintiff moves unopposed
to deem the truth of any matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
(“RFA”) admitted against Defendant.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2.)
Plaintiff also
requests an award of sanctions against Defendant and her counsel in the total
amount of $5,912.50 for (1) failure to appear for her deposition; and (2) because
of Defendants’ failure to respond to FROG and RFA under oath and without
objections.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§2023.040, 2025.450(g)(1),
2033.280(c).)[1]
 
1.    
Motion to Compel FROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses
from Defendant to Plaintiff’s FROG, the Court rules as follows.
          On August 19, 2024,
Plaintiff served FROG on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Lipofsky ¶13, Exh. 12.) 
On September 23, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel
Defendant’s RFA, but did not included responses to FROG.  (Decl. of Lipofsky ¶9, Exh. 6.1.)  On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel spoke
by phone with Defendant’s counsel to attempt to obtain Defendant’s responses to
the discovery.  (Decl. of Lipofsky
¶11.)  During that conversation, Defendant’s
counsel represented that he had in his possession responses to FROG and verifications
for FROG and RFA, that he mistakenly failed to email them to Plaintiff’s
counsel, and that he would do so right away.  (Decl. of Lipofsky ¶11.)  Plaintiff’s counsel never received these
responses.  (Decl. of Lipofsky ¶11.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses to
the FROG.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Defendant is ordered to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s FROG compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without
objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $5,912.50 for the omnibus motion against Defendant and her counsel of record.  Since the instant motion is unopposed, the
Court declines to grant sanctions for anticipated fees for reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply.  
          The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount of $825.00,
calculated as follows:
(1.5 hours to prepare
instant motion x $550.00) = $825.00

The sanctions are payable by
Defendant and her attorney, jointly and severally, within 20 days of this
order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion to Deem RFA Admitted
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion to Deem RFA Admitted against Defendant, the Court rules as
follows.
On August 19, 2024,
Plaintiff served RFA on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Lipofsky ¶13, Exh. 12.) 
On September 23, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel
Defendant’s RFA, which was not verified. 
(Decl. of Lipofsky ¶9, Exh. 6.1.) 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel spoke by phone with Defendant’s
counsel to attempt to obtain Defendant’s verified responses to the discovery.  (Decl. of Lipofsky ¶11.)  During that conversation, Defendant’s counsel
represented that he had in his possession a verification for RFA, that he
mistakenly failed to email it to Plaintiff’s counsel, and that he would do so
right away.  (Decl. of Lipofsky
¶11.)  Plaintiff’s counsel never received
the verification to RFA.  (Decl. of
Lipofsky ¶11.)  Plaintiff now moves to deem
RFA admitted. 
          Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters
specified in his RFA to Defendant and the genuineness of all documents
specified therein is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.420(a).
          The Court declines to award Plaintiff sanctions on this
motion because sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280(c) were not properly
noticed in Plaintiff’s notice of motion. 
(See C.C.P. §2023.040 [“A request for a sanction shall, in the
notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the
sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of
motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and
accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any
monetary sanction sought.”].)  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 

3.     Deposition
Sanctions
Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration indicates he attempted to meet
and confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding the insrant motion.  (See Decl. of Lipofsky ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
substantially complies with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Background
Plaintiff and Defendant rescheduled
Defendant’s deposition for May 31, 2024. 
(Decl. of Lipofsky ¶2.)  
Neither Defendant nor her counsel appeared
for the deposition.  (See Decl. of
Lipofsky ¶¶3-4, Exh. 1.)  A court reporter
then prepared a Certificate of Nonappearance. 
(Decl. of Lipofsky ¶5, Exh. 2.)
Defendant rescheduled her deposition for
July 2, 2024, wherein she was unable to testify as to why she did not attend
her deposition.  (Decl. of Lipofsky ¶¶7-8, Exh. 5.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on October
14, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no opposition has been filed.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part,
“[t]he service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to
require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          Plaintiff
only moves for sanctions and does not move to compel Defendant’s
deposition.  C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1)
provides, “If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1).)
          Here,
Plaintiff does not move to compel Defendant’s deposition, therefore, there is
no motion for this Court to grant. 
Because this Court has not granted a motion to compel, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions related to Defendant’s failure to appear at her May 31,
2024, deposition cannot be granted.
          Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
Sanctions
In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, the Court declines to award sanctions.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
