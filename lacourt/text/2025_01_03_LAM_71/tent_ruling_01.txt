         vs.
 
AUTOMOBILE
  CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV36095
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 3, 2025



 
Defendant
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s unopposed motion to
compel the deposition of Non-party A&D Auto Body is denied.
Defendant
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s request for sanctions is
denied.
 
          Defendant
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Exchange”) (“Moving Defendant”)
moves unopposed to compel
the deposition of Non-party A&D Auto Body (“A&D”) to appear for
deposition and produce documents.  (Notice
of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§2025.480; CRC, Rules 3.1345(b), 3.1346.)  Moving Defendant also requests monetary
sanctions against A&D in the amount of $2,140.00.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Legal Standard
A motion to compel a nonparty deponent’s attendance
must be personally served on the nonparty deponent.  (See C.C.P. §1005(a)(13) [written
notice of motion is required]; cf. CRC 3.1346 [motion to compel answers
or production at deposition must be personally served on nonparty
deponent unless deponent agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service].)
 
Discussion 
Moving Defendant’s proof of service fails to
indicate A&D was served by any means with the instant motion, let alone personally
served as required by CRC, Rule 3.1346. 
Moving Defendant’s proof of service only indicates that Plaintiff’s
counsel was electronically served with the instant motion.  (See POS.) 
Further, Moving Defendant does not indicate that
A&D agreed to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or
electronic service address specified on the deposition record.  (CRC, Rule 3.1346.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
the deposition of A&D.  is denied.
Moving Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
