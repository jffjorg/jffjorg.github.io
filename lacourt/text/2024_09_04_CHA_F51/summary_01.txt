And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel by Malek H. Shraibati (Counsel) for his client Mario Enrique Ismalej (Plaintiff) is continued pending proof of service on nonparty lien claimant XL Insurance America, Inc. The motion was filed on May 29, 2024, and Counsel properly filed supporting documents, including a notice of the motion, a declaration in support of the motion, and a proposed order granting the motion. However, the proof of service does not indicate any service on XL Insurance America, Inc. Counsel's withdrawal from representation of Plaintiff does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his client, as no trial date has been set and the next hearing date is a case management conference. The motion will be continued to December 13, 2024, pending proof of service on the nonparty lien claimant.
