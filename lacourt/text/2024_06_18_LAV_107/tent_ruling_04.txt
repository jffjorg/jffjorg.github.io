COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: Request for Entry of
  Default Judgment
 




 


 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: DENIED
 

The complaint does not
     specify the damages claimed. This is an action for personal injury and
     plaintiffs seek punitive damages. However, no statement of damages has
     been served on the defaulting defendant. A “statement setting forth the
     nature and amount of damages being sought” is required to be served on the
     defendant “before a default may be taken” in an action for personal injury
     per California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11, subdivision (c).
     And, a certain statement of punitive damages must be served on the
     defaulting defendant “before a default may be taken, if the motion
     for default judgment includes a request for punitive damages” per
     California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115, subdivision (f).

 

The proposed judgment is
     not on the form JUD-100. And, the calculation of damages in the proposed
     judgment is incorrect. The sum of the amounts sought is $50,975.50, not
     $51,045.00.

 

A summary of the case is
     missing. Plaintiffs must submit a summary of the case identifying the
     parties and the nature of the action.

 

Plaintiffs do not submit
     any declarations or evidence in support of their damages. Either an
     affidavit or personal testimony “as to all or any part of the evidence or
     proof required or permitted to be offered, received, or heard” is required
     per California Code of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (d).

 

Plaintiffs seek $10,000
     in attorney’s fees. However, no calculation or justification for this
     amount is shown. Attorney’s fees must be allowable under contract,
     statute, or law under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
     subdivision (a)(10).

 

Plaintiffs seek default
     against just one defendant while other defendants remain in the action.
     However, Plaintiffs have not shown that the action is severable or that
     recovery will not be duplicative.
