```

And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiffs' request for entry of default judgment. The complaint does not specify the damages claimed, and a statement of damages was not served on the defaulting defendant. Additionally, the calculation of damages in the proposed judgment is incorrect. The Judge also notes that the plaintiffs failed to submit a summary of the case, and did not provide declarations or evidence in support of their damages claims. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees is not justified, as there is no calculation or justification for the amount sought. Finally, the Judge notes that the plaintiffs seek to default against one defendant, while other defendants remain in the action, without showing that the action is severable or that recovery will not be duplicative.
