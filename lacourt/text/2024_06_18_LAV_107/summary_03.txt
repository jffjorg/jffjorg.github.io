And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The plaintiff, Michele Bidinger, alleges that the defendants, including Ralph Shaffer, Abrienne Schaffer, Vivian Sypien, Andrew Sypien, and Isaac Stewart, committed acts of harassment, including failing to perform necessary repairs and maintenance, creating financial difficulties, and encouraging or permitting certain conduct. The defendant moved to strike the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages, arguing that they do not meet the requirements for such damages. The court disagrees, finding that the plaintiff has adequately pled allegations that may support a claim for punitive damages. The court concludes that the defendants acted with oppression and malice by failing to perform necessary repairs and maintenance, and that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts that may support a claim for punitive damages. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages.
