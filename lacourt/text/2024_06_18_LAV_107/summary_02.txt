And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Defendant Abrienne Schaffer is GRANTED. The judge has concluded that Plaintiff's need for disclosure of Defendant Isaac's address outweighs Isaac's privacy interest in his address. The judge has also considered the parties' safety concerns and has found that the mere assertion of a fear of harm by Abrienne Schaffer does not establish the existence of a risk of harm.
