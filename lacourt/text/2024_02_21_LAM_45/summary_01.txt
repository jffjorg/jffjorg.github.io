Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for attorneys' fees brought by the plaintiffs, Maynard Matthews and Tanis Matthews, against the defendant, Patrick Ryan. The motion is based on the plaintiffs' contention that the defendant refused to admit the truth of certain matters and the plaintiffs incurred fees to prove those matters.

After reviewing the evidence and arguments presented, the court finds that the plaintiffs fail to show that the defendant did not have a "reasonably entertained good faith belief" of prevailing on the issues at trial. The court concludes that the standard under CCP ยง 2033.420 is very high and the plaintiffs' arguments and evidence largely go to the merits of their case, not to the defendant's good faith belief.

Therefore, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees.
