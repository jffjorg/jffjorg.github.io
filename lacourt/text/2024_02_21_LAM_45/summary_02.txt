Summary:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside default, finding that the defaults were entered due to excusable neglect or inadvertence. The defendants had been trying to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiff out-of-court and did not realize the significance of being in default until they appeared in court. The defendants retained counsel shortly after the defaults were entered and attempted to reach a stipulation with the plaintiff's counsel to avoid unnecessary motion practice or to expeditiously resolve the matter. The court finds that the defendants did not delay in filing their motion and that the evidence supports a finding of excusable neglect or inadvertence.
