And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motions of Counsel to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Robert Olie and Florence Olie. The Court has already denied previous motions due to the clients being unduly prejudiced, and nothing has changed. Counsel has filed the necessary documents and has a compelling reason to withdraw due to the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. However, granting the motion would prejudice the defendants, who will not have sufficient time to engage new counsel before the final status conference and trial.
