And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by the defendants to admit William J. Madden IV to practice law pro hac vice. However, the Court finds that the defendants have failed to provide proof of service of the application on the State Bar of California, as required by California Rules of Court rule 9.40(c). Additionally, the Court notes that Madden IV has appeared in California under this rule in three separate instances in the past year, which is prohibited by California Rules of Court rule 9.40(b) unless special circumstances exist. As a result, the Court has continued the motions to allow the defendants to file proof of service of the application on the State Bar, proof of payment of the fee, and to address Madden IV's prior repeated appearances under this rule.
