And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge grants Equinox Fitness South Bay, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against PAC-94, Limited Partnership. The dispute began when PLP claimed Equinox was responsible for the parking lot, but a lease agreement revealed that PLP is actually responsible. Equinox was not aware of the claims and causes of action until after filing its answer and cross-complaint. The proposed cross-complaint arises from the same operative facts as the principal action and seeks equitable indemnity against PLP. The Judge finds that Equinox has shown good faith and grants the motion.
