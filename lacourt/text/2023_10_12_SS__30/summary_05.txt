And here is a English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motions to compel discovery and to deem the Request for Admissions admitted. The Defendant served the discovery requests on the Plaintiff on May 8, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to respond within the 30-day timeframe. The Plaintiff has still not responded to any of the discovery requests, despite defense counsel contacting the Plaintiff's counsel on July 31, 2023. As a result, the Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objections, to the Defendant's Request for Production and Form Interrogatories within 20 days. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's motion to deem the Request for Admissions admitted, deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests to be admitted.
