The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel discovery filed by Defendant Ann Jihae Sin. The ruling grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff, Miguel Angel Rodriguez Marroquin, to serve responses to the Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of the issuance of the order. The request for sanctions is denied. The court notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide verified responses to the Form Interrogatories, which were propounded on March 1, 2022.

The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), which states that failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product.
