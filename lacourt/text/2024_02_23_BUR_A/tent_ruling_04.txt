ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Anthony Lavigne (Plaintiff) brings this action against
Avalon Bay Communities Inc. (Defendant) in relation to an apartment Plaintiff
rents from Defendant located at 10987 Bluffside Drive, Apartment 4116 Studio
City, California. 91604 (Subject Property). Plaintiff alleges a number of
issues with the Subject Property that render it uninhabitable. Plaintiff
further alleges that Defendant continues to collect rent for the Subject
Property while refusing to remediate issues of water intrusion, mold, and insect
infestation. 
 
Before the Court are two motions to compel further discovery
responses brought by Defendant. Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to Form Interrogatory No. 6.4 and Special Interrogatories Nos. 2, 5,
8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68,
71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 96, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123,
126, and 129. Defendant additionally seeks monetary sanctions in regard to both
motions. Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to either motion. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that the
responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an
unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce
documents in lieu of a substantive response, or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (C.C.P.
§¿2030.300(a).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections thereto. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)
 
II.           
MERITS 
 
The Court finds
Defendant is entitled to further responses to their interrogatories. 
 
On September 26,
2023, Defendant propounded its interrogatories on Plaintiff’s counsel via email
service. (Aslanyan Decl. ¶ 2.) On October 24 ,2023, Plaintiff responded to
the interrogatories. (Aslanyan Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant’s counsel sent a meet
and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel to address alleged shortcomings in the
responses and providing until December 8, 2023 to send supplemental responses.
(Aslanyan Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Exh. C.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not provide
supplemental responses and did not reply to further meet and confer attempts.
(Aslanyan Decl. ¶¶ 6-9.)  
 
Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatory No. 6.4, which seeks information
about the health care providers from which Plaintiff revied treatment, is
incomplete and evasive. Plaintiff states that he received treatment from an
urgent care facility but did not provide any of the requested contact
information for that facility. (Aslanyan Decl. Exh. B, FROG No. 6.4) The Court
agrees this response is incomplete and requires further response be compelled. 
 
Defendant
further argues that Plaintiff’s responses to each of the identified Special
Interrogatories is defective in the same way. Each of these interrogatories
requests identification of documents which evidence Plaintiff’s allegations as
to the condition of the Subject Property. Each response is identical and contain
a litany of objections followed by the statement “Responding Party contends
that they are in possession of photographs inspection reports, all other
relevant Documents, documenting conditions, and images documenting their
complaints to the Defendants about the conditions.” (Aslanyan Decl. Exh. B.) The Court finds
this statement in no way identifies any documents which are responsive to the
request, instead submitting a vague overture as to the existence of some
documents in Defendant’s possession. 
 
The Court notes
that Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to this motion. A failure to oppose a
motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (California Rules
of Court, Rule 8.54(c).) Further, on a motion to compel further responses Plaintiff
has the burden to justify his objections thereto. Here, Plaintiff has failed to
oppose this motion and failed to justify his objections. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel further response to Form
Interrogatory No 6.4 is GRANTED.  
 
The motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47,
50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 96, 102, 105, 108,
111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, and 129 is also GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions 
As concerns motions to compel, the law only requires
sanctions in the event that a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response. (C.C.P. §¿2030.300(d).) As such, any monetary
sanctions granted are within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P.
§ 2030.290. Additionally, it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has
filed a motion to compel, and the other party fails to file an opposition.
(C.R.C. Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
Here, Defendant
has submitted two motions to compel further responses while Plaintiff has
provided no opposition. Defendant requests the Court grant sanctions in the
amount of $2,510 for the Special Interrogatory Motion and $1,810.00 for the
Form Interrogatory Motion. (Aslanyan Decl. ¶ 11.) Defendant’s counsel
states that they expended 6 hours of attorney work in preparing and filing
these motions at a rate of $350 an hour. (Id.) The Court finds that
given the lack of opposition and the relatively simple nature of these
discovery motions, sanctions in the amount of $2,100 would be proper. Sanctions
will be awarded against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel jointly and
severally.
