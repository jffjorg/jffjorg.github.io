ALLEGATIONS: 
 
NHP/PMB Burbank
Medical Plaza II, LLC (Plaintiff) brings this action against Salem Neurological
Associates (Defendant). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to pay rent
pursuant to a commercial lease agreement between the parties. Plaintiff seeks
damages in the amount of $168,913.64. 
 
Before the Court
is a motion brought by Plaintiff to deem matters in their Request for
Admissions (RFA) admitted. Defendant has provided no opposition to this motion.

 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party fails to respond
to requests for admission in a timely manner, the requesting party may move for
an order that the matters be deemed admitted. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) The requesting party’s motion must be
granted by the court unless the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with C.C.P. § 2033.220 prior to the hearing. 
(C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).)  By failing
to timely respond, the party to whom the requests are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (C.C.P. §
2033.280(a).) 
 
The Court shall
impose monetary sanctions for failure to timely respond to requests for
admission unless the party acted with substantial justification, or the
circumstances render imposition of sanctions unjust. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).) The Court must impose a monetary sanction
on the party or attorney whose failure to serve timely Requests for Admission
responses necessitated the motion. (Id.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
On September
27, 2023, Plaintiff served their RFA via email on Defendant’s counsel, Alfred
Joseph Verdi. (Freedman Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. B.) Plaintiff states that as of
the date of filing this motion, no responses to the RFA have been received.
(Freedman Decl. ¶ 5.) The Court
notes that Defendant has rendered no opposition to this motion. A failure to
oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.
(California Rules of Court, Rule 8.54(c).) Plaintiff has propounded its RFAs,
and Defendant has served no proposed response in substantial compliance with
C.C.P. § 2033.20. As such, the Court finds the unopposed motion to deem
RFA matters admitted must be GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions

 
Plaintiff
states that they have incurred the sum of $1,625.00 in preparing and filing
this motion and seeks sanctions in that amount. (Freedman Decl. ¶ 6.) The
Court notes that the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is devoid of an
accounting for time spent preparing the motion. The declaration also lacks any
statement as to the hourly rate of Plaintiff’s counsel. Without these
statements, the Court is unable to determine the reasonable nature of
Plaintiff’s requested sanctions. Given that sanctions are mandatory by statute,
the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $700. The Court finds this amount
reasonable given the relatively simple nature of the motion and the lack of
opposition. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel
jointly and severally.
