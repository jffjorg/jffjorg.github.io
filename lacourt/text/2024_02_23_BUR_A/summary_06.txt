  - "Gov. Code § 946.6 is clear that a prerequisite to granting relief is that a petitioner file an application for leave to present a late claim pursuant to Gov. Code § 911.4 within a reasonable time."
  - "The statute is clear that relief cannot be granted in light of such a procedural defect."
  - "Even had such an application been submitted, it does not appear from the language of Gov. Code § 946.6 that a petition for leave can be considered after a civil action has been filed."

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for relief from Government Code Section 945.4. The Plaintiff alleged that a driver for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) negligently operated a bus, resulting in her personal injury. The Plaintiff filed a claim with the MTA, but it was rejected as untimely. The judge found that the Plaintiff did not show that she was entitled to relief under Government Code Section 946.6 because she had not applied for leave to present a late claim to the MTA within a reasonable time. The judge also noted that the statute contemplates relief only before a civil action is filed, and not after. Therefore, the motion for relief was denied.
