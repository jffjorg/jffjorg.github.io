And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the declaration of Vanessa Dao, who states that she began suffering from a previously undiagnosed medical condition around the beginning of 2024. Due to her condition, she failed to ensure that responses to plaintiff discovery were served timely. On May 30, 2024, Dao had a medical emergency that rendered her unconscious, and she subsequently resigned from her position at Clark Hill early June 2024. Dao's declaration suggests that she did not recognize the impact of her condition on her work until she had a medical emergency. The judge's tentative ruling is based on the facts presented in Dao's declaration.
