[2] Specifically, Dao
declares “…around the beginning of 2024, I began suffering from a previously
undiagnosed medical condition. Due to my condition, I had mistakenly thought
that discovery responses were served timely to Plaintiff’s Counsel. [¶] At the
time, I failed to realize how this condition prevented me from completing my
work and caused me to fail to ensure that responses to Plaintiff Discovery were
served timely. [¶] On or about May 30, 2024, I had a medical emergency that
rendered me unconscious. I then recognized that it was a mistake to continue to
work while exhibiting the symptoms of my medical condition and subsequently
resigned my position at Clark Hill early June of 2024.” (Declaration of Vanessa
Dao signed August 22, 2024, ¶¶ 3-5.)
