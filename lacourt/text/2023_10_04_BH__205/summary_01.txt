## English Text Summary:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff WCO Spectrum, LLC's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The reason for denial is that Plaintiff's Separate Statement, a document outlining the facts they believe are undisputed, does not comply with California court rules. Specifically, the Separate Statement fails to properly reference the exhibits supporting each claimed undisputed fact. This makes it difficult for the Judge to quickly assess the evidence and determine if summary judgment is appropriate. 

The denial is **without prejudice**, meaning Plaintiff can refile the motion after correcting the deficiencies in their Separate Statement.
