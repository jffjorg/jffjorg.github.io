Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by WCO Spectrum, LLC (Plaintiff) against Signal Flare Capital, Inc. et al. (Defendants). The Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing the Plaintiff's failure to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1350(d)(3) in its Separate Statement.

The Judge has determined that the Plaintiff's Separate Statement fails to provide these references, making it difficult for the Court to quickly identify the evidence supporting each alleged undisputed material fact.
