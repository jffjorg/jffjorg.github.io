And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to discovery in its entirety. The plaintiff had filed six motions seeking orders compelling the defendants to respond to requests for production, interrogatories, and requests for admissions. The judge finds that the defendants' all-objection responses do not indicate a lack of good faith participation in the discovery process, and that the plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel further discovery responses. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's argument that the defendants did not verify their responses is unavailing, as objections are not factual statements. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion is procedurally misplaced and denies the motion. The judge also declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff for its unsuccessful motion.
