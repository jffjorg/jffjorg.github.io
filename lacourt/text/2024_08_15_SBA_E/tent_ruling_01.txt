Background
 
This is a commercial unlawful detainer action based on
nonpayment of rent. 
 
Plaintiff MBS Media Campus, LLC sued defendants MK
Business Centers, LLC (“MKBC”) and Emily Karp (“Karp”) on December 1, 2023, to
recover possession of commercial space within the property located at 1600
Rosencrans. Ave., Bldg. 7, Manhattan Beach 90266 (“the Property”). Plaintiff
alleges Defendants agreed to rent the Property for 7.5 years at a rate of
approximately $21,000.00 per month. (Compl., ¶ 6.) Defendants eventually
stopped paying, and Plaintiff served them with a pay or quit notice on November
27, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10.) At the time Plaintiff served the notice,
Defendants owed approximately $2.5 million in rent arrears. (Id., ¶ 12.)
Defendants failed to pay off their arrears before the notice expired, and
Plaintiff sued.
 
On July 17 and July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed six (6)
motions, three as to each defendant, seeking orders compelling Defendants to
respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production (“RPDs”) and Interrogatories,
and deeming admitted all matters referred to in Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission (“RFAs”).
 
On August 2, 2024, Defendants filed a consolidated
opposition to Plaintiff’s six (6) motions.
 
On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed its reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response .
. . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any
objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)-(b).)  
 
Similarly, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it . . . [t]he party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . .
.   [and] The party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.  (Id., § 2031.300(a)-(b).)  
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests or admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response…[t]he party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product[.]” 
(Id., § 2033.280(a).)  Where
a party fails to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction.  (Id., § 2033.280 (b).) 
The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters
specified in the requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to
whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id., §
2033.280(c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel further
discovery responses. 
 
Plaintiff contends the Court should disregard Defendants’
boilerplate, all-objection responses. Plaintiff’s point is well-taken that all-objection
responses generally do not indicate a good-faith participation in the discovery
process. Nonetheless, objections are one form of response expressly permitted
by the Code. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.200(a)(3) [interrogatories], 2031.210(a)(3)
[RPDs], 2033.210(b) [RFAs].)
 
Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants did not verify their
responses is similarly unavailing. Objections are not factual statements, so
objection-only responses do not require verification. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.250(a) [the party “shall sign the response under oath unless the response
contains only objections”].)
 
Plaintiff’s motion for initial responses cannot succeed
because initial responses were already provided. The motion is denied.
 
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under [section
2023.010 et seq.] against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel [initial responses] ... unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c) [interrogatories], 2031.300(c) [requests for
production].)
 
Here, Plaintiff filed a motion that was substantively
meritorious but procedurally misplaced. It would be unjust for the Court to
sanction Plaintiff for a purely procedural lapse, when the insufficiency of
Defendants’ responses is readily apparent.
 
The Court imposes no sanctions on Plaintiff for its
unsuccessful motion.
 
Conclusion
 
The motions are denied in their entirety. No sanctions.
