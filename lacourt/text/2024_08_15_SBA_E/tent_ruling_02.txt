Background
 
This is a dispute between neighbors over damage to trees
in Plaintiffs’ yard, allegedly caused when Defendants sprayed the now-dying
trees with phytotoxin. Plaintiffs sued on February 6, 2024 for negligence,
trespass, trespass to chattels, conversion, and violations of Code of Civil
Procedure sections 733 and 3346.
 
On June 24, 2024, Defendants moved to strike Plaintiffs’
claims for punitive damages from the complaint. Plaintiffs opposed on August 5,
2024. Defendants filed no reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Motions
to strike are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not
challengeable by demurrer, such as words, phrases, and prayers for damages.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435, 436, and 437.) The proper procedure to attack
false allegations in a pleading is a motion to strike. (Id. § 436 (a).) 
 
“The
court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435 [notice of motion to
strike whole or part of complaint], or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading.” (Id. § 436 (a).) Irrelevant matters include
immaterial allegations that are not essential to the claim or those not
pertinent to or supported by an otherwise sufficient claim. (Id., §
431.10.) The court may also “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.” (Id. § 436 (b).)
 
A motion to strike is also the proper procedure to attack
a purportedly improper remedy such as unjustified punitive damages. (Venice
Town Council, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1547,
1561-1562.) A complaint including a request for punitive damages must also
include allegations showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such an award. (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
 
Meeting and Conference
 
The statutes permitting a motion to strike contain a meet
and confer requirement equivalent to the requirement for demurrer. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5.) Counsel submitted a declaration that satisfies section
435.5. (King Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Discussion
 
A plaintiff may seek punitive damages for “oppression,
fraud or malice” by the defendant. (Civ. Code, § 3294(a).) “Malice” means
conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct that is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. (Civ. Code, §
3294(c)(1).)  “Oppression” means
despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights. (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(2).) “Fraud”
means intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact
with the intention of depriving a person of property or legal rights, or
otherwise causing injury. (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3).) 
 
A claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded generally
and allegations that a defendant acted “with oppression, fraud and malice”
toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show that the plaintiff
is entitled to an award of punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett
(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Specific factual allegations are required to
support a claim for punitive damages. (Ibid.)
 
The complaint contains no facts that suggest fraud. Malice
and oppression each require Plaintiff to plead a particular state of mind. Plaintiffs
allege Defendants “intentionally sprayed harmful chemicals on [their] trees”
(Compl., ¶ 18), but no more facts regarding their knowledge or mental state. Plaintiffs
have pled the basis for punitive damages only by conclusion.
 
The motion is granted with leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court grants Defendants’ motion to strike with twenty
(20) days’ leave to amend.
