And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ruiz v. City of West Hollywood. The plaintiff, Ruiz, sued the city for injuries sustained when she tripped and fell crossing the street on January 23, 2024. The defendant, City of West Hollywood, demurred, arguing that the court has no jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to substantially comply with the Government Claims Act. The plaintiff had filed an initial complaint on June 18, 2024, which was premature, and the defendant did not respond to the claim. The plaintiff then filed a first amended complaint on July 23, 2024, which the defendant argues is a sham pleading because it attempts to plead around the noncompliance with the Act.

The court grants judicial notice of the documents requested by the defendant and finds that the plaintiff's initial complaint was not in compliance with the Government Claims Act. However, the court finds that the first amended complaint is in compliance with the Act, as it refers back to the filing of the initial tort claim. The purpose of the Government Claims Act is to give the governmental entity notice of claims and the opportunity to resolve them prior to a suit being filed. The court overrules the demurrer and orders the defendant to answer within 15 court days.
