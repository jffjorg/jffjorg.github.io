Hosseini v. Yang, Case no. 24SMCV02715
Hearing Date September 26, 2024
Defendant
Yang’s Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
Plaintiff
Hosseini alleges defendant Yang struck her vehicle while intoxicated. Defendant
moves to strike the prayer for punitive damages.
Punitive
damages are allowable only when plaintiff proves defendant’s conduct
constitutes oppression, fraud or malice. Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving
rise to a claim for punitive damages must be pleaded specifically – vague or
conclusory allegations are insufficient. G.D. Searle & Company v.
Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29. Punitive damages must be
pleaded specifically, and conclusory requests for punitive damages without
factual support are subject to a motion to strike. E.g., Cyrus v. Haveson
(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306, 316-317; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157
Cal.App.3d 159, 164. Recklessness or negligence, even gross negligence, are
insufficient to support an award of punitive damage. Dawes v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88. 
Plaintiff’s
sole allegation regarding defendant’s alcohol consumption is “The
aforementioned acts of Defendant Yang were willful and wanton in that Defendant
Yang demonstrated a conscious and deliberate disregard of the rights, safety,
and interests of others by voluntarily commencing, and thereafter continuing,
to consume alcoholic beverages and/or narcotic medications to the point of
intoxication, knowing from the outset that he must thereafter operate a motor
vehicle.” Compl. para. 13. This is not sufficient. Plaintiff must allege specific
facts.
Malice
is conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury or despicable conduct
carried on by defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or
safety of others. Civ. Code §3294(c)(1). Plaintiff alleged conscious disregard
for the safety of others but failed to plead any specific facts showing such. See
Dawes, supra (holding that the risk of injury to others from
ordinary driving while intoxicated is certainly foreseeable but is not
necessarily probable). 
Plaintiff
cites Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 899 and Peterson
v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 147. Defendant correctly notes that in both
cases, plaintiff alleged particular facts regarding speed and defendant’s
behavior beyond merely the fact that they were allegedly driving while
intoxicated. 
The
opposition states that after striking plaintiff’s vehicle, defendant struck two
parked cars and fled the scene. However, this conduct is not alleged in the
complaint. The motion is GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend to allege punitive
damages.
