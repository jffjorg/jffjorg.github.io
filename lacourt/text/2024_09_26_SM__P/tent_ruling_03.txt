notice may be granted under Evid. Code §452(d) for records of the court as well
as for the filings and contents of a government claim under Evid. Code §452(c).
GRANTED.
 
“No
suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented… until a written claim
therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the
board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board.” Cal. Gov. Code
§945.4. Failure to comply with the mandates of the Government Claims Act
results in loss of jurisdiction by the Superior Court.  Rubenstein v. Doe 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th
903, 906; Gates v. Sup.Ct. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 481, 509. 
Defendant
argues the FAC fails as a matter of law because it fails to substantially
comply with the governmental tort claims act (“Act”). Defendant notes "The
long established rule in this state is that the courts may allow no exceptions
to the claim provisions of a claim statute under the guise of interpretation or
construction. Compliance with the [Government Claims Act] is mandatory and the
requirement may not be waived."  Powers
Farms v. Consolidated Irrigation District (1941) 19 Cal.2d 123, 130. Defendant
points to plaintiff’s filing of the initial claim with the City on June 3,
2024, and the filing of the complaint 15 days later on June 18, 2024, as a
fatal failure to comply with the Act. Under the Act, plaintiff was required to
wait 45 days after filing a claim before filing a complaint. 
Defendant
is correct that the initial complaint was not in compliance, as the time had
not elapsed. Defendant cites to Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor District
(2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 211, 219 noting “‘Timely claim presentation is not merely
a procedural requirement but is … ‘a condition precedent to plaintiffs
maintaining a cause of action against defendant.’ ‘Only after the public
entities board has acted upon or is deemed to have rejected the claim may the
injured person bring a lawsuit alleging a cause of action in tort against a
public entity.’ (Citation.)  Lowry failed
to comply with the act because he filed a complaint before his claim was
rejected.” Id. 
Plaintiff
does not dispute that fact. Instead, plaintiff argues she filed her FAC on July
23, 2024, and the FAC is in compliance with the time requirements of the Act. 
Defendant
argues that filing the FAC does not cure the procedural deficiencies of the
initial complaint. Citing again to Lowry, defendants note that in that
case “[plaintiff] offered to amend the complaint to state he complied with the
applicable claims statutes. But the lawsuit is precluded because it was not
preceded by rejection of a claim. [plaintiff]'s noncompliance with the
[Government Claims] Act cannot be cured by amending the complaint to allege he
complied.” Id. at 221. 
In
this, defendant is correct. Plaintiff conceded in the FAC that the initial
complaint was filed prematurely, before defendant rejected the claim, and the
court has granted judicial notice of plaintiff's June 25, 2024 proof of service
demonstrating the initial complaint was served prematurely.
Defendant
asserts the FAC is a sham pleading because plaintiff is attempting to plead
around her noncompliance with the Act. Defendant notes plaintiff did not allege
facts about whether she complied with the Act’s procedural requirements in the
original complaint and argues because plaintiff argues in the FAC that the FAC
complies with the Act, it is a sham pleading. The court disagrees. 
Pleading
compliance with the Act in the FAC is not inconsistent with the initial
complaint’s silence on this issue. Plaintiff points to Malear v. State of
Cal. (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 213, 225. In that case, a prematurely filed
complaint was amended to include allegations of compliance with the Act after
the public entity denied the claim, but before either the original or amended
complaint had been served on the public entity; the court found this substantially
complied with the Act. Id. 
Similarly,
plaintiff timely filed a claim. She (admittedly) filed the initial complaint
prior to expiration of the 45 days. However, her FAC was timely. The purpose of
the Act is to give the governmental entity notice of claims and the opportunity
to resolve them prior a suit being filed. Here, the filing of the FAC refers
back to the filing of the initial tort claim. The demurrer is OVERRULED.
Defendant to answer within 15 court days.
