And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Hosseini and Yang. Hosseini alleges that Yang struck her vehicle while intoxicated and seeks punitive damages. Yang moves to strike the prayer for punitive damages, arguing that Hosseini's complaint lacks specific facts showing Yang's conscious disregard for safety. The judge agrees, citing California Civil Code Section 3294, which states that punitive damages are only allowed when a plaintiff proves that the defendant's conduct constitutes oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge finds that Hosseini's complaint does not meet this standard and grants Yang's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, giving Hosseini 20 days to amend the complaint to include specific facts supporting a claim for punitive damages.
