And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Ferrazzi Greenlight, the plaintiff, is the prevailing party with regards to its anti-SLAPP motion to strike the sixth cause of action for unfair business practices brought by defendants Whitfield and Wakefield. The court granted the motion to strike without leave to amend, and the plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees and costs under Code Civ. Proc. §425.16. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not sufficiently described the work performed or the qualifications of counsel to justify the hourly rates claimed, and therefore, the matter may be continued to allow the plaintiff to provide more detailed information about the work performed and the hourly rates charged. The court will also consider the reasonableness of the fees requested.
