And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Michelman & Robinson LLP, is entitled to summary adjudication on its breach of contract claim against the defendant, Cesar Lossley. The parties entered into a written agreement on June 18, 2023, under which the plaintiff would provide legal services to the defendant and the defendant would pay for those services. The plaintiff has provided evidence that it performed its obligations under the agreement, but the defendant has failed to pay the billed invoices in full. The court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden in showing that it is entitled to summary adjudication, and the burden now shifts to the defendant to establish a triable issue of material fact. However, the defendant has failed to submit an opposition, and therefore is unable to meet its burden. The court notes that there is no defense to the defendant's breach.
