ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On
September 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Jaclyn Marsoubian (“Marsoubian”) and minor Plaintiff
Grace Lopez by and through her guardian ad litem Jaclyn Marsoubian filed an
action against Defendant Annie Chiang (“Chiang”) for negligence, arising out of
an alleged motor vehicle accident that occurred on September 19, 2021.
 
            On
December 27, 2023, The Court denied Petitioner Jaclyn Marsoubian’s Expedited
Petition for Minor’s Compromise, filed on November 27, 2023, due to several
deficiencies.
 
            On
June 10, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Expedited Petition to Approve
Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of minor Claimant Grace Lopez
(“Expedited Petition”).
 
            No
opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the
ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. 
[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is
endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)
Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or
she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code section
3500. 
 
            Regarding the substance of the
Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the
petitioner must file a complete and
“verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’
[Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage
Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)
(Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed,
the Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the
hearing.
