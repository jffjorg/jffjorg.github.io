And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Kenneth M. Lee. The motion seeks reconsideration of the Court's decision not to award attorney fees in connection with the default judgment entered against Defendant Reinaldo Beckford on May 21, 2024. The Judge finds that the motion is procedurally deficient and cannot be granted because Plaintiff failed to provide a notice of motion, a declaration in support of the motion, and failed to cite any legal authority. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff did not provide any new facts, law, or circumstances to warrant reconsideration. As a result, the Judge denies the motion for reconsideration.
