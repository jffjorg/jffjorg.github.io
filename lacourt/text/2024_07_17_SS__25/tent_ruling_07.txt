 
BACKGROUND
 
On March
15, 2023, Plaintiff Michelman & Robinson LLP. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Cesar
Lossley (“Defendant”) asserting the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) account stated; (3) common counts, and (4) open book account.
 
On August 11, 2024, Defendant filed
his Answer to the Complaint.
 
On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed the second through fourth causes of action as well as the
Doe Defendants 1-100. 
 
            On April 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Adjudication (“Motion”). No
opposition has been filed.  
 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because there are no triable
issues of material fact in dispute in connection with its breach of contract
claim. Specifically, Plaintiff presents evidence to establish all elements of
its breach of contract claim.  
 
OPPOSITION
 
            None filed
as of July 12, 2024.
 
 
             
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for Summary Judgment 
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.  In analyzing such
motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3)
determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment or summary adjudication
is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in
the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact
exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. 
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate or establish
an essential element.  Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.  A motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must be denied where the moving party’s evidence does not prove
all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where the
opposition is weak.  See Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222
Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387. 
 
Once the moving party has met the
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show via specific facts that
a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense
thereto.  CCP § 437c(o)(2).  When a party cannot establish an
essential element or defense, a court must grant a motion for summary
adjudication.  CCP § 437c(o)(1)-(2). 
 
A.        Undisputed Facts 
 
            The
parties entered into a written agreement dated June 18, 2023, wherein Plaintiff
would provide legal services to Defendant and in exchange Defendant would pay
for those services.  UMF Nos. 1-3;
Willingham Decl. ¶ 5; Robinson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. B at pg. 1; Camhi Decl. ¶ 3. Pursuant
to the agreement, payment was due upon receipt of each monthly invoice, and the
parties agreed that the amounts billed would be paid within thirty days
following the receipt of the billing invoice.  UMF No. 4; Robinson Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B at pg.
5.  Plaintiff provided legal services for
Defendant pursuant to the agreement and issued two invoices that were dated
July 31, 2020 and August 31, 2020.  UMF
Nos. 5, 7-8; Robinson Decl. ¶ 5; Willingham Decl., Exh. A at pp. 1, 6.  It is Plaintiff’s business practice to send
these invoices within ten days of the date stated on them.  UMF Nos. 6; Willingham Decl. ¶ 12.  The July 31, 2020 invoice stated that the
total due for services rendered through July 31, 2020 was $8,575.70, and the
August 31, 2020 invoice stated that the total due for services rendered through
August 31, 2020 was $14,033.00.  UMF Nos.
7-8; Willingham Decl., Exh. A.  To date,
Defendant has failed to pay these invoices in full, which totals $22,608.70.  UMF
No. 9; Camhi Decl. ¶ 3; Willingham Decl. ¶ 6. 
Based on the outstanding balance, prejudgment interest through April 15,
2024 amounts to $8,003.67.  UMF No. 11;
Camhi Decl. ¶ 4. 
 
B.        Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action for
Breach of Contract 
 
            “‘[T]he
vital elements of a cause of action based on a contract are mutual assent
(usually accomplished through the medium of an offer and acceptance) and
consideration.”  Pacific Bay Recovery
Inc. v. California Physicians’ Services, Inc. (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 200,
215.  “To prevail on a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the
plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.  
 
            Here, in support of its burden,
Plaintiff submits evidence to show that a contract existed between the parties
that required Defendant to pay for legal services that Plaintiff rendered
within 30 days following the receipt of the billed invoiced.  UMF Nos. 1-4. 
Next, Plaintiff has shown that it had performed its obligations under
the contract by providing legal services to Defendant, and these services are
reflected by the invoices sent to Defendant. UMF Nos. 5, 7-10.  Defendant consequently breached the agreement
by failing pay the billed invoices within the time period prescribed under the
agreement, and Defendant has not cured his default.  UMF Nos. 3, 4, 8-9.
 
In terms of damages, due to the
breach, the amount due and owing is $22,608.70 based on the billed invoices
sent to Defendant.  UMF Nos. 7-8.
Moreover, Plaintiff seeks interest at the legal rate of 10% pursuant to Civil
Code § 3289, which amounts to $8,003.67. 
 
            Because
Plaintiff has established each element for its breach of contract claim and
shown that there is no defense to it, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met
its burden in showing that it is entitled to summary adjudication as to the
first cause of action. Therefore, the burden now shifts to Defendant to
establish a triable issue of material fact that either Plaintiff’s claim lacks
merit or there is an applicable affirmative defense.  However, as stated above, Defendant has
failed to submit an opposition, and as a result, Defendant is unable to meet
his burden. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is no defense to
Defendant’s breach. “It is well established that the pleadings determine the
scope of relevant issues on a summary judgment motion.”  Nieto v. Blue Shield of Calif. Life &
Health Ins. Co. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 74. “What is put in issue by a
denial is limited to the allegations of the complaint ... A defense in the
nature of ‘yes, those allegations are true, but ...’ is not put in issue by the
denial.”  FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 383–384. Upon review of Defendant’s
answer, the affirmative defenses raised lack sufficient factual allegations to
suggest that they would have merit.    
 
            Accordingly, the Motion for Summary Judgment
is GRANTED.
