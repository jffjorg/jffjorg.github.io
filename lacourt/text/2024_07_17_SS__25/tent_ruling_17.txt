Proc. § 430.10.)  There are two types of demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.) General demurrers can be used to attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 430.30, 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at 318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence."  (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.) Special demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract is oral or written.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)  However, special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction civil actions and any grounds for special demurrers must be raised as affirmative defenses in the answer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 92(c).) Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).) When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue.  (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.").) III.              Discussion Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the bases that (1) it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant and (2) is uncertain. The Court notes that special demurrers, on the basis that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible, are not allowed in limited jurisdiction actions.  Accordingly, the Court will rule on the Demurrer on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a breach of contract cause of action. A.     Meet and Confer Defendant has submitted form CIV-140, indicating that at least five days prior to the responsive pleading being due, she met and conferred with Plaintiff by telephone but was unable to reach an agreement resolving the matters raised by the Demurrer.  (CIV-140 ¶ 2a.) The Court finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that she has attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff.  Thus, the requirement to meet and confer has been satisfied. B.     Demurrer “To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms – set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect. [Citations.]  In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms.  This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.’ [Citation.]”  (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)   Plaintiff has filed a form complaint for a breach of contract cause of action seeking damages in the amount of $30,000, as well as interest and attorney’s fees in the amount of $5,000.  (Compl. ¶¶ 10, BC-1, BC-3.)  A copy of a Month-to-Month Lease Agreement is attached to the Complaint. Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the basis that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract.  First, Plaintiff does not allege the material terms of the agreement and simply attaches a one-page Lease Agreement without any allegations regarding dates or essential terms.  (Demurrer p. 2.)  Second, there are no factual allegations regarding Defendant’s actions breaching the agreement and, thus, causing Plaintiff harm.  (Ibid.) Plaintiff has not opposed the Demurrer.             The Court finds that the allegations stated in the Complaint do not contain sufficient facts to constitute a breach of contract cause of action.  The form complaint is severely deficient as it fails to list the parties to the agreement, the date of breach, the specific acts that constitute breach of the agreement, and how such actions caused Plaintiff to suffer harm.  (See Compl. ¶¶ BC-1 through BC-6.)  Although a copy of a Month-to-Month Lease Agreement is attached, demonstrating the existence of the contract, Plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded any of the other elements for a breach of contract cause of action, including Plaintiff’s performance, Defendant’s breach, and the resulting damages.             Accordingly, the Court sustains the Demurrer to the Complaint.  The Court finds that there is a possibility that the defect may be cured by amendment.  Thus, the Demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. IV.              Conclusion & Order For the foregoing reason, Defendant Valeria De La Luz Ramos’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend. Judicial Assistant is directed to give notice.
