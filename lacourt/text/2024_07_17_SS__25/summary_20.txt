And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Defendant Felicidad T. Honkala's Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint. The Court finds that Defendant lacks legal capacity and therefore personal service on her alone without her guardian ad litem is ineffective. The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to oppose the motion and has therefore conceded to Defendant's arguments. The Court orders Defendant to file an application for appointment of a guardian ad litem in this action and to serve the application on the Court. The Court also orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to attach a copy of the Court's tentative ruling to the notice.
