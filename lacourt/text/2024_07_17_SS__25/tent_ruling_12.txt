 
BACKGROUND
 
On December
15, 2023, Plaintiff Kenneth M. Lee (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Reinaldo Beckford (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for breach of
contract.  
 
On December
19, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint for Breach of
Contract against Defendant. 
 
On May 7,
2024, default was entered against Defendant. 
 
On May 21, 2024, default judgment was entered for Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the sum of $3,190.00. (05/21/24 Judgment.) The Court
did not award Plaintiff any attorney fees pursuant to the default judgment.
(05/21/24 Judgment.) The Court mailed a copy of the default judgment to
Plaintiff on May 21, 2024. (See 05/21/24 Certificate of Mailing.) 
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
Motion for Reconsideration. Plaintiff appears to seek reconsideration of the
Court’s decision to not award attorney fees in connection with the default
judgment. 
 
Initially, the Court notes that the motion does not contain
a notice of motion setting forth the grounds for the issuance of the requested
order, and there is no declaration in support of the motion. Plaintiff merely
states that he “ask[s] the court to reconsider its decision or at least explain
its reasoning.” (Mot. at p. 1:26-27.)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion for
Reconsideration 
A.               
Legal Standard 
Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(a) “requires that a
motion for reconsideration be based on new or different facts, circumstances,
or law.” New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206,
212. “A party seeking reconsideration must also provide a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.” Ibid.
“A trial court’s ruling on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under the
abuse of discretion standard.” Ibid., citation omitted.
California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1008(a)
provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order . . .
[may] make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” “The party
making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a). A trial court has discretion with respect to
granting a motion for reconsideration. New York Times Co. v. Superior Court,
supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212. A trial court has the inherent authority
“to reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.” Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107. 
B.        Discussion
            The Court finds that the motion is
procedurally deficient and cannot be granted. Plaintiff failed to provide a
notice of motion which articulates “in the opening paragraph the nature of the
order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1110(a).) Additionally, the Court finds that Plaintiff only filed
what purports to be a half-page memorandum of points and authorities without citing
any legal authority therein. 
            Additionally, the Court notes that
Plaintiff did not file any declaration in support of the motion setting forth
any new facts, law, or circumstances to warrant reconsideration. Thus,
Plaintiff has not shown that reconsideration is proper under CCP § 1008.  
            As
such, the Court finds it appropriate to deny the motion. 
II.        Conclusion 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration of the Court’s Denial of Attorney Fees in Connection to the
Default Judgment Entered on 05/21/2024 is DENIED. 
 
            Moving party is ordered
to give notice.
