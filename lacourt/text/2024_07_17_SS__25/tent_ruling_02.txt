ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On July 18, 2019, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Kevin Lopez (“Lopez”)
(“Defendant”) for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant,
on the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance
policy, on the other hand.  (Compl.)  Plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed damages
in the amount of $9,956.16 and filed the instant claim against Defendant for
allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid.
pp. 2-3.)
 
            On October 9, 2019, Defendant filed an
Answer to the Complaint.
            On January 3, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default
(“Stipulation”), signed by both parties, to dismiss the action on the premise
that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $7,553.10.  On January 4, 2022, the Court dismissed the entire
case without prejudice, pursuant to the Stipulation.
 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment (“Motion”).
 
No opposition has been filed.

Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).

Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary
dismissal of an action or special proceeding terminates the court’s
jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los
Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) 
“‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements
of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a
settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid.
(quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for
the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the
same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed
necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request
must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been
dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request
must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the
parties signed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default (“Stipulation”)
containing the parties’ agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and
enter judgment in the event of default.  (Stipulation
¶ 10.)  Prior to the dismissal of this
action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the
Court.  (Ibid. at p. 4.)  On January 4, 2022, the Court dismissed the
entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated
that it “RETAINS JURISDICTION OF THIS CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND PURSUANT TO
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 664.6.”  (1-4-22 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation
Agreement filed on January 3, 2022, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed
to dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of $7,553.10. 
(Stipulation ¶ 4.)  Pursuant to
the Stipulation, Defendant’s insurance carrier GEICO would make a payment of $2,753.10
within thirty (30) days of Defendant’s execution of the agreement.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2(i).)  Defendant would pay the remaining balance with
$100 monthly payments commencing on January 15, 2022, and continuing on the fifteenth
day of each month, until the balance is paid in full.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2(ii).)  Defendant would also be responsible for the
balance not paid by his insurance carrier. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 2(i).)  All
parties signed the Stipulation.  (Ibid.
at p. 4.)
 
The Stipulation
also provides that Defendant will have a fifteen (15) day grace period to make
payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  In the event Defendant fails to make
payments, Plaintiff will give written notice of default and Defendant will have
an additional ten (10) days to cure the default.  (Ibid.)  If Defendant does not cure the default,
“Plaintiff may immediately cause Judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms
set forth in this Stipulation for the full amount of the agreed upon judgement
as set forth in Paragraph 1 less any monies paid to date of the breach; and
shall also file a partial Satisfaction of Judgment for all sums previously paid
pursuant to this Stipulation.”  (Ibid.
at ¶ 6.)  If Defendant’s contact
information changes, he is responsible for providing written notice to
Plaintiff, otherwise Plaintiff will send the notice of default to the address
indicated in the Stipulation.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 8.)
 
On May 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion alleging that Defendant breached the
Stipulation.  Plaintiff’s counsel, Susan
M. Benson, states that Defendant’s insurance carrier made a payment of $2,753.10
and Defendant made payments in the amount of $1,600.  (Benson Decl. ¶ 5.)  On December 15, 2023, Counsel sent a default
notice to Defendant to pay the remaining sum of $3,200.00.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. 2.)  However, Defendant has not made any additional
payments toward the balance.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 7.)  Thus, Plaintiff requests that
the Court enter judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $5,678.06
as follows: principal amount of $9,956.16, less $4,353.10 in payments made by Defendant
and his insurance carrier, plus filing costs of $75.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant stopped
making monthly payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written notice of
default.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on January 4, 2022, is
vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $5,678.06
as
follows: principal amount of $5,603.06 and $75.00 in
motion filing fees.
