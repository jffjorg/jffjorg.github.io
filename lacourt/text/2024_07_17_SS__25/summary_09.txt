And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling from the court regarding an Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim filed on behalf of minor Claimant Grace Lopez. The petition was filed by Petitioner Jaclyn Marsoubian, who is also the parent of the minor. The claim is for negligence arising from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on September 19, 2021.

The court notes that the petition has not been opposed and that the settlement amount is $7,500.00. The court also notes that the settlement meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, including that the claim is not for wrongful death, that there are no unresolved liens to be satisfied, and that the settlement is $50,000 or less.

However, the court also identifies several deficiencies in the petition, including the incorrect address listed on the Notice of Motion, the lack of an Application to be appointed guardian ad litem for the minor, and the failure to file proof of service indicating that the petition has been properly served on all parties. As a result, the court continues the petition to September 17, 2024, and orders the petitioner to electronically file supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing.
