And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to set aside and vacate a judgment entered against him. The defendant claims that he entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff, but mistakenly sent the payment directly to the plaintiff instead of to the Labor Commissioner. The judge is continuing the hearing on the motion to allow the Labor Commissioner to be served with the motion. The judge finds that the defendant has shown a basis to set aside the judgment on grounds of mistake and inadvertence, but notes that the Labor Commissioner should have been given notice of the motion. The judge orders the defendant to file proof of service of the motion and to give notice of the court's ruling.
