23STCV06987
Motion to Remove
Case from Arbitration
Motion to Enforce
Stay Pending Arbitration
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Plaintiff
Cynthia Batac (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment case against Defendants
Windsor Healthcare Management, Inc. (“Windsor Healthcare”); Windsor Terrace
Healthcare; LLC (“Windsor Terrace”); SNF Management Company LLC (“SNF”); CPE HR
Inc. (“CPE”); Modern HR, Inc. (“Modern HR”); and Amanda Moore (“Moore”).  All of the defendants except CPE and Modern
HR filed a motion to compel arbitration on May 31, 2023, and CPE and Modern HR
filed a notice of joinder on June 1, 2023. 
Plaintiff opposed the motion, which the Court granted on August 17, 2023,
and the Court stayed the case. 
Notwithstanding the stay, Plaintiff’s counsel named six more defendants to
this case on September 18, 2023.  Then,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed an ex parte application to return the case to the
active docket, which the Court denied on October 9, 2023.  Afterwards, Plaintiff’s counsel added a
seventh new defendant and issued deposition notices (even though the case was
stayed).  Now, Defendant files a motion
to enforce the stay or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration of the new
defendants.  Plaintiff again seeks to
return this case to the active docket. 
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
            Plaintiff
filed this employment case on March 30, 2023. 
Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the Court granted
on August 17, 2023.  The Court’s order
stated as follows: “The case is ordered stayed pending binding arbitration as
to the entire matter.”  (See Court’s
Minute Order, dated August 17, 2023.)  Notwithstanding
the stay, on September 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed six Doe amendments
naming defendants in place of Doe 1 through Doe 6.  (See Amendments to Complaint
(Fictitious/Incorrect Name), dated September 18, 2023.)  
 
            On October
6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed an ex parte application to withdraw this
case from arbitration and restore the case to the active docket under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.97, arguing that the arbitration fees were not
paid in a timely manner.  The Court
denied the ex parte application for two reasons.  First, the Court found that an ex parte
application was improper because there was no irreparable harm, immediate
danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, as required
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202. 
(See Court’s Minute Order, dated October 9, 2023.)  Second, and more important, the Court found
that the arbitration fees had, in fact, been paid:
 
“Second, in fact, the required fees
were paid in a timely manner. Plaintiff’s counsel represents that the fees were
due on or before September 30, 2023. (See Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application, pp.
3:10, 4:3.) Defendants’ counsel provides an email from the arbitration service
stating “This will confirm that the filing fee was paid/received on September
15, 2023, by the Castro Law Group on behalf of all Respondents. The filing fees
are not based on the number of Respondents; therefore, the filing requirements have
been met and the AAA are proceeding forward with this matter.” (Declaration of
Kerri Lutfey, Exh. #6.) There is no basis to find that this email is false.”
 
(See id., pp. 1-2.)  
 
            Notwithstanding
the Court’s order staying this case and the Court’s order finding that the case
properly belonged in arbitration, Plaintiff’s counsel named a seventh defendant
in place of Doe 7 on October 9, 2023.  (See
Notice of Amendment to Complaint, filed on October 9, 2023.)  Then, on October 24, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel sought to take depositions of six of the new defendants and two other
individuals in the instant case.  (See
Declaration of Kerri R. Lutfey, ¶ 6.)  
 
            On October
20, 2023, Defendants’ counsel filed a motion to enforce the stay or, in the
alternative, to compel arbitration of the new defendants.  Defendants also seek monetary sanctions in
the about of $6,810 against Plaintiff Cynthia Batac and her counsel, Suzanne E.
Rand-Lewis, for discovery abuses under Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030.  Then, on October 24, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion to withdraw the case from arbitration and to return
the case to the active docket under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97,
arguing that the arbitration fees were not paid in a timely manner.   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Plaintiff’s Motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.97
 
Under the California Arbitration
Act, in an employment arbitration, if the employer fails to timely pay the fees
and costs to initiate the arbitration within 30 days of the due date, the
employer has breached the arbitration agreement, and has waived the right to compel
arbitration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281.97, subd. (a)(1).)  The fees are due upon receipt of the invoice
unless the arbitration agreement states the number of days in which the parties
to the arbitration must pay all required fees. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281.97, subd. (a)(2).)  The parties’ agreement controls: “[U]nless
the parties expressly agree to the contrary, the drafting party’s receipt of
the invoice triggers the 30-day clock under section 1281.97, subdivision
(a)(1).”  (Espinoza v. Superior Court
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 774.)   
 
            The Court
(again) finds that Defendants paid the arbitration fee in a timely manner.  On August 31, 2023, the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) sent a letter to the parties stating: “[W]e request that
the employer pay its share of the filing fee in the amount of $2,100 on
September 30, 2023.”  (See Declaration of
Kerri R. Lutfey, Exh. #1.)  On September
15, 2023, AAA sent an email reminding Defendants (except for Windsor Terrace
Healthcare, LLC, which was in bankruptcy) to pay the filing fee of $2,100 by
the deadline of September 30, 2023.  (See
id., Exh. #4.)  AAA sent a payment link
first to Ms. Kerri R. Lutfey, who represents Windsor Healthcare Management,
Inc., Windsor Terrace Healthcare, LLC, SNF Management Company LLC, and Amanda
Moore.  (See id., Exh. #5.)  Then, AAA sent a payment link to Mr. Jose-Manuel
A. de Castro, who represents CPE HR Inc. and Modern HR Inc.  (See id., Exh. #6.)  Mr. de Castro paid the fee that day.  (See id., ¶ 7.)  AAA sent a letter to the parties, dated
September 15, 2023, confirming that the fee of $2,100 had been paid.  (See id., Exh. #7.)  AAA sent another letter to the parties, dated
October 3, 2023, confirming that the total filing fee was $2,100, and that it
had been paid.  (See id., Exh. #8.)  Contrary to Plaintiff’s counsel’s argument,
the filing fee was a total of $2,100, and not $2,100 for each party or each set
of parties.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s
motion is denied.
 
            B.        Defendants’ Motion to Enforce the Stay
and for Sanctions 
 
            The Court
is concerned that Plaintiff’s counsel disobeyed a court order staying this case
by naming additional defendants and, more troubling, propounding discovery.  The Court’s order was clear on its face: “The
case is ordered stayed pending binding arbitration as to the entire
matter.”  (See Court’s Minute Order,
dated August 17, 2023.)  There is no
justification for Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct.  If Plaintiff’s counsel believed that the
order should no longer apply (e.g., based upon the arguments raised in her
motion or opposition to Defendants’ motion), she should have raised those
issues first with the Court.  By
propounding discovery in a case that has been stayed, Plaintiff’s counsel has
violated a court order. 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ motion.  The Court finds that Plaintiff and her
counsel, Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, have misused the discovery process within the
meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 by serving deposition
notices and attempting to take depositions in a case which has been stayed by
order of the Court.  The Court finds that
this violates Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010(a).  The Court also finds that Plaintiff and her
counsel have caused undue oppression, burden, and expense to Defendants, per
section 2023.010(c), based upon the necessity of the instant litigation.  The Court finds that the request for
sanctions in the amount of $6,810 is fair and reasonable under the
circumstances.    The Court considered whether to issue an
Order to Show Cause re: Sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5
or sections 128 and 2019, but the Court believes that the instant sanctions
order sufficiently resolves the issue by making Defendants whole.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
withdraw this case from arbitration and return the case to the active docket.
 
            2.         The Court grants Defendants’ motion to
enforce the stay.  This case shall remain
stayed for all purposes absent an order from the Court.   
 
            3.         The Court grants Defendants’ request
for sanctions and orders Plaintiff and her counsel, Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis,
Esq., jointly and severally, to pay the moving Defendants monetary sanctions in
the amount of $6,810 within thirty (30) days through their counsel, Kerri R.
Lutfey, Esq. 
 
            4.         The Court advances and vacates all
dates.  The Court orders the parties to
meet-and-confer and to proceed with the arbitration.  The Court advances and continues the Order to
Show Cause why this case should not be dismissed following arbitration from
March 4, 2024, to December 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court orders the parties to file a status
report on or before November 19, 2024. 
The Court provides notice: If Plaintiff’s counsel does not appear at the
OSC hearing, absent good cause, the Court will assume this case has been
resolved by way of arbitration or settlement and will dismiss the case with
prejudice.
 
            5.         Defendants’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
