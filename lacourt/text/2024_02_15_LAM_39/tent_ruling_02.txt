 Case Number:  21STCV07112    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  39 Jim Hoseini v.
Michael Mercer, et al.
Case No.
21STCV07112
Motion for
Attorney’s Fees
 
            The Court
granted Defendants’ special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, and awarded Defendants a total of $24,693.89 for attorneys’
fees and costs.  Plaintiff filed a notice
of appeal, but the appeal was dismissed because Plaintiff “failed to timely
appeal the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion.”  The Court of Appeal ordered that Defendants
are entitled to recover their costs on appeal. 
However, Defendants’ counsel also seeks $24,872.65 in attorneys’
fees.  
 
            Defendants’
motion is problematic.  As an initial
matter, the notice of motion seeks only attorneys’ fees “incurred in defending
an appeal” of the Court’s decision to grant the anti-SLAPP motion.  However, the motion itself seeks a large
amount of fees for judgment debtor proceedings in Defendants’ counsel’s effort
to collect the prior fees award.  Not
only is this not included in the notice of motion, the memorandum of points and
authorities cites no authority for the prospect that a judgment creditor may seek
attorneys’ fees under these circumstances. 
Defendants’ counsel is required to file a comprehensive notice of motion
and cite proper authority in support of a request for attorneys’ fees.
 
            Similarly,
the Court is troubled because the motion includes costs on appeal that are not
included in the memorandum of costs. 
Specifically, Defendants’ counsel seeks $3,527.65 in costs but the
memorandum of costs seeks only $390 in filing fees and $43.20 for filings in
the Court of Appeal.  Presumably, these
costs also stem from judgment debtor proceedings.  Therefore, in the absence of proper notice
and statutory authority, the Court considers the motion only with respect to
attorneys’ fees that clearly were earned for the appeal in this matter.  
 
The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  The burden is on the party seeking
attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.)  The Court has broad discretion in determining
the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its
calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the
factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
            The Court’s
review of the record suggests that Defendants’ counsel spent limited amounts of
time on the appeal.  The Court authorizes
the following hours based upon its review of the billing records and its view
of the amount of time that reasonably should have been spent on the tasks
related to the appeal:
 
            Jeffrey
Lewis:             1.7 Hours        
            Sean
Rotstan:              11.9 Hours 
            Jason
Ebbens:             3.4 Hours
            Renee
Miramontes:    3.0 Hours
 
The Court authorizes the following billing rates:
 
            Jeffrey
Lewis:             $700 per hour
            Sean
Rotstan:              $400 per hour
            Jason
Ebbens:             $150 per hour 
            Renee Miramonte:      $150 per hour 
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court authorizes the following
attorneys’ fees for the appeal:
 
            Jeffrey
Lewis:             $1,190
            Sean
Rotstan:              $4,760
            Jason
Ebbens:             $510
            Renee
Miramonte:      $450
 
In addition, the Court authorizes an additional five hours
for the instant motion and all related proceedings at a rate of $400 per hour,
for a total of $2,000.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants the motion only with
respect to attorneys’ fees and costs clearly related to the appeal.  The Court denies the motion for lack of
notice and statutory authority with respect to attorneys’ fees relating to
judgment debtor proceedings.
 
            2.         The Court orders Plaintiff to pay an
additional $8,910 in attorneys’ fees.
 
            3.         The Court orders Plaintiff to pay an
additional $433.20 in costs.
 
            4.         Defendants’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
