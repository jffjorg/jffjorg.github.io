Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by ICANN. The judge sustains the demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action, which are based on contract claims. The judge finds that the complaint does not clearly identify a policy requiring ICANN to permit registration of single character domain names. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is for declaratory relief, because this matter is not suitable for declaratory relief. The judge sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which is for negligence, because the complaint does not allege a duty. The judge sustains the demurrer to the seventh cause of action, which is for fraudulent inducement, because the complaint does not satisfy the standard for alleging fraud with particularity. Finally, the judge sustains the demurrer to the unfair competition claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200, which appears to be derivative of the fraudulent inducement claim. The judge grants leave to amend with respect to the second and fifth causes of action, but denies leave to amend with respect to the first, sixth, and seventh causes of action.
