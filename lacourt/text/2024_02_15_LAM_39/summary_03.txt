And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in this employment case. The defendants' motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff is granted. The plaintiff is ordered to make himself available for the examination within 20 days, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer to select a date or dates for the examination.

The defendants' motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production of documents is denied, except for requests for the plaintiff's telephone number(s) during the relevant time period and his mobile/cellular carriers. The plaintiff is ordered to produce his EDD records, which he has agreed to do.

The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain special interrogatories is denied, as the plaintiff's counsel has served an excessive number of interrogatories without good cause.

Finally, the case management order sets forth dates for a hearing on motion for summary judgment, a final status conference, and trial.
