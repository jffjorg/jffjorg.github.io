Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena for employment records. The plaintiff, Jocelyn Lopez, is seeking to prevent her former employer, Arcadia Living, LLC, from obtaining her employment records from her current employer, Cedars Sinai Health Ventures. Arcadia Living, LLC is seeking the records as part of its affirmative defense that Jocelyn Lopez was an administrative employee exempt from overtime and minimum wage laws. The court has granted the motion to quash the subpoena because Arcadia Living, LLC has failed to establish an evidentiary foundation for an exemption. The court has also denied Jocelyn Lopez's request for sanctions against Arcadia Living, LLC and its counsel.
