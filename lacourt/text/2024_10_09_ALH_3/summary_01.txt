And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel depositions of defendants Yun Xiang Tseng and Kristine A. Naldjian, as well as sanctions in the amount of $3,067.26 each. The plaintiff had requested these relief due to the defendants' failure to appear for their depositions. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff did not include any deposition notice in their motion, and therefore, the threshold requirement that a deposition notice was actually served has not been established. Additionally, the plaintiff's counsel did not provide an explanation for why the requested sanctions are reasonable. The motions are denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the motions and provide the necessary evidence to support their claims.
