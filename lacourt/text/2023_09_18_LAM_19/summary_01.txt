The judge denied the Motion to Set Aside Default Based On Attorney Fault filed by Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona without prejudice. The Motion was filed late, missing pages, and incomprehensible, and did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge also rejected the argument that the Motion was untimely, as the mandatory provision of the code requires the application to be made no more than six months after entry of judgment, and default judgment has not been entered. The judge noted that the Motion was missing pages, including a signature page, and that the proposed demurrer was also missing pages, and therefore the Motion was not in "proper form" as required by the code.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant Valencia Fulfillment, Inc.'s motion to set aside default based on attorney fault. The defendant had filed a motion to set aside the default that was entered against them on June 16, 2022, citing attorney mistake. However, the judge found that the motion was incomplete and missing pages, including a signature page from the attorney's declaration. The judge also found that the proposed demurrer was missing pages and therefore not in proper form. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to refile the motion with the necessary documentation. The judge noted that the default judgment has not been entered, and therefore the six-month period for mandatory relief has not begun to run. The plaintiffs had alleged breach of contract, constructive trust/unjust enrichment, violation of Business and Professions Code §17200, and interference with prospective economic advantage & business relations. The judge's ruling does not address the merits of these claims, but rather the procedural issue of the defendant's motion to set aside default.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge denied the motion by Defendants Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona to set aside a default that had been entered against the company, Valencia Fulfillment, Inc. The denial was "without prejudice," meaning the Defendants can file the motion again.  The Judge denied the motion because the supporting documents, specifically the declaration of their attorney Robert Hirschman, were incomplete (missing pages and a signature) and because a required responsive pleading (a proposed demurrer, also incomplete) was not properly submitted.  The judge ruled that the motion was *not* untimely, despite the Plaintiffs' claim that it was filed too late. The underlying case involves a lawsuit by Plaintiffs Rocio Ayala and Gary Rand & Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, Professional Law Corporations, against the Defendants for breach of contract and other claims.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the briefs and oral arguments in this case and has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment without prejudice. The defendants, Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona, had sought to set aside the default judgment based on attorney fault, but the judge found that the motion was not in proper form and was missing critical information. Specifically, the declaration of Robert Hirschman, the defendants' attorney, was missing pages, including a signature page, and the proposed demurrer was also missing pages. The judge also found that the motion was untimely, but only because the default judgment had not been entered. The judge noted that the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) requires the application to be made "no more than six months after entry of judgment," and since default judgment had not been entered, the six-month period had not begun to run. However, the judge found that the motion was denied without prejudice, allowing the defendants to refile the motion if they can cure the defects and provide the required information.

**Case Number:** 22STCV15026

**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Dept:** 19

**RULING**

After considering the briefing and oral argument, Defendants Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona's Motion to Set Aside Default Based On Attorney Fault is **DENIED without prejudice**. Plaintiffs' counsel is to provide notice.

**CASE BACKGROUND**

This case involves an alleged breach of contract. Plaintiffs Rocio Ayala, Gary Rand, and Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, Professional Law Corporations, have sued Defendants Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona for Breach of Express Contract, Constructive Trust/Unjust Enrichment, Violation of Business and Professions Code §17200, and Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage & Business Relations. Default was entered for Defendant Valencia Fulfillment, Inc. on June 16, 2022.

**MOTION DENIED**

Defendant Valencia Fulfillment, Inc. moved for relief from default based on attorney mistake under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The court must consider two parts: discretionary and mandatory relief provisions.

1. **Discretionary relief provision** - A party must show that the attorney's neglect was excusable.
2. **Mandatory relief provision** - The court must grant relief if the attorney admits neglect, even if it was inexcusable.

Defendant Valencia moved under the mandatory provision. However, the motion is missing pages, including the signature page of Robert Hirschman's declaration and pages of the proposed demurrer. The court cannot consider an incomplete affidavit or a motion without a responsive pleading. Therefore, the motion is **DENIED without prejudice**.
