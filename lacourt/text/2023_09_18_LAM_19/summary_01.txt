The judge denied the Motion to Set Aside Default Based On Attorney Fault filed by Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona without prejudice. The Motion was filed late, missing pages, and incomprehensible, and did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge also rejected the argument that the Motion was untimely, as the mandatory provision of the code requires the application to be made no more than six months after entry of judgment, and default judgment has not been entered. The judge noted that the Motion was missing pages, including a signature page, and that the proposed demurrer was also missing pages, and therefore the Motion was not in "proper form" as required by the code.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant Valencia Fulfillment, Inc.'s motion to set aside default based on attorney fault. The defendant had filed a motion to set aside the default that was entered against them on June 16, 2022, citing attorney mistake. However, the judge found that the motion was incomplete and missing pages, including a signature page from the attorney's declaration. The judge also found that the proposed demurrer was missing pages and therefore not in proper form. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to refile the motion with the necessary documentation. The judge noted that the default judgment has not been entered, and therefore the six-month period for mandatory relief has not begun to run. The plaintiffs had alleged breach of contract, constructive trust/unjust enrichment, violation of Business and Professions Code ยง17200, and interference with prospective economic advantage & business relations. The judge's ruling does not address the merits of these claims, but rather the procedural issue of the defendant's motion to set aside default.
