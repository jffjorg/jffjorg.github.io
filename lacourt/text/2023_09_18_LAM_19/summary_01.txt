And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the Motion to Set Aside Default Based On Attorney Fault filed by Valencia Fulfillment, Inc., Jose Corona, and Marisol Corona without prejudice. The Motion was filed late, missing pages, and incomprehensible, and did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge also rejected the argument that the Motion was untimely, as the mandatory provision of the code requires the application to be made no more than six months after entry of judgment, and default judgment has not been entered. The judge noted that the Motion was missing pages, including a signature page, and that the proposed demurrer was also missing pages, and therefore the Motion was not in "proper form" as required by the code.
