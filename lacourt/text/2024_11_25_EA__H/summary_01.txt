The judge grants the motion of Morgan & Morgan Los Angeles, LP to be relieved as counsel for David Zucconi and Anahiz Zucconi, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the clients at their last known addresses. The motion is granted because the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, have been met, and there is no opposition to the motion. The judge notes that the attorney and clients have communicative differences that cannot be resolved, and the attorney has served the clients with the motion papers.
