Discussion 
Morgan
& Morgan Los Angeles, LLP seeks
to be relieved as counsel of record for the Clients. 
The Court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed
to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The Court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules Court,
rule 3.1362(e).) 
Attorney Constantinos Pavlakos attests that the
attorney and the Clients “have communicative differences that cannot be
resolved.”
Pavlakos states that he served the Clients by mail
at the Clients’ last known address with copies of the motion papers served with
his declaration and that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the
address is current, by telephone.
The motion is not opposed. The Court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have been sufficiently met.
Accordingly,
the motions are granted, effective upon the filing of proofs of service
showing service of the signed order(s) upon the Clients at the Clients’ last
known address(es).
