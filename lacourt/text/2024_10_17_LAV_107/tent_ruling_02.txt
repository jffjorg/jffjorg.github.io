I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This
action arises out of a car accident. (Complaint p. 5.) On August 2, 2023,
Plaintiffs Kattalyn Dayenka Diaz, Natalia Hernandez Orduz, Jessica Orduz, and
Valentina Morales filed a complaint against Defendants Cortlynn Thelma Moore
and Does 1 to 50 alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general
negligence. 
 
On
June 3, 2024, Defendant Cortlynn Thelma Moore (“Defendant”) filed twelve
motions to compel discovery.
 
On
September 3, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration stating that
Plaintiffs Kattalyn Diaz, Valentina Morales, Natalia Hernandez, and Jessica
Orduz served verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, on June 4,
2024, July 12, 2024, July 16, 2024, and August 13, 2024, respectively.
(Hanassab Declaration ¶¶ 3-6.) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
declaration further states that Plaintiffs’ served verified responses to
Request for Production, Set One, on August 13, 2024. (Hanassab Declaration ¶
7.) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration does not mention Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories.
 
No replies have been filed.
 
II.            
MEET
AND CONFER¿ 
 
"Unlike
a motion to compel further responses,
a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45–day
time limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good
cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) 
¿ 
Because no response was provided to the instant
discovery requests and Defendant files motions to compel, not motions to compel
further, there is no requirement for the parties to have met and conferred
prior to the filing of the motions.¿ 
 
Regardless, Defendant’s counsel submits a
declaration stating she sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs on April
30, 2024. (Cloud ¶ 10.)
 
On October 14, 2024, the court held an informal discovery conference
with both sides present (remotely). Since that time nothing regarding
compliance has been filed with the court. 
 
III.          
LEGAL STANDARD
 
a.    
Interrogatories 
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response . . . [that party] waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290.) “The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) “The court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2030.230, and 2030.240. [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)
  
b.    
 Demands for Production 
 
“I]f a party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response
to it,… [t]he party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand
[and]…[t]he party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300.) “The court, on motion,
may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that . . . (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. [and] (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)  
 
c.     
Produce
Discovery After Motion is Filed
 
“If a party provides an untimely
interrogatory response . . . the untimely response might completely or
substantially resolve the issues raised by a motion to compel responses[.]” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp.
408-409; see also County of San Benito v. Superior Court (2023) 96
Cal.App.5th 243, 256 [citing Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. in
relation to a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and
interrogatories.]) The court, however, retains authority to hear the motion. (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 409.) “The trial court . . . might deny the motion to compel
responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose
sanctions.” (Id.)
 
d.    
 Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290(c).) 
 
Similarly,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(c).)
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even [if] . . . the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed.”
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION 
 
Motion to Compel #1
 
Defendant requests this court order Plaintiff Jessica Orduz to
provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Defendant served Jessica Orduz with Form Interrogatories, Set One,
on November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The responses were originally
due on December 22, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel granted Jessica Orduz
multiple extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶ 4-10.) With the final extension,
Jessica Orduz’s responses were due by May 10, 2024. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 10.) Jessica
Orduz served no responses by that date. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 12.) 
 
On September 3, 2024, Jessica Orduz’s counsel filed a declaration
stating Jessica Orduz served responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
August 13, 2024. (Hanassab Declaration ¶ 6.)
 
Because Jessica Orduz subsequently served Defendant with responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, this court finds that an order compelling
Jessica Orduz to respond is unnecessary and denies the motion to compel.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #1 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Jessica Orduz did not act with substantial
justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust.¿ This court
also finds Jessica Orduz’s failure to timely respond to Defendant’s discovery
requests a misuse of the discovery process.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Jessica Orduz is granted in
the amount of $360.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee, one hour for preparing
the motion, and one hour for attending the hearing at $150.00 per hour.
 
Motion to Compel #2 
 
Defendant requests this court order Plaintiff Valentina Morales
(“Morales”) to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Defendant served Morales with Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The responses were originally due
on December 22, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel granted Morales multiple
extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶ 4-10.) With the final extension, Morales’
responses were due by May 10, 2024. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 10.) Morales served no
responses by that date. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 12.) 
 
On September 3, 2024, Morales’ counsel filed a declaration stating
Morales served responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, on July 12, 2024.
(Hanassab Declaration ¶ 4; Ex. 2.) 
 
Because Morales subsequently served Defendant with responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, this court finds that an order compelling Morales
to respond is unnecessary and denies the motion to compel.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #2 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Morales did not act with substantial
justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust.¿ This court
also finds Morales’ failure to timely respond to Defendant’s discovery requests
a misuse of the discovery process. Because this court granted Defendant
attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the first motion, and the motions will be
heard on the same day, this court further finds that attorneys’ fees for the
hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Morales is granted in the
amount of $210.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee and one hour for preparing
the motion at $150.00 per hour.
 
Motion to Compel #3 
 
Defendant requests this court order Plaintiff Jessica Orduz to
provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Defendant served Jessica Orduz with Special Interrogatories, Set
One, on November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The responses were
originally due on December 22, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel granted Jessica
Orduz multiple extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶ 4-10.) With the final
extension, Jessica Orduz’s responses were due by May 10, 2024. (Cloud
Declaration ¶ 10.) Jessica Orduz served no responses by that date. (Cloud
Declaration ¶ 12.) 
 
Accordingly, this court grants Defendant’s motion to compel
Jessica Orduz’s responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #3 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Jessica Orduz did not act with substantial
justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust.  This
court also finds Jessica Orduz’s failure to respond to Defendant’s discovery
requests a misuse of the discovery process. Because this court granted Defendant
attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the first motion, and the motions will be
heard on the same day, this court further finds that attorneys’ fees for the
hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Jessica Orduz is granted in
the amount of $210.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee and one hour for
preparing the motion at $150.00 per hour.
 
Motion
to Compel #4
 
Defendant requests this court order Plaintiff Natalia Hernandez
Orduz to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Defendant served Natalia Hernandez Orduz with Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The
responses were originally due on December 22, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel
granted Natalia Hernandez Orduz multiple extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶
4-10.) With the final extension, Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s responses were due
by May 10, 2024. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 10.) Natalia Hernandez Orduz served no
responses by that date. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 12.) 
 
On September 3, 2024, Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s counsel filed a
declaration stating Natalia Hernandez Orduz served responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, on July 16, 2024. (Hanassab Declaration ¶ 4; Ex. 3.) 
 
Because Natalia Hernandez Orduz subsequently served Defendant with
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, this court finds that an order
compelling Natalia Hernandez Orduz to respond is unnecessary and denies the
motion to compel.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #4 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Natalia Hernandez Orduz did not act with
substantial justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of
sanctions unjust.¿ This
court also finds Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s failure to timely respond to Defendant’s
discovery requests a misuse of the discovery process. Because this court
granted Defendant attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the first motion, and the
motions will be heard on the same day, this court further finds that attorneys’
fees for the hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Natalie Hernandez Orduz is
granted in the amount of $210.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee and one hour
for preparing the motion at $150.00 per hour.
 
Motion
to Compel #5
 
Defendant requests this court order Plaintiff Natalia Hernandez
Orduz to provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Defendant served Natalia Hernandez Orduz with Special
Interrogatories, Set One, on November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The
responses were originally due on December 22, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel
granted Natalia Hernandez Orduz multiple extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶
4-10.) With the final extension, Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s responses were due
by May 10, 2024. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 10.) Natalia Hernandez Orduz served no
responses by that date. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 12.) 
 
Accordingly, this court grants Defendant’s motion to compel
Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set
One. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #5 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Natalia Hernandez Orduz did not act with
substantial justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of
sanctions unjust.¿ This
court also finds Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s failure to respond to Defendant’s discovery
requests a misuse of the discovery process. Because this court granted
Defendant attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the first motion, and the motions
will be heard on the same day, this court further finds that attorneys’ fees
for the hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Natalie Hernandez Orduz is
granted in the amount of $210.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee and one hour
for preparing the motion at $150.00 per hour.

extensions. (Cloud Declaration ¶¶ 4-10.) With the final extension, Morales’
responses were due by May 10, 2024. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 10.) Morales served no
responses by that date. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 12.)
 
On September 3, 2024, Morales’ counsel filed a declaration stating
Plaintiffs served responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on
August 13, 2024. (Hanassab Declaration ¶ 7.) 

 
Because Morales subsequently served Defendant with responses to
Demand to Produce, Set One, this court finds that an order compelling Morales
to respond is unnecessary and denies the motion to compel.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #6 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Morales did not act with substantial
justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust.¿ This court
also finds Morales’ failure to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests a
misuse of the discovery process. Because this court granted Defendant
attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the first motion, and the motions will be
heard on the same day, this court further finds that attorneys’ fees for the
hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Morales is granted in the
amount of $210.00, reflecting the $60.00 filing fee and one hour for preparing

On September 3, 2024, Morales’ counsel filed a declaration stating
Plaintiffs served responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on

Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the
$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for
appearing at the hearing. (Notice of Motion #7 p. 2.) 
 
This court finds that Diaz did not act with substantial
justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions

$60.00 motion filing fee, one hour for preparing the motion, and one hour for

stating Plaintiffs served responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, on August 13, 2024. (Hanassab Declaration ¶ 7.)  
 
Because Jessica Orduz subsequently served Defendant with responses

Defendant served Natalia Hernandez Orduz with Demand to Produce,
Set One, on November 20, 2023. (Cloud Declaration ¶ 4.) The responses were

Because Natalia Hernandez Orduz subsequently served Defendant with

Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $360.00 in monetary sanctions. This includes the

court also finds Natalia Hernandez Orduz’s failure
to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests a misuse of the discovery process.
Because this court granted Defendant attorneys’ fees for the hearing on the
first motion, and the motions will be heard on the same day, this court further
finds that attorneys’ fees for the hearing on this motion would be duplicative.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Natalia
Hernandez Orduz is granted in the amount of $210.00, reflecting the
$60.00 filing fee and one hour for preparing the motion at $150.00 per hour.
 
I.
