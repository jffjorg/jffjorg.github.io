And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to stay the proceedings in this case is granted. The plaintiff, Jose Moreno, brought a representative action under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) against the defendants, PPG Industries, Inc. and Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation. However, the defendants showed that another aggrieved employee, Jovani Orozco, has already brought a PAGA action against Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation in a separate case. The judge finds that proceeding with both actions would be inefficient, as the PAGA claims significantly overlap and judgment in the earlier action would bind all aggrieved employees. Therefore, the court has stayed the entire action pending resolution of the earlier action.
