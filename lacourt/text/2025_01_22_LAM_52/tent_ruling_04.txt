 Case Number:  24STCV08289    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendants
PPG Industries, Inc. and Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation’s Motion for Stay of
Proceedings
Defendants
PPG Industries, Inc. and Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation move to stay this action
by plaintiff Jose Moreno.  Defendants
argue the court should do under the doctrine of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction or via the court’s inherent authority.  The court will stay the action under its inherent
authority.  The court therefore need not
and does not reach the issue of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction.
Staying
this action will serve the interest of judicial economy.  “Trial courts generally have the inherent
power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.”  (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)   Plaintiff brings a representative action under
the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA).  Defendants show that another aggrieved
employee has already brought a PAGA action against Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation
in Jovani Orozco v. Sierracin/Sylmar Corp., case No. 23STCV26564.  (Davoudian Decl., ¶ 2, Exs. 1-2.)  
Proceeding
with this action along with the prior action would be inefficient.  The PAGA claims significantly overlap.  Judgment in the former action would bind all
aggrieved employees.  (Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986.)  “[T]here is no mechanism for opting out of the
judgment entered on the PAGA claim.”  (Robinson v. Southern Counties
Oil Company¿(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 476, 482.)  The court finds staying this action
appropriate because the earlier action could result in a binding adjudication
of some of plaintiff’s claims.   
Defendants PPG Industries,
Inc. and Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation’s motion to stay proceedings is granted.  The court hereby stays the entire
action pending resolution of Jovani Orozco v. Sierracin/Sylmar Corp.,
case No. 23STCV26564.
