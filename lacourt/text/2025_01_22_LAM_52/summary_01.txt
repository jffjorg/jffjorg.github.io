And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club is granted its motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in its requests for admission, set one, to plaintiff Gail Wiggan. This is because plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to the requests, which Interinsurance served on July 15, 2024. As a result, Interinsurance is entitled to an order deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests. Additionally, the court must impose sanctions against plaintiff for her failure to serve a timely response. The sanctions will be in the amount of $1,740, which plaintiff must pay within 30 days.
