And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiffs, Dr. Lincoln Luk, Jr., M.D. and California Society of Pathologists, can seal certain records containing confidential information. The records in question include portions of exhibits A-Q and Y to Avi W. Rutschman's declaration in support of the plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication, as well as exhibits B and C to Richard Long's declaration. The judge found that the patients' privacy rights and the confidentiality requirements of HIPAA outweigh the public's right to access these records. The judge also found that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that there are no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest in protecting the patients' privacy. However, the judge did not grant the plaintiffs' request to seal Exhibit R to Rutschman's declaration, as the defendant failed to file a motion to seal the record within the required time frame and the clerk must now transfer the unredacted version of the document into the public file.
