And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs regarding their motion for a protective order to quash the deposition notices issued by the defendant. The judge finds that the in-person deposition of the plaintiffs may cause emotional distress and that a remote deposition would be more suitable. The judge also grants the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents, finding that the defendant's responses were deficient and not code-compliant. Additionally, the judge denies the plaintiffs' request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel.
