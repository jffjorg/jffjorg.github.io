ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff American
Contractors Indemnity Company (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for breach of indemnity agreement against Defendant
Elias Gonzalo Davila aka Gonzalo Davila (“Defendant”)
on July 11, 2022. Defendant filed an answer in properia persona on September 26,
2022. On March 8, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests
for admissions, set one, admitted. (Minute Order, 03/08/23.) On August
10, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges a
single cause of action for breach of bond application/indemnity agreement.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant agreed to indemnify Plaintiff for losses
incurred with respect to Contractors License Bond, No. 100317995, issued
on behalf of LD Construction and Demolition, Inc. (“A B B Construction”).
(Compl., ¶¶3-5.) A copy of the indemnity agreement is attached to the Complaint
and provides that in consideration of the execution of the Bond, Defendant
agrees to reimburse Plaintiff “upon demand for all payments made for and to
indemnify Surety from all loss, claim payments, costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ and construction consultants’ fees, which the Surety incurs.”
(Compl., ¶5 and Exh. A, ¶1.) Plaintiff allegedly incurred damages over the past
four years as a result of its obligations under the Bond in the amount of
$15,700.00. (Id. at ¶6.) Plaintiff allegedly discharged all its
obligations under the Agreement and Bond, while Defendant breached the same by
failing to take appropriate action to resolve the claims on the Bond and by
failing to reimburse Plaintiff for its losses. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) As a
result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $15,700.00.
(Id. at ¶9.)  
 
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. On a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication of a particular cause of action, a moving plaintiff must show that
there is no defense by proving each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the
Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such inferences [citations], in
the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
In support of the Motion, Plaintiff requests that the court
take judicial notice of (1) the Complaint for breach of contract filed July 11,
2022; (2) Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint filed September 26, 2022; (3)
Plaintiff’s Motion for Requests for Admissions to be Deemed Admitted, filed March
8, 2023; and (4) Notice of Ruling on ACIC’s motion for Requests for Admissions
to be Deemed Admitted, filed July 24, 2023. The request is granted pursuant to
Cal. Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c) and (d). 
 
Cause of Action for Breach of Indemnity Agreement
 
The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are
(1) the existence of contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach (or anticipatory breach); and (4)
resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) 
 
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment for breach of
the indemnity agreement, Plaintiff presents the following undisputed facts. Plaintiff
issued Contractor’s License Bond No. 100317995 (“the Bond”) naming LD
Construction and Demolition, Inc. (“Principal”) as principal and the State of
California as oblige. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Baciocco Decl.,
¶5.) In exchange, on July 7, 2016, Defendant entered into an indemnity
agreement with Plaintiff as surety. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 1;
Baciocco Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 3.) Pursuant to the indemnity agreement, Defendant
agreed to reimburse Surety “upon demand for all payments made for and to
indemnify Surety from all loss, claim payments, costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ and construction consultants’ fees, which the Surety incurs.”
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Baciocco Decl., ¶6 and Exh. 3, p. 2.) 
 
In February 2018, Plaintiff sent Defendant a letter
requesting indemnification with respect to a claim made by Peter Geykhman (“Geykhman”).
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Baciocco Decl., ¶7 and Exh. 6.) On
August 1, 2018, Plaintiff sent another letter to Defendant requesting that it
fulfill its obligations under the Indemnity Agreement. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 5; Baciocco Decl., ¶8 and Exh. 7.) August 15, 2018,
Plaintiff sent a check for $1,000.00 to Guardian Group, Inc. as payment for
investigation services it rendered into Geykhman’s claim. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 6; Baciocco Decl., ¶9 and Exh. 8.) On August 17, 2018,
Plaintiff sent Geykhman a letter and check for $15,000.00 for full and final
settlement under the Bond. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 7; Baciocco
Decl., ¶10 and Exh. 9.) Defendant was sent a copy of this letter and check.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 7; Baciocco Decl., ¶10 and Exh. 9.) 
 
On September 20, 2018, April 23, 2019, November 22, 2019,
August 20, 2022, and August 31, 2021, ACIC sent Defendant Notices of
Reimbursement Due. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 8, 10; Baciocco
Decl., ¶¶11, 14 and Exhs. 10, 13.) On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff received a
$300.00 payment towards the outstanding balance due on the Bond from Defendant.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Baciocco Decl., ¶13 and Exh. 12.)
Plaintiff incurred damages of $15,700.00 plus interest of $8,372.60, attorney’s
fees, and costs. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 11; Baciocco Decl., ¶16;
Murray Decl., Exh. 5.) Defendant’s answer does not include facts that support
any defense to the Complaint. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 14; Murray Decl.,
¶5 and Exh. 2.) The Court also granted Plaintiff’s motion to admit the requests
for admission propounded on Defendant. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 15-16;
Murray Decl., ¶¶6-7 and Exhs. 3-4.) 
 
This evidence carries
Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof as to its claims for breach of the Indemnity
Agreement against Defendant. Plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of the Indemnity
Agreement between itself and Defendant, Defendant’s breach by failing to
reimburse Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s resulting damages. The burden now shifts
to Defendant to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to
Plaintiff’s claims. As no opposition has been filed, however, Defendant has
failed to demonstrate the existence of any triable issue of material fact. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff American
Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
