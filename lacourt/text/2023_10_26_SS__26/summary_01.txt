And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by defendant Heather Naylor to the first amended complaint is overruled. The demurrer was based on allegations that the complaint does not attach a copy of the written lease agreement or allege its terms verbatim, and that the complaint does not specify when the rent was due. The judge has found that the complaint does sufficiently set forth the legal effect of the rent concessions and relocation credits, and that the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to apprise the defendant of the basis of the alleged breach of the lease agreement. The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts and uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10. As a result, the defendant is required to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
