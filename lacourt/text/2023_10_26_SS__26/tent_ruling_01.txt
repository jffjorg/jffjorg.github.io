ANALYSIS:
 
On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff
SM 10000 Property LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
for breach of lease agreement against Defendant Heather Naylor (“Defendant”). The First Amended Complaint, also alleging
a single cause of action for breach of lease agreement, was filed on October 6,
2022. On June 22, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s motion to quash service
and ordered Defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days. (Minute
Order, 06/22/23.) 
 
On July 19, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 3, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant owns
the residential rental property located at 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California. (Compl., ¶1.) On June 13, 2019, Defendant rented Unit 2101
of the Property pursuant to a written lease agreement for 12 months commencing
on July 28, 2019. (Id. at ¶5.) The monthly rent was $12,150.00 due on
the first of each month; following the 12-month period the lease would continue
on a month-to-month basis. (Ibid.) A copy of the lease agreement is
attached as Exhibit A. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. A.) Defendant was in
possession of Unit 2101 from July 28, 2019 through August 17, 2020, and left a balance
owing of $17,663.56. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) On September 1, 2020, Defendant received
a rent concession of $12,000.00 covering two weeks of rent in July 2020 and two
weeks of rent in August 2020. (Id. at ¶9.) Defendant received a second
rent concession of $3,000.00 to cover another week in August 2020. (Ibid.)
The rent concessions, which were intended to reimburse Defendant for incurred
expenses, are eliminated because Defendant sought those relocation credits in a
small claims case, LASC 22SMSC00457. (Id. at ¶10.) The Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to transfer the small claims case to be heard with this
action. (Ibid.) Based on the combined concessions of $15,000.00 and
unpaid rent of $17,663.56, Plaintiff seeks $32,663.56 in damages. (Id.
at ¶11.) Defendant breached the lease agreement by failing to make complete
rental payments from July 28, 2019 through August 17, 2020. (Id. at ¶12.)
Plaintiff performed all its obligations under the lease agreement. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff made a good faith effort to investigate whether governmental rental
assistance was available to Defendant and received a Final Decision (as defined
in the Civil Code) that she was not. (Id. at ¶13.)
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required
by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Jacobs Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Defendant
demurs to the breach of contract cause of action for failure to allege
sufficient facts and uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivisions (e) and (f). Special demurrers, however, are not permitted in a
court of limited jurisdiction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Therefore,
the Court will not rule on the demurrer for uncertainty. 
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are (1)
existence of contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach (or anticipatory breach); and
(4) resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y.
Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) Defendant demurs on the
grounds that the First Amended Complaint does not attach a copy of the written lease
agreement or its amendments, nor allege its terms verbatim. In opposition,
Plaintiff points out that did it attach a copy of the lease agreement and that a
contract can be alleged according to its legal effect.
 
A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim in
the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and
incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect. (Id., §§ 479, 480,
pp. 572–573.) In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must
“allege the substance of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it
requires a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement,
and avoidance of legal conclusions.” (Id., § 480, p. 573.)
 
(McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) The complete
lease agreement, therefore, is attached to the First Amended Complaint.
Regarding the terms of the rent concessions/relocation credits, the First
Amended Complaint sets forth the amounts paid, the time periods covered, and
their purpose. At the pleading stage, this sufficiently sets forth the legal
effect of the rent concessions/relocation credits. 
 
Defendant also
argues that Plaintiff has not alleged when the rent was due. The First Amended
Complaint, however, alleges that rent was due the first of each month and that
over the course of the rental period, from July 28, 2019 and August 17,
2020, Plaintiff failed to pay $17,663.56. This is sufficiently detailed at the
pleading stage to appraise Defendant of the basis of the alleged breach of the
lease agreement. 
 
Finally, the Demurrer points to numerous alleged statutory
violations by Plaintiff which are premised on facts outside of the First
Amended Complaint and of which the Court has not taken judicial notice.
(Demurrer, p. 5:19-9:2.) These arguments are improper on demurrer. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) Therefore,
the Demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of lease agreement is
overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Heather Naylor’s Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
Moving party to give notice.
