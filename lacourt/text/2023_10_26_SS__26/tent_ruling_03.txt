ANALYSIS:
 
On June 5, 2023, Defendant Xuehao Tang (“Defendant Tang”)
served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, on Plaintiff Samia Naous (“Plaintiff”) (Motions, Romans Decl., Exh. C.) Despite a meet and confer effort
extending the deadline to serve verified responses without objections,
Plaintiff has not done so. (Id. at ¶¶7-8 and Exh. D.) Defendant Tang filed
the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on September 15,
2023. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant Tang is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive. Under
a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded in the amount of $510.00 based on
two hours of attorney time billed at $195.00 per hour and filing fees of $60.00
each. (Motions, Romans Decl., ¶9.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Xuehao Tang’s (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF SAMIA NAMOUS IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
PLAINTIFF AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $510.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
