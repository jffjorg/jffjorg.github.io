The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure § 36(a). The motion has been denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, Nani Gita Kanel, is 82 years old and was involved in a motor vehicle accident on August 16, 2022. She has filed the motion seeking a trial preference due to her age and health concerns. However, the court finds that despite the plaintiff's age, her health is not such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court notes that most of the plaintiff's medical records are over two years old and that the plaintiff's current medical prognosis does not indicate that her health is in such a condition necessitating a trial preference. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
