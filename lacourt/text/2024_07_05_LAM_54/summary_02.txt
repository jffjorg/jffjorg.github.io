And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Maurice Leiter has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint in the case of Vardui Rose Barsamyan v. Stolar Law Group, etc., et al. The demurrer was filed by Cross-Defendants Vardui Rose Barsamyan and Barsamyan Family Law.

The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the second, third, and fourth causes of action, and overrules the demurrer as to the first cause of action. The Court finds that the responses to requests for admission do not support the allegations in the First Amended Cross-Complaint.

The Court also rules that the first cause of action for breach of oral contract is sufficient, but the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is insufficient and is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The third and fourth causes of action for tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, respectively, are also insufficient and are sustained with 30 days leave to amend.

The Court grants Cross-Defendants' request for judicial notice of the discovery responses of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Steven Stolar.

The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling, and if they wish to do so, they should email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
