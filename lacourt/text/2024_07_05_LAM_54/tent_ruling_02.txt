BACKGROUND
            
This
is an action arising from alleged nonpayment of wages. On March 21, 2023,
Plaintiff Vardui Rose Barsamyan sued Defendants Stolar Law Group and Steven
Stolar, alleging causes of action for: (1) Unpaid Wages; (2) Inaccurate Wage
Statements; (3) Waiting Time Penalties; (4) Unfair Business Practices; and (5)
Failure to Provide Records.  
 
On March
4, 2024, Defendants and Cross-Complainant Stolar Law Group filed the operative First
Amended Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”) against Cross-Defendants Vardui Rose Barsamyan
and Barsamyan Family Law, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Oral Contract;
(2) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Tortious
Interference with Contract; and (4) Tortious Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage.  
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            The Court GRANTS
Cross-Defendants’ request for judicial notice. The Court can take judicial
notice of the discovery responses of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Steven Stolar.
(Bounds v. Superior Court (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 468, 478.) 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.) A
demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which the
court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or conclusions
of law or fact. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be
alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) In ruling on a
demurrer, “[t]he complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable
inferences from the facts pleaded.” (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 513, 517.) 
 
A. Responses to
Requests for Admission 
 
            Cross-Defendants contend that
Cross-Complainants admitted in discovery to a violation of Penal Code § 476a
and admitted that they stopped payment on Plaintiff’s paycheck and
reimbursement check. Cross-Defendants argue that these admissions mean that all
causes of action asserted in the FAXC fail and the demurrer should be
sustained.  
 
            On
a demurrer, the Court analyzes the pleadings; it does not rely on deemed
admissions. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 224.) Owens v.
Kings Supermarket (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 379, relied on by Cross-Defendants
is inapposite; it addressed inconsistent allegations in a pleading. Berg
& Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Boyle (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1020 did not
address the issue of requests for admission in the context of a demurrer. And Stencel
Aero Engineering Corp. v. Superior Court (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 978 does not
stand for the proposition that responses to requests for admissions can be used
to sustain a demurrer. 
 
            Cross-Defendants
essentially argue that the responses to requests for admission mean there is no
factual dispute concerning certain issues. Cross-Defendants may file a motion
for summary judgment. The Court cannot determine on demurrer that certain
issues are undisputed.
            
B. Sufficiency of the
First Cause of Action for Breach of Oral Contract  
 
To state a cause of action for breach of contract, a party
must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
            The first cause of action for
breach of oral contract is sufficiently alleged. Cross-Complainants have alleged
the existence of a contract, their performance, the breach of Cross-Defendants,
and damages. (FAXC, ¶¶ 8-11, 19-23.)  
 
The demurrer to the first cause of
action is OVERRULED. 
 
C. Sufficiency of the
Second Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing   

 

            “A
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing involves
something beyond breach of the contractual duty itself and it has been held
that bad faith implies unfair dealing rather than mistaken judgment.” (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific
Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1394.) “If the
allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract breach and,
relying on the same alleged acts, simply seek the same damages or other relief
already claimed in a companion contract cause of action, they may be
disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated … [T]he
only justification for asserting a separate cause of action for breach of the
implied covenant is to obtain a tort recovery.” (Id. at pp. 1394-1395.) To recover in tort for breach of the implied
covenant, the defendant must “have acted unreasonably or without proper cause.”
(Id. at p. 1395, citations and
italics omitted.)
 
            The
second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing does not go beyond the allegations of breach of the purported oral
contract. (FAXC, ¶¶ 24-29.) 
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to
amend. 
 
D. Sufficiency of the Third Cause of Action for Tortious
Interference with Contract 
 
            To state a
cause of action for tortious interference with contract, Cross-Complainants
must allege: (1) a valid contract between cross-complainants and a third party;
(2) cross-defendants’ knowledge of this contract; (3) cross-defendants’
intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual
relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship;
and (5) resulting damage. (Hahn v. Diaz-Barba (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th
1177, 1196.) 
 
            Cross-Complainants
have not alleged that they had valid contracts with third parties. (FAXC, ¶¶
30-37.) Cross-Complainants also have failed to allege a breach or disruption of
the contractual relationship. (FAXC, ¶¶ 30-37.) 
 
            The Court SUSTAINS
the demurrer to the third cause of action with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
E. Sufficiency of the Fourth Cause of Action for Tortious
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage 
 
            “An
interference with prospective economic advantage cause of action requires (1)
an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party, with the
probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant’s
knowledge of the relationship; (3) the defendant’s intentional acts designed to
disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5)
economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant’s acts.” (SC
Manufactured Homes, Inc. v. Canyon View Estates, Inc. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 663, 672, fn. 7, citation omitted.) 
 
            Cross-Complainants
have failed to allege that Cross-Defendants intended to disrupt an economic
relationship between Cross-Complainants and a third party. (FAXC, ¶¶ 38-44.) Also,
Cross-Complainants have failed to allege an actual disruption of an economic
relationship. (FAXC, ¶¶ 38-44.) 
 
            The
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to
amend. 
 
F. Tertiary Arguments
 
            In the notice of motion,
Cross-Defendants argue that Defendant and Cross-Complainant Steven Stolar was
improperly added as a Cross-Complainant in the FAXC without leave of court. Cross-Defendants’
memorandum of points and authorities does not address this contention. Cross-Defendants
have waived this argument. “Contentions are waived when a party fails to
support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
