Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Referee Kevin Singer's motion to approve his accounting, terminate his appointment, and order the plaintiff to pay his fees. The motion was granted due to Singer's reasonable fees and expenses incurred during the partition of real property. The judge notes that Singer's determinations regarding the distribution of funds are supported by the evidence and follow the terms of the parties' stipulation. The judge also finds that the offsets to the distribution of funds are reasonable and in accordance with the stipulated judgment. The motion is granted, and the referee is ordered to notice the parties.
