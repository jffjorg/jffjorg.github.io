Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the court proceedings. The judge finds that the entire case is intertwined with the plaintiff's sex harassment claims and cannot be severed. The judge has granted the parties' requests for judicial notice of public records. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's employee, Sarah Chavez, harassed and retaliated against the plaintiff based on her sex and pregnancy. The plaintiff also alleges that she was constructively terminated. The defendant argues that the allegations do not constitute sexual harassment and that the plaintiff's claims are subject to arbitration. The judge has determined that the Ending the Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 applies to the case and prevents the mandatory arbitration of the plaintiff's claims.
