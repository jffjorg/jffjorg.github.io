The Court has reviewed the motions for summary judgment and adjudication and has granted the defendants' motions. The Court has found that the defendants have presented substantial evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment actions taken against the plaintiff. The plaintiff has failed to create a triable issue of fact as to pretext for the adverse employment actions. As a result, the Court grants summary adjudication on all claims and summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
