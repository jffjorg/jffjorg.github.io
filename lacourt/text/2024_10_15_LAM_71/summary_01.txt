And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment and sets a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter the default judgment. The reason for this decision is that the request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount equal to or less than the amount sought in the prayer of the complaint. The judge is of the opinion that the court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint. The hearing is set for January 17, 2025, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
