And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will not hear the motion for leave to file a proposed first amended complaint at this time. The motion is still pending because no notice of related case has been filed. The complaint references a previous case, Gold River Holding LLC v Lu Ying and Wu Haitao (LASC case no: 23PSCV02543), which was filed on August 21, 2023, and was later dismissed by the plaintiff. Since the same parties and similar or identical claims are involved, a notice of related case must be filed, but neither party has done so. The court is requesting the plaintiff to make the requisite filing before the motion can be heard.
