On November

(CHRISTINE) LU, an individual; HAITAO (RICHARD) WU for damages for breach of a
commercial lease. Plaintiff alleges that the damages include lost rental income
at the rate of $36,490 per month during the five months required to make the
Premises rentable again (total exceeding $182,450) and incurred costs and
expenses exceeding $21,610 to repair the Premises so it could be relet.

2024, Defendants filed their opposition.
 
On October 4,
2024, Plaintiff filed its reply.
 
Discussion
 
The court
need not engage the merits of the motion at this juncture as no notice of
related case has been filed. The complaint references the UD action entitled
Gold River Holding LLC v Lu Ying and Wu Haitao (LASC case no: 23PSCV02543)
that was filed on 8/21/23.[1]
Pursuant to California Rules of Court Rule 3.300 [Related Case], “[w]henever a party in a civil action knows or learns that
the action or proceeding is related to another action or proceeding pending, dismissed,
or disposed of by judgment in any state or federal court in California, the
party must serve and file a Notice of Related Case.” (CRC Rule 3.300, subd.
(a), emphasis added.) Here, a review of the 23PSCV02543 case (West Covina
Courthouse/Dept 6), indicates that the case was dismissed by Plaintiff. (See
1/12/2024 Filing.) When, such as here, the case involves the same parties and
similar or identical claims, a notice of related case must be filed; however,
neither party has done so. Therefore, the court requests Plaintiff make the
requisite filing. 
 
Based thereon, the motion will not be heard at this time.
