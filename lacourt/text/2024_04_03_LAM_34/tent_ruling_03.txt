ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondents all parties
to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the
arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) 
 
“A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)      
“Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.
 
(b)      
“Set
forth names of the arbitrators.
 
(c)       
“Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4, subds. (a)–(c).)
 
“If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
“If an award is
confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so
entered has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions
of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in
which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
A.      Procedural
Items
 
        Petitioner followed all the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285, 1285.4, and 1286. 
 
B.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
On October 27, 2023, the Arbitrator, the Honorable Gerald Rosenberg
(retired), found in favor of Petitioner (who was the respondent before the
Arbitrator) and against Respondent (who was the claimant before the
Arbitrator). The Arbitrator awarded a total amount of $569,052.15 to
Petitioner, which comprised of: (1) $280,790.44 in damages; (2) $128,143.01 in
interest; (3) $94,181.00 in attorneys’ fees; and (4) $65,937.70 in arbitration costs.

 
Petitioner moves the Court to confirm the Arbitrator’s award and enter
judgment in favor of Petitioner and against Respondent. (Memorandum, p.
7:22–23.) Petitioner requests that these amounts be entered in the judgment:
(1) $569,052.15 for the amount of the Arbitrator’s award; (2) $12,602.30 in
post-award, pre-judgment interest; (3) $5,300.00 in post-award attorneys’ fees;
and (4) $496.65 in post-award costs. (Id. at pp. 7:24, 8:1–7.)
 
Respondent opposes the Petition, arguing that the Court should vacate
the award or reduce it by $98,215.75 (as well as reduce any award of interest).
(Opposition, p. 5:9–10.) According to Respondent, the Arbitrator exceeded his
powers since he did not consider evidence presented regarding Petitioner’s
negligence regarding mediation. (Id. at p. 3:10–12.)
 
In its Reply, Petitioner argues that Respondent lost the arbitration
because the evidence did not support Respondent’s claims against Petitioner.
(Reply, p. 3:16–18.)
 
C.      The
Arbitrator’s Consideration of the Evidence
 
Petitioner has the better argument here. 
 
On October 27, 2023, the Arbitrator issued his thirty-four page “Final
Arbitration Award.” As a general note, the Arbitrator noted that “[t]he
Arbitrator has considered all evidence presented and all theories and arguments
of counsel.” (Decl. Stone, Exh. 2, p. 34 [actual page 50 of 59].) As to the
specific issue of the mediation, the Arbitrator considered Respondent’s
arguments about Petitioner’s alleged negligence. (Decl. Stone, Exh. 2, pp.
30:14–27, 31:1–13 [actual pages 46–47 of 59].) The Arbitrator then wrote:
 
“The Arbitrator holds that these contentions
are not supported by the evidence set forth in the Findings of Fact. And,
again, many of the contentions require expert testimony to show that Respondent
breached the standard of care. No such testimony was presented.” (Decl. Stone,
Exh. 2, p. 31:15–17 [actual page 47 of 59].)
 
While the Court generally agrees with Respondent’s argument that not
all breaches of the standard of care require expert testimony, the Arbitrator
did two things: (1) the Arbitrator held that the Respondent’s arguments were
not support by the evidence; and (2) the Arbitrator noted that no expert
testimony was presented. The Arbitrator’s use of the word “And” between these
two arguments clearly indicates in this context that these were two independent
bases for the Arbitrator’s determination. 
 
Thus, regardless of whether expert testimony was or was not required in
this specific circumstance, the Arbitrator considered the evidence presented
and held that Respondent’s contentions were not supported by that evidence.
Even under Respondent’s argument in opposition to the Petition, it appears that
the Arbitrator did not exceed his authority in a manner that warrants
disturbing the Final Arbitration Award.
 
D.      The Relief Requested
 
        As Petitioner is the prevailing party
and there is an applicable attorney’s fees provision, Petitioner is entitled to
additional attorney’s fees and costs incurred during the post-award,
pre-judgment period. (Petition, Attachment 4(b); Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032,
subds. (a)(4), (b), 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B), 1293.2; see also Marcus &
Millichap Real Estate Inv. Brokerage Co. v. Woodman Inv. Grp. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 508, 513.) 
 
However, the fees and costs must be reasonable. Here, Petitioner
requests an additional $8,798.00 in fees (16.6 hours of work at $530.00 per
hour) and an additional $496.65 in costs. While the costs and the hourly rate
claimed are both reasonable, ten hours for this simple Petition is unreasonable.
Considering the petition, opposition and reply, the Court will allow nine hours
of work at the requested hourly rate (totaling $4,770.00 in fees) and $496.65
in costs. 
 
Finally, Petitioner is also entitled to the requested relief of
post-award, pre-judgment interest. (Civ. Code, § 3287, subds. (a), (b); see Tenzera,
Inc. v. Osterman (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 16, 21–22 [“Section 3287 applies to
arbitration awards. A prevailing party in arbitration is entitled to
prejudgment interest as of the date of the final award to entry of
judgment.”].) The Court does not see any error with Petitioner’s calculation of
this interest. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Petition is GRANTED in part. 
 
The Arbitration Award is CONFIRMED in the total amount of $569,052.15.
 
Attorney’s fees of $4,770.00, costs of $496.65  and post-award, pre-judgment interest of
$24,801.84 are AWARDED, for a total of an additional of $30,068.49.
