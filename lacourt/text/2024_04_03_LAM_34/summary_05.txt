And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay or dismiss judicial proceedings is denied. The Defendant had argued that an arbitration agreement existed between it and the Plaintiff, but the judge has not been convinced that the Defendant has met its initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such an agreement exists. The judge has also not been convinced that the Defendant has met its burden in establishing the existence of the agreement. The Plaintiff had argued that she did not sign the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) that contained the arbitration agreement, and the judge has accepted this argument. The judge has determined that the Defendant has not met its burden in establishing the existence of the agreement and has denied the motion.
