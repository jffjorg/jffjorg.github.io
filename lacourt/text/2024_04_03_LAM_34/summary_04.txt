The judge's tentative ruling is that the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) is stricken and the operative pleadings are the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the Amended Verified Cross-Complaint (FACC). The Demurrer to the FACC is overruled. The court found that the allegations of breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty are sufficient to survive a demurrer.
