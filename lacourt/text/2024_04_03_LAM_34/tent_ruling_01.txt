  Case Number:  19STCV36480    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion to  Strike or, in the Alternative, Tax Costs   Moving Party: Defendants  Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc. and Open Top Sightseeing USA  Resp. Party:    Plaintiff Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.                                  The Motion to Strike or, in the  Alternative, Tax Costs is DENIED.      PRELIMINARY  COMMENT:           Although  Defendants move to strike Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs, Defendants only request  that “the Court strike or tax” the $18,488.89 in costs associated with “Item 12  – Models, Enlargements and Photocopies of Exhibits.”  (Motion, p. 2:7-12.)  In other words, this is not actually a motion  to strike the Memorandum of Costs, it is simply a motion to strike or tax Item 12.  Therefore, the Court will only address the costs associated with Item 12 – Models, Enlargements and  Photocopies of Exhibits.   BACKGROUND:   On October 11, 2019,  Plaintiff Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. filed its Complaint against  Defendants Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc., Open Top Sightseeing USA, and Chris  Schlesinger on causes of action arising from allegedly unfair competition.    On June 8, 2022, the  Court found related cases 19STCV36480 and 22STCV14150, and the Court designated  19STCV36480 as the lead case.    On August 31, 2022,  the Court granted summary adjudication in favor of Defendants Big Bus Tours Los  Angeles, Inc. and Open Top Sightseeing USA (“Defendants”) and against Plaintiff  regarding the third cause of action (intentional interference with prospective  economic advantage) and fourth cause of action (negligent interference with  prospective economic advantage) in the Complaint.    From January 8 to 12,  2024, the Court held a jury trial in this matter. The Court admitted hundreds  of exhibits throughout trial.    On January 12, 2024,  the Jury found: (1) for Defendants and against Plaintiff on the cause of action  for interference with the Vector contract; (2) for Plaintiff and against  Defendants on the cause of action for interference with the LPG contract, with  damages in the amount of $720,000.00; (3) for Defendants and against Plaintiff  on the cause of action for unfair business practices; and (4) that there was  not clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted with malice,  oppression, or fraud.    On February 5, 2024,  the Court entered Judgment in this matter.    On February 20, 2024,  Plaintiff filed its Judicial Council Form MC-010, Memorandum of Costs  (Summary).    On March 7, 2024,  Defendants filed their Motion to Strike or, in the Alternative, Tax Costs  (“Motion”).    On March 21, 2024,  Plaintiff filed its Opposition to the Motion.    On March 26, 2024,  Defendants filed their Reply in support of their Motion.    ANALYSIS:   I.           Legal  Standard                            “Except as otherwise expressly  provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to  recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.  (b).)   Prevailing parties seeking to claim  costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a), and parties  seeking to contest costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule  3.1700(b).    The Court separately considers each  category of contested costs, including: (1) whether they are specifically  allowable or specifically prohibited; (2) whether they were incurred  (irrespective of whether or not paid); (3) whether they were reasonably  necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or  beneficial to its preparation; and (4) whether they are reasonable in amount.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds. (a), (b), and (c)(1)–(3).   “Items not mentioned in this  section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the  court’s discretion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4); see also Foothill-De Anza Cmty. Coll.  Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)   II.        Discussion   A.       The  Parties’ Arguments   Plaintiff claims $70,516.53 in  costs, which comprises of:   (1)        $875.00  in filing and motion fees;   (2)        $1,336.48  in jury fees;   (3)        $24,736.70  in deposition costs;   (4)        $1,010.00  in service costs;   (5)        $21,807.55  in court reporter fees;   (6)        $18,488.89  in models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits; and   (7)        $2,261.91  in electronic filing or service fees.    (MC-010, p. 1.)           Defendants move  the Court to strike the Memorandum of Costs or, in the alternative, issue an  order taxing costs. (Motion, p. 6:9–11.) Defendants specifically points to the  costs for models, enlargements, and photocopies as “only approximately 26% of  the exhibits contained in the parties’ joint exhibit books” were used. (Id. at  p. 5:19–22.)           Plaintiff  disagree, arguing: (1) that the exhibits were used at trial; and (2) that even  if they weren’t used at trial, they are allowable in the Court’s discretion.  (Opposition, p. 4:4–21.)           Defendants  reiterate their arguments in their Reply.    B.       Discussion   “Models, the enlargements of  exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic presentation of  exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and electronic formatting, may be  allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).           “Postage,  telephone, and photocopying charges, except for exhibits” are specifically not  allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).)           Hundreds of  exhibits were admitted at trial; most were admitted at the beginning of the  trial pursuant to a stipulation of both parties. The Court finds that as a  whole, these models, enlargements, and photocopies reasonably aided the jury. Further,  as indicated above, both parties stipulated to the admission of the vast majority  of these exhibits.  Had Defendant prevailed  at trial, it no doubt would have requested costs for its exhibits; the Court  would likely have allowed such costs.     The Court allows all of the costs  claimed for models, enlargements, and photocopies.      III.      Conclusion   The Motion to Strike or, in the  Alternative, Tax Costs is DENIED.
