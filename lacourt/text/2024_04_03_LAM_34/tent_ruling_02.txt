        As indicated above, the Court is
overruling every one of Plaintiff’s 64 objections to these two
declarations.  Many of the objections are
frivolous.  “This is hardly good
advocacy, and it unnecessarily overburdens the trial court.” (Nazir v.
United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 243, 254, fn. 3.)  
 
 
 
II.       Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Sikiyan requests that the Court take judicial
notice of a declaration previously submitted in this matter. 
 
The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial
notice of this item. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention to an
item filed in this action may simply cite directly to the document by execution
and filing date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)
 
III.    
Legal Standard
 
“A party may
move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that
the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or
proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since
the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom
the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that
the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. That is because of the general principle that a party who seeks
a court’s action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon. There is
a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable
trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the
motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar v.
Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of
his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of
material fact.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the summary judgment standards in Aguilar
to motions for summary adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what
inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from
the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in
mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine
issues. Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact
finder to determine whose version is more likely true. Nor may the trial court
grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder,
supra, at p. 840, citations omitted; see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Dep’t of Transp. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for
summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must
instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
“On a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no
discretion to exercise. If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable
issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise
Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320, citation omitted.) 
 
IV.      Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Haskell & Davis, CPA moves for
summary adjudication of the following two issues:
 
(1)       whether
Sikiyan was a partner at Haskell & Davis, CPA and thus owed fiduciary
duties to the partnership; and
 
(2)       whether
Sikiyan was an employee at Haskell & Davis, CPA who did not owe fiduciary
duties to the partnership. 
 
(MSA, p. 1:7–10.)
 
        Haskell & Davis,
CPA argues: (1) that the Parties’ conduct reveals that Sikiyan was a partner at
Haskell & Davis, CPA; (2) that Sikiyan was not an employee at Haskell &
Davis, CPA; and (3) that multiple estoppel doctrines preclude inconsistent
positions. (Memorandum, pp. 7:13, 10:1, 11:13.)
 
        Sikiyan opposes the
MSA, arguing: (1) that whether Sikiyan was an employee or a partner is question
of fact for the jury; (2) that factual issues remain whether any partnership
agreement was formed; (3) that Sikiyan was not given any sharing of profits or
business management participation; and (4) that Haskell & Davis, CPA has
admitted that Sikiyan owned 0% of the partnership. (Opposition, pp. 4:11, 5:12,
8:1, 8:25.)
 
        In its Reply, Haskell
& Davis, CPA argues: (1) that Sikiyan refuses to concede undisputed facts;
(2) that Sikiyan makes an abusive number of objections; and (3) that Sikiyan
does not address Haskell & Davis, CPA’s arguments. (Reply, pp. 1:1,
5:11–12, 8:1–2, 10:10.)
 
B.      Discussion
 
The “issues” raised by Haskell &
Davis, CPA are actually two sides of the same issue: either Sikiyan was a
partner at Haskell & Davis, CPA, or she was an employee at Haskell &
Davis, CPA. 
 
Haskell & Davis, CPA submits evidence
that indicates Sikiyan was a partner. Among this evidence is: (1) declaratory
evidence from Gregory Davis that Sikiyan is a partner and not an employee; (2)
declaratory evidence from Shannon Deck that Sikiyan was a partner and not an
employee; (3) various documents (including a business card, an email signature,
webpages, tax documents, etc.) that indicates Sikiyan was a partner; and (4)
text messages from Sikiyan that indicate she considered herself to be a
partner. (Decl. Davis, ¶ 13; Decl. Deck, ¶ 11; Evidence, Exhs. 2, 4–7, 11–13,
17–19.)
 
Sikiyan submits contrary evidence that
she was not a partner. Among this evidence is: (1) declaratory evidence from
Sikiyan that she did not share in the profits of the partnership and had no
control of the partnership; and (2) the IRS forms, which includes a declaration
under penalty of perjury that Sikiyan owned 0% of the partnership. (Decl.
Sikiyan, ¶¶ 5–8; Evidence, Exh. 11, Schedule K-1 [actual page 196 of 605] and
Exh. 17, Schedule K-1 [actual page 356 of 605].)
 
The Court agrees with Sikiyan that the
issues raised by Haskell & Davis, CPA involve questions of fact that must
be determined by the jury. Although Haskell & Davis, CPA has met its
initial burden on these issues, Sikiyan has met her subsequent burden to demonstrate
that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether Sikiyan was or
was not a partner. 
 
V.        
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
