And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, staying the case pending the completion of arbitration proceedings. The court finds that the arbitration agreement was properly authenticated and meets the initial burden of proof. The plaintiff's claims against the defendant arise out of the employment agreement and fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The plaintiff did not advance any defense to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, so the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that the arbitration clause should not be enforced.
