WHITNEY ROLLAND REED II, an individual, by
  his guardian ad litem, 
Joanna Jones Reed 
  
        
  vs.
 
County of Los Angeles, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  20STCV39600  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 28, 2024




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his RFPs is DENIED. Accordingly, the
Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 

 
On 10/15/2020, Plaintiff Whitney Rolland Reed II
(Plaintiff or Mr. Reed) filed suit against the County of Los Angeles, Los
Angeles County Sherriff’s Department, Sheriff Alex Villanueva, Sergeant
Rodriguez, Sergeant L. Raymond, Deputy D. Auner, Deputy Hussainian, Deputy M.
Salomon, and Deputy J. Stern (collectively, Defendants). On 5/26/2023,
Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC) alleging: (1) breach of
mandatory duties; (2) failure to summon medical care; (3) negligence; and (4)
violation of the Bane Act. 
 
            On
4/23/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses from County of Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sherriff’s Department (collectively,
Defendants) to his Requests for Production (RFPs). Plaintiff seeks $7,200 in
monetary sanctions. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to his RFP Nos. 18-20. The RFP in question
are as follow:
 
Request No.
18: Please provide all surveillance video of Title 15 safety checks conducted
at the cell holding Plaintiff on September 20, 2019, between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00
p.m. 
 
Request No.
19: Please provide all surveillance video of Title 15 safety checks conducted
at the cell holding Plaintiff on September 27, 2019, between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00
p.m. 
 
Request No.
20: Please provide all surveillance video of Title 15 safety checks conducted
at the cell holding Plaintiff on October 7, 2019, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
 
            In
its responses, Defendant County of Los Angeles (COLA) maintains that it cannot
produce CCTV footage because it has been replaced and overwritten. 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that this representation must be false because of COLA documents which
clearly demonstrate the requested materials were independently set aside and
saved for purposes of a criminal investigation into the assaults onto
Plaintiff: 
 
The requested
materials are not random videos that would be overwritten in the course of
retention because they were separately set aside for review by the County
itself from the dates of the assaults on Mr. Reed: (1) September 20, 2019; (2)
September 27, 2019; (3) October 7, 2019.
 
A LASD
Incident Report dated September 20, 2019, acknowledges that DVTEL video of the
September 20, 2019, incident was reviewed and booked into evidence: “I reviewed
DVTEDL video footage to confirm V/Reed’s statement. After reviewing DVTEL video
footage, suspect in question was Inmate Tucker…A compact disc (EV-1) containing
video footage of the physical altercation that took place between S/Tucker, and
V/Reed was booked into evidence by Deputy Hussainian #648655. Sergeant Johnson
#52031 was notified of the incident.” See Plaintiff’s Exhibit C, BATES 87.
 
A LASD
Incident Report dated September 27, 2019, acknowledges that surveillance of the
September 27, 2019, incident was also booked into custody: “CDs/Video – (1)
envelope containing DVD-CD/R of photographs of the victims and suspects from
the indicated incident.” (BATES 124) Furthermore, defendant Deputy Salomon
“formed the opinion that S/Espinoza and S/Raygoza were in violation of 242 P.C.
(Battery). V/Reed Stated he was desirous of prosecution against both.” See
Plaintiff’s Exhibit D, BATES 125.
 
LASD deputies
also acknowledged booking surveillance evidence of the October 7, 2019,
incident into custody: a “compact disk containing photographs of: victim Reed’s
injuries” was booked into evidence by Ryker Convento (#639804) on October 7,
2019,” as well as a “Compact disk containing video surveillance footage of the
incident.” See Plaintiff’s Exhibit E, at BATES 104-105. Surveillance video of
the October 7th incident was reviewed and saved onto a compact disc: “Based on
the statements given by V/Reed and the CCTV footage, I formed the opinion that
S1/Reyes, S2/Don Cruz, S3/Lozano, S4Perez and S5/Garcia are in violation of
245(a)(1) P.C. The CCTV footage of the incident was saved to a second DVD-R
compact disc (EV-2) and booked into the Men’s Central Jail evidence locker by
Deputy Convento. Id. at Bates 107.
 
            (Motion.,
4:11-5:14.) 
 
            In
opposition, Defendants argues that Plaintiff is conflating two distinct issues
relating to the video surveillance footage: “While it is undisputed that some
video surveillance footage depicting the actual physical altercations was
booked into evidence as a part of a criminal investigations, there is
absolutely no evidence to suggest that any surveillance footage depicting the
Title 15 safety checks before each incident was booked into evidence.” (Opp.,
3:16-19.) 
 
            As
such, Defendant contends that there is nothing contradictory or evasive about
its responses indicating that after a reasonable and diligent search for
responsive materials, Responding Party has been unable to locate any responsive
documents within its possession, custody, and control as to RFP Nos. 18-20. 
 
            Moreover,
as for electronic media that was previously booked into evidence, it is unclear
to the Court whether Defendant’s have maintained a copy.  Defendant’s responses indicated that the
evidence had been subsequently submitted to the District Attorney for filing
consideration, and specifically advised Plaintiff to subpoena the District
Attorney to obtain copies of the material. (See Opp., Exhibit 9)
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ statement of an inability to comply is Code-Compliant. The Court
cannot compel Defendants to produce materials which it contends do not exist.
If Plaintiff believes that there was intentional destruction or spoilation of
evidence, the proper motion would be a motion for sanctions, rather than a
motion to compel further. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to his RFPs is
denied. Accordingly, the Court declines to award sanctions at this time.  
 
            
 It
is so ordered.
