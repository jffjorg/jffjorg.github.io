Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Whitney Rolland Reed II vs. County of Los Angeles, et al. The Court has denied Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his Requests for Production (RFPs). The Court has also declined to award sanctions at this time. The dispute centers on Plaintiff's request for surveillance video footage of Title 15 safety checks conducted at the cell holding Plaintiff on September 20, 2019, September 27, 2019, and October 7, 2019. Defendant County of Los Angeles claims it cannot produce the video footage because it has been replaced and overwritten. Plaintiff argues that this representation must be false because of COLA documents which demonstrate the requested materials were independently set aside and saved for purposes of a criminal investigation. The Court has found that Defendant's statement of an inability to comply is Code-Compliant, and Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is denied.
