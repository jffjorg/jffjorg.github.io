And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to reopen discovery. The defendant argued that new witnesses had been identified and that plaintiff's medical treatment had continued after the discovery cut-off. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to show good cause for reopening discovery and that they had not acted with diligence. The defendant had waited two months to file an ex parte application to reopen discovery and then another month to file the motion, which lacked substantive evidence. The judge also noted that it was unlikely that the defendant would be able to complete 15 depositions and obtain records through deposition subpoenas without needing another trial continuance, given that the trial had already been continued eight times.
