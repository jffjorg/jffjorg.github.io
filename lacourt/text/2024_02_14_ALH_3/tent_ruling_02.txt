[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFAULT
  JUDGMENT
 
 
Dept. 3
8:30 a.m.
February 14, 2024



 
On
February 10, 2021, plaintiff Donald J. Matson (“Plaintiff”) and the Law Offices
of Donald J. Matson (“Law Firm”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) brought this
action against defendant Chao Li (“Defendant”) and his various aliases. Plaintiffs’
first amended complaint, filed on February 16, 2022, asserts causes of action
for: (1) theft [Civil Code § 3344 & Penal Code § 496]; (2) theft [Penal
Code §§ 484 & 496]; (3) trade libel; (4) infringement of trade name; (5)
fraud; (6) indemnification; (7) conversion; (8) civil conspiracy; (9)
accounting; (10) unfair business practices; (11) declaratory relief; and (12)
injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs alleges Defendant
used Plaintiff’s law firm name and trade insignia to practice unlicensed law
and otherwise defraud potential clients.  Plaintiffs’ FAC prays for $750,000 in
compensatory damages and “at least” $2,250,000 in punitive damages.
On
May 16, 2022, default was entered as to Defendant on the FAC. On August 25,
2022, the Court denied default judgment without prejudice. On January 20, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed another request for default judgment which was denied on January
30, 2023. On May 11, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ request for default
judgment submitted on May 2, 2023. 
On
September 19, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ default package submitted on September
8, 2023. 
The
Court now considers Plaintiffs’ default application submitted on February 5,
2024. Plaintiffs request a court judgment in the amount of $786,267.42,
consisting of $750,000 in general damages, $1,267.42 in costs, and $35,000 in
attorney fees.  
The
Court cannot grant Plaintiffs’ application for default. Plaintiffs do not
justify an attorneys’ fee award of $35,000 and only attach a copy of a bill for
fees in the amount of $16,625.88. (Matson Decl., ¶ 30.) Plaintiffs also do not
substantiate a general damages award (i.e., noneconomic damages) of $750,000.
The Declaration of Donald J. Matson only describes economic damages in the form
of a $15,933 decrease in gross income. (Matson Decl., ¶¶ 31-33.) 
The
proposed order also inappropriately includes a reference to a “permanent Civil
Harassment Restraining Order" because no application for a restraining
order (either temporary or permanent) has been made. 
Lastly,
Plaintiffs list $30 for “document costs” and $23 for “video appearance,” which
do not appear to be recoverable costs under CCP 1033.5. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request
for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
            Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 14th
day of February 2024
