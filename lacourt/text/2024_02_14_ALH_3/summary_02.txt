As for the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment, which seeks a total of $786,267.42. The court finds that the plaintiff's declaration does not justify an attorneys' fee award of $35,000 and does not substantiate a general damages award of $750,000. The court also notes that the plaintiff's request for a permanent civil harassment restraining order is inappropriate because no such application has been made. Finally, the court finds that certain costs listed by the plaintiff, such as document costs and video appearance fees, are not recoverable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
