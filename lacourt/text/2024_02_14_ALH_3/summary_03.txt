And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Chris Prussak of Prussak, Welch, & Avila on behalf of the Welch Law Firm, Donald Rance Welch, and Sara Welch (collectively, the "Welch Defendants"). The motion was filed due to a mistake made by Mr. Prussak's firm, which accidentally filed an answer on behalf of the Welch Defendants without their retention. The Welch Defendants claim that they never retained Mr. Prussak or his firm, and that they had no authority to file any pleadings on their behalf. The Court has granted the motion, noting that relieving counsel will not cause any prejudice to clients who never retained them in the first place. The Court has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the motion is procedurally deficient, and has denied their request to sanction Mr. Prussak and his firm for failing to respond to discovery on behalf of parties they do not represent.
