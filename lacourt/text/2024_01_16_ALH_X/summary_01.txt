And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Elevate Health Group's motion to deem the truth of the matters asserted in its requests for admission as admitted against Nora Shahverdi. Elevate Health Group served its requests for admission on September 20, 2023, but Nora Shahverdi failed to respond. Although Elevate Health Group's motion was initially made, it is now denied as moot since Nora Shahverdi has already responded to similar requests on January 2, 2024.
