And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs. The defendant seeks to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs related to the rental property at 1918 Denton Avenue #E in San Gabriel, California. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint alleging four causes of action, including breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and malicious prosecution.

The judge finds that the defendant acted in good faith and that denying the motion would effectively bar any claim the defendant may have against the plaintiffs. The judge also declines to review the merits of the cross-complaint before it is filed and notes that the plaintiffs' arguments against the cross-complaint are unavailing.

The judge orders the defendant to file its cross-complaint within 10 days of the notice of this order.
