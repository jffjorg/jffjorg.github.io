BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises out of Plaintiff
Mike Margullis’s (“Plaintiff”) lemon law claim for a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado,
Vehicle Identification Number 3GCPCREC7JG322418 (“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on January 17, 2023, alleging four
causes of action against Defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”) for (1)
violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2) violation
of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, (3) violation of the
Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, and (4) Fraud – Fraudulent Inducement –
Concealment.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied. 
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
On receipt of a response to discovery requests, the party requesting may
move for an order compelling further responses for interrogatories (Code Civ.
Proc. 2030.300), requests for admission (Cod. Civ. Proc. section 2033.290), and
request for production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310). “Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
requesting party waives any right to compel further response to the requests
for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling Defendant to produce further responses to their
requests for the production of documents. Plaintiff provides that he served
written discovery on July 28, 2023. (Jacobson Decl. ¶
29.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant produced boilerplate responses on August
31, 2023. (Id. ¶ 30.) On December 6, 2023, this court denied Plaintiff’s
previous motion to compel based on Plaintiff’s failure to provide a
code-compliant separate statement. Plaintiff refiled this motion with an
amended separate statement. 
 
            The
court notes that Plaintiff’s separate statement still relies heavily on
repeated language. However, Plaintiff has narrowed the discovery requests at
issue and has added references to specific discovery requests.
