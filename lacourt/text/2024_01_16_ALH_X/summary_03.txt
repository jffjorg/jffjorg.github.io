And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses and awards sanctions of $2,475. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is granted for the time spent working on the motions, totaling $495 for 5 hours. The judge finds that the defendants did not make reasonable and good faith efforts to informally resolve the disputes, instead providing boilerplate objections to discovery requests. The judge also notes that the defendants' counsel's behavior during the meet and confer conversation was unprofessional and hindered the discussion. The judge emphasizes the importance of civil discovery being self-executing and notes that the parties should act reasonably and with good faith.
