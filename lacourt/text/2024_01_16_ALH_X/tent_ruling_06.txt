RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             The County of Los Angeles moves
for leave to intervene in the present lawsuit. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Manuel
Lopez’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that he was injured in a motor vehicle collision
caused by Defendants Javari Adderly and Valentin Valdez (“Defendants”).
Plaintiff filed a form complaint on September 1, 2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            The County’s motion for leave to intervene is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            The
County of Los Angeles (“County”) moves for leave to intervene in the present
action. 
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 387, subdivision (a), provides: “Upon timely
application, any person, who has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in
the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, may
intervene in the action or proceeding.” 
 
            Labor
Code Section 3852 provides, in part: “Any employer who pays, or becomes
obligated to pay compensation, or who pays, or becomes obligated to pay salary
in lieu of compensation, or who pays or becomes obligated to pay an amount to
the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to Section 4706.5, may likewise make a claim or bring an action against the
third person. In the latter event the employer may recover in the same suit, in
addition to the total amount of compensation, damages for which he or she was
liable including all salary, wage, pension, or other emolument paid to the
employee or to his or her dependents.”
 
            In his
complaint, Plaintiff alleges he was injured in a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on October 19, 2021. The County provides that Plaintiff’s alleged
injury occurred within the scope of Plaintiff’s employment with the County.
(Greathouse Decl. ¶ 2.) The County provides that
it has become obligated to pay or has paid Plaintiff for indemnity and medical
expense and therefore has a claim for reimbursement. (Id. ¶ 3.) The
County’s motion for leave to intervene is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            The County’s motion for leave to intervene is GRANTED.
