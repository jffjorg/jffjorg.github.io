And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which adds a cause of action for elder abuse. The plaintiffs, who are tenants of a building owned or managed by the defendants, have alleged harassment by the defendants' property manager. The amended complaint is necessary because since filing the original complaint, the defendants' property manager has continued to harass and threaten the plaintiffs, and has even physically attacked two of them, causing injuries. The court has determined that there is no prejudice to the defendants and has granted the motion, allowing the plaintiffs to file and serve the amended complaint within 10 days.
