And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions filed by counsel for defendants Jackie Robinson, All Net, LLC, and AGS Assurety, LLC to be relieved as counsel of record. The judge found that the motions comply with the requirements and that the moving counsel's declaration shows a cognizable ground for withdrawal due to client conduct that renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively. The judge also noted that no opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client. The court will sign the orders submitted by counsel and will set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) at the hearing on these motions to strike the answer and enter default of the defendants AGS Assurety, LLC and All Net, LLC for failure to obtain new counsel.
