  Case Number:  20STCV41938    Hearing Date:   September 16, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motions to be Relieved as Attorney of Record.
 
Counsel for Defendants Jackie Robinson, All Net, LLC,
and AGS Assurety, LLC has filed  motions
to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notices, declarations, proposed orders,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows a
cognizable ground for withdrawal, that is, client conduct that renders it
unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively.
No opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client. See
Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
Therefore, the motions are granted, and the Court will
sign the orders submitted by counsel. At the hearing on these motions, the
Court will also set an OSC re striking answer and entering default of Defendants
AGS Assurety, LLC and All Net, LLC, for failure to obtain new counsel.
