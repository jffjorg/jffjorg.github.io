And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City has requested judicial notice of a grant deed recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office on May 27, 2022. The judge grants this request. Additionally, the judge notes that the courts consider the substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or mandatory. Mandatory injunctions, which require a party to take affirmative action, carry a heavy burden and are only granted in extreme cases where the right to such an injunction is clearly established. However, a court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint.
