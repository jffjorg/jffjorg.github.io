City of Whittier, et al. v.
Romero Investments LLC, 24STCV15002

Tentative decision on application
for preliminary injunction: granted




 



 
Plaintiff City of Whittier (“City”), on behalf of itself and
the People of the State of California, seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin
Defendant Romero Investments, LLC (“Romero”) from continuing to hold unpermitted
events at a property.
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff City filed this action on June 14, 2024 against
Defendant Romero alleging causes of action for (1) public nuisance under state
law and (2) public nuisance under City’s Whittier Municipal Code (“WMC”). The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows:
Defendant Romero, a California limited liability company, owns,
leases, or otherwise occupies a property located at 14081 Summit Drive in the
City (“the Property”). Compl., ¶¶ 3-4. The City has zoned the Property as
Housing-Residential (“H-R”). Compl., ¶4.  Romero illegally operates a business at the
Property by renting it out as an event space. Compl., ¶5. 
In the course of its business, Defendant is violating at
least eight municipal regulations in at least 16 different ways, including  (A) illegal grading & import of untested
soils, (B) activities causing stormwater/runoff issues, (C) activities creating
erosion issues, D) unpermitted paving, (E) unpermitted construction of a
deck-type structure with no safety rails on hillside edge that was graded
without permits, (F) storage of what appears to be a dozen cords of firewood up
against a hillside immediately adjacent to protected Habitat Authority open
space, (G) unpermitted and intensified use of area zoned for single-family
hillside residential use, including (1) noise, (2) lighting, (3) vehicular
access, (4) lack of fire approvals/fire protection or evacuation routes, and (5)
environmental & biological impacts on sensitive and protected resources,
and (H) unpermitted and unlicensed business activity, including (1)
construction, advertisement, and rental of ‘event center’, (2) unpermitted
assembly/event of hundreds of people, (3) unknown status of health permits, (4)
unknown status of ABC licenses, and (5) unknown status of fire marshal
approvals/assembly use approvals.  Compl.,
¶5.
Around October 16, 2022, the City was notified that Romero was
illegally performing grading or construction at the Property without proper
permits. Compl., ¶13. Around October 21, 2022, the City received notice of the
same violations again.  Ibid.  Around October 24, 2022, the City inspected
the Property, verified illegal work was taking place, and issued a Stop Work notice.
Ibid.  Defendant failed to respond
or stop unpermitted activities. Ibid.
Around November 22, 2022, the City issued a Notice of
Non-Compliance letter to Defendant. Compl., ¶14, Ex. 1. The Non-Compliance
letter gave Defendant notice to stop illegal grading activities in a landslide
zone and to (1) submit a remediation plan for grading work already performed,
(2) submit an erosion control plan to address current and future erosion
issues, (3) submit a Standard Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and (4) cover,
remove, or recompact soil stockpiles or potentially disturbed soils.  Ibid.  The letter also gave notice of a storm event
the week of November 8, 2022 that had caused stormwater and runoff pollution
from the Property. Ibid.  The letter
demanded a response within ten days and gave Defendant notice of a possible
public nuisance abatement action, receivership, or criminal prosecution for
failure to comply. Compl., ¶ 15.
Around February 15, 2023, the City sent Defendant a Notice
of Violation letter.  Compl., ¶17, Ex. 2.
The Notice of Violation letter gave notice of the same violations and the same
possible repercussions for failure to comply as the November 2022 Notice of
Non-Compliance. Compl., ¶¶ 17-18. 
In September of 2023, Defendant’s engineer submitted grading
plans to the City to correct the illegal grading that was performed at the
Property without a permit.  Compl., ¶19. The
plans were deficient, and the City rejected them.  Ibid. At the time of this Complaint,
Defendant still has not submitted compliant plans. Compl., ¶20. 
Defendant rents out the Property for events such as parties,
weddings, and large social gatherings, sometimes with hundreds of attendees. Compl.,
¶21. Defendant has not obtained proper permits, nor a business license for an
H-R zone.  Ibid.  The events are loud and boisterous and cause considerable
disturbance to residences in the vicinity. Compl., ¶21. Disturbances include
fireworks, farm animals, and excessive noise in both day and nighttime hours. Ibid.
The City’s police department has been called to the Property on nuisance calls
numerous times. Compl., ¶22. Residents also have complained to the City
Council. Ibid. 
Defendant ignored the City’s various notices and continued
to plan and conduct events through the filing of this Complaint.  Compl., ¶21.
            Plaintiff
City seeks an order (1) requiring Defendant Romero to show cause, if any, why it
should not be immediately, preliminarily and permanently enjoined from the
activity set forth in the Complaint, (2) declaring the Property a nuisance and
enjoining Defendant from further nuisance activity, (3) temporarily,
preliminarily, and permanently enjoining Defendant from operating, conducting,
using, occupying, or permitting unpermitted grading and/or construction or events
at the Property, (4) enjoining Defendant from transferring any ownership
interest and/or leasehold interest in the Property and structures thereon
unless there has been approval of its compliance with all applicable court orders
and requests by the City, (5) requiring Defendant to abate all conditions that
cause nuisances on the Property, (6) awarding costs and fees, including costs
of investigation, and (7) other just and proper relief.  Compl., pp. 15-16. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
Plaintiff City filed the Complaint on June 14, 2024.
On June 26, 2024, the court issued a temporary restraining
order (“TRO”) and an order to show cause (“OSC”) restraining Defendant. from
continuing to hold unpermitted events at the Property.  The City’s application also sought a TRO/OSC
against illegal grading, excavation, and construction work at the Property
which the court denied as not emergent.
 
B. Applicable Law
An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act; it may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court. 
CCP §525.  An injunction may be
more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to
perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.  See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941)
17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending final resolution upon a trial. 
See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316; Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618,
623.  The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy.  Voorhies v.
Greene (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v.
Superior Court, (1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
A preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a
noticed motion.  The complaint normally
must plead injunctive relief.  CCP
§526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence
of an adequate damages remedy at law. 
CCP §526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors,
(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood
Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of “inadequacy of the legal
remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time of the early courts of
chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff.  Department of Fish & Game v.
Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a
balancing of the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely
to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St.
Johns Hospital, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th
296, 304.  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v. Carlson, (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  See CCP §529(a); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
C. Governing Law
A “city may make and enforce within its limits all local,
police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with
general laws.” Cal. Const. art. XI, § 7.  A city’s general police power enables it to
“make and enforce ordinances to regulate or prohibit a thing or act which is of
such a nature that it may become a nuisance or may be injurious to the public
health if not suppressed or regulated.” Sullivan v. City of Los Angeles,
(1953) 116 Cal. App. 2d 807, 810.
A “public nuisance” is defined as “behavior constituting a
violation of the provisions of: (1) Chapter 11 of Title 7 of the California
Penal Code, and (2) Sections 407 or 415 of the California Penal Code, and (3)
Section 8.32.030 of the WMC, or (4) noise that is unreasonably loud, raucous,
excessive or jarring to persons within the area of audibility in a residential
area which disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood.”  WMC §9.56.020.
 “A violation of this
chapter is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, which may be abated by the
city in the manner provided by the laws of the State of California and the
ordinances of this city ... , and the city shall also have all rights provided
by such laws and ordinances to recover damages suffered from any such nuisance
and to recover from the owner of the property upon which such nuisance is
located the cost of any abatement thereof by the city.”  WMC §8.32.150(B).
 “It shall be unlawful
for any person to willfully make or continue, or cause to be made or continued,
any excessive or unreasonable noise, which disturbs the peace or quiet of any
neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person
of normal sensitiveness residing in the area.”  WMC §8.32.030.
Business and Professions Code section 16000(a) permits a
city to license and regulate businesses. 
Businesses operating within the City shall obtain licenses.  WMC §05.04.010.
 
D. Statement of Facts[3]
1. City’s Evidence
Defendant Romero owns the Property. RJN, Ex. 1.  Social media postings as of June 18, 2024
indicate the Property is available for rental as an event space.  Ballard Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. 4-5.  The Property is promoted as “one of the best
venues in LA”, with “amazing views” and the reader is encouraged to “book it
now”.  Ballard Decl., ¶4, Ex. 4.  A wedding is scheduled to be held at the
Property on June 22, 2024 from 5:30 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.  Ballard Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  A search of the City’s public records shows
no City permit or license issued to Romero or anyone else to host or rent the
Property for large parties and events.  Garcia
Decl., ¶4.
Since May 2022, Whittier Police Department (“WPD”) has
received multiple noise complaints from residents of the City about the
Property and has responded 24 times.  Bar
Decl., ¶3.  WPD has issued 15 WMC
violations due to the noise complaints. 
Bar Decl., ¶4.  For example, on
Jun 8, 2024, WPD was dispatched six times to the Property due to loud noise
complaints from residents located as far as a mile from the Property.  Bar Decl., ¶4.  There was a live band playing for an
estimated 500 people.  Bar Decl., ¶4.  On May 11, 2024, WPD was dispatched twice to
the Property due to a band, party lights and loud music.  Bar Decl., ¶4.  On April 21, 20243, WPD was dispatched three
times to the Property due to noise complaints. 
Bar Decl., ¶4.  Notice of Loud
Party Violations were issued on each occasion. 
Bar Decl., ¶5, Ex. 6.
On June 11, 2024, five City residents complained at a City
Council meeting about excessive noise and music at the Property. Garcia Decl.,
¶3, Ex. 3.
The City’s counsel sent Romero a letter on June 13, 2024,
entitled “Cease and Desist from all Illegal Events and Unpermitted
Construction”, informing it that criminal charges were being prepared for both
illegal events and unpermitted construction. 
Do Decl., ¶2, Ex. 7.
 
2. Romero’s Evidence
Romero owns property encompassing approximately 7.94 acres
located at 14081 Summit Drive, City of Whittier, County of Los Angeles, State
of California (the Property). Jacobo Decl., ¶2. 
Romero also owns the 7.55 acres of property located in the County of Los
Angeles (“County”) immediately west of and adjoining the Whittier Property
(“County Property”).  Jacobo Decl., ¶3.   The only means of access to the County Property
is via the Property.  Jacobo Decl., ¶4.
Romero purchased the Property and County Property on or
about May 2022 and thereafter began contemplation and design of horse stables
and landscaping at the Property.  Jacobo
Decl., ¶5.  Collaboration with the City
remains Romero’s priority and our cooperation with the City continues today and
despite the initiation of the City’s Complaint. Jacobo Decl., ¶9.
While Romero’s envisioned plans for the County Property
remain under development, they include enclosed/contained structures for music
in order to contain noise and mitigate any adverse noise impacts. The use of
the County Property may also include ancillary social activities and/or private
recreation events as may be permitted by Los Angeles County. Jacobo Decl., ¶12.  Romero has not submitted any development
application to the County or sought a business license from the County but intends
to do so once its development plans are complete.  Jacobo Decl., ¶13.
It remains Romero’s intent to continue to work with the
relevant administrative agencies to secure the necessary entitlements and
licenses respectively applicable to the Property and County Property.  Jacobo Decl., ¶14.  Romero hopes that this court’s involvement
will not only provide a means to assure the City that any development of the
Romero properties will occur in an orderly and permitted fashion, but also
ensure that the planned use of them will not be frustrated or delayed by
arbitrary or capricious denials, or selective regulatory enforcement amounting
to a compensable taking under California law. Jacobo Decl., ¶15.
While events have been held at the Whittier Property, such
events have been limited to those held for immediate family, co-workers and
friends. The Property is not a commercial venue available to the general
public.  Jacobo Decl., ¶16.  Krystal Sosa and Fernando Arroyo, the bride
and groom described in the wedding of Krystal and Fernando are close family
friends of Romero’s operations director.  Jacobo Decl., ¶17.  While costs of such events were recovered, no
persons or entities associated with Romero profited from these events. Jacobo
Decl., ¶18.
Upon information and belief, individuals not associated with
Romero and without Romero’s consent have published inaccurate information on
various social media outlets describing the Property as presently open for
business to the general public. Jacobo Decl., ¶20.  Such posts are not accurate as the Property
is not a venue open to the general public. Nor do such individuals speak for
Romero. Jacobo Decl., ¶21.
Romero acknowledges that it should comply with applicable
noise restrictions relevant to the Property and County Property.  Jacobo Decl., ¶22.
Upon information and belief, Romero will use the Property in
a manner consistent with the WMC H-R Zone requirements and work diligently with
the City to secure any permits and/or licenses that may be required in the
event that Romero’s desired use deviates from those described in the H-R Zone.  Jacobo Decl., ¶23.
 
E. Analysis
Plaintiff City seeks to enjoin
Defendant Romero’s illegal use of the Property as an event space to rent for
extremely loud parties, events, and receptions that go on into the early
pre-dawn hours.  
 
1. Reasonable Probability
of Success
A civil action to abate a public nuisance may be brought by
a city or district attorney on behalf of the People of the State of
California.  CCP §731.  An “[i]njunction is the method of abatement
in equity and the most frequent instances of employment of mandatory injunction
include the removal of nuisances.” Katenkamp v. Union Realty Co., (1936)
6 Cal. 2d 765, 776. To obtain injunctive relief to abate a public nuisance, the
applicant must show the defendant’s conduct “can be brought within the terms of
the statutory definition of public nuisance” and that the nuisance is
substantial and unreasonable.  In re
Englebrecht, (1998) 67 Cal.App 4th 486, 492.  A nuisance is substantial if it is
“definitely offensive, seriously annoying or intolerable.”  People v. Acuna, (1997)14 Cal.4th
1090, 1105.  Unreasonableness is
determined by comparing the social utility of the activity to the gravity of
the harm it inflicts. Id.
The City presents evidence that WPD
has been notified many times, and many residents have complained, about excessively
loud and boisterous events at the Property that can be heard up to a mile away with
music from DJs and bands that blare until 3 a.m. or later with laser light
shows, ATVs. staging equipment, and thumping techno music.  The Property is not zoned for commercial
events as it is located in a hillside-residential (H-R) zone.  Romero has no conditional use permit or
business license to rent out the Property for these events which have up to 500
attendees.  See App. at 7.
“It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully make or
continue, or cause to be made or continued, any excessive or unreasonable
noise, which disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or which causes
discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of normal sensitiveness
residing in the area.”  WMC
§8.32.030.  A “public nuisance” is
defined as including noise that is unreasonably loud, raucous, excessive or
jarring to persons within the area of audibility in a residential area which
disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood.”  WMC §9.56.020.
The City’s unrebutted evidence shows that Romero is
violating WMC section 8.32.030 and therefore the Property is a public nuisance
under WMC section 9.56.020. 
Additionally, the Property is not zoned for commercial use and Romero
has no permit or business license.  See
WMC §05.04.010.
Romero’s opposition argues that it is not holding commercial
events at the Property and a business license is not required.  See Jocobo Decl., ¶16.  While Romero plans to use the County Property
for such purposes, the County, not the City, is the proper authority for
licensure.  Opp. at 8.  Romero acknowledges that it should comply
with the City’s noise restrictions, but the City must not be arbitrary or
capricious in its enforcement.  There are
numerous nearby venues that have the potential to cause noise to residences,
including a college football stadium.  It
would be unfair to vigorously enforce the noise ordinance against Romero and
not other adjacent landowners.  Further,
no injunction is required because the WMC provides adequate enforcement tools
such as damages, fines, and contempt proceedings.  Opp. at 9-10.
Romero’s arguments do not undermine the fact that there have
been numerous noise complaints and WPD actions at the Property.  There is nothing wrong with the City’s
invocation of injunctive relief to abate the excessive noise problem and Romero
has failed to show selective enforcement. 
The City has shown a reasonable probability that the events at the
Property are a public nuisance.
 
2. Irreparable Harm
There is no need for the City to show irreparable harm.  A showing of irreparable harm is not required
where the Legislature by statute or a city by ordinance has determined that a
defined condition is a public nuisance; the only showing necessary is the
statutory violation.  City of
Bakersfield v. Miller, (1966) 64 Cal.2d 93, 100.  The court should not engage in the usual
balancing of irreparable harms test for injunctions; the only issues to decide
are whether the statutory violation exists and whether the statute is
constitutionally valid.  People v.
Dept. of Transportation, (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1067, 1076; Amusing
Sandwich, Inc. v. City of Palm Springs et al., (1985)165 Cal.App.3d 1116,
1129; City of Bakersfield v. Miller, (1966) 64 Cal.2d 93, 100. Violations
of city planning and zoning requirements are a public nuisance which may be
enjoined by injunction without a showing of irreparable harm.  See City
and County of San Francisco v. Padilla, (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 388, 401. 
Romero argues that the balance of harms works in its favor
but fails to show why.  It argues that
restraints against non-commercial gatherings would preclude its full use and
enjoyment of the Property, but that full use has resulted in the excessive loud
noises which the City seeks to abate.  See
Opp. at 11-12.  
 
F. Conclusion
The application for a
preliminary injunction is granted. 
Defendant Romero and its agents are enjoined during the pendency of this
action from hosting, allowing, or renting the Property for events, parties, and
receptions.  No bond is required for a
public agency.
