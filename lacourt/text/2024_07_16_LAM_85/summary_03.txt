The Judge has made a tentative decision on the motion to continue the trial, which is set for September 17, 2024. The Judge has read and considered the moving papers, but no opposition was filed. The Judge finds that the motion is denied unless the Department of Social Services (DSS) waives the defect. The Judge notes that trial dates are firm and that a party seeking a continuance must make a request by noticed motion or ex parte application with supporting declarations. The Judge also notes that the decision regarding a continuance request must be based upon good cause. The Judge has considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court 3.1332(c) and finds that the motion is denied. However, if DSS waives the defect or Davar files a proof of service, the Judge will reconsider the motion. The Judge will discuss the issue with both parties at the hearing.
