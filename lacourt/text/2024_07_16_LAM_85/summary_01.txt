Plaintiff: Chang Ho Yoo dba PCH Medical Pharmacy
Defendant: Michelle Baass, Director of Department of Health Care Services
```
**Facts**
```
* PCH submitted Medi-Cal bills for payment for drugs dispensed at two pharmacy locations, Midway and Bell Gardens, before DHCS approved their enrollment applications.
