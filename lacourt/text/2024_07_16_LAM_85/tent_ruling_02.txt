Yoo implies that there may be a
procedural violation in handling the remand. 
Rather than the Director making this decision or appointing a new ALJ,
the Chief ALJ unilaterally undertaken this court-mandated task despite the fact
that she issued the original decision. 
The Chief ALJ also did not afford Yoo any opportunity to be heard before
making the Remand Decision and, by letter dated August 30, 2023, denied Yoo’s
request for reconsideration.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 9.  Yoo has not articulated any
statute, regulation, or rule violated by the Chief ALJ.

While the Legislature abrogated the holding in Valley View Home
of Beaumont through the enactment of W&I Code section 14018.5, DHCS must still
follow the provisions of section
51488.1(b).  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
