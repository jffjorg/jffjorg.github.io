injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or mandatory.  Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.
Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a

mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.

maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).
