 Case Number:  24STLC02143    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  85 
Mashian
Law Group v. Tony Husson, et al.., 24STLC02143
Tentative decision on right to attach applications:
granted in large part







 
 
Plaintiff Mashian Law
Group, APC (“MLG”) applies for right to attach orders against Defendants Tony
Husson (“Husson”) and 21 Choices, LLC (“21 Choices”) for $25,467.12, which
includes estimated costs of $310 and estimated attorney fees of $1,595. 
The court has read and
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders the following
tentative decision.  
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff MLG filed
the Complaint on March 22, 2024, against Husson and 21 Choices for breach of
contract, account stated, and quantum meruit. The verified Complaint alleges in
pertinent part as follows. 
On or about February 22, 2021, Husson and 21 Choices
retained MLG to perform legal services in connection with the Los Angeles
Superior Court matter 21 Choices, LLC v. Guinart Construction, Inc.,20STCV27023
(the “Lawsuit”).  Compl., ¶6.  The parties signed a written retainer
agreement (the “Retainer Agreement”), which Husson executed as manager of 21
Choices and in his individual capacity.  Compl.,
¶6.  
During the months of February 2021 through January 2023, MLG
attorneys provided legal services to Husson and 21 Choices regarding the
Lawsuit, and Husson and 21 Choices incurred legal fees and costs for which MLG
issued invoices.  Compl., ¶7.  
While Husson and 21 Choices made payments toward their legal
fees and costs to MLG, $19,116.54 in legal fees and costs incurred by Husson
and 21 Choices in connection with the Lawsuit remains unpaid.  Compl., ¶8. 

On April 10, 2023, MLG transmitted to Husson and 21 Choices
a copy of the unpaid invoice and demanded payment of the $19,116.54 owed by Husson
and 21 Choices, jointly and severally, but neither has paid any portion of the
unpaid and open invoice.  Compl., ¶9.  MLG sent statement reminders to
Husson and 21 Choices demanding payment of the unpaid and open invoice on May
8, June 6, July 10, August 7, September 5, October 5, November 3, and December
6, 2023, and on January 3 and February 5, 2024. 
Compl.,
¶10.  Despite these
repeated demands, Husson and 21 Choices have failed and refused to pay any
portion of the unpaid and open invoice.  Compl.,
¶10.  
On February 9, 2024, MLG advised Husson and 21 Choices of
their right to resolve this dispute via arbitration in accordance with the
requirements of Business and Professions Code section 6201 et seq.  Compl., ¶11.  Neither Husson nor 21 Choices timely
demanded arbitration of this fee dispute. 
Compl.,
¶11.
MLG seeks (1) compensatory damages against
Defendants, jointly and severally, in an amount to be determined at trial but
not less than $19,116.54, (2) pre-judgment interest, (3) costs of suit, (4)
reasonable attorneys’ fees, and (5) other and further relief the court deems
just and proper.  Compl., pp. 5-6. 
 
2. Cross-Complaint
On May 10, 2024, 
Cross-Complainants Husson and 21 Choice filed a Cross-Complaint against
Cross-Defendant MLG.  The Cross-Complaint
alleges causes of action for professional negligence and breach of contract and
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
On information and belief, Cross-Defendant MLG is a law firm
doing business in the County of Los Angeles, State of California.  X-Compl., ¶3.
On information and belief, MLG owes Cross-Complainants a
duty of care inter alia to: (i) properly provide attorneys experienced in
litigation and trial as promised at the inception if litigation was not
avoided; and/or (ii) use due diligence to know of the pertinent lease
provisions affecting Cross-Complainants in its issues with their commercial
landlord, the reason for the representation, to avoid litigation.  X-Compl., ¶7. 
On information and belief, MLG also owes Cross-Complainants a duty of
care to avoid and mitigate any damages.  X-Compl., ¶8.
On information and belief, MLG breached its duties of care
by failing to: (i) properly provide attorneys experienced in litigation and
trial as promised at the inception; and/or (ii) use due diligence to know of
the pertinent lease provisions in affecting Cross-Complainants in its issues
with their commercial landlord.  X-Compl., ¶9. 
On information and belief, the breaches of duties have proximately
caused CrossComplainant to sustain damages and, therefore, Cross-Complainants
are entitled to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial.  X-Compl., ¶10.
On information and belief, MLG breached its Retainer
Agreement.  X-Compl., ¶12.  Cross-Complainants performed all conditions
precedent to MLG’s obligations under the Retainer Agreement, except those
conditions excused by Marshian’s negligence and failure to perform as alleged
herein.  X-Compl., ¶13.
On information and belief, each of MLG’s wrongful acts and
omissions directly and proximately contributed to business losses and other
harm such as payment of fees for work not done in accordance with the standard
of care.  X-Compl., ¶14.  Accordingly, Cross-Complainants are entitled
to complete or partial return of moneys paid to Marshian and for recovery of
losses Cross-Complainants suffered as a consequence of such breaches.  X-Compl., ¶15.
            Cross-Complainants
pray for a judgment against MLG for compensatory damages against each
Cross-Defendant in an amount to be determined at trial, attorney fees and
costs, costs of suit, and or such other and further relief as the Court may
deem just and proper.  X-Compl., pp. 4-5.
 
3. Course of
Proceedings
On May 10, 2024,
Husson and 21 Choices filed a joint Answer to the Complaint and a
Cross-Complaint against MLG. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.



            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273. 
The court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form
AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the
attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP
§484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than
the recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts[1]
1. MLG’s Evidence
On or about February 22,
2021, 21 Choices and Husson retained MLG to perform legal services in
connection with the Lawsuit.  Mashian
Decl. ¶3, Ex. 1.  21 Choices is a
California limited liability company, and its manager is Husson.  Mashian Decl., ¶¶3, 14, RJN Ex. 101.  Husson signed the Retainer Agreement, in his
capacity as manager of 21 Choices and as an individual.  Mashian Decl., ¶3.  Brian Mashian, Esq. (“Mashian”), President of
MLG, signed the Retainer Agreement on behalf of MLG.  Mashian Decl., ¶3. 
Pursuant to Paragraphs 2 and
3 of the Retainer Agreement, Defendants agreed to pay MLG for legal services at
the hourly rates stated and for all costs and expenses incurred by MLG in
representing Defendants in connection with the matters described in the
Retainer Agreement.  Mashian Decl. ¶¶4-5,
Ex. 1.  MLG performed all conditions,
covenants and promises required of MLG in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Retainer Agreement and performed legal services for
Defendants.  Mashian Decl., ¶7.
During the months of
February 2021 through January 2023, MLG represented Defendants in the Lawsuit
and provided legal services and advice pursuant to the Retainer Agreement.  Mashian Decl., ¶¶7-8.  Defendants incurred legal fees and costs for
which MLG issued invoices.  Mashian Decl.,
¶9.  On or about April 10, 2023, MLG
provided an invoice to Defendants, requesting payment for professional services
rendered.  Mashian Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  While Defendants made payments toward their
legal fees and costs, the April invoice reflects that there remains unpaid
$19,116.54 in legal fees and costs.  Mashian
Decl., ¶¶9-10, Ex. 2.
Despite demands, Defendants
have failed and refused to pay the balance due in breach of the agreement
between the parties. Mashian Decl., ¶10.
The debt owed by Defendants
is not secured by real property.  Mashian
Decl., ¶12.  Mashian is unaware of any
past or pending bankruptcy of 21 Choices or Husson that has either stayed or
discharged MLG’s claims against either of the Defendants.  Mashian Decl., ¶15.  
As of April 3, 2024,
Defendants, jointly and severally, owe a total of $20,886.78 balance due under
the Retainer Agreement, including interest (at the rate of 10% pursuant to the
Retainer Agreement); $2,255 in legal fees and $420.34 in costs incurred in this
case to date, plus $1,595 in estimated legal fees and $310 in estimated costs,
for a total of $25,467.12.  Mashian Decl.,
¶11; Stanton Decl., ¶5.
 
2.
Defendants’ Evidence
21 Choices has served
delicious cold desserts and other items in Old Town Pasadena for decades. The
current location in Pasadena was to have been built out with certain
modifications important to the flow of business – in particular a second door
so customers could come in, make their selections, are served their orders, and
have a convenient way to exit without getting in the way of incoming customers.
There were other issues with the landlord.  21 Choices and Husson hired MLG to resolve
these issues.  Husson Decl., ¶3.
Husson told MLG’s owner,
Mashian, that he did not want to spend more than $20,000 and that if MLG wanted
to bill more, or did bill more, he would find a different route towards
resolving construction and build out issues with my company’s commercial
landlord.  Husson Decl., ¶3.
As it turned out, Mashian
and MLG did not follow Husson’s desires and kept 21 Choices in the dispute and
kept sending bills that were paid up to at least $45,000.  MLG represented them so poorly and
fraudulently that it owes the large amount of money it was paid ($45,000).  Husson Decl., ¶4.
Husson wanted Mashian to
negotiate with the landlord to settle the lawsuit with the general contractor
since the general contractor was the landlord’s contractor.  He thought the landlord had more leverage with
the general contractor than 21 Choices and that there was no need to deal with
the general contractor or litigate against him.  Based on Husson’s prior experience with Mashian
when he worked at a big law firm, Buchalter Nemer Younger, Mashian knew leases
yet never referred to 21 Choices’ lease even once.  Husson sent Mashian a detailed description of
how much leverage 21 Choices had per section 2 of the lease for the landlord to
complete the buildout that was never completed, Mashian made no comment as if
he did not know the lease.  In hindsight,
he was set on litigation in this case to bill us more money than a simple set
of phone calls in negotiation with the landlord.  Husson Decl., ¶5.
The landlord did not like
the general contractor and was upset with the general contractor for delaying
the project. So, it was a slam dunk to go through a leasing lawyer like Mashian
and, if necessary, he could use a litigator to respond to the lawsuit only
since Husson told him he did not want a trial and wanted the lawsuit with the
general contractor settled fast.  Mashian’s job to explore a landlord approach
to resolve the construction issues and not to drive up litigation costs against
the general contractor.  Husson Decl., ¶5.
The landlord sent Mashian a
letter saying that the landlord was not aware 21 Choices had a permit for the
side door.  Husson urged Mashian to use
this opening to once again get side door installed, but he refused to respond
to that letter from the landlord. That negligent failure left the landlord with
the false impression that there was no urgency on installing the side door.  It was rude to the landlord and totally
against our interest as the clients.  Husson
Decl., ¶5. 
Mashian was paid $5,000 in
trust to 21 Choices by the general contractor for moneys owed to 21
Choices.  Mashian kept that money even
though no money was owed to his firm at that time.  Husson Decl., ¶5.
Mashian’s declaration does
not provide any invoice that shows the work done or when it was done, or the
payments of $45,000 that his firm billed and was paid. There is no itemization
of charges. Husson Decl., ¶6.
Mashian told Husson that he
was an attorney who worked with transactions and was experienced with real
estate and commercial leases, but did not do trials.  He assured Husson that his law firm had
experienced trial lawyers to handle litigation. Husson and 21 Choices were
prejudiced by the lack of trial experience. 
Husson Decl., 7.
Mashian was told not to work
more than $20,000 worth so that 21 Choices and Husson would have the option of
changing the approach. They ignored these instructions for their own
enrichment.  Husson Decl., ¶7.
 
3. Reply Evidence 
In response, at no time
prior to the execution of the Retainer Agreement did Husson communicate to
Mashian that Defendants intended MLG’s representation to be for a purpose other
than representing Defendants in the 21 Choices Lawsuit.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶19.  Husson did not tell Mashian that he was
entering the Retainer Agreement specifically to resolve issues with 21 Choices’
commercial landlord.  Mashian Reply Decl.,
¶19.  The Retainer Agreement also applies
to MLG’s representation of Defendants in other ancillary matters.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶20.  
MLG provides copies of all
invoices sent to Defendants showing in detail MLG’s legal fees and costs in
providing services to Defendants from the inception of MLG’s representation of
Defendants in February 2021 through January 2023.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶21, Ex. 4.  These
invoices also record, where appropriate, all payments made by Defendants.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶21, Ex. 4.
The parties to the Retainer Agreement
never agreed to cap MLG’s fees at $20,000. 
Mashian Reply Decl., ¶22.  The Retainer
Agreement states: “An estimate of fees, if any, is not a guarantee as actual
fees will vary from any estimates given.” 
Mashian Reply Decl., ¶22; Ex. 1, ¶6. 
Defendants’ invoices show that Defendants had incurred over $20,000 by
May 2021, but MLG’s representation of Defendants continued for another 19
months through the end of January 2023.  Mashian
Reply Decl., ¶22, Ex. 4. 
Although Husson asserts that
he wanted MLG “to negotiate with the landlord to settle the lawsuit with the
general contractor since the general contractor was the landlord’s contractor,”
21 Choices was suing its contractor, Guinart Construction, Inc. (“Guinart”),
not 21 Choices’ landlord.  Mashian Reply
Decl., ¶26.  MLG could not negotiate with
a third party to effect a settlement of the 21 Choices Lawsuit; only Guinart
could agree to a settlement.  Mashian
Reply Decl., ¶26.
The two litigators who worked
with Mashian on the case were not inexperienced attorneys.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶25.  At the time MLG represented Defendants under
the Retainer Agreement, Martha Cohen, Esq. had been practicing for over 25
years and Kelsey Solberg, Esq. had been practicing for approximately five
years.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶25.  Ms. Cohen and Ms. Solberg both have
significant litigation experience, including trial experience.  Mashian Reply Decl., ¶25.  The purpose of MLG’s representation was the
21 Choices Lawsuit, as the Retainer Agreement reveals on its face, and Mashian
and other MLG attorneys and staff provided legal services to that end,
eventually bringing the 21 Choices Lawsuit to a settlement freely negotiated by
the parties and executed by Defendants.  Mashian
Reply Decl., ¶24.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff MLG applies for right to attach orders against
Defendants 21 Choices and in the amount of $25,467.12, which includes estimated
costs of $310 and estimated attorney fees of $1,595.00.  
 
1. A Claim Based
on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
            MLG’s
claims are based on the Retainer
Agreement.  Mashian Decl.,
¶3.  The asserted damages under the Retainer Agreement exceed $500.  MLG has claims on which to base attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages
are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
Pursuant to Paragraphs 2 and
3 of the Retainer Agreement, Defendants agreed to pay MLG for legal services at
the hourly rates stated and for all costs and expenses incurred by MLG in
representing Defendants in connection with the matters described in the
Retainer Agreement.  Mashian Decl. ¶¶4-5,
Ex. 1.  During the months of February
2021 through January 2023, MLG represented Defendants in the Lawsuit and
provided legal services and advice pursuant to the Retainer Agreement.  Mashian Decl., ¶¶7-8.  Defendants incurred legal fees and costs for
which MLG issued invoices.  Mashian Decl.,
¶9.  While Defendants made payments
toward their legal fees and costs, the April invoice reflects that there
remains unpaid $19,116.54 in legal fees and costs.  Mashian Decl., ¶¶9-10, Ex. 2.  These damages are readily ascertainable.
            MLG
claims $1770.24 in interest at 10% pursuant to the Retainer Agreement.  MLG fails to provide any calculation or
ledger for this amount and it is disallowed.
            MLG
also claims $2255 in legal fees and $420.34 in costs incurred to date in this
action, plus an estimated $1595 in legal fees and $310 in costs for the reply
and writs of attachment.  Stanton Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4.  MLG fails to show that the
parties agreed to an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an
enforcement action and the attorney fees are disallowed.  The total of $730.34 in costs is permitted.
            The
total readily ascertainable amount shown is $19,846.88.
            
            3.
Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
The facts showing the Retainer Agreement, MLG’s performance, and unpaid
invoices show a probability of success on the merits. During the months
of February 2021 through January 2023, MLG represented Defendants in the
Lawsuit and provided legal services and advice pursuant to the Retainer
Agreement.  Mashian Decl., ¶¶7-8.  Defendants incurred legal fees and costs for
which MLG issued invoices.  Mashian Decl.,
¶9.  On or about April 10, 2023, MLG
provided an invoice to Defendants, requesting payment for professional services
rendered.  Mashian Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  While Defendants made payments toward their
legal fees and costs, the April invoice reflects that there remains unpaid
$19,116.54 in legal fees and costs.  Mashian
Decl., ¶¶9-10, Ex. 2.
Defendants raise two issues with respect to probability of success.  First, Defendants rely on a claim of
offset.  A defendant may raise a claim of
offset for any indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant raised in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense in an answer.  CCP §483.015(b)(2), (3).  The defendant’s offset claim under CCP
section 483.015(b)(2) or (3) must be supported by sufficient evidence to prove
a prima facie case of attachment in its own right. Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel, (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937; Pos-A-Traction,
Inc. v. Kelly Springfield, (C.D. Cal. 1999) 112 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183.
Strict compliance is required with statutory requirements
for affidavits for attachment (Anaheim National Bank v. Kraemer, (1932)
120 Cal.App. 63, 65), and the court must apply the same evidentiary standard to
the declarations in an attachment hearing as to a case tried on oral
testimony.  VFS Financing, Inc. v. CHF
Express, LLC, (2009) (C.D. Cal.) 620 F.Supp.2d 1092, 1096-97.  The declarant must show personal knowledge of
the relevant facts, and such evidence must be admissible and not
objectionable.  Id.  All documentary evidence, including contracts
and canceled checks, must be presented in admissible form, and admissibility as
non-hearsay evidence or exception to the hearsay rule, such as the business
records exception.  Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp., (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
937, 944; Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v. Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., supra,
112 F.Supp.2d at 1182.  
Defendants’ evidence consists of conclusions that lack
foundation and, where appropriate, supporting documentation.  Their argument is insufficient to make a prima
facie case of offset. 
Second, Defendants contend that the moving papers attach invoices but
fail to show any invoice that shows the work done or when it was done,
or the payments of $45,000 that were paid. 
Opp. at 2.  While MLG has not
provided timesheets, it has provided evidence supported by invoices that it
performed and billed for legal services and that some portion of the bill
remains unpaid.  Defendants do not show
that a timesheet is required.  In any
event, MLG provides the timesheet summary in reply.  Mashian Reply Decl., Ex. 4.
 
4. Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            Husson
is the manager of 21 Choices.  Mashian
Decl., ¶¶3, 14, RJN Ex. 101.  MLG was
retained to represent Husson and 21 Choices in the Lawsuit.  MLG does not explain what the Lawsuit was
about.  However, the fact that both 21
Choices and Husson were represented indicates 
that it was commercial in nature and not a personal matter for Husson.
            MLG’s
action against Husson arises out of his conduct of a business or profession.  
 
            5.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  MLG seeks
attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            6.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            For
Husson, MLG seeks to attach interests in real property except leasehold estates
with unexpired terms of less than one year; accounts receivable; chattel paper;
equipment; farm products; inventory; general intangibles and final money
judgments arising out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or
profession; money on the premises where a trade, business, or profession is
conducted and elsewhere; deposit accounts; negotiable documents of title;
instruments; securities; minerals or the like to be extracted; and any
community property that would be subject to enforcement of judgment obtained in
this case.  The description of attachable
property is adequate.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are granted against Defendants 21
Choices and Husson, jointly and severally, in the amount of $19,846.88.  No writ shall issue for either Defendant
until MLG posts a $10,000 undertaking for that Defendant.
