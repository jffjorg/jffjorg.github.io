  Case Number:  22STCP00618    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  85 
Chang Ho Yoo dba PCH
Medical Pharmacy, v. Michelle Baass, Director of Department of Health
Care Services, 22STCP00618


Tentative decision on supplemental petition: denied 




 
 
Petitioner Chang Ho Yoo (“Yoo”), doing business as PCH
Medical Pharmacy (“PCH”) and formerly doing business as Midway Drugs (“Midway”)
and Bell Gardens (“Bell”) seeks to set aside the decision after remand of Respondents
Department of Health Care Services and Director Michelle Baass (collectively,
“Department” or “DHCS”) and order DHCS to set aside its inappropriate billing
finding.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Yoo (PCH) commenced this action on February 22, 2022, alleging a single cause
of action for administrative mandamus. 
The Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            PCH
submitted Medi-Cal bills for payment for drugs dispensed at two pharmacy
locations, Midway and Bell Gardens, for a year before DHCS approved the enrollment
applications for these two locations on October 27, 2017, effective August 31,
2016.  Only about $37,000 was paid before
the March 7, 2016 licensure of those locations by the Board of Pharmacy.
            On October 10, 2019, DHCS began an
audit of payments to PCH, including those that predated the Medi-Cal approval.  On March 12, 2020, DHCS demanded recovery of
$2,045,350, $1,791,322.75 for claims submitted for drugs dispensed at Midway
and Bell Gardens prior to August 31, 2016 and the rest for alleged inventory
shortages from more than three years prior to the demand for
recovery.
            PCH
timely appealed the audit findings and the demand for recovery and a formal
hearing was held in January 2021.  On
December 16, 2021, DHCS’s administrative law judge (“ALJ”) issued a proposed
decision denying PCH’s appeal.  The Chief
ALJ adopted the proposed decision as the final decision on December 29, 2021.
            Yoo
contends that the doctrine of laches prohibits DHCS’s decision.  The decision also incorrectly asserts that Midway
and Bell Gardens could not bill for drugs dispensed to Medi-Cal beneficiaries before
August 31, 2016, that PCH’s submissions were false or misleading, and that it
improperly billed for pharmacies that were suspended as Medi-Cal providers.  
            The
inventory shortage allegations further are unsupported.  DHCS’s auditors could not find a single claim
in which a beneficiary did not receive the ordered drug.  Despite this fact, DHCS concluded that it could recover
based on non-specific information, which is not authorized by 22 CCR section
51488.1(a).  At most, DHCS demonstrated
that in 2020 PCH could not provide copies of all bulk purchase orders furnished
to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.  This is not
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that PCH did not furnish the drugs to
beneficiaries for every claim.
            PCH
seeks (1) an order vacating and reversing the final decision and directing DHCS
to rescind the demand for recovery, and (2) costs of the action.
 
            2. Supplemental Petition
            Yoo filed a Supplemental
Petition on September 12, 2023, seeking a writ of mandate following
remand.  The Supplemental Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
 
            a. Remand Decision
            On November 2, 2022, the
court granted a writ of mandate in this action remanding the DHCS’s decision.  Supp. Pet., ¶2.  It ordered the DHCS to exercise its
discretion under Welfare and Institutions Code (“W&I Code”) section 14043.26(k)
to consider mitigating facts based on facts already in the record.  Supp. Pet., ¶2.  
            On
August 25, 2023, the Chief ALJ issued a “Final Decision After Remand from the
Superior Court” (“Remand Decision”) denying payment for services rendered at
Midway and Bell before Yoo submitted enrollment application packages for
them.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  As a result, DHCS did not need to adjust its inappropriate
billing practice audit finding.  Supp.
Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            The
Supplemental Petition alleges that the Chief ALJ’s Remand Decision was in
excess of her authority.  Supp. Pet.,
¶4.  It unilaterally established a
Medi-Cal policy of “Deterring Providers’ Non-Compliance with Medi-Cal Laws and
Regulations, and the High Risk of Failing to Detect and Respond to Providers’
Inappropriate Claiming.”  Supp. Pet.,
¶4.  This violated applicable rule-making
procedure, and converted a discretionary decision to a mandatory denial of
payment to any provider prior to submitting an enrollment application for that
location.  Supp. Pet., ¶4.  
            DHCS
is only authorized to take remedial action through a Medi-Cal audit and appeal
process, not punitive measures.  Supp.
Pet., ¶5.  DHCS has acknowledged that,
pursuant to 22 CCR section 51488.1(b), when a provider has actually dispensed
drugs to Medi-Cal beneficiaries pursuant to their doctors’ orders, DHCS must
consider mitigating and ameliorative factors during an audit.  Supp. Pet., ¶5.  It failed to do so.  Supp. Pet., ¶5.  
            The
court directed DHCS not to penalize PCH as if it billed for services furnished
by suspended providers.  Supp. Pet.,
¶5.  The Remand Decision found PCH’s
conduct to be more than inadvertent or negligent, which is not supported by the
evidence and findings.  Supp. Pet.,
¶5.  
            The
Supplemental Petition seeks an order vacating the Remand Decision and its demand
for recovery for the overpayment for drugs furnished at Midway and Bell between
March 7 and August 31, 2016.  Supp. Pet.
Prayer for Relief, ¶1.  
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On February 23, 2022, Yoo
served Respondent Baass with the Petition and Summons.
            On June 6, 2022, Respondent
DHCS filed its Answer.
            On October 25, 2022,
this court granted the Petition in part, directing DHCS to consider mitigating
circumstances under 22 CCR section 51488.1(a).  
The judgment was entered on November 2, 2022 and a writ of mandate
was issued on November 8, 2022.
            On
August 29, 2022, DHCS filed the Return to the writ of mandate.
 
            On September 12, 2023, Yoo filed the
Supplemental Petition and served DHCS by e-mail.
            On October 13, 2023,
DHCS filed a declaration of its intent to file a demurrer and of entitlement to
an automatic 30-day extension of the deadline.
            On February 6, 2024,
DHCS filed its Answer to the Supplemental Petition.
On February
15, 2024, the court overruled DHCS’ demurrer to, and motion to strike, the Supplemental
Petition. 



 
            B. Governing Law
            Once
a judgment has been entered, the trial court loses its unrestricted power to
change the judgment.  Graven v. Crout,
(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 779, 782.  
A court issuing a writ of mandate retains jurisdiction to
make any order necessary to its enforcement. 
CCP §§ 1097, 1105; County of lnyo v. City of Los Angeles, (“County
of Inyo”) (1977)  71 Cal.App.3d 185,
205; see also, Professional Engineers in Cal. Govt. v. State
Personnel Bd., (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 101, 109.  This authority is codified in CCP section
1097, which provides in part that when a peremptory writ has issued and is
disobeyed, the court “may make any orders necessary and proper for the complete
enforcement of the writ.”  This
enforcement power is also an inherent power of the court.  Kings v. Woods, (1983) 144 Cal. App.3d
571, 578.  Thus, where the writ remands
the matter to an agency with directions to proceed in a certain manner, and the
agency’s return states that the court’s mandate has been carried out, a
petitioner may challenge the validity of that claim.  CCP §1097. 

A supplemental petition is
not directly authorized in the CCP.  A supplemental complaint – defined as
a complaint alleging material facts occurring after an earlier complaint was
filed – is specifically authorized.  CCP §464(a).  The CCP provisions
concerning complaints constitute the rules of practice for mandamus.  CCP
§1109.  Hence, the requirements of CCP section 464 with respect to a
supplemental complaint apply to a supplemental petition for mandamus.  CCP section 464(a) expressly
requires a motion to file a supplemental complaint, and there is case authority
for a motion for leave to file a supplemental petition for mandamus.  See
Giannini Controls Corp. v. Superior Court, (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 142,
151 (supplemental petition sought by noticed motion should have been
permitted).   There is authority that the
motion for leave to file a supplemental petition may be either oral or
written.  City of
Carmel-by-The-Sea v. Board of Supervisors, (“Carmel-by-the-Sea”)
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 964, 971.
A supplemental petition is permitted in mandamus only after
the mandated party has filed a return advising the court and parties of its
compliance.  Pollak v. State Personnel
Board, (“Pollak”) (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1394-95
(supplemental petition challenged board’s order for reduced penalty imposed
after remand); Carmel-by-The-Sea, supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at 971
(petition may challenge a return in several ways, including a supplemental
petition); Kensington University v. Council for Private Postsecondary, etc.
Education, (“Kensington”) (1997) 62 Cal.App.4th 27, 39
(supplemental petition considered only after administrative body’s final
decision).  
The court’s review of a return is limited to determining
whether the agency cured the deficiencies identified in the writ.  Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v.
County of Riverside, (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1351-52.  The court must resolve any doubts in favor of
the agency’s finding and decision.  Id.  The failure to challenge the scope of writ
arising from facts in existence before judgment are precludes a challenge in
post-judgment proceedings concerning compliance with the writ.  Ballona Wetlands Land Trust v. City of Los
Angeles, (“Ballona Wetlands”) (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 455,
481.  The court may not consider any
newly asserted challenges arising from the same material facts in existence at
the time of the prior judgment because consideration of those issues that were,
or could have been, raised in the litigation leading to the return.  See Town
of Atherton v. Cal. High-Speed Rail Auth., (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
314, 354 (holding that petitioner’s argument in second lawsuit regarding
validity of alternatives analysis in a revised EIR was barred by collateral
estoppel because the court had already rejected petitioner’s same argument in
the first case).
The existence of a return is a condition precedent to the
three means of challenging the agency’s action. 
“Where, as here, the writ remands the matter...and the return states
that the court’s mandate has been carried out, the petitioner may challenge the
validity of that claim” by a new petition, a supplemental petition, or a motion
to compel compliance.  Carmel-by-the-Sea,
supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at 971.  To
conclude that a petitioner may challenge anything other than the return’s
compliance with the judgment and writ would raise serious issues about the
judgment’s finality and scope of the writ. 
See Graven v. Crout, supra, 163 Cal.App.3d at 782; Ballona
Wetlands, supra, 201 Cal.App.4th at 481.  
 
            C.
Statement of Facts 
1. The Court’s Judgment
            On
August 31, 2016, DHCS received the Medi-Cal change of ownership applications
for Midway and Bell.  Court’s Decision
(“Dec.”), p. 10.  It approved the
applications retroactive to that August 31, 2016 date on October 27, 2017.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 10.  
            DHCS’
audit of Midway and PCH concluded that PCH had received payment for 5,184
Medi-Cal claims fulfilled at Midway and Bell when they were suspended,
unenrolled, and ineligible.  Dec., p. 9.  DHCS demanded recovery of $1,791,322.75 in
overpayment for these inappropriate billing practices.  Dec., p. 9. 
An administrative hearing upheld the DHCS’ actions.  Dec., p. 11. 

            This
court’s trial decision on the Petition ruled in part that DHCS had conflated
the definitions of a “provider” of pharmacy services and a “physical
location.”  Dec., p. 21-22.  PCH had always billed at Midway and Bell on
its own behalf, not on behalf of a suspended provider.  Dec., p. 22. 

DHCS was authorized to deny a claim for pharmaceuticals
dispensed at a new location before an application for that location had been
submitted.  Dec., p. 23.  DHCS
regulations require a provider to submit an application to the
Department when there is a change of ownership (22 CCR §51000.30(a), (b)), and
for enrollment at a new location. 
§14043.26(a)(1); Mednik v. State Dept. of Health Care Services, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at 636.  A provider currently enrolled in the Medi-Cal
program who has submitted an
application package for enrollment at a new location may use its existing NPI
to bill for services rendered at the new location until the application package
is approved or denied.  §14043.26(a). 
If a provider submits claims for services rendered at a new location
before the application for that location is received by the Department, the
Department may deny the claim.  §14043.26(k).  DHCS shall recover overpayments from
pharmaceutical providers at a 100% rate when the provider submits or causes to
be submitted any false or misleading statement of material fact on or in
connection with any claim which results in reimbursement for ingredient costs
and professional fees.  §51488.1(a)(7).  Dec., p. 25.
The ALJ correctly found that PCH’s claims for drugs
dispensed at Midway and Bell Gardens were false and misleading, thus allowing
recovery under section 51458.1(a)(7).  Yoo knew that he had to file applications to
use his provider number at the Midway and Bell Gardens locations before PCH did
so.  Once the applications were in place,
he could use his existing NPI to bill
for services rendered at Midway and Bell Gardens until the applications were
approved or denied.  §14043.26(a).  But he knew or should have known that
submitting claims for services rendered at a new location before the
application was received by the Department could result in denial of the
claim.  See §14043.26(k).  Dec., p. 27.
However, W&I Code section 14043.26(k) allows DHCS to
exercise discretion whether it should deny PCH’s submission of bills prior to
August 31, 2016.  Dec., pp. 23-24.  DHCS’ regulation, 22 CCR section 51488.1(b),
also provides that mitigating or ameliorating facts and circumstances shall be
considered where services have been rendered. 
Dec., p. 28.  DHCS’ decision
assumed that it was required to recover the overpayments under 22 CCR section
51488.1.  Dec., p. 25.  DHCS could be compelled to exercise its
discretion under W&I Code section 14043.26(k).  Dec., p. 25. 
Potential mitigating facts included Yoo’s contacts with his attorney,
his mistaken belief about his licensing by the Board, his belief that closing
would occur earlier than it actually occurred, and his general effort to comply
with the law.  Dec., p. 28.
            In
remanding the matter, the court directed DHCS to exercise its discretion under W&I
Code section 14043.26(k) and consider mitigating facts under 22 CCR section
51488.1(b) as to improper billing.  Dec.,
p. 33.  
 
            2.
The Return
In its Return dated August 29, 2023, DHCS asserted that it
had complied with the writ by considering the mitigating facts in the record as
they relate to the inappropriate billing issue raised in the Petition.  The
Return attached the Chief ALJ’s August 25, 2023 Final Decision After Remand (“Remand
Decision”).  Supp. Pet. Ex. A.
 
3. The
Remand Decision
The Chief ALJ determined that Yoo, a licensed pharmacist and
Medi-Cal provider for over 30 years, had experience enrolling multiple
pharmacies in the Medi-Cal program.  Ex. A, p. 11.  Yoo also acknowledged in his testimony that
he was acquainted with and aware of the requirements governing the Medi-Cal
program.  Ex. A, p. 11.
Yoo knew that he needed to submit an application to DHCS
prior to using PHC’s NPI number to bill for services rendered at Midway and
Bell.  Ex. A, p. 11.  The evidence established that Yoo informed
his legal counsel in a part of April 22, 2015 emails that he contemplated
buying Midway and Bell from Cho and inquired as to the lawfulness of using
PHC’s NPI number to bill for services at these new locations.  Ex. A, p. 11. 
On April 27, 2015, Yoo’s counsel advised him that he was required to
submit new provider applications prior to using PCH’s NPI number to bill for
services provided at Midway or Bell.  Ex.
A, pp. 11-12.  The attorney further
stated that Yoo will identify on each application that he intends to bill for
services at these new locations using his existing provider number while the
applications are pending.  Ex. A, p.
12.  Counsel further advised that the
Medi-Cal applications should be received by Medi-Cal on or before the closing
date for the purchases.  Ex. A, p. 12.  Despite this advice, Yoo billed under
PCH’s NPI at Midway Drugs beginning on June 25, 2015, and then at Bell Gardens
on July 12, 2015 more than one year prior to submitting an application to DHCS
and approximately seven to eight months before obtaining a pharmacy permit from
the Board of Pharmacy.  Ex. A, p. 12.
The ALJ concluded that Yoo’s election to disregard his
lawyer’s guidance and proceed with billing for services prior to submitting
application packages did not warrant an adjustment to the inappropriate billing
determination.  Ex. A, p.
17.
The ALJ next considered whether Yoo’s mistaken beliefs that
(1) he complied with advice from his legal counsel and (2) thought he would
come into ownership of Midway and Bell in December 31, 2015, would warrant the
reversal of the improper billing findings. 
Ex. A, p. 12.
First, the ALJ reviewed Yoo’s allegation that billing for
services rendered at Midway Drugs and Bell Gardens prior to submitting
applications complied with advice from his legal counsel.  Ex. A, pp. 11-13. 
The ALJ determined that Yoo’s counsel provided clear direction what
he needed to do to use PCH’s NPI number to bill for services at the new
locations.  Ex. A, p. 13.  He also was advised of the differing
timelines for Board of Pharmacy permits and Medi-Cal services.  Ex. A, p. 13. 
No reasonably prudent person would read the attorney’s email to equate
ownership of a pharmacy with entitlement to use an existing NPI number at the
new pharmacy.  Ex. A, p. 13.  Yoo’s testimony
that he “didn’t really read it through what’s going on” shows that he was not
acting prudently.  Ex. A, p. 13.
Second, the ALJ examined Yoo’s contention that his belief he
would close on the purchase of Midway and Bell in December 31, 2015, but the
closing did not occur until March 7, 2015. 
Ex. A, p. 19.  This led him to
bill under PCH’s NPI at Midway beginning on June 23, 2015 and at Bell on July
13, 2015.  Ex. A, p. 18-19.  The ALJ found that the anticipated December
31, 2015 closing would only account for the using of PCH’s NPI number from the
date of closing.  Ex. A, p. 19.  Yet, PCH began using its NPI number at Midway
and Gardens approximately six months before the
anticipated closing date.  Ex. A, p.
19.  Yoo’s anticipated closing fails to
account for all but one day of PCH’s billings in 2015 and this potential
mitigating fact does not warrant an adjustment to the inappropriate billing
practice finding.  Ex. A, p. 19.
The ALJ considered
Yoo’s general effort to comply with the law.  Ex.
A, p. 19.  Although Yoo sought advice
from his legal counsel, he did not follow that advice.  Ex. A, p. 20. 
Further, PPCH failed to mitigate its submission of false claims.  Ex. A, p. 20. 
PCH violated section 51488.1(a)(7) beginning June 23, 2015, more
than a year before submitting its applications to DHCS and approximately seven
to eight months before obtaining a Board of Pharmacy permit.  Ex. A, p. 20.  Further, despite being notified
that the applications should be submitted on or before the closing date of
purchase, Yoo waited nearly six months after escrow closed to do so.  Ex. A, p. 20. 
 His inaction speaks louder than
the bare minimum of soliciting legal advice, which he did not even heed.  Ex. A, p. 20.
The ALJ noted DHCS’
strong policy interest in deterring providers’ noncompliance with Medi-Cal laws
and regulations and the high risk in failing to detect and respond to
providers’ inappropriate claims.  Ex. A,
p. 9.   Paying a provider for services
rendered at a new location prior to the submission of an application sends the
opposite message.  Ex. A, p. 10.  As PCH’s case demonstrates, a provider
billing for services rendered at a new location before submitting an application
is virtually undetectable by DHCS absent an audit.  Ex. A, p. 10. 
It is imperative that DHCS deter providers’ non-compliance with the
enrollment for a new location to most effectively and efficiently manage its
limited resources and safeguard the fiscal integrity of the Medi-Cal
program.  Ex. A, p. 10.  Denying payment in this circumstance “sends an
unambiguous message of compliance to providers….”  Ex. A, p. 28.
Taking all of Yoo’s
actions into consideration, the ALJ 
exercised DHCS’ discretion under W&I Code section 14043.26(k) to
deny payment for services rendered at Midway and Bell prior to the submission
of an application package for enrollment at these two new locations and no
adjustment to the inappropriate billing practice audit finding is
warranted.  Ex. A, p. 20. 
 
D. Analysis
            This court directed
DHCS to exercise its discretion under W&I Code section 14043.26(k) and
consider mitigating facts under 22 CCR section 51488.1(b) as to improper
billing.  Yoo does not dispute that the
Chief ALJ’s Remand Decision exercised DHCS’ discretion and considered the
required mitigating factors.  Yoo alleges
that the Remand decision failed to follow the procedure required by law because
(1) it set forth a new policy which is an unlawful underground regulation and
(2) the new policy exceeds DHCS’ authority under W&I Code section
14043.26(k), and (3) the Remand Decision is punitive in nature.
 
1. The Remand Decision Does Not Articulate a New
Policy That Is an Underground Regulation
Yoo argues that, in purporting to interpret W&I Code section 14043.26(k), the Chief
ALJ has declared a new Medi-Cal policy of denying payment to a provider who
submits bills to Medi-Cal using the provider’s existing provider number to bill
for services/products supplied at a new and different location prior to the
submission of a Medi-Cal enrollment application.  According to the Chief ALJ, State DHCS has a
“strong policy interest in deterring providers’ non-compliance with Medi-Cal
laws and regulations,” and of “failing to detect and respond to providers’
inappropriate claiming” under facts and circumstances such as those specific to
PCH.  This new policy “sends an
unambiguous message of compliance to providers.”  Ex. A, p .10. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 7.  
Yoo argues that DHCS did not follow the rulemaking
procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), Gov’t.
Code §§ 11346 et seq., in establishing this new policy.  Without giving any notice to the public or
obtaining any comments from PCH and other Medi-Cal providers, the Chief ALJ
unilaterally decreed this to be “Medi-Cal policy” in the Remand Decision.  Similar attempts to make Medi-Cal policy
without complying with the APA rulemaking
requirements have been invalidated by the courts.  See, e.g., Grier v. Kizer, (1990) 219
Cal.App.3d 422, 434-40 (application of statistical sampling policy to Medi-Cal
audit appeals developed without compliance with the APA was invalid, barring DHCS from recovering
alleged overpayment).  In fact, the new
policy is in the nature of a penalty and the APA
expressly prohibits an agency from imposing a penalty unless the policy on
which it is based has been adopted as a regulation pursuant to Govt. Code section 11340.  See Govt.
Code §11425.50(e).  Pet. Op. Br. at 7.
Yoo is incorrect.  The Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”) requires that every regulation be adopted
according to specific procedures.  Govt. Code §11340.5(a), (b).  A “regulation” is defined as every rule,
regulation, order, or standard of general application or the amendment,
supplement, or revision of any rule, regulation, order or standard adopted by
any state agency to implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or
administered by it, or to govern its procedure. 
Govt. Code 2111342.600.  Any order
which is a regulation as defined in Government Code section 11342.600 may not
be enforced unless the order has been adopted as a regulation under the
APA.  Govt. Code §11340.5.  Whether an agency’s practices amount to the
enforcement of an underground regulation may be challenged through an action in
mandamus pursuant to CCP 1085.  Union
of Am. Physicians & Dentists v. Kizer, (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 490, 495
[CCP 1085 challenge to DHCS underground
regulation in audit proceeding). 
The two-part test for determining
whether a rule constitutes a regulation subject to the APA is well established:
“First, the agency must intend its rule to apply generally….Second, the rule
must ‘implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered
by [the agency], or . . . govern [the agency’s] procedure.”  Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw,
(“Tidewater”) (1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 571 (quoting Govt. Code
§11342(g), now Govt. Code §11342.600). 
This definition sweeps “very broadly” (id. at 571) and ensures
that all stakeholders may participate through a formal, public process in the
adoption of any “regulation.” Id. at 568-69.  An “underground regulation” is one that has
not been promulgated according to the APA
and therefore is invalid and cannot be enforced.  Govt.
Code §11340.5; Naturist Action Com. v.
DHCS of Parks & Recreation, (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1244, 1250.  A department’s statutory interpretation in
the course of a case specific adjudication is not a regulation.  Tidewater, supra, 14 Cal.4th
at 571.  
As DHCS’ opposition
argues (Opp. at 16), Medi-Cal regulations clearly give DHCS the authority to deny payments to an existing provider
of services who bills for services at a new location before submitting an
application for enrollment at a new location. 
W&I Code §14043.26(k). 
While the Department may permit payment in some cases, it is not
required to do so.  (Ibid. 
The Remand Decision refers to DHCS’ policy interest and does not
purport to establish a new policy.  Moreover,
a department’s statutory interpretation in a case specific adjudication is not
a regulation.  Tidewater, supra, 14 Cal.4th at 571.  The Chief ALJ properly applied W&I Code section 14043.26(k) to Yoo’s individual facts
and circumstances and did not set forth a rule of general application.  Even when the Chief ALJ stated that denying
payment “sends an unambiguous message of compliance to providers….”  (Ex. A, p. 28), she did so in interpreting
W&I Code section 14043.26(k) as part of adjudicating Yoo’s case.
The Remand Decision did not adopt a new policy in violation
of the APA.
 
2. The Remand
Decision Does Not Exceed DHCS’ Authority
In a related argument, Yoo notes that DHCS only possesses
the power delegated to it by statute.  See
Podiatric Med. Bd. of California v.
Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco, (2021) 62
Cal.App.5th 657, 669.  Administrative
agency policies that alter or amend the statute or impair its scope are void.  Ontario
Community Foundation, Inc. v. State Board of Equalization, (1984) 35
Cal.3d 811, 816-17.
In W&I Code section 14043.26(k), the Legislature has
given DHCS the discretion to deny Medi-Cal payment to an existing provider of
services who bills for services at a new location before submitting an
application for enrollment at the new location. 
The statute does not mandate that DHCS deny payment in all such
cases.  However, the Chief ALJ’s policy
requires the denial of payment in all cases to “[deter] providers’
non-compliance with Medi-Cal laws and regulations” and to avoid the “high risk
of failing to detect and respond to providers’ inappropriate claiming.”  The Remand Decision then uses PCH’s “facts
and circumstances” as an example of why the policy is appropriate.  In other words, under the new policy
articulated by the Chief ALJ, DHCS lacks the discretion to pay for any claims
for services furnished prior to the receipt of an enrollment application for a
new location.  The new policy thus
impairs a right assured to Medi-Cal providers, including Yoo, by statute.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8; Reply at 2.
Aside from the fact that the Chief ALJ has not set forth a
new policy, the Remand Decision is within the scope of W&I Code section
14043.26(k).  The Chief ALJ reviewed the
potentially mitigating factors articulated by the court, including Yoo’s
contacts with his attorney, his mistaken belief about his licensing by the
Board, his belief that closing would occur earlier than it actually occurred,
and his general effort to comply with the law. 
Dec., p. 28.  The Chief ALJ
expressly exercised DHCS’ discretion under
W&I Code section 14043.26(k) and concluded that, considering all of Yoo’s actions, denial of payment for
services rendered at Midway and Bell prior to the submission of an application
package for enrollment at these two new locations was appropriate and no
adjustment was warranted.  Ex. A, p. 20.  
The Remand Decision
did not rely solely on a new policy to ignore Yoo’s individual circumstance and
was within the scope of W&I Code section 14043.26(k).
 
3. The Remand
Decision Does Not Violate 22 CCR Section
51488.1
Yoo notes that 22 CCR section 51488.1 governs the recovery of
overpayments from pharmaceutical providers such as PCH.  Subdivision
(a)(7) requires DHCS to recover 100% of the ingredient cost and professional
fee paid, if any, where the provider submits any false or misleading statement of material fact in connection
with any claim which results in reimbursement not allowed “under the
regulations of this division.”   Section 51488.1(b) requires that “where a service has been rendered, mitigating or ameliorating facts and
circumstances will be considered in determining the audit findings.”
The court has upheld
the audit finding that the claims submitted by PCH for pharmaceuticals
dispensed at Midway and Bell prior to August 31, 2016 were false because the
claims did not expressly indicate that the pharmaceuticals were dispensed at those
locations.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9.  Upon remand, DHCS was required to consider
the mitigating factors under section 51488.1.[1]
Yoo argues that he concealed nothing from the state and
federal government with respect to his ownership and operation of Midway and
Bell during the period of March 1 to August 30, 2016 and before.  For example, the public records of the State
Board of Equalization reflected Yoo’s pharmacy seller’s permit at Midway and
Bell as early as October 1, 2015.  AR 1526, 1610.
 In March 2016, the Department of
Consumer Affairs’ public records reflected Yoo’s ownership and operation of the
two pharmacies, effective March 1, 2016. 
 Well before August 30, 2016, the
public records for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the
federal agency administering Medicare and Medicaid, reported Yoo’s ownership
and state pharmacy licensing of Midway and Bell on April 21, 2016. 
AR 636-37, 964243.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
According to the Chief ALJ, Yoo “ignored” or “failed to
heed” his lawyer’s legal advice and began billing for services rendered at
Midway on June 23, 2015, and at Bell on July 13, 2015, more than a year “prior
to submitting an application package” for each new location.  The ALJ Chief’s characterization overstates
the evidence.  PCH and Yoo made mistakes
but hardly intentionally ignored or failed to heed such advice.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
Until the audit was conducted years after the fact, Yoo did
not know that PCH had submitted bills at either pharmacy for services furnished
prior to the close of escrow and the licensing of the two pharmacies in early
March 2016.  The overwhelming majority of
the overpayment for which recovery is sought concerns services furnished after
the two pharmacies were licensed in Yoo’s name by the Board of Pharmacy.  Yoo was confused about the dates of the
closing of escrow and the impact of the licensure of the two pharmacies.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
At most, Yoo’s conduct was negligent, which is consistent
with the Chief ALJ’s characterization that he failed to act as a reasonably
prudent person.  The fact that Yoo sought
the advice of counsel in the first place shows a good faith intent to comply
with the complex regulatory scheme governing the provisions of the Medi-Cal
Program.  Yoo did not try to hide the advice
he was given; he proffered the evidence of his counsel’s advice at the hearing
to show how complicated the rules can be. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
The Chief ALJ’s conclusion ignores the fact that Yoo
actually furnished medically necessary pharmaceuticals to Medi-Cal
beneficiaries at the two new locations, which can only be done pursuant to
outside prescriptions, and that Medi-Cal would have had to pay the very same
sum for the pharmaceuticals to another pharmacy if Midway and Bell had not
furnished them.   Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
The current on-line Miriam-Webster dictionary definition for
“mitigating” is “to cause to become less harsh or hostile” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitigating).  The Chief ALJ’s conclusions are inconsistent
with this definition.  Medi-Cal payment
rates are notoriously low and at best cover only a percentage of a pharmacy’s
cost of providing pharmaceuticals. 
See California Pharmacy
Ass’n v. Maxwell-Jolly, (9th Cir. 2010) 596 F.3d
1098.  On the other hand, DHCS gains a
nearly $1.8 million windfall if it pays nothing for the costs of furnishing
these pharmaceuticals.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
Yoo is aware of State DHCS’ need to maintain a system of
administrative controls over the Medi-Cal program.  An appellate court has held: “We cannot agree
that an administrative system must be mindless in order to be efficient.”  See Valley View Home of Beaumont, Inc. v. Dep’t of
Health Servs., (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 161, 169 (“The exercise of
administrative controls must be vigorous, but not ruthless”).[2]
Yoo is attempting
to substitute his discretion for that of DHCS.  
Neither he nor the court can do so. 
Mandamus will not lie to compel the exercise of a public agency’s
discretion in a particular manner.  American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 261.  It is available to correct an abuse of
discretion actually exercised (Manjares v. Newton, (1966) 64 Cal.2d 365,
370-71) but the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,
whose decision must be upheld if reasonable minds may disagree as to its
wisdom.  Id.  A writ will lie where the agency’s discretion
can be exercised only in one way.  Hurtado
v. Superior Court, (1974) 11 Cal.3d 574, 579.
DHCS has exercised
its discretion under section 51488.1(b) to consider mitigating factors.   Yoo fails to show that the Remand Decision
is arbitrary and capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful,
or procedurally unfair.  Kahn v. Los
Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System, (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 98, 106.
 
4. The Chief
ALJ’s Interpretation of Section 51488.1 Is Not Punitive
Yoo argues that there must be an express unequivocable
statutory provision authorizing such punitive sanctions before an agency can
impose punishment or a penalty.  Absent
such express authority penalties may not be imposed.  See Cinquegrani v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles,
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 741, 746-50 (statute did not permit DMV to suspend
driver’s license for “boating under the influence” conviction).  Even where an agency is allowed to impose
“discipline” on a licensed person, the agency cannot “punish” the
licensee.  See Pirouzian v. Superior Court, (2016)
1 Cal.App.5th 438, 450.  Yet, the Remand
Decision speaks about “deterring” noncompliance with Medicare rules as a reason
for denying all payment for all pharmaceuticals because of the late submission
of the enrollment packages for Midway and Bell. 
Deterrence is a principle for the punishment of persons who commit
crimes, not regulated parties who make mistakes regarding the timing of the
submission of enrollment applications.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 13-14.
Yoo mistakenly describes the recovery of overpayments from pharmaceutical providers
such as PCH under 22 CCR section 51488.1 as a punishment.  It is not. 
Rather, it is a regulation governing the circumstance in which a claim
that could have been denied W&I Code section 14043.26(k) may be
recovered.  It is not intended as
punishment.  Nor is there anything in the
Remand Decision that reflects punishment.
 
 
          E. Conclusion
The Supplemental Petition is denied.  DHCS’ counsel is ordered to prepare a
proposed judgment, serve it on Yoo’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten
days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections,
and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for August 20,
2024 at 9:30 a.m.
