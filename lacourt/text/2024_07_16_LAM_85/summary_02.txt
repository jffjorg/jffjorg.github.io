And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a procedural issue related to the handling of a remand decision. The Chief ALJ made the decision without giving the plaintiff, Yoo, an opportunity to be heard, and then denied Yoo's request for reconsideration. The judge notes that Yoo has not pointed to any specific statute, regulation, or rule that was violated by the Chief ALJ. The judge is also considering the requirement to follow statutory provisions, specifically California Welfare and Institutions Code section 51488.1(b). The judge will need to determine whether the Chief ALJ's actions were proper and whether the Legislature's abrogation of the holding in Valley View Home of Beaumont affects the outcome.
