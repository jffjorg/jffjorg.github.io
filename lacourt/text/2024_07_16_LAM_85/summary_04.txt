The City of Whittier has brought an action against Romero Investments LLC, alleging that the latter has been hosting events at a property without a permit, in violation of the City's noise regulations. The City has received multiple noise complaints from residents and has issued multiple noise violations to Defendant. The Court finds that Defendant has a reasonable probability of committing a public nuisance and that the City has shown a legitimate interest in preventing the harm. The Court grants the City's application for a preliminary injunction, enjoining Defendant from hosting events at the property without a permit during the pendency of the action.
