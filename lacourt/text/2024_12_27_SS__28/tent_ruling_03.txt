 Case Number:  23STCV00997    Hearing Date:   December 27, 2024    Dept:  28 On
January 17, 2023, Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad (“Plaintiff’) filed this
action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”), Esayas Alemu
(“Alemu”), and Does 1-100 for negligence. 
On
February 21, 2023, the County and Alemu ("Defendants") filed answers. 
At
the September 25, 2024 final status conference, the Court continued the trial
from October 2, 2024 to November 13, 2024 based on counsel’s oral stipulation.  The Court directed that all discovery
deadlines would remain closed except for expert discovery deadlines, which would
be based on the new trial date. 
On
November 13, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to quash Plaintiff’s subpoena
served on third-party witness Corina Mary Weaver.  The motion was set for hearing on December
27, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Also
on November 13, 2024, based on counsel’s oral stipulation, the Court continued
the trial from November 13, 2024 to December 9, 2024. 
On
November 18, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and continued
the trial from December 9, 2024 to February 13, 2025.  The Court did not continue or reopen
discovery. 
On
December 9, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation stating in part: 
·       “WHEREAS, Plaintiff agrees to conditionally withdraw
the trial subpoena for Corina Mary Weaver that forms the basis of the Motion to
Quash, thereby rendering it moot;”
·       “WHEREAS, Defendants have agreed to conditionally
withdraw the pending Motion to Quash and agree to have the hearing on December
27, 2024, vacated;”
·       “WHEREFORE, the parties conditionally stipulate to
advance the trial date and FSC to a date convenient for this Court within the
second half of January 2025.”
  The parties
did not, however, provide a proposed order for the Court’s signature or set the
matter for hearing.  The Court has not considered
the parties’ stipulated request.  In
addition, the parties have not taken the hearing on Defendants’ motion to quash
the subpoena served on third-party witness Corina Mary Weaver, set for December
27, 2024, off calendar. 
The Court
continues the hearing on Defendants’ motion to quash Plaintiff’s subpoena to a
date to be provided at the December 27, 2024 hearing.  At least ten court days before the continued hearing,
Defendants shall file a supplemental brief or declaration addressing the status
of the motion.  Plaintiff may file a
responsive supplemental brief or declaration no later than five court days
before the continued hearing. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice.
