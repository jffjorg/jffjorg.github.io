 Case Number:  23STCV16831    Hearing Date:   December 27, 2024    Dept:  28 On August
20, 2024, the Court denied the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Lindsey Keefe’s action, which Petitioner filed on July 18, 2024. 
On
October 24, 2024, the Court denied the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of minor Plaintiff Lindsey Keefe’s action, which Petitioner filed on
September 23, 2024. 
Petitioner
has not filed a new petition for approval of a minor’s compromise (or petition for expedited
approval of a minor’s compromise) since the Court denied the last petition on
October 24, 2024.  The Court cannot make
a ruling on the compromise of minor Plaintiff Lindsey Keefe’s action unless
Petitioner files a new petition (either a petition to approve the compromise or
a petition for expedited approval of the compromise, whichever is appropriate).  Any new petition should correct the defects
identified in the Court’s August 20, 2024 and October 24, 2024 orders.
