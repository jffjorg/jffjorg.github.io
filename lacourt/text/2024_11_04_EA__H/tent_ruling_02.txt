v. Real Time Resolutions, Inc., et al., Case No. 24PSCV01975
 
ORDER
ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Plaintiff
Antonio Monreal’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
 
I.        Background 
Plaintiff Antonio Monreal
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On
December 13, 2006, David and Angela Lopez (together, the “Lopezes”) obtained
(1) a first position loan from WMC Mortgage Corp. (“WMC”) for $332,00.00 and
(2) a second position loan from WMC in the amount of $83,000.00, both of which
were secured by Deeds of Trust (i.e., “Deed 1 and Deed 2,” respectively)
recorded January 5, 2007 on the property located at 2442 Lennox Street in
Pomona (the “subject property”). Deed 1 and Deed 2 were assigned multiples
times but the loans continued to be serviced by Seneca Mortgage Servicing LLC
(“Seneca”) under one loan number, i.e., Loan No. 0005230626.
On
or about September 7, 2016, a Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded in
connection with Deed 1; in lieu of foreclosure, the subject property was listed
for sale as a short sale. In or about December 2016, Seneca approved the short
sale in connection with Loan No. 0005230626; the Short Sale Approval stated the
“Current Balance” of the Deed 1 was $242,195.32 with $242,195.32 to be applied
and the “Current Balance” of the Deed 2 was $98,070.292 with $45,183.34 to be
applied, with the total due listed as $287,378.66.
On
November 16, 2016, Plaintiff purchased the subject property with a $305,000.00
purchase money loan from Guild Mortgage Company secured by a Deed of Trust
recorded December 23, 2016. These funds were used to pay off the balance due
under Deed 2. Despite the payoff of Deed 2, however, it was not released and a
reconveyance was not recorded; instead, Deed 2 was purportedly assigned to Real
Time Resolutions Inc. (“Real Time”) via an Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded
on October 7, 2020. On September 28, 2023, a Substitution of Trustee was
recorded whereby ZBS Law, LLP (“ZBS”)[FN1] was
substituted as the foreclosure trustee under Deed 2. On October 20, 2023, ZBS
recorded a Notice of Default relative to Deed 2. On February 13, 2024, Real
Time and ZBS were advised via letter that they were required to release the Deed
2, execute a full reconveyance, and record that reconveyance. To date, no
reconveyance has been recorded. On June 5, 2024, ZBS recorded a Notice of Sale
relative to Deed 2. 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint,
asserting causes of action against Real Time, ZBS, Seneca, All Other Persons
Unknown, Claiming Any Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Real
Property Described in the Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s Ownership Interest
or Any Cloud on Plaintiff’s Right Thereto, and Does 1-50 for:
1.       Violation of Civil Code Section 2941(b),
2.       Quiet Title,
3.       Cancellation of Instruments,
4.       Unjust Enrichment,
5.       Declaratory Relief, and
6.       Injunctive Relief. 
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of
Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens).” On July 8, 2024, an “Amendment to Complaint”
was filed, wherein “ZBD Law, LLP’s” name was corrected to “ZBS Law, LLP.” 
On
July 26, 2024, ZBS filed a “Declaration of Nonmonetary Status.” 
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. On
September 6, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application for a temporary
restraining order so as to prevent the sale of the subject property while the
motion for a preliminary injunction was pending. The Court ordered further briefing
on the motion for preliminary injunction, as follows: Plaintiff was ordered to
file a supplemental moving brief by October 14, 2024, RTR was ordered to file a
response by October 21, 2024, and Plaintiff was permitted to file an optional
reply by October 28, 2024. The Court received an opposition from RTR but never
received a supplemental moving brief or reply brief from Plaintiff. For the
reasons stated herein, the motion for preliminary injunction is denied.
II.      Legal Standard
“An
injunction may be granted in the following cases: (1)
When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
demanded, and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the
commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period
or perpetually[;] (2)
When it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or
continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or
irreparable injury, to a party to the action[;] (3)
When it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or
threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act
in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the
subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual[;] (4)
When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief[;] (5)
Where it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation
which would afford adequate relief[;] (6)
Where the restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial
proceedings[;] (7)
Where the obligation arises from a trust.” (CCP § 526(a).)
“In
considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a court evaluates two
interrelated factors: the likelihood plaintiff will prevail on the merits at
trial and the interim harm to plaintiff or defendant if the court denies or
grants the preliminary injunction. Plaintiff carries the burden of proof and
persuasion on these issues.” (Drakes Bay
Oyster Co. v. California Coastal Com. (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 1165, 1171.)
“The
trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit
and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less
must be shown on the other to support an injunction.” (Butt v. State of California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.) “[A]n
injunction should not issue where there is no possibility of success even
though its issuance might prevent irreparable harm. . . Where there is indeed
no likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail, an injunction favoring the
plaintiff serves no valid purpose and can only cause needless harm.” (American Academy of Pediatrics v. Van de
Camp (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 831, 838.)
An
application for a preliminary injunction may be based upon a verified
complaint, or upon affidavits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).)
Finally,
“[a] preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
party applying for it provides an undertaking” for damages which the enjoined
defendant may sustain due to the injunction if the court finally decides that
the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 529, subd. (a); City of S. San Francisco v. Cypress
Lawn Cemetery Ass’n (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.)

III.     Discussion
Plaintiff
moves the Court for a preliminary injunction to enjoin and restrain Real Time,
its agents, attorneys, and representatives, and all persons acting in concert
or participating with it, from recording a notice of trustee’s sale, selling,
attempting to sell, or causing to be sold the subject real property at issue in
this case, either under the power of sale in the subject deed of trust or by
any other foreclosure during the pendency of this action. 
 
Interim Harm
It
is beyond dispute that real property is unique such that injury or loss cannot
be compensated in damages.  (Civ. Code §
3387; Aspen Grove Condominium Assoc. v
CNL Income Northstar LLC (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 53, 62.)  Plaintiff thus has sufficiently demonstrated
interim harm, in that this dispute revolves around ownership of real property
and the potential loss of title ownership.

 
Reasonable Likelihood of Prevailing on
the Merits
The
burden upon Plaintiff is to show that there is a reasonable likelihood that
Plaintiff will prevail on the merits. On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
verified complaint, asserting causes of action for (1) Violation of Civil Code
section 2941(b), (2) Quiet Title, (3) Cancellation of Instruments, (4) Unjust
Enrichment, (5) Declaratory Relief, and (6) Injunctive Relief.
Plaintiff
proffers the following facts in support of its request for a preliminary
injunction:  
Plaintiff purchased the subject property in November 2016.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 7 and 14, Exh. 7; see also Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶¶ 3 and 4, Exh.
3). On or about December 13, 2006, Plaintiff’s predecessors in interest, the
Lopezes obtained first and second position loans from WMC Mortgage Corp. in the
original principal amounts of $332,000.00 and $83,000.00, respectively.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 8 and 9; Dunn Decl., ¶¶ 4 and 5, Exhs. 1 and 2). The first
position loan was secured by Deed 1, which was recorded on January 5, 2007 as
Document No. 20070025973; the second position loan was secured by Deed 2, which
was recorded that same day as Document No. 20070025974. (Complaint, ¶¶ 8 and 9,
Exhs. 1 and 2). Deed 1 and Deed 2 were thereafter assigned multiple times but
the loans continued to be serviced by Seneca under one loan number (i.e., Loan
No. 0005230626), as evidenced by statements dated August 16, 2016, November 16,
2016 and December 16, 2016 obtained from Seneca (each of which identify both
the first and second mortgage loan). (Complaint, ¶ 10; Dunn Decl., ¶ 6, Exhs.
5-7). On or about September 7, 2016, a Notice of Trustee’s Sale recorded in
connection with Deed 1; in lieu of foreclosure, the subject property was listed
for sale as a short sale. (Complaint, ¶ 11).
In or about December 2016, Seneca approved the short sale
in connection with Loan No. 0005230626. (Complaint, ¶ 12, Exh. 6; Dunn Decl., ¶
7, Exh. 8.) The Short Sale Approval states the “Current Balance” of Deed 1 was
$242,195.32 with $242,195.32 to be applied and the “Current Balance” of Deed 2
was $98,070.292 with $45,183.34 to be applied, with the total due listed as
$287,378.66. (Complaint, ¶ 13, Exh. 6; Dunn Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 8.) In purchasing
the subject property, Plaintiff obtained a purchase money loan in the amount of
$305,900 from Guild Mortgage Company, which was secured by a first position
deed of trust recorded December 23, 2016; $287,378.66 of these funds were wired
to Seneca to satisfy Deed 1 and Deed 2. (Complaint, ¶¶ 15-18, Exh. 8; Dunn
Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. 9; Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 4.)
Plaintiff
contends that Deed 2 was not released and a reconveyance was not recorded,
despite it being paid off, that Real Time was purportedly assigned the
satisfied and extinguished Deed 2 via an Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded
on October 7, 2020, that ZBS substituted in as trustee under Deed 2 on or about
September 28, 2023, and that ZBS recorded a Notice of Default and Notice of
Sale relative to Deed 2 on October 20, 2023 and June 5, 2024, respectively. (Complaint,
¶¶ 21-25; Dunn Decl., ¶ 11). The foreclosure sale of the subject property was
subsequently rescheduled for September 10, 2024. (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 8.)
All
of Plaintiff’s causes of action are based on the contention that Deed 2 was
paid off through the short sale. (Complaint, ¶¶ 47, 51 and 56.) Real Time,
however, asserts that Deed 2, which it services, was not satisfied through the
short sale.
In
support of its position, Real Time proffers the following evidence:
Real Time does not possess any information that Deed 2 was
satisfied through the 2016 short sale or otherwise. (Trakhtenbroit Decl., ¶ 14.)
There is no indication that Seneca ever serviced Deed 2; rather, an Assignment
of Deed of Trust was recorded in 2013 which reflected that Deed 2 was assigned
to HSBC Bank, USA, National Association (“HSBC”). (Trakhtenbroit Decl., ¶¶ 7
and 15, Exh. 2.) Deed 2 remained assigned to HSBC at the time of the 2016 short
sale. (Id., ¶ 15.) Real Time’s records reflect that Bank of America was
the prior servicer of the loan secured by Deed 2. (Id., ¶ 16.)
Real Time acquired ownership of the second position loan in
March 2020 and began servicing same shortly thereafter. (Id., ¶ 9.) On
October 7, 2020, an Assignment of Deed of Trust was recorded, through which Deed
2 was assigned to Real Time. (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. 3.) At the time Real Time
began servicing Deed 2, Real Time obtained the Lopezes’ credit reports, which
reflected only one tradeline pertaining to Seneca, with the loan number thereon
matching the number on the documentation enclosed with Plaintiff’s counsel’s
February 13, 2024 correspondence, No. 005230626. (Id., ¶¶ 12 and 17,
Exh. 5.)
The tradeline reflects that the term of the mortgage is 47
years (id.), whereas the maturity date listed on the face of Deed 1 is
January 1, 2037, which is 30 years after its origination. (Id., ¶ 6,
Exh. 1.) Real Time’s corporate counsel, Samuel Trakhtenbroit, opines, based on
his experience, that this suggests that the loan secured by Deed 1 was modified
and the maturity date was extended. (Id., ¶ 18.)
The mortgage statements proffered by Plaintiff do not
support Plaintiff’s position. While the mortgage statements refer to a “1st
Mortgage” and a “2nd Mortgage,” they are referred together as Loan
No. 0005230636. (Dunn Decl., ¶ 6, Exhs. 5-7.) The August 16, 2016 statement
refers to the “2nd mortgage” as having a principal balance of
$98,070.29, which does not accord with the fact that Deed 2’s original
principal balance was $83,000.00. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 5.) In Trakhtenbroit’s
view, this $98,070.29 figure reflects a deferred, lump sum balance that
resulted from a modification agreement entered into with the Lopezes on the
loan secured by Deed 1. (Trakhtenbroit Decl., ¶ 18). The statements also refer
to the “2nd mortgage” as having a 0% interest rate and the “1st
mortgage” as having a 4% interest rate (the latter of which contradicts the
Adjustable Rate Rider to Deed 1, which states that “[t]he interest rate. . .
will not be greater than 10.425% or less than 5.425%”), again suggesting to
Trakhtenbroit that a modification occurred. (Dunn Decl., ¶¶ 4 and 6, Exhs. 1
and 5-7; Trakhtenbroit Decl., ¶ 21.)
According to Trakhtenbroit, while Plaintiff claims both
loans were serviced together by Seneca as loan No. 005230626, separate loans
are typically given separate loan numbers by mortgage brokers and that here,
Bank of America had a separate loan number while servicing the loan secured by
Deed 2. (Id., ¶ 21.)
Finally, records from Seneca demonstrate that Seneca only
serviced Deed 1. Seneca, in response to a deposition subpoena issued by
Plaintiff’s counsel, did not produce a copy of Deed 2 or any other document
relating to Deed 2 or that referenced the recording information for Deed 2. (Id.,
¶ 24.) Seneca produced a “Lien Release Initial Review Checklist,” which makes
reference only to the recording information for Deed 1. (Id., ¶ 24, Exh.
6.) The short sale approval letter attached to attorney Kelly Vierra’s February
13, 2024 correspondence also only refers to the release of one lien in
connection with the short sale (Complaint, ¶ 26, Exh. 10(B) [“Seneca . . . will
release the lien on the subject property if the following conditions are
met”].)
The
aforementioned evidence suggests that contrary to Plaintiff’s claim, Deed 2 was
not satisfied in conjunction with the 2016 short sale. Accordingly, Plaintiff
has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The
motion is denied.
