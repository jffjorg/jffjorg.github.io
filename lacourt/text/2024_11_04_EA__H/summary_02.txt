And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the sale of the subject property. The plaintiff, Antonio Monreal, alleged that Real Time Resolutions, Inc., and others were attempting to foreclose on a second position loan that was paid off in conjunction with a short sale of the property in 2016. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, as the evidence suggested that the second position loan was not satisfied in conjunction with the short sale.

The judge noted that the plaintiff's causes of action were based on the contention that the second position loan was paid off through the short sale, but the evidence presented by Real Time suggested that the loan was not satisfied and that a modification occurred. The judge also found that the mortgage statements produced by the plaintiff did not support the plaintiff's position and that the records from Seneca, the servicer of the loan, only referred to the release of one lien in connection with the short sale.

Therefore, the judge denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.
