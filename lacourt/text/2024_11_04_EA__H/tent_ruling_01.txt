  Case Number:  20PSCV00849    Hearing Date:   November 4, 2024    Dept:  H Liu v. Lanterprise, Inc., et al., Case
No. 20PSCV00849
Defendants Lanterprise, Inc. dba
Lanterprise Corporation dba Lanterprise Construction, Waiming Li, and Weiheng
Zhen’s Motion for Damages to be Added to Cost Bill Under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 907 is DENIED.

Background
Plaintiff Miller Liu (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
In or about September 2018, Plaintiff engaged in discussions with
Waiming Li (“Li”) and Weiheng Zhen (“Zhen”), whereby Li’s construction company,
Lanterprise, Inc. dba Lanterprise Corporation dba Lanterprise Constriction
(“Lanterprise”), would build an ADU for Plaintiff in Plaintiff’s backyard. Plaintiff
advised Li and Zhen that he intended to move into the ADU and wanted the ADU to
have a separate and independent water, gas, and electric meters. The parties
thereafter entered into a contract and Plaintiff paid $170,000.00 towards the
$180,000.00 projected costs as construction progressed. On August 15, 2019, Li
prepared a change order, which set forth additional costs of $21,965.00 for
items related to gas and water connections and meters.
Li and Zhen refused to finish construction of the ADU when Plaintiff
disputed paying the $21,965.00. Plaintiff has obtained a written quote of
$41,705.44 to finish the construction. As Plaintiff was inspecting the ADU, he
discovered that Li and/or Zhen sabotaged some of the construction before
leaving the premises, including drilling a hole in one of the new metal water
pipes and removing a previously installed electrical breaker that had passed
inspection and replacing it with an inexpensive one which failed inspection by
the building inspector in a subsequent inspection.
On December 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes
of action against Lanterprise, Li, Zhen, and Does 1-20 for (1) breach of
written agreement and (2) intentional destruction of property.
On April 11, 2023, the Court granted Lanterprise, Li, and Zhen’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings. On May 4, 2023, judgment was entered;
that day, “Notice of Entry of Judgment” was filed.
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of Appeal.” On August
7, 2024, remittitur was issued (affirmed). 
 
Legal Standard
“When it appears to
the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous or taken solely for
delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as may be just.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 907 [Emphasis added].)
“On motion of a
party or its own motion, a Court of Appeal may impose sanctions,
including the award or denial of costs under rule 8.278, on a party or an
attorney for: (1) Taking a frivolous appeal or appealing solely to cause delay;
(2) Including in the record any matter not reasonably material to the appeal’s
determination; (3) Filing a frivolous motion; or (4) Committing any other
unreasonable violation of these rules.” (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 8.276(a)
[Emphasis added].)
 

Discussion
Lanterprise,
Li, and Zhen (collectively, “Defendants”) move the Court, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 907, for an order awarding it damages in the amount of
$42,559.67 on the grounds that the appeal was frivolous and taken solely for
harassment and to attempt to exact revenge.
The
motion is denied. The reviewing court here is the Second District, Division 7
Court of Appeal. Defendants have not provided the Court with any authority
which reflects that Code of Civil Procedure section 907 provides a non-reviewing
Court with the ability to impose such damages. Defendants’ citation
to Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175 involved the Fourth
District, Division One Court of Appeal’s (and not the trial court’s) imposition
of section 907 sanctions.
