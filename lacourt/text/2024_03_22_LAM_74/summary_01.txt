And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, as well as the defendant's opposition and the plaintiff's reply. However, the motion is "off calendar" because it was withdrawn on January 25, 2024, after being filed on January 24, 2024. The court notes that the plaintiff's account of filing and withdrawing the motion is inconsistent with the record, and that the motion on file with the court is not labeled as an amended or corrected motion. As a result, the court will deny the motion.
