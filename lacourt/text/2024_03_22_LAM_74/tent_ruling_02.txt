Express Corporation v. HT Pet Products, LLC 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for
Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a breach of contract.
            On
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff Morrison Express Corporation (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendant HT Pet Products, LLC (Defendant). The complaint
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2)
breach of oral contract; (3) accounts shared; and (4) quantum meruit.
            On
September 22, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with special interrogatories. 
            On
November 14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel claimed to have not received the
discovery.
            Plaintiff
re-sent the special interrogatories and extended Defendant’s time to respond to
December 14, 2023.
            However,
Defendant did not provide timely responses to the special interrogatories.
            On
January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel the discovery responses.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            This
motion is moot because Defendants served responses to the special
interrogatories on January 19, 2024. However, sanctions are necessary because
Defendant’s failure to respond in time lacked substantial justification. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Plaintiff’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate
is reasonable, and he has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Flashman
Decl., ¶ 7.) But this motion largely duplicates Plaintiff’s prior motion. The
court will adjust the award accordingly.
CONCLUSION 
The
court finds this motion moot. The court grants Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel attorney fees in the sum of
$307.50 within 10 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.Morrison
