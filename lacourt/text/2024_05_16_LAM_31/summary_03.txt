```

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Judgment Debtors' Motion to Seal and Motion to Terminate Royalty Payment. The court finds that the motion to seal lacks merit because Judgment Debtors failed to file a supporting memorandum and did not demonstrate that the requested records meet the requirements for sealing under California Rules of Court. The court also denies the Motion to Terminate Royalty Payment because Judgment Debtors' appeal of the court's May 20, 2022 order is still pending. The court finds that the motion would alter the status quo and affect the effectiveness of the appeal.
