And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling considers the case between Pine Valley and Judgment Debtors, which centers around the alleged reverse engineering of Pine Valley's trade secret. Judgment Debtors claim that the contractors they engaged were successful in reverse engineering the trade secret, but the court does not address whether this has rendered the trade secret invalid. The court notes that Judgment Debtors took measures to shield the trade secret from the contractors, indicating an intention to maintain the integrity of the reverse engineering process. The court does not address the validity of Judgment Debtors' claims about the contractors' success, but rather focuses on the measures taken to protect Pine Valley's trade secret.
