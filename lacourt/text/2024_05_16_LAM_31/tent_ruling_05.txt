MOTION
TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Heidi Lindegaard Brask 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Carmiel
Cohen
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a quiet title action.  On November 22, 2016, Plaintiff Heidi
Lindegaard Brask (formerly known as Heidi Annette Christiansen) filed a Notice
of Settlement of Entire Case.  On January
19, 2017, Plaintiff and Defendant Carmiel Cohen entered into a Settlement
Agreement and Release (the “Agreement”). 
The court dismissed the action pursuant to the Agreement on February 16,
2017.  The parties, who have two children
together, agreed that Defendant was to make child support payments until the
parties’ youngest child turned 18 years of age on July 25, 2021, and to pay
Plaintiff the sum of $600,000.  Within 90
days of July 25, 2021, Defendant was to make an additional payment of  $862,000 for the benefit of the two children.  As security for the payment of child support,
Defendant was to execute a Deed of Trust in the amount of $350,000 on the
property located at 6460 Colgate Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90048 (the “Subject
Property”).  As to the $600,000 payment,
Defendant was to make the payment within 90 days of July 25, 2021.  As security, Defendant was to provide
Plaintiff with a Second Deed of Trust in the amount of $600,000, to be reconveyed
to Defendant upon receipt of the $600,000 payment.  
 
            Defendant’s
obligation to pay the sums of $862,000 and $600,000 to Plaintiff was due on
October 23, 2021.  Defendant did not make
the payments.  As required by the
Agreement, on January 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant a Notice of Default
and Opportunity to Cure.  Under the
Notice, Defendant had 15 days to cure the default.  Defendant did not cure the default.
 
            On February
14, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiff also seeks an award of attorney’s
fees and costs.
            
            Defendant
filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.¿ If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿ 
 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion,
the trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms
of a settlement agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia
Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret
the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182
Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first
establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the
parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court. [Citation.]”¿ (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that
a letter confirming the essential terms of a settlement agreement was not a
“writing signed by the parties” sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
Section 664.6].)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction 
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special proceeding
terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913,
917.)  “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).) 
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under
section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be express, not implied
from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting
Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff references the Agreement as Exhibit 1 but
did not attach it to the motion.  Instead,
Plaintiff sets forth the pertinent contractual language in the body of the
motion.  Although Defendant does not
assert any objections to the language as quoted, the court will continue the
motion to allow Plaintiff to file the Agreement with the court.
 
B. Entry of Judgment 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant has breached three terms of
the Agreement and seeks an order granting relief as set forth in the Proposed
Order.  However, Plaintiff has not filed
the Proposed Order with the court.  For
this reason, and the reason described above, the court will continue the motion
to allow Plaintiff to file the Agreement and the Proposed Order.  The court will nonetheless address the merits
of the motion.
 
According to Plaintiff, Defendant breached the Agreement as
follows:
 
1.     
Failure to make payment of $862,000
for the benefit of the parties’ children, to be deposited with a fiduciary
selected by Plaintiff from the membership roster of the Professional Fiduciary
Association of California (PFAC) within 90 days of Defendant’s last child
support payment;
2.     
Failure to make child support
payments in accordance with the child support agreement between the parties
until the parties’ youngest child turns eighteen (18);
3.     
Failure to make payment of $600,000
to Plaintiff.
 
The child support payments were secured by a Deed of Trust
on the Subject Property in the sum of $350,000. 
The $600,000 settlement payment to Plaintiff was secured by a Second
Deed of Trust to the Subject Property in the sum of $600,000.  Plaintiff appears to seek an order permitting
her to foreclose on the Subject Property.
 
Addressing only one of the three foregoing breaches,
Defendant argues the motion must be denied because he complied with the payment
of $862,000 to the parties’ children.  In
support, Defendant provides his declaration and the declaration of the parties’
son, Max Christiansen Cohen, to argue that he satisfied the $862,000 payment by
transferring his interest in the Subject Property to his son with the consent
and approval of his sister (the parties’ daughter).
 
Given that the Agreement and the Proposed Order have not
been filed with the court, the court defers its ruling to allow the court to
review the Agreement and Proposed Order. 
However, issues related to the appropriate remedy remain.  Plaintiff does not challenge the fact that a transfer
was made.  Plaintiff also does not
challenge the value of the Subject Property, i.e., that the property was worth $862,000,
such that it would satisfy Defendant’s obligation under the Agreement.  If there is a violation of the agreement, what
do the parties propose as the remedy? The court will hear from the parties.
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Given the foregoing, the motion is CONTINUED to June 24,
2024.  Plaintiff is ordered to file and
serve the Agreement and Proposed Order no later than 5 court days before the
hearing.  
 
The court will hear from the parties regarding the issues
noted herein.
 
Moving party to give notice.
