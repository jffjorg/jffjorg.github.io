[1] To clarify, Judgment Debtors
engaged two third-party culinary firms to reverse engineer Pine Valley’s trade
secret.  The contractors, Judgment
Debtors claim, were successful.  The
contractors, and not Judgment Debtors, purportedly reverse engineered Pine
Valley’s trade secret.  Judgment Debtors
further detail how they shielded themselves and Pine Valley’s trade secret from
the contractors to maintain the integrity of the reverse engineering enterprise.  (See Mot. to Terminate Royalty, pp. 4-5; see
also Declaration of Michael Eshaghian.)  However,
for the reasons stated herein, the court does not address whether Judgment
Debtors have demonstrated Pine Valley’s trade secret has ceased to exist
because of Judgment Debtors’ efforts.
