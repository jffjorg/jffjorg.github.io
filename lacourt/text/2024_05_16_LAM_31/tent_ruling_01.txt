I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On February
5, 2024, Plaintiff Excel Adjusters Inc. (“Excel” or “Plaintiff”) filed these motions
to compel Defendant Tigran Petrosyan (“Petrosyan” or “Defendant”) to provide responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and to have Requests for Admission, Set One, deemed
admitted against Petrosyan.  Excel also
seeks sanctions against Petrosyan and his counsel of record.
                                                     
            The motions
are unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely serve responses
waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2033.280, subd. (a).)  A party moving to
compel discovery responses under these statutory provisions is not required to
meet and confer prior to filing the motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko)
(citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted
time’”).)¿¿¿ 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . .
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  In the context of a motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves
for an order compelling Petrosyan to provide responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories and to deem admitted the Requests for Admission.  
 
            It is
undisputed that Plaintiff properly served Petrosyan with the at-issue discovery
requests on September 12, 2023.¿ To date, Petrosyan has not served
responses.  Accordingly, all objections
to the discovery requests are waived. 
Further, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling responses to the
interrogatories and to deemed admitted the requests for admission.
 
             Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Petrosyan.  Given
the Court’s ruling, sanctions are warranted.  In the context of admissions request, they are
mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  Pursuant to Hennings,
supra, imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper
unless counsel shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings,
58 Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet their burden.¿
Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Petrosyan and his counsel of record
in the amount of $1,034.26, consisting of two hours at plaintiff’s counsel
hourly rate and $134.26 in filing fees. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed
motions are GRANTED.  Defendant Tigran
Petrosyan is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiff
Excel Adjusters Inc.’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days of this
order.  Plaintiff Excel Adjusters Inc.’s Requests
for Admission, Set One, is deemed admitted against Defendant Tigran Petrosyan.  
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted.  Defendant
Tigran Petrosyan and his counsel of record are ordered to pay, jointly and
severally, sanctions in the amount of $1,034.26 to Plaintiff, by and through its
counsel within 30 days of this order.
 
            The stay in
this case is lifted pursuant to the court’s orders issued on September 15, 2022
and June 13, 2023.
 
Moving party to give notice.
