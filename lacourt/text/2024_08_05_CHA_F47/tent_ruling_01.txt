SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Maximilian Webb’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2018 Ford F-150 (the Vehicle) on 1/14/19.  Plaintiff alleges that “[d]efects and
nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the applicable express
warranty period, including but not limited to, transmission defects, engine
defects, body defects; among other defects and nonconformities.”  (SAC ¶33). 

 
On 8/16/23, Plaintiff Maximilian I Webb (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendants Ford Motor Company (Ford) and Autonation Ford
Valencia (Autonation) for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(d); (2) Violation
of Civil Code 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3); 
(4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civil
Code 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5); 
(5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment and (6) Negligent
Repair (not alleged against Ford).
 
On 9/18/23, Ford filed and served a demurer to the 1st
– 5th causes of action in the complaint which was set for hearing on
2/2/24.  On 1/22/24, nine court days
before the hearing, Plaintiff filed and served a First Amended Complaint which
rendered the demurrer moot.  See
CCP 472(a); CCP 1005(b).  As such, on
2/2/24, the Court placed the hearing on Ford’s demurrer to the original
complaint off calendar.  (See
2/2/24 Minute Order).  The First Amended
Complaint alleged the same six causes of action as the original complaint.  On 4/19/24, the Court sustained Ford’s
demurrer to the 5th cause of action for fraudulent inducement –
concealment with leave to amend.  (See
4/19/24 Minute Order).  
 
On 5/17/24, Plaintiff filed and served the subject Second
Amended Complaint which alleges the same six causes of action as the original
Complaint and First Amended Complaint.  After
meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Ford had with the 5th
cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment alleged in the Second
Amended Complaint, on 6/25/24, Ford filed and served the instant demurrer to
the 5th cause of action.  On 7/24/24,
Plaintiff filed and served his opposition to the demurrer and on 7/29/24, Ford
filed and served a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer may be based on the ground that the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  CCP 430.10(e).  A demurrer admits the truth of all properly
pleaded facts regardless of how unlikely or improbable they may be.  See Aubry (1992) 2 C4th 962,
966-967; Del E. Webb Corp. (1981) 123 CA3d 593, 604.  Allegations in a complaint must be liberally
construed with a view toward substantial justice between the parties.  CCP 452. 

 
5th Cause of Action – Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment
 
The elements of a fraudulent concealment cause of action
are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact, (2) a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff, (3) intentional concealment or suppression of the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff was
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he/she did if he/she had known
of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiffs sustained damage.  Boschma (2011) 198 CA4th 230, 248.  Additionally, every element of a fraud cause
of action must be alleged with factual specificity.  Cooper (1990) 219 CA3d 1252, 1262; Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  Concealment of
a material fact is actionable when there is a duty of disclosure, which may
arise from a relationship between the parties, such as a buyer-seller
relationship.  Dhital (2022) 84
CA5th 828, 843-844, review granted, citing Hoffman (2014) 228 CA4th
1178, 1186-1187.  In such case, the
plaintiff must describe the content and where the omitted information should or
could have been revealed.  Tapia
(S.D. Cal. 2015) 116 F.Supp.3d 1149, 1163.
 
Plaintiff has still failed to allege with the requisite
particularity the defect in Plaintiff’s vehicle that Ford allegedly concealed.  The Second Amended Complaint, like the First
Amended Complaint, again describes a list of ways in which Ford F-150s
transmissions may be defective and hazardous driving conditions relating
generally to the purported transmission defect but does not state what the
alleged defect is in the Vehicle or otherwise . 
(See FAC ¶¶47, 85; SAC ¶¶48, 82). 
Such allegations are insufficient to support the fraud-based claim.  Santana (2020) 56 CA5th 334, 345.
 
Plaintiff has also still failed to adequately allege where
the omitted information should or could have been revealed by Ford and fails to
identify the requisite representative samples of advertisements, offers, or
other representations by Ford that consumers relied upon to make their
purchase.  Additionally, Plaintiff does
not identify by name who made the alleged omissions when he purchased the
Vehicle. 
 
Even if Plaintiff had pled an identifiable defect in the
Vehicle, Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing Ford had a legal duty to
disclose those facts.  “There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.’”  LiMandri (1997) 52 CA4th 326, 336.  The latter three circumstances presuppose the
existence of some other transactional relationship (i.e., seller and buyer,
employer and prospective employee, doctor and patient, another contractual agreement)
between a plaintiff and defendant giving rise to a duty to disclose.  Id. at 336-337.  Regardless of the circumstances under which a
duty to disclose may arise, Plaintiff must allege facts to show that Ford was
aware of a defect at the time of sale.  Wilson
(9th Cir. 2012) 668 F.3d 1136, 1145.
 
In Dhital, relied on by Plaintiffs, the plaintiffs
alleged that they bought the vehicle at issue from a Nissan dealership, that
Nissan backed the vehicle with an express warranty, and that Nissan’s
authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the sale of the Nissan
vehicles to consumers. See Dhital, supra at 844.  While Plaintiff now alleges that he purchased
the vehicle from Ford’s “authorized retail dealership Galpin Ford, located at
15505 Roscoe Blvd., North Hills, CA 91343,” the Second Amended Complaint does
not specifically allege that Ford’s authorized dealerships are its agents for
purposes of the sale of Ford vehicles to consumers.  (See SAC ¶28 and generally).  Additionally, the warranty contract relied on
by Plaintiff is actually titled “2018 Model Year Ford Warranty Guide” and is
not signed by either party.  (SAC ¶¶27,
29, Ex.A).   Even if the facts alleged are deemed
sufficient to impose a duty of disclosure on Ford, the claim fails for other
reasons.
 
Plaintiff relies on conclusory allegations regarding
Ford’s purported exclusive knowledge of the defects.  (See SAC ¶¶83, 85(b)).  Additionally, the Second Amended Complaint,
like the First Amended Complaint, concedes that Ford issued publicly available Technical
Service Bulletins (TSBs) regarding the alleged Transmission Defect. (FAC
¶¶49-57; SAC ¶¶51-55).  Further, the
issuance of TSBs does not establish Ford’s knowledge of a defect in Plaintiff’s
specific vehicle which was concealed from Plaintiff upon purchase.  See American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
(2011) 199 CA4th 1367, 1378.  
 
As such, it is still not clear what additional
information regarding the transmission in Plaintiff’s vehicle was purportedly
concealed from the dealerships and/or Plaintiff with whom it appears Ford had
no direct interaction.  The claim also
appears to be based, in part, on concealment that allegedly occurred after
Plaintiff purchased the Vehicle.  (SAC ¶84).
 Information allegedly concealed after
the purchase could not have fraudulently induced Plaintiff to purchase the
vehicle.  Plaintiff has still failed to
plead facts to establish active concealment on the part of Ford or partial
representations while suppressing material facts.   
 
Additionally, Plaintiff has still failed to allege
sufficient facts to establish that the fraud claim is not barred by the
“economic loss rule.” “[T]he economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover
in strict products liability in tort when a product defect causes damage to
‘other property,’ that is, property other than the product itself. The law of
contractual warranty governs damage to the product itself.”  Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. (2004) 34
C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez (2002) 29 C4th 473, 482-483.  Based on the allegations in the Second Amended
Complaint, it still appears that the only duty allegedly breached was that
created by the terms of the warranty and the only harm which resulted from Ford’s
alleged concealment was that Plaintiff would not have leased/purchased the
Vehicle.  (See FAC ¶87; SAC ¶¶92-93
(which are duplicative of one another)). 
Plaintiff also does not allege any facts which indicate an intent by
Ford not to perform under the contract so as to fraudulently induce Plaintiff
into purchasing the Vehicle.  See Food
Safety Services (2012) 209 CA4th 1118, 1130-1132.  Rather, the allegations indicate that Ford
has attempted to comply with the warranty contract, but, according to
Plaintiff, has not successfully repaired the problem.  (SAC ¶8).  
 
 As noted in the
Court’s ruling on Ford’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, the holding
in Robinson Helicopter was narrowly limited to “a defendant’s
affirmative misrepresentations on which a plaintiff relies and which expose a
plaintiff to liability for personal damages independent of the Plaintiffs’
economic loss.”  Robinson Helicopter,
supra at 993; See also In re Ford Motor Company Motor Co.
(C.D. Cal. 2020) 483 F.Supp.3d 838, 848, 850.  Here, the fraud claim is based on purported
concealment, not affirmative misrepresentations.  Plaintiff’s reliance on Dhital, supra,
for the proposition that the fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss
rule” is still unpersuasive.  First, Dhital
is still under review by the Supreme Court of California as to the economic
loss rule; therefore, it is not citable.  Second, the Court of Appeal has recently held
that unless there is a specific assertion of agency in the complaint, there is
no showing of agency between Ford and the authorized dealerships.  See Ochoa (2023) 89 CA5th 1324
(review granted 7/9/23).  As noted above,
while Plaintiff alleged that he purchased the Vehicle from an authorized Ford
dealership, Plaintiff has not made sufficient agency allegations. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to the 5th
cause of action is sustained.  While
Plaintiff has requested leave to amend, if the demurrer is sustained, Plaintiff
does not give any indication as to how he can cure the defect in the Second Amended
Complaint as is his burden. See Blank (1985) 39 C3d 311, 318.  Rather, Plaintiff merely states that his
“[c]ounsel would be prepared to discuss any specific deficiencies that the
Court might view as correctible at the hearing.”  (See Opposition, p.14:20-21).  Additionally, Plaintiff has already had three opportunities
to plead his fraudulent inducement – concealment claim and has failed to
adequately do so.  Therefore, leave to
amend is denied.  See Titus
(2004) 118 CA4th 906, 918; Green (1986) 185 CA3d 544, 556.
