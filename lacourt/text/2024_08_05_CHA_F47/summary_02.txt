And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the defendants, Allegiance Gold, LLC, Unik Marketing LLC, Mark Naaman, Assadour Ebkarian, Fred Palmerino, Octavio Rocha, and Monica Ward, seeking an order awarding and fixing the amount of attorneys' fees to which they are entitled as the prevailing parties in this action.

The plaintiff, Shawn Campbell, was a former employee of Unik Marketing LLC who was terminated on September 5, 2023, and signed a Severance Agreement and General Release on the same day. The agreement contained an attorney fee provision that provided for the prevailing party to recover its costs, including attorneys' fees.

The defendants filed a motion for attorneys' fees after the court dismissed the plaintiff's action with prejudice on February 8, 2024. The court found that the defendants are the prevailing parties in this action and are entitled to recover their costs, including attorneys' fees under the contract.

The judge calculated the amount of attorneys' fees incurred by the defendants to be $14,550.00, plus $3,000.00 related to the instant motion, for a total of $17,550.00. The judge awarded the defendants $17,550.00 in attorney's fees.

The judge also warned the defendants that they failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion, which may result in future sanctions if they continue to violate this rule.
