And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the 5th cause of action (fraudulent inducement – concealment) is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Maximilian I Webb, alleged that Ford Motor Company concealed defects in the 2018 Ford F-150 he purchased and fraudulently induced him to buy the vehicle. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to adequately plead the fraud claim, citing insufficient allegations regarding the defect in the vehicle, the duty of disclosure, and the concealment of material facts.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's reliance on the "economic loss rule" was unpersuasive, as the fraud claim was based on alleged concealment rather than affirmative misrepresentations. Additionally, the judge noted that the plaintiff had already had three opportunities to plead the fraudulent inducement – concealment claim and had failed to do so adequately.

As a result, the answer is due within 20 days, and the plaintiff is not granted leave to amend the complaint.
