And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied an application by the defendants to set aside a right to attach order, quash a writ of attachment, and release attached property. The defendants, Noureen Entertainment, Inc. and Zia Abhari, argued that the plaintiff, Centennial VTC LLC, did not provide proper notice of the ex parte application and that there was no exigency for the issuance of the writ of attachment. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did provide proper notice, as evidenced by an email sent to the defendants' counsel, Tyler Vance, on 5/2/24, four court days before the 5/8/24 hearing. Additionally, the judge noted that the defendants failed to challenge the merits underlying the issuance of the writ of attachment in their application. The judge also pointed out that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint was overruled, indicating that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action against the defendants.
