SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendant Noureen
Entertainment, Inc.’s (Noureen) alleged breach of a written lease entered into
with Plaintiff Centennial VTC LLC’s (Plaintiff) predecessor-in-interest for
property located at 24201 W. Valencia Blvd., Suite 101 in Valencia,
California.  (Complaint ¶¶1, 4-6).
 
On 3/7/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Noureen
for breach of lease and against Defendant Zia Abhari (Abhari) for breach of written
guaranty of the lease.  On 4/5/24,
Defendants filed and served a demurrer to the entire complaint.  On 5/2/24, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application for right to attach order and order for issuance of writ of
attachment.  On 5/8/24, the Court granted
the ex parte application and on 5/16/24 a writ of attachment was issued for any
property of Noureen to secure $367,828.17. 
(See 5/8/24 Minute Order; 5/16/24 Writ of Attachment).  
 
On 5/17/24, Noureen filed and served the instant
application for an order setting aside the Right to Attach Order issued on
5/8/24, quashing the Writ of Attachment issued on 5/8/24 and releasing the
attached property of the defendant described in the writ.  On 5/21/24, the Court overruled Defendants’
demurrer to the complaint and ordered an answer to be filed within 30 days.  On 6/28/24, Defendants filed an answer to the
complaint.  On 7/29/24, Defendants filed
a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Valencia Town Center, L.P. and Roes
1-1000.  On 8/5/24, Plaintiff answered
the cross-complaint.  On 11/12/24,
Plaintiff filed and served an opposition to the instant application.
 
ANALYSIS
 
This application is supported solely by the declaration
of Defendants’ counsel, Tyler Vance, who makes the unsubstantiated claim the
that Plaintiff did not provide proper notice of the ex parte application.  Attorney Vance claims that he was served with
notice via email “in violation of rules of court 2.12.04.”  (See Vance Decl. ¶¶4, 9).  First, there is no Los Angeles Superior Court
Local Rule or California Rules of Court, Rule 2.1204.  Presumably, attorney Vance meant to cite
California Rules of Court, Rule (CRC) 3.1204. 
However, CRC 3.1204 does not indicate that email notice is improper or
invalid.  CRC 3.1204 provides: 
 
“(a) Contents of notice
When notice of an ex parte
application is given, the person giving notice must:
(1) State with specificity the
nature of the relief to be requested and the date, time, and place for the
presentation of the application; and
(2) Attempt to determine whether
the opposing party will appear to oppose the application.
(b) Declaration regarding notice
An ex parte application must be
accompanied by a declaration regarding notice stating:
(1) The notice given, including the
date, time, manner, and name of the party informed, the relief sought, any
response, and whether opposition is expected and that, within the applicable
time under rule
3.1203, the applicant informed the opposing party where and when the
application would be made;
(2) That the applicant in good
faith attempted to inform the opposing party but was unable to do so,
specifying the efforts made to inform the opposing party; or
(3) That, for reasons specified,
the applicant should not be required to inform the opposing party.
(c) Explanation for shorter
notice
If notice was provided later than
10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance, the declaration
regarding notice must explain:
(1) The exceptional circumstances
that justify the shorter notice; or
(2) In unlawful detainer
proceedings, why the notice given is reasonable.”
 
Additionally, Plaintiff has presented unrefuted evidence
which shows that the email giving notice of the ex parte application with the
moving papers attached was received and read on 5/2/24, 4 court days before the
5/8/24 hearing.  (See Ibarra
Decl., Ex.1).  
 
Next, attorney Vance contends that the ex parte
application was improperly granted because there was no exigency.  (Vance Decl. ¶¶6, 9).  The granting of the application indicates
that the Court believed sufficient grounds existed to grant the relief on an ex
parte basis.  Even if exigent
circumstances did not exist for ex parte relief, Noureen has failed to
challenge the merits underlying the issuance of the writ of attachment in the
instant application.
 
Further, attorney Vance claims that the demurrer shows
that the complaint lacks the necessary allegations to sustain a cause of
action.  (Vance Decl. ¶¶7, 11).  As noted above, the Court found that the
complaint sufficiently states a cause of action against Defendants when it
overruled their demurrer to the entire complaint.  (See 5/21/24 Minute Order).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The application is denied.
