[Tentative] Ruling: CONTINUE
 
Nicholas Vicente, a minor by and
through his parent, Ani Piliposian, has agreed to settle his claims against
Defendants Artin Sarkissian dba Art In Real Estate and Viking Realty, LLC in
exchange for $4,000.00. 
 
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob.
Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) 
CRC Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be
filed on Judicial Council Form MC-350 and must be fully completed.  Finally, per California Rules of Court, Rule
7.952, Petitioner and Minor Claimant must appear at the hearing. The Court will
require petitioner’s  appearance in order
to grant the petition.
 
Nicholas is to receive $4,000.00.
Defendants have agreed to pay $246,000.00 to Ani Piliposian and Hernan Vicente,
the other named Plaintiffs. 
 
However, the petition was not verified
by petitioner. Moreover, the proof of service does not show service on the
other parties. Instead, it shows service of Plaintiff’s counsel.  Moreover, section 17 is incomplete. Petitioner
contends there is an agreement for services provided (section 17(a)) yet no
agreement was provided and moreover, section 17(f) is blank.
