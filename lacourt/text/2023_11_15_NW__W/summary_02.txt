And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling confirms that the petition to confirm the minor's compromise will be continued. The minor, Nicholas Vicente, has agreed to settle his claims against the defendants, Artin Sarkissian and Viking Realty LLC, in exchange for $4,000.00. The defendants have also agreed to pay $246,000.00 to the other named plaintiffs, Ani Piliposian and Hernan Vicente. However, the petition was not verified by the petitioner, and the proof of service does not show service on the other parties. Additionally, section 17 of the petition is incomplete. The court will require the petitioner's appearance at the hearing to grant the petition.
