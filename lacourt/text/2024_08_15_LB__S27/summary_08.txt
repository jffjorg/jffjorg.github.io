And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case where Mitchell P. Beck, the attorney for Roseanne and Leora Acosta, is seeking to be relieved as counsel due to an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge requires Beck to provide return receipts showing that he confirmed the Plaintiffs' addresses via mail before granting the motions. If Beck fails to provide the receipts, the motions will be denied without prejudice. The judge also notes that confirming addresses via mail does not confirm the address, and only receiving the signed return receipt confirms the address. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court and follow the instructions provided on the court website.
