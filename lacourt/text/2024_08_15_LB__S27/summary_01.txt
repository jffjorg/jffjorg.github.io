Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Hanseo University's motion to amend the judgment to add H2 Link Company as a judgment debtor. The motion is denied for two reasons: first, Hanseo has not served H2, which is a necessary precondition to entry of judgment against it; and second, Hanseo was aware of the alter ego relationship between H2 and Hanseo USA, LLC before judgment was entered and failed to amend its complaint to add alter ego allegations. The judge also notes that Hanseo failed to provide authority permitting amendment of a judgment based on the single enterprise doctrine. The judge is inclined to find that the single enterprise doctrine could support amendment of the judgment to add H2, but notes that no authority specifically on point is provided in the moving papers.
