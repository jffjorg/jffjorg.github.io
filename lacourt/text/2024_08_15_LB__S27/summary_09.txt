And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to RFAs (Request for Admissions) in an uninsured motorist arbitration proceeding. The Petitioner sought a case number to resolve discovery disputes, and the Respondent had objected to several RFAs. The Judge found that the Respondent failed to justify its objections and therefore overruled the objections and granted the motion to compel further responses. The Judge also ordered the Respondent to serve further responses, without objections, within 20 days. Additionally, the Judge awarded the Petitioner sanctions in the amount of $1800 against the Respondent's attorney, as the Respondent did not meaningfully justify its objections to discovery. The parties are also reminded of a post-arbitration status conference scheduled for today.
