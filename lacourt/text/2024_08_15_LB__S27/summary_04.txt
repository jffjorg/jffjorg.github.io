And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the settlement agreement between Mia Helmick, the 13-year-old plaintiff, and Mountain and Sea Educational Adventures, the defendant, in a case involving a severe laceration that required air lifting and extensive medical treatment. The parties have agreed to settle the action, with the defendant paying the plaintiff $125,000, which will be divided among medical expenses, attorneys' fees, costs of suit, and a remaining amount to be placed in a blocked account. The judge finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable and will grant the petition to approve the settlement if the parties appear and testify at the hearing on August 15, 2024. However, the judge requires the parties to provide a proposed order to deposit funds in a blocked account before granting the petition. The parties are also reminded that there is an OSC re: dismissal (settlement) on the same calendar date and that remote appearances are requested.
