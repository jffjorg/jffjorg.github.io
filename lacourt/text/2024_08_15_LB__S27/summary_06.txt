And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a property owner's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure. The defendant has opposed the request, arguing that the plaintiff did not properly serve them with all necessary documents and that the plaintiff has not made payments in the increased amounts required by their loan agreement. The judge has reviewed the evidence and is inclined to keep the injunction in place, requiring the parties to meet and confer to come up with a payment plan for any past-due payments that are genuinely due. The judge has also expressed skepticism about the plaintiff's failure to explain the significant increase in their loan payment from $1144.42 to $1897.54 per month. The parties are required to appear remotely at a hearing on the motion and at a continuing motion calendar scheduled for the same day.
