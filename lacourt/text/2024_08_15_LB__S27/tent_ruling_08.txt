 Case Number:  24LBCV00172    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  S27 Mitchell P. Beck, attorney for Roseanne
and Leora Acosta, seeks to be relieved as counsel, contending an irreconcilable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has occurred such that further
representation is not possible.  
 
Counsel declares he confirmed
Plaintiffs’ addresses by mail, return receipt requested.  The Court wishes to view the return receipts
prior to granting the motions.  The Court
notes that requesting the receipt does not confirm the address; only receiving
the signed return receipt confirms the address. 
If the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs’ addresses were confirmed, the
Court will grant the motions.  
 
If Counsel submits on the tentative
ruling without providing a copy of the receipts, the motions will be denied
without prejudice.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
