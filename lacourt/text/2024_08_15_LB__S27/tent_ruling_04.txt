 Case Number:  23LBCV01599    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Mia Helmick, by and
through her father and GAL, Allan Helmick, filed this action against Defendant,
Mountain and Sea Educational Adventures to recover damages arising out of a
severe laceration that required air lifting and extensive medical treatment.  
 
At this time, the parties have
agreed to settle the entire action.  If
the settlement is approved, Defendant will pay Plaintiff $125,000, of which
$24,474.19 will be used for medical expenses, $31,250.00 for attorneys’ fees,
and $7797.82 for costs of suit; the remaining $61,477.99 will be placed in a
blocked account.  
 
The Court has reviewed the
settlement and finds it is fair and reasonable. 
Pursuant to CRC 7.952, unless their appearance is excused, Plaintiff and
Petitioner must appear at the hearing and testify to the satisfaction of the
Court before the petitions can be granted. 
Plaintiff is 13 years old, and therefore the Court will not excuse her
appearance.  If the Court is satisfied
with all testimony at the hearing, it will grant the petition and sign the
proposed order at the conclusion of the hearing.
 
The Court cannot locate a proposed
order to deposit funds in a blocked account, Judicial Council Form MC-355.  Petitioner must provide this order before the
Court will grant the petition.  
 
The parties are reminded that there
is an OSC re: dismissal (settlement) on calendar concurrently with the hearing
on the petition.  The parties are also
reminded that remote appearances are requested.
