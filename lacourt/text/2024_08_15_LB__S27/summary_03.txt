Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel an inspection of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff had initially refused to provide dates for the inspection until after the motion was filed, and then provided a date very close to the discovery cut-off. The judge finds the plaintiff's behavior to be unreasonable and orders the parties to meet and confer to schedule an inspection forthwith. The judge is hopeful that the parties can resolve the issue in a way that allows the trial date to remain on calendar. If the parties cannot resolve the issue, the judge will briefly continue the trial date to allow the inspection to go forward. The judge notes that the plaintiff's desire to dispose of the vehicle is unclear, as the action has been pending since 2022.
