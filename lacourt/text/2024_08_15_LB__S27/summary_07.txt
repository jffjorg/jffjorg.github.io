And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two demurrers filed by the defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Memorial Health Services, Ali Khoynezhad, M.D., and MemorialCare Medical Group. The demurrers challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Teresa Heim and the Estate of Donald Heim, alleging wrongful death, negligence, corporate negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and survival claims.

The judge notes that a demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings, and that the burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. The judge also notes that the parties must meet and confer in person or by telephone to determine whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.

The judge overrules the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges willful and wanton misconduct, finding that it is a separate cause of action. However, the judge sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges fraud, finding that it is not pled with the requisite specificity. The judge gives the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to cure the defects.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within 20 days, and the defendants to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The judge also orders the parties to give notice.
