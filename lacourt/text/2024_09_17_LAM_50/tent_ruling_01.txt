[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE, TAX, AND
  DISALLOW COSTS
 




 
Background 
Plaintiffs Chuanjie Yang, Ollie Lan aka Ruoning Lan, Yu Xia Lu,
and Liu Liu (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on October 11, 2022
against Defendants Market America, Inc., Market America Worldwide, Inc., James
Howard Ridinger, Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley. The Complaint alleges one
cause of action for declaratory relief. 
On August 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Complaint
(Fictitious/Incorrect Name) substituting the true name “Loren Ridinger, as
Representative of the Estate of James Howard Ridinger” for the name “James
Howard Ridinger” wherever it appears in the Complaint.
On February 22, 2024, an Order Dismissing Action was entered in this
matter. The Court’s February 22, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “on
October 9, 2023 the court entered an order…granting the motion of defendants
Market America, Market Worldwide, Ridinger, and Ashley to dismiss this action
on the ground of forum non conveniens,” and that “[o]n December 18,
2023, the court entered an order granting the motion of defendant Ridinger
Estate to quash service of summons…” The February 22, 2024 Order further
provides that “[t]his action is dismissed in its entirety without prejudice to
the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims,” that “[t]his order shall constitute a
written order of dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 581d,” and that “Defendants, as the prevailing parties on the forum
non conveniens motion and the motion to quash are awarded their costs of suit…”

On February 26, 2024, counsel “[s]pecially appearing as attorneys for
Defendants” filed a notice indicating, inter alia, that “on February 22,
2024 and February 23, 2024, the court entered the attached ‘Order Dismissing
Action’ and related minute orders.” The proof of service attached to the
February 26, 2024 notice states that the notice was served by email on February
26, 2024.  
On March 5, 2024, a Memorandum of Costs was filed by counsel specially
appearing for “Defendants.”  
            Plaintiffs
now move “to strike, disallow, and tax…Defendants Market America, Inc., Market
America Worldwide, Inc., James Howard Ridinger, Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley[’s]
costs in the total amount of $3,465.00…” Specially appearing defendants Market America, Inc., Market
America Worldwide, Inc., Marc Ashley, and Loren Ridinger, individually and in
her capacity as personal representative of the Estate of James Howard Ridinger
(collectively, “Defendants”) oppose. 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b),
“[e]xcept as otherwise
expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of
right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4), “‘[p]revailing party’ includes
the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal
is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any
relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant.” 
As set forth above, February
22, 2024 Order in this action provides that “[t]his action is dismissed in its
entirety without prejudice to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims,” and that
“Defendants, as the prevailing parties on the forum non conveniens motion and
the motion to quash are awarded their costs of suit…” 
Costs recoverable under section 1032 are restricted to those that are both
reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds. (c)(2), (3).) Costs
“merely convenient or beneficial” to the preparation of a case are disallowed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); see Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [expenses for
attorney meals incurred while attending local depositions not “reasonably
necessary”].) 
“A ‘verified memorandum
of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of the items listed on it,
and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to demonstrate that they
were not reasonable or necessary.” (Adams
v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487 [italics and brackets omitted].) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn., supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) Costs otherwise allowable as a matter of
right may be disallowed if the court determines they were not reasonably
necessary, and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost item to an
amount that is reasonable. (See Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245 [finding
that “the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) is to
authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees,
when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily”].)
As discussed, on March 5, 2024, a Memorandum of Costs was filed by
counsel specially appearing for Defendants. The Memorandum of Costs claims a
total of $3,465.00 in costs, which includes $2,415.00 in “[f]iling and motion
fees,” and 1,050.00 in “Court reporter fees as established by statute.” 
In the motion, Plaintiffs first assert that “Defendants have waived
their right to recover any costs because the request was not timely made.”
(Mot. at p. 3:23-24.) Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700, subdivision (a)(1), “[a] prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of
service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days
after entry of judgment, whichever is first…” 
Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants noticed dismissal of Market America,
Inc., Market America Worldwide, Inc., Loren Ridiger, and Marc Ashley, on
February 15, 2024,” and that “Defendants noticed dismissal of Estate of James
Howard Ridinger on December 18, 2023.” (Mot. at p. 4:3-5.) The Court notes that
on February 15, 2024, counsel “[s]pecially appearing as attorneys for
Defendants” filed a notice indicating, inter alia, that “on February 14,
2024, the court entered the attached minute order denying plaintiffs’ motion to
reopen proceedings and/or for reconsideration of the Court’s October 9, 2023
minute order dismissing this action on the grounds of forum non conveniens.”  The proof of service attached to the February
15, 2024 notice states that the notice was served by email on February 15, 2024.

In addition, on December 18, 2023, counsel “[s]pecially appearing as
attorneys for Defendants” filed a notice indicating, inter alia, that “on
December 18, 2023, the court entered the attached minute order granting the
motion of Specially Appearing Defendant LOREN RIDINGER, IN HER CAPACITY AS
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES HOWARD RIDINGER, to Quash
Service of Summons for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction.” The proof of service
attached to the December 18, 2023 notice states that the notice was served by
email on December 18, 2023. 
 Plaintiffs contend that “the
memorandum of costs was not filed within 15 days of the notices of ruling
dismissing the various defendants. The later Order entered on February 22, 2024
is not to be read because the deadline is the earlier of dismissal, which
occurred on December 18, 2023 and February 15, 2024.” (Mot. at p. 4:11-13,
emphasis omitted.) The Court notes that 15 days after February 15, 2024 is
March 1, 2024. In addition, 15 days after December 18, 2023 is January 2, 2024.
As discussed, the subject Memorandum of Costs was filed on March 5, 2024. The
proof of mailing attached to the Memorandum of Costs indicates that the
Memorandum of Costs was served by mail on March 5, 2024. 
In the opposition, Defendants assert that “Defendants timely filed
their Memorandum of Costs within 15 days of when the Court signed and entered
the Order Dismissing the Action on February 22, 2024, and Defendants gave
Plaintiff and filed Notice of such dismissal on February 26, 2024.” (Opp’n at
p. 2:13-15.) The Court notes that 15 days after February 22, 2024 is March 8,
2024. In addition, 15 days after February 26, 2024 is March 12, 2024. The
subject Memorandum of Costs was filed and served before both of these dates, on
March 5, 2024. As discussed, the proof of mailing attached to the Memorandum of
Costs indicates that the Memorandum of Costs was served by mail on March 5,
2024.
As set forth above, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subdivision (a)(1), “[a] prevailing party who
claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the
date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the
date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within
180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first…” 
Defendants note that pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 581d, “[a]ll dismissals ordered by the court shall be
in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action
and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for
all purposes, and the clerk shall note those judgments in the register of
actions in the case.” (Emphasis added.) Defendants note that the Court’s February
14, 2024 minute order denying Plaintiffs’ motion to reopen proceedings and/or
for reconsideration, is unsigned. In addition, the December 18, 2023 minute
order granting “the Estate’s motion for an order quashing service of summons
and dismissing the claims against the Estate” is unsigned. As noted by
Defendants, the February 22, 2024 Order Dismissing Action is signed. Plaintiffs
do not appear to address this point in their reply. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have shown
that the March 5, 2024 Memorandum of Costs was timely filed and served. As
discussed, 15 days after February 22, 2024 is March 8, 2024. In addition, 15
days after February 26, 2024 (the date of Defendants’ notice of the February
22, 2024 Order) is March 12, 2024. As discussed, the subject Memorandum of
Costs was filed and served before both of these dates, on March 5, 2024. 
Lastly, Plaintiffs assert that the “the Court report [sic] fees of
$1,050 should be disallowed because they were not Court ordered.” (Mot. at p.
4:15-16.) As discussed, the Memorandum of Costs claims a total of $3,465.00 in
costs, which includes $2,415.00 in “[f]iling and motion fees,” and $1,050.00 in
“Court reporter fees as established by statute.” Plaintiffs cite to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(5),
which provides that “[t]he following items are not allowable as costs, except
when expressly authorized by law:…(5) Transcripts of court proceedings not
ordered by the court.” 
In the opposition, Defendants cite to Government
Code section 68086, subdivision (d)(2), which provides that “[t]he Judicial
Council shall adopt rules to ensure all of the following:…(2) That if an
official court reporter is not available, a party may arrange for, at the
party’s expense, the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an
official pro tempore reporter. At the arranging party’s request, the court
shall appoint the certified shorthand reporter to be present in the courtroom
and serve as the official reporter pro tempore unless there is good cause shown
for the court to refuse that appointment. The fees and charges of the
certified shorthand reporter shall be recoverable as taxable costs by the
prevailing party as otherwise provided by law.” (Emphasis added.) 
Defendants note that on October 9, 2023, the Court issued a Nunc Pro
Tunc Order providing, inter alia, that “[i]t appearing to the Court that
through inadvertence and/or clerical error, the minute order of 10/09/2023 in
the above-entitled action does not properly reflect the Court’s order. At the
direction of the Judicial Officer, said minute order is corrected nunc pro tunc
as of 10/09/2023, as follows: By adding: Pursuant to Government
Code sections 68086, 70044, and California Rules of
Court, rule 2.956, Kevin Roldan, CSR #13463, certified shorthand reporter
is appointed as an official Court reporter pro tempore in these proceedings,
and is ordered to comply with the terms of the Court Reporter Agreement.” Plaintiffs
do not appear to address Government Code section 68086 or this minute order in
the reply.
In his declaration in support of the opposition, Defendants’ counsel attached
as Exhibit 2 a “true and correct copy of an invoice from First Legal, dated
October 10, 2023, for the court reporters fees of $1,050.00 for the hearing on
October 9, 2023 on the Motion to Dismiss for Forum Non Conveniens.” (Steinberg
Decl., ¶ 4.) Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs
have shown that the court reporter fees of $1,050.00 should be disallowed. 
In light of the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion to
strike, tax, and disallow costs.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiffs’ motion to strike, tax, and disallow costs is denied. 
Defendants are ordered provide
notice of this ruling.¿
