**Tentative Ruling:**

The Court grants Cloud9's motion to strike the punitive damages claims against Cloud9, with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court finds that the Complaint lacks factual allegations to support its claims for punitive damages against Cloud9. Plaintiff has not alleged Cloud9 authorized the actions of Christian Doe, and the Court requires more specific allegations to support a claim for punitive damages.
