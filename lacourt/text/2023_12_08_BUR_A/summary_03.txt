Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, GKGF, LLC, for attorneys' fees against the defendants, Jojos California Family Restaurants, LLC and Coco's Restaurants, LLC. The plaintiff is seeking $64,769.42 in attorneys' fees, while the defendants are disputing the reasonableness of the plaintiff's counsel's hourly rates and hours worked.

The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel has adequately evidenced the reasonableness of their rates, citing industry standards and the complexity of the case. The court also finds that the hours billed for the preparation and filing of motions to compel written discovery, a motion for summary judgment, and a motion for judgment on the pleadings were reasonable.

However, the court reduces the amount of attorneys' fees awarded to the plaintiff by $7,500 because the plaintiff's submissions do not contain an assessment of the actual time spent preparing the instant motion.

In the end, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and awards $57,269.42 against the defendants jointly and severally.
