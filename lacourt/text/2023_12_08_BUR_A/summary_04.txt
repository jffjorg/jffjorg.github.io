And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of 10415 Commerce, LLC (plaintiff) in a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1. The plaintiff had served Form Interrogatories on the defendant, Hratchia Bardakjian, on June 15, 2023, and granted an extension for the defendant to reply until August 1, 2023. The defendant failed to oppose the motion, which the court considers as a consent to the granting of the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for ordering further production, as the current responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 are incomplete and require supplementing to be fully responsive to the request. As a result, the motion is granted, and the defendant is ordered to provide further production within 30 days. The court also declines to issue sanctions, as the plaintiff's counsel only provided an estimate of the amount of attorney time expended in preparing the motion without providing specific details. Finally, the court schedules a case management conference for March 28, 2024, and requires the plaintiff to provide notice unless all parties waive notice.
