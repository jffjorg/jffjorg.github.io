And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for an assignment order filed by Melissa Person, the plaintiff, against Kenneth D. Mathis, the defendant. The plaintiff is seeking an order assigning the rights to payments of real estate salespersons commissions or other payments due to Mathis from The Passman Group, Inc. The defendant does not oppose the motion.

The judge notes that under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 708.510(a), the court may order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or to an appointed receiver all or part of a right to payment due or to become due. The judge also notes that the court may take into consideration several factors when making an assignment order, including the judgment debtor's reasonable requirements, payments the judgment debtor is required to make to satisfy other judgments and wage assignments, the amount remaining due on the judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of the right to payment that may be assigned.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to establish that Mathis may be receiving commission payments from the Passman Group as a real estate salesperson. The judge grants the motion for an assignment order and orders the plaintiff to submit a proposed order for the court's signature.
