Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The plaintiff, Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC, is seeking to reclaim a 2021 Peterbilt 389 tractor truck, VIN 1XPXA48X8MD744303, which is believed to be located at one of four addresses. The defendant, Shane Josef Weber, dba Weber Enterprises, has not opposed the application.

The court finds that the plaintiff has not established probable cause to believe that the property is located at one of the four addresses. The plaintiff has submitted a declaration from Michael Cohen, its Chief Risk Officer, which demonstrates the existence of the Master Equipment Finance Agreement between the parties and the defendant's default under the agreement. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not set forth probable cause to believe that the property is located at one of the four addresses.

The approximate wholesale value of the vehicle is $113,500.00, while the approximate retail value is $144,675.00. The defendant owes $275,825.36, which is more than the market value of the vehicle. Therefore, the court waives the requirement for the defendant to file an undertaking and sets a re-delivery bond of $150,000.00.
