And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to set aside the September 15 order deeming the Request for Admissions (RFA) matters admitted. The defendant's counsel, Arno Keshishian, failed to respond to the RFA due to a spam filter on his email, and the judge finds that this failure was excusable. The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,200 against Keshishian for failing to respond to the RFA. The motion to set aside the September 15 order is granted, and Arutyunyan is ordered to serve responses to the RFA within 20 days. The plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings is moot and off calendar.
