The

to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) notice of intent to appear is
required to argue the demurrer, but not the OSC Re Sanctions.  Unless the
Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling, no argument will be permitted
unless a “party notifies all other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the
court day before the hearing of the party’s intention to appear and
argue.  The tentative ruling will become the ruling of the court if no
notice of intent to appear is received.”

ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Cintarius
Jamal Davis (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, brings this action against the Burbank
Police Department (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges he was arrested and confined
by Defendant and is seeking $60,000,000 in compensation. Defendant now demurs
to the Complaint in its entirety, arguing it states no cognizable cause of
action. Plaintiff has rendered no opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (C.C.P. §
430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Id.)
 
A demurrer assumes the truth of all factual,
material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading. (Blank v.
Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.) No matter how unlikely or improbable,
the plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling
on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.  App. 3d 593, 604.) But this does not include contentions;
deductions; conclusions of fact or law alleged in the complaint; facts
impossible in law; or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take
judicial notice.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at 318.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“C.C.P.”) §§
430.10(e) and (f), the party against whom a complaint has been filed may demur
to the pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or that the pleading is uncertain,
ambiguous and/or unintelligible. It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the
defect can be cured by amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles
(2003) 31 Cal. 4th 1074, 1082.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint is reproduced below in its entirety: 
 
This letter serves as a complaint from Cintarius
Davis to the Burbank Police Department. Cintarius Davis is requesting the
release of information and compensation regarding his confinement and arrest by
the Burbank Police Department in violation of his civil rights. The plaintiff
is seeking monetary compensation for $60,000,000.00 for false arrests,
unreasonable search of his home, wrongful detention, and false imprisonment.
The plaintiff was not made aware of the incidents leading to his arrest nor was
he able to retrieve information regarding the footage of his arrest from the
defendant
 
A
demurrer hearing is concerned only with whether the complaint, as it stands,
regardless of extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) Uncertainty is defined as that which is
ambiguous and unintelligible. (C.C.P. § 430.10.) A demurrer for
uncertainty should be granted “if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.) 
 
Further,
a complaint must “set forth the essential facts of his case with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Ludgate Ins. Co. v.
Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) 
 
Defendant
argues the Complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to state a cause of
action. Defendant further argues it is uncertain from the brief allegations
what Plaintiff’s causes of action are intended to be. Defendant’s counsel submits
that they attempted to address these issues in meet and confer communications.
(Aguado Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant explains that while they do have record of Plaintiff’s
arrest in 2022, they are not sure whether this action is in reference to that
arrest. (Aguado Decl. ¶ 4.) When Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff to explain
the issues, Plaintiff responded by threatening to kill Defendant’s counsel.
(Aguado Decl. ¶5.)  
 
The
Court finds the Complaint does not state a cognizable cause of action or sufficient
facts. While Plaintiff seems to allege a violation of his civil rights, he does
not identify which rights these are or how they were violated. The Court does
find it is possible Plaintiff could amend to add such facts. As such, the
demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days’ leave to amend.
