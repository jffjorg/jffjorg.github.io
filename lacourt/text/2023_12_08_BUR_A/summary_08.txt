And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer filed by the Burbank Police Department in response to a complaint filed by Cintarius Jamal Davis, who is seeking $60,000,000 in compensation for false arrests, unreasonable search, wrongful detention, and false imprisonment. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not state a cognizable cause of action and is unclear about the plaintiff's claims. The court has reviewed the complaint and finds that it does not sufficiently state a cause of action, but grants the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the complaint. The demurrer is sustained, and the case will be continued to January 3, 2024, for further proceedings.
