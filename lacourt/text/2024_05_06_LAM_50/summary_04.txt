And here is a summary in English:

The Judge, Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet, issued a tentative ruling on May 6, 2024, denying the cross-complainants' motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The cross-complainants seek to allege new causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation. The proposed amended cross-complaint seeks to remove certain parties and claims that have been dismissed. The Judge denied the motion due to the cross-complainants' failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), and their failure to show their former counsel's "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect."
