[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



 
Plaintiff Tomas Llamas (“Plaintiff”) seeks
entry of default judgment against Defendants Martin Robles Lopez and Francisca
Montes De Oca aka Francisca Montesdeoca. Plaintiff seeks $2,393.73 in costs and
judgment that “the Covenant and Agreement Regarding Maintenance of Off-Street Parking
Space recorded on August 7, 1959 authorizing three (3) parking spaces on the
servient tenement for use by dominant tenement is extinguished.” (See
Proposed Judgment, Item 7.)
The Court notes a few
defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First,
the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) does not appear to refer to the
declaratory relief requested in the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100). 
Second,
the Declaration of Tomas Llamas in support of the request references a number
of exhibits. (See Llamas Decl., ¶¶ 2-4, 6, 9, 11.) However, no exhibits
are attached to Mr. Llamas’s declaration.
Third,
Plaintiff has not set forth any legal authority for
certain requested costs that are not allowable under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 (i.e., $432.00 in costs for “courtesy
copy/recorder fees.”) (See Request, Item 7(d).) 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice.
The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the
default judgment package.
