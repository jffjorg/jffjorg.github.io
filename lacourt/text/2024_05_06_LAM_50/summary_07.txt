And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court notes that the Plaintiff's opposition did not include separate evidentiary objections. The Court references a previous case, Paragon Real Estate Group of San Francisco, Inc. v. Hansen, which emphasized the importance of public policy considerations in multiparty tort litigation, promoting the maximization of recovery to the injured party, settlement of the injured party's claim, and equitable apportionment of liability among concurrent tortfeasors. The Court also references California Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50, which governs the filing of cross-complaints, and Labor Code section 1132.2, which defines an employer. The Court's tentative ruling suggests that relevant public policy considerations support the Defendant's cross-complaint for equitable indemnity.
