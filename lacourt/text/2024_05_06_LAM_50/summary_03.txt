And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants. The plaintiff, Tomas Llamas, had sought to obtain a default judgment against Martin Robles Lopez and Francisca Montes De Oca for $2,393.73 in costs and judgment. However, the judge found defects in the submitted default judgment package, including an incomplete Request for Court Judgment and a lack of attached exhibits. Additionally, the judge questioned the allowability of certain costs and requested clarification. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and scheduled a meeting to discuss a revised submission.
