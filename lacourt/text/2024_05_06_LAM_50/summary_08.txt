She and her husband purchased the truck, which was taken back and refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. The judge believes her experience will not affect her impartiality. However, parties may file a verified statement of disqualification if they believe the judge is biased. The court hearing on the Case Management Conference is continued to July 8, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
