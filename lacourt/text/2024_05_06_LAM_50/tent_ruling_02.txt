[1]The third cause of action for unjust enrichment is
alleged against all of the defendants.   


[2]As noted by Plaintiff, the Demurring Defendants appear
to mistakenly indicate that they demur to the “entire Third Amended Complaint.”
(See Demurrer at p. 3:7-10.) The memorandum of points and authorities in
support of the demurrer only concerns the third cause of action of the TAC.
Moreover, in the conclusion section of the demurrer, the Demurring Defendants state
that “[i]t is respectfully requested that this Court sustain the demurrer as to
the 3rd Cause of Action without leave to amend.” (Demurrer at p. 10:11-12.)
Thus, the Court overrules any purported demurrer to causes of action other than
the third cause of action of the TAC. 


[3]The TAC defines “Nominal Defendant Lily Bleu, Inc.” as
the “Company.” (TAC, ¶ 2.) 


[4]The Demurring Defendants also appear to assert that
because the causes of action of the TAC incorporate previous paragraphs, striking
paragraph 46 renders the TAC as a whole subject to a motion to strike. (See
Mot. at pp. 4:27-5:1.) The Court does not find that the Demurring Defendants
have provided legal authority to support this proposition. The Court thus
denies the motion to strike the TAC in its entirety. 


[5]As noted by the Demurring Defendants, Plaintiff does
not substantively oppose the arguments made in the motion to strike.  


[6]Only the third cause of action of the TAC is alleged
against all of the defendants. The remaining causes of action of the TAC are
alleged against only Michael Weiss and Barbara Cambilargiu.
