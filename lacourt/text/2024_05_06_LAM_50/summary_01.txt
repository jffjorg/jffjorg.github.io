The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the third cause of action for unjust enrichment should be sustained as to Michael Weiss and Barbara Cambilargiu, but not as to Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jessica Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu, and Good Day Gardena Properties, LLC. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendants were unjustly enriched by the payments alleged, as the payments were allegedly made in the course of their employment and were not unjustly enriched. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are inconsistent and cannot be accepted as true, and that the plaintiff has not shown a better legal or equitable right to the benefits at issue.
