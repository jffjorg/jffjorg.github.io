And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Dr. Nicholas Thaler, Ph.D., who was retained by the plaintiff, Vaneza Alfaro, to assess her injuries. The defendant had served a deposition notice for Dr. Thaler and argued that his deposition was warranted under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450, 2025.480, 1987.1, and 1987.2. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that Dr. Thaler is a retained expert and that his deposition cannot take place prematurely before expert designations, which are not due until January 20, 2025. The judge concluded that Dr. Thaler cannot be compelled to testify at this time and that the defendant will have the opportunity to depose him after the exchange of expert witness information.
