  Case Number:  23AHCV02326    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING  DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF NICHOLAS THALER PH.D.           I.         INTRODUCTION On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff  Vaneza Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Defendant Liliana  Deluca (“Defendant”), alleging injuries resulting from an automobile collision.  Plaintiff retained Dr. Nicholas Thaler, Ph.D. (“Dr. Thaler”), on March 23,  2023, to assess her injuries. On April 16, 2024, Defendant served  a deposition notice for Dr. Thaler, seeking his testimony and the production of  documents. Dr. Thaler’s deposition was scheduled for September 6, 2024.  However, on September 4, 2024, after a dispute over the production of  documents, Plaintiff objected to the deposition proceeding as scheduled. Defendant now moves for the Court  to compel Dr. Thaler’s deposition. Moving Party’s Position Defendant moves to compel the  deposition of Nicholas Thaler, Ph.D., to appear for a deposition and produce  the documents set forth in the subpoena. Defendant contends that the deposition  is warranted under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450, 2025.480, 1987.1,  and 1987.2, as Plaintiff’s counsel has improperly refused to allow the deposition  to proceed despite a properly served subpoena. Defendant argues that Dr. Thaler is  a treating physician that Plaintiff was examined by for psychological issues  before the lawsuit was filed. Plaintiff now seeks to preclude the deposition by  designating Dr. Thaler as a retained expert. Defendant asserts that this is  baseless and meritless. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff waived any  objection to the testimony by failing to timely object.  Opposition Plaintiff opposes the motion on the  grounds that Dr. Thaler is a retained expert, and his deposition cannot take  place prematurely before expert designations, which are not due until January  20, 2025. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210, Plaintiff  asserts that Dr. Thaler’s deposition is premature, as he was retained to form  and express opinions in anticipation of litigation. Plaintiff further contends that  Defendant is seeking an unfair advantage by attempting to depose Dr. Thaler  before Plaintiff has received all relevant information necessary for Dr. Thaler  to form his opinion, specifically the raw data from Defendant's expert, Dr.  Delis. Plaintiff also rebuts Defendant’s waiver argument, stating that just two  days before the scheduled deposition, Defendant notified Plaintiff that the  essential data would not be available. This delayed notification prevented  Plaintiff from making a timely objection, in accordance with Code of Civil  Procedure section 2025.410.  Reply In response, Defendant asserts that  Dr. Thaler is a treating physician and that the lack of exchanged raw data is  irrelevant to the current deposition request. Defendant also highlights that  Plaintiff previously agreed to produce Dr. Thaler for deposition.   II.        LEGAL STANDARD             Code Civ.  Proc. §2025.450 (a) If, after service of a  deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing  agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that  is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection  under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with  it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored  information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party  giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance  and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice. (b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of  the following: (1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good  cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically  stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to  attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored  information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration  stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the  nonappearance. . . . (g)(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the  deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification  or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by  attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in  the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be taken, the court shall  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the  deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.   III.      ANALYSIS Meet and Confer The parties attempted to meet and  confer regarding Dr. Thaler’s deposition on several occasions prior to the  filing of this motion (Opposition, Exh. 2, 3). Initially, Plaintiff agreed to  the deposition under the stipulation regarding the exchange of raw data between  experts. However, as the deposition date approached, Plaintiff withdrew their  agreement, citing the lack of essential raw data from Defendant’s expert, Dr.  Delis (Opposition, p. 3). Despite communications to resolve this issue,  including Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff failed to timely object to the  deposition, the parties could not reach an agreement. Defendant has satisfied  the meet and confer requirements.   Compel Deposition The Court finds that Dr. Thaler  cannot be deposed at this stage in his capacity as a retained expert witness  for Plaintiff. According to the Opposition, Plaintiff retained Dr. Thaler on  March 23, 2023, seven months prior to filing the Complaint on October 23, 2023,  specifically to determine whether Plaintiff sustained a traumatic brain injury  as a result of the collision underlying this matter (Opposition, p. 2). Dr.  Thaler was retained “for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion in  anticipation of litigation or in preparation for the trial" (Opposition,  p. 2). Plaintiff further asserts that  while there was an initial agreement to proceed with Dr. Thaler’s deposition,  this agreement was made under the stipulation regarding Plaintiff’s  neuropsychological examination. Under the stipulation, Defendant’s expert, Dr.  Delis, was required to exchange raw data directly with Plaintiff’s retained  expert, Dr. Thaler (Opposition, p. 3). Plaintiff contends that Dr. Thaler was  retained to provide an expert opinion based on testing, not for treatment  purposes. To date, Plaintiff claims they have  not received Dr. Delis’ report or raw data, despite multiple requests.  Plaintiff argues that the exchange of raw data is essential for the experts to  form fully informed opinions. Furthermore, Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s  motion to compel Dr. Thaler’s deposition seeks to take unfair advantage by  pursuing an unauthorized early deposition of a retained expert while denying  Plaintiff access to the necessary information for a meaningful deposition. Plaintiff also contends that their  delayed objection to the deposition was caused by Defendant’s late  notification, just two days before Dr. Thaler’s scheduled deposition, that Dr.  Delis’ report and data would not be available in time (Opposition, p. 3). Given  these circumstances, Plaintiff maintains that Dr. Thaler’s deposition is  premature. In contrast, Defendant contends  that Plaintiff has previously agreed to Dr. Thaler’s deposition and is now  improperly seeking to delay it by labeling him an expert witness. (Motion pg.  2) Defendant highlights that Dr. Thaler’s designation as an expert should not  shield him from deposition when the information sought pertains to his role as  a treating physician¿. (Reply pg. 1) Defendant also emphasizes that Plaintiff  failed to object to Dr. Thaler’s deposition and as such is required to be  compelled for deposition. (Reply pg, 7-9)  In light of these facts, the Court  concludes that Dr. Thaler, as a retained expert, cannot be compelled to testify  at this time. Defendant will have the opportunity to depose Dr. Thaler after  the exchange of expert witness information. Accordingly, the motion to compel  is DENIED.   IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER             Defendant’s  motion to compel deposition of Dr. Thaler is DENIED. Plaintiff is to give notice.
