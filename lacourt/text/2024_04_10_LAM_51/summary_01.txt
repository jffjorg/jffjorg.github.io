(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.)

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Chris Cowart, alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for filing a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). The defendant, LAC Metro, argued that it had a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Cowart's employment.

The court found that the defendant met its burden of providing a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Cowart's employment. The court noted that Cowart was involved in an accident while driving an LAC Metro bus and that his actions were deemed "unbecoming, unsafe, and a substantial breach of Metro's and the public trust."

The court also found that Cowart failed to provide any evidence that his discharge was more likely to be motivated by discriminatory reasons. Therefore, there was no dispute of material fact as to whether Cowart was subject to retaliation.

The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant had a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Cowart's employment and that Cowart failed to provide any evidence that his discharge was more likely to be motivated by discriminatory reasons.
