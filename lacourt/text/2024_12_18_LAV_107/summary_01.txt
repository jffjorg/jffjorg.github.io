And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Lyft's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The court found that Lyft has met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement exists between itself and the plaintiff, Tammy Annette Gillispie. The arbitration agreement was presented to the plaintiff when she accepted Lyft's Terms of Service, and she was required to click to demonstrate consent and agreement to be bound by the Terms of Service before continuing to use the Lyft app. The court noted that the arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and Delaware law, and that it is valid and enforceable. As a result, the court has stayed litigation pending arbitration.
