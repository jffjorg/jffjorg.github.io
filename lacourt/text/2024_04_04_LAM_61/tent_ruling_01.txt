Defendant to provide notice.
 
I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that the
responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding party
asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
Plaintiff Sylvia Santiago moves to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Four, Nos. 151–156, 158,
161–164, 166, and 176–183. These interrogatories asked Defendant Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals (Defendant) to “identify” various individuals, with
“identify” meaning to state “the full name, address, telephone number, job
title, department they worked in, and dates of employment of the individual or
entity and the place of incorporation of the company, and the address of the company's
principal place of business if applicable.” (Mohrsaz Decl. Exh. 1.) Interrogatory
No. 183, the sole exception to this pattern, asked Defendant to state, for each
person so identified, what information Defendant believes they have relating to
Plaintiff’s claims. Defendant offered objections in response. (Separate
Statement.)
 
Defendant in opposition claims to have served
supplemental responses as of February 14, 2024, in keeping with the parties’
meet-and-confer correspondence preceding the present motion. (Opposition at pp.
4–5.)
 
Plaintiff in opposition contends that the
responses remain insufficient for the following reasons:
 
·        
Defendant
failed to provide contact information for Interrogatories No. 152, 153, 155,
156, 164, 166, and 181, for which the individuals were identified as former
employees of Defendant;
·        
Defendant
stated that it does not know of the individuals identified in Interrogatories
No. 154, 161, 179, and 182, when evidence produced suggests they possess such
knowledge;
·        
Defendant
stated in response to Interrogatories No. 162, 163, and 180 that the
individuals could be contacted through the United Nurses Association of
California, without providing contact information.
 
(Reply at pp. 3–4.)  
 
From the above, no further response is needed
as to Interrogatories No. 151, 158, and 176–178. Moreover, although Plaintiff
contends that Defendant ought to have information related to the individuals
presented in Interrogatories No. 154, 161, 179 and 182, Plaintiff presents no
evidence upon which this argument is based. No further response is needed as to
Interrogatory No. 183, because although Plaintiff argues that Defendant is
feigning ignorance of certain individuals as a means of evading discovery, no evidence
is presented on this point. The motion is therefore DENIED as to
Interrogatories No. 151, 154, 158, 161, 176–179, 182, and 183.
 
Additionally, no further response is required
as to Interrogatories No. 155 and 156, as Defendant’s responses indicate that
the individuals identified were never in its employ. (Supp. Semmer Decl. Exh.
C.) Likewise, no further response is necessary for Interrogatories No. 163 and
180, as Defendant indicated that these were current employees who could be
contacted through counsel, as provided in the parties’ prior meet-and-confer
correspondence. (Ibid.; Mohrsaz Decl. Exh. 4.)
 
But further responses are warranted as to
Interrogatories No. 152, 153, 162, 164, 166, and 181. Defendant indicated as to
these responses that these were former employees, but did not provide contact
information as required by the interrogatory. The motion is therefore GRANTED
as to these requests.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $6,560.00 in sanctions, representing ten
hours of attorney work at $650 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (Mohrsaz Decl.
¶ 16.)
 
No sanctions are awarded, as Defendant opposed the motion
with substantial justification. The parties reached an agreement as to the
desired character of Defendant’s responses on December 26, 2023. (Mohrsaz Decl.
Exh. 4.) Plaintiff followed up this agreement with a short follow up email on
January 4, 2024, to which Defendant’s counsel did not respond before the motion
was filed on January 11, 2024. (Mohrsaz Decl. ¶¶ 10–11.) Defendant should have
responded, but a modest amount of additional follow-up could have obviated the
need for the motion, as shown by the supplemental responses that Defendant
provided more than a month before it filed its opposition.
