Judge's Tentative Ruling: Armen Ambarachyan's Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.

The Judge rules that Armen Ambarachyan's motion for reconsideration is defective due to lack of proof of service and lack of entitlement to reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure § 1008. The Judge finds that the defendant's motion is based on the court's prior ruling on the demurrer, which was issued a month before the ruling on the defendant's motion for sanctions and was within the contemplation of the court and parties at the time. The Judge concludes that the defendant advances no "new or different facts" upon which to base the request for reconsideration.
