The judge grants Plaintiff Sylvia Santiago's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, setting aside certain interrogatories for which Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals failed to provide contact information. The motion is denied as to other interrogatories for which Defendant provided sufficient responses. The judge finds that Defendant's opposition to the motion was substantial and justifies the denial of sanctions.
