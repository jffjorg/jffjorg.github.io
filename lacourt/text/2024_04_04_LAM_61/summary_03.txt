Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by the judge grants a defendant's motion to compel arbitration in a case involving Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc. (SLSS) and plaintiff Fernando Velez Rojas. SLSS seeks to compel arbitration of Rojas' claims against it, citing an arbitration agreement executed on November 5, 2019. Rojas contests the agreement, alleging it was fraudulently induced and unconscionable. The judge finds that the agreement is valid and enforceable, despite Rojas' contentions. The judge also rejects Rojas' arguments that the agreement is unconscionable due to its incorporation of American Arbitration Association (AAA) discovery rules, which permit the arbitrator to order discovery as necessary to a full and fair exploration of the issues in dispute. The judge concludes that the AAA discovery rules are not unduly restrictive and do not render the agreement unconscionable.
