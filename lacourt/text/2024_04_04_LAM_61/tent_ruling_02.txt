 Case Number:  22STCV02561    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  61 Defendant
Armen Ambarachyan’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
I.       MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
Code Civ. Proc. § 1008 is the
exclusive means for seeking reconsideration of an order or renewing a
motion.  (Kerns v. CSE Ins. Group (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 368, 384.)  The application to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order must be made within 10 days after
service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order to the same
judge or court that made the order.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008(a).) A motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the
party moving for reconsideration can offer “new or different facts,
circumstances, or law” which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion.  (Id.)
There is a strict requirement of diligence - i.e., the moving party must
present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence or
different facts earlier.  (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 690.) “The burden under section 1008 is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior
Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212–13.)
Defendant Armen Ambarachyan
(Defendant) seeks reconsideration of this court’s order of January 4, 2024
order denying his prior motion for sanctions. Defendant bases the present
motion on this court’s ruling of December 7, 2023, sustaining Defendant’s demurrer
to the second and third causes of action contained in the First Amended
Complaint (FAC).
The motion is doubly defective.
First, although the motion is unopposed, it is unaccompanied by any proof of
service.
Second, Defendant shows no
entitlement to reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure § 1008. Defendant
cites this court’s December 7, 2023 order on its demurrer, but this order was
issued a month before the ruling on Defendant’s motion for sanctions, and was
within the contemplation of the court and parties at the time. Defendant
advances no “new or different facts” upon which to base the request for
reconsideration.
The motion is therefore DENIED.
