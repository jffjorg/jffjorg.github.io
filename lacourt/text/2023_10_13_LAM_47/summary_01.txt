English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Avraham Bibi's motion to compel production of documents from Defendants Eydan Berger and Revital Agi in accordance with their statements of compliance. The Court orders Defendants to produce all non-privileged, responsive documents that have not already been produced within 20 days of the order. The Court also orders Defendants to serve an amended, verified, code-compliant statement of compliance stating that they have produced all responsive, non-privileged documents in their possession, custody, or control, and to provide a privilege log if any documents are withheld on the basis of privilege. The Court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendants and their counsel.
