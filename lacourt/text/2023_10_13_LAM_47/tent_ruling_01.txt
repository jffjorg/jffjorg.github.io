DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Production of Documents From Eydan
Berger in Accordance with Statement of Compliance
 
Plaintiff moves to compel
production of documents from Defendant Eydan Berger in accordance with a
statement of compliance with Requests for Productions Nos. 1-3, 5-6, 8-27, 29-31,
34-39, 45-60, 62, 65-66, 68-85, and 89-92.
 
Analysis
 
A motion to compel compliance
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.320 does not have a 45-day
time limit; nor does it contain a meet and confer requirement or a good cause
requirement. This type of motion is only proper where the responding party
represented in its response that it would comply with the request for
production and failed to do so. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.320(a).) A proper
response to a request for production is “[a] statement that the party will
comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling” by the date set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section
2031.030(c)(2) (within a reasonable time, at least 30 days after service of the
demand).
 
Plaintiff served the Requests for
Production on Defendant on January 13, 2023, seeking various records pertaining
to the parties’ business dealings. (Declaration of Joel G. Weinberg ISO Mot. ¶
2 Exh. 1.) Defendant served initial responses on March 16, 2023, asserting
numerous objections to the Requests, with particular emphasis on the purported
ambiguity of the terms used. (Id. ¶ 3, Exhs. 2-3.) Amended Responses
were served on June 22, 2023, which state in connection with the Requests at
issue that Defendant “will produce responsive, relevant, non-privileged
documents in Defendant’s possession, custody, or control.” (Id. ¶ 9,
Exhs. 9-10.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant states
that responsive documents were produced between August 8 and 9, 2023, after
this motion was filed. (Declaration of Ryan Davis ISO Opp. ¶ 12.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff expresses concern
that Defendant did not produce all responsive documents. For example, Plaintiff
states that Defendant Berger did not produce any emails or messages between the
various Defendants regarding any of the various business dealings, even though
it is likely that such materials should exist and would be responsive to, for
example Requests 36-39 and 55-60. (See Weinberg Decl. Exh. 1 Nos. 36-39,
55-60.) Moreover, Plaintiff observes, correctly, that Defendant’s statements of
compliance do not strictly conform with the Code of Civil Procedure because
they do not state that Defendant has produced all responsive documents in
Defendant’s possession, custody, or control, nor do they clearly state if only
partial production is being made, and the reasons for doing so. (See generally Weinberg
Decl. Exh. 9.) Plaintiff requests that the Court require Defendant to either
produce all responsive documents or provide an amended verified statement of
compliance stating that all responsive documents have been produced. The Court
finds this to be an appropriate resolution to the dispute. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will order
Defendant to produce all responsive, non-privileged documents responsive to
these requests that have not already been produced, if any, and to provide an
amended verified statement of compliance stating that all responsive documents
have been produced. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel in the amount of $6,077.50 jointly
and severally.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.320(b), subject to exceptions not relevant here, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.320(b).)
 
            The Court
is not inclined to award sanctions where, as here, the party against whom the
sanctions are sought has not meaningfully opposed the motion but rather has
provided responsive documents pursuant to the statement of compliance.
Accordingly, the Court finds that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust
in this instance. 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Production of Documents from Eydan Berger in Accordance with Statement of
Compliance is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to produce all non-privileged, responsive documents that have not
already been produced within 20 days of this order. Defendant is also ordered
to serve an amended, verified, code-compliant statement of compliance which
states that Defendant has produced all responsive, non-privileged documents in
Defendant’s possession, custody, or control, and to provide a privilege log if
any documents are withheld on the basis of privilege. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Motion to Compel Production of Documents From Revital
Agi in Accordance with Statement of Compliance
 
Plaintiff moves to compel
production of documents from Defendant Revital Agi in accordance with a statement
of compliance with Requests for Productions Nos. 1-3, 5-6, 8-27, 29-31, 34-39,
45-60, 62, 65-66, 68-85, and 89-92.

even though it is likely that such materials should exist and would be
responsive to, for example Requests 36-39 and 55-60. (See Weinberg Decl. Exh. 1
Nos. 36-39, 55-60.) Plaintiff also states that Defendant Agi did not produce
balance sheets or income and expense statements after July 31, 2022, even
though, by October of 2023, some records for the second half of 2022 and beyond
should exist. (See Declaration of Joel G. Weinberg ISO Reply ¶ Exhs. 4-5.) Moreover,
Plaintiff observes, correctly, that Defendant’s statements of compliance do not
strictly conform with the Code of Civil Procedure because they do not state
that Defendant has produced all responsive documents in Defendant’s possession,

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
