DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories – Employment (Set One)
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment Nos.
201.1, 201.6, 206.2, 209.2, 211.1, 216.1, and 217.1. propounded to Defendant Bar-Ray
Products, Inc. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Meet and
Confer
 
A party making a
motion to compel further responses must include a declaration stating facts
showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues
presented by the motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2030.310(b).) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states
that she met and conferred extensively with Defendant’s counsel via telephone
and email between January 4, 2023 and August 11 2023 regarding the disputed
discovery responses, to no avail. (Declaration of Rachel Sauer ISO Mot. ¶¶15-34
Exhs. 13-31.) The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has made a reasonable
and good-faith attempt to resolve the issues presented informally. 
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Here,
the responses were served on Plaintiff on December 21, 2022. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 14,
Exh. 12.) The parties agreed in writing to several extensions of the deadline
to file a motion to compel further responses, with the final agreement setting
the deadline at September 18, 2023. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 34, Exh. 31.) The instant
motion was served and filed on September 15, 2023. The motion is therefore
timely. 
 
Waiver of
Objections
 
            As a preliminary matter, the
undisputed facts show that these interrogatories were served on Defendant on
June 6, 2022, and that Defendant did not respond before the statutory deadline
of July 27, 2022. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) Accordingly, by operation of Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), all objections were waived. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(a).)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatories - Employment Nos. 201.1, 201.6, 206.2, 209.2,
211.1, 216.1, and 217.1. propounded to Defendant Bar-Ray Products, Inc. 
 
1.     
Form Interrogatory No. 201.1
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 201.1 asks if the respondent’s employee was involved in a
termination, and demands all reasons for that termination, the contact
information of every person who participated in that decision, the contact
information of every person who provided information relied upon in that
decision, and the identity of all documents relied upon in that decision. (See Sauer
Decl. Exh. 1. No. 201.1.) Defendant responded to this interrogatory in the
affirmative, stated that the reason for the termination was that Plaintiff’s
position as eliminated because of sales territory realignment, and identified
two individuals responsible and with relevant information, John More and
Anthony Caggiano, who may be contacted through Defendant’s counsel of record.
(Sauer Decl. Exh. 12 No. 201.1.) Defendant did not identify specific documents
relied upon, merely stating that “sales and account data for sales territories”
were relied upon. (Id.) 
 
Plaintiff
contends that Defendant’s response is inadequate and evasive because it does
not provide the contact information of the named witnesses and does not
identify any specific documents relied upon. In opposition, Defendant contends
that no contact information was provided because Mr. Moore is a current
employee of Defendant Burlington Medical, Mr. Caggiano is a former employee of
Burlington, and therefore no further response is required. With respect to Mr.
Moore, the Court agrees that this response is sufficient, since, as an employee
of a named party in this action, he may be contacted through that party’s
counsel. However, the response as to Mr. Caggiano is insufficient and evasive. As
a former employee, Mr. Caggiano is not represented by Defendants’ counsel in
any capacity and cannot be contacted through Defendants’ counsel. Defendant
cites no authority standing for the position that a party may not seek the
basic contact information of a witness, and, in any event, Defendant has waived
all objections by its failure to serve timely responses. 
 
The
Court is similarly unpersuaded by Defendant’s assertion that a vague statement
of “sales and account information for sales territories” is sufficiently
responsive to this request. Although Defendant is correct that a description of
a document is not only sufficient, but necessary to properly respond to this
interrogatory, (see Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th
285, 293), “sales and account information for sales territories” can hardly be
considered a meaningful description of responsive documents. Plaintiff is
therefore entitled to an order compelling a further response to this request.
 
2.      Form
Interrogatory No. 206.2-206.3
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 206.2 seeks the contact information of any agent or employee who
responded to any inquiries regarding their former employee (i.e., Plaintiff)
after that employee’s termination. (Sauer Decl. Exh. 1. No. 206.2.) No. 206.3
asks for the contact information of the recipient of any post-termination
statement published about the employee by the employer, and the substance of
those statements. (Id. No. 206.3.) Defendant refused to respond to these
interrogatories, claiming that they were not applicable because they were
categorized under “defamation,” which is not a claim Plaintiff has alleged. (Id.
Exh. 12. No. 206.2.) Plaintiff concedes that she has not brought a claim for defamation
but argues that these interrogatories are relevant to Plaintiff’s claims for
failure to prevent, retaliation, failure to pay commission wages, and failure
to provide employment records, but offers no explanation for the relevance of
these interrogatories to this action. As the interrogatories do not appear on
their face to be applicable to this action, the Court is not persuaded that
further responses are required. 
 
3.      Form
Interrogatories Nos. 201.6 209.2, 211.1, 216.1, and 217.1
 
Defendant
states in its opposition that it agrees to provide further responses to these
form interrogatories as demanded by Plaintiff. Plaintiff is therefore entitled
to an order compelling further responses to these requests. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff also requests sanctions
against Defendant and/or its counsel in the amount of $3,277.50. 
 
            Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.) Under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subd. (a), “[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of
this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
            Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c); 2030.300(d).) However, sanctions
are not mandatory if the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Id.)
 
Here,
as neither party fully prevailed on the motion to compel further responses,
neither party is entitled to sanctions. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories –
Employment (Set One) is DENIED IN PART as to Interrogatory Nos. 206.2 and 206.3
and otherwise GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production (Set Two)
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) propounded to Defendant Bar-Ray
Products, Inc. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
The Declaration of Rachael Sauer
provides extensive documentation of the parties’ meet and confer efforts
between May 17, 2023 and August 11, 2023. (Declaration of Rachel Sauer ISO Mot.
¶¶ 3-15; Exhs. 3-14.) The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has satisfied
the statutory meet and confer obligations. 
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further responses
to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Defendant responded to the Requests
for Production at issue on May 17, 2023. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2.) The parties
agreed to multiple extensions to the deadline to file this motion, with the
final deadline being September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶ 15, Exh. 14.) This
motion was filed on September 15, 2023, and served on September 14, 2023. The
motion is therefore timely. 
 
Good Cause
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production Nos. 60 and 61.
 
Requests Nos. 60 and 61 seek
documents and communications, respectively, pertaining to age discrimination
complaints or lawsuits against any company affiliated with Murray Pitts. (See
Sauer Decl. Exh. 1.) Mr. Pitts is alleged to be the CEO of Bar-Ray and Burlington,
(Complaint ¶ 11), and Plaintiff argues that this discovery is relevant to show
a pattern and practice of discrimination and to elicit me-too evidence. Implicit
in Plaintiff’s contention is the argument that Mr. Pitts cultivated an
atmosphere of discrimination which pervaded every firm with which he has been affiliated.

 
“Me-too” evidence of other
individuals who have been subjected to sufficiently similar discrimination or
harassment is discoverable. (See Pantoja v. Anton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
87, 89; see also McCoy v. Pacific Maritime Assn. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th
283, 296-98.) In opposition, Defendant argues this discovery is not
relevant—and thus, implicitly, that there is no good cause for production of
these documents—because it falls outside the scope of “me-too” evidence as it
seeks evidence of conduct by non-parties, not by a defendant. In reply,
Plaintiff argues that this evidence is relevant because it seeks evidence of a
pattern and practice by Defendant Fox Three Partners of bringing Mr. Pitts in,
as an agent, to newly acquired companies and thereafter eliminating older
employees through him. In this framing, Plaintiff is arguably seeking evidence
of other individuals who have been subjected to sufficiently similar
discrimination by a named Defendant who was her ultimate employer. The Court
therefore finds on this basis that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for
these requests. 
 
Defendant’s Responses
 
Defendant responded to both of the
discovery requests at issue with a series of objections, asserting that they
were vague and ambiguous as to “complaints and affiliated with,” overbroad,
unduly burdensome, and harassing and oppressive as to scope and time, seeks irrelevant
information not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence, seeks
privileged, private, confidential and/or proprietary information, seeks documents
equally available to plaintiff, and seeks discovery relating to nonparties through
Defendant. (Sauer Decl. Exh. 2.)
 
The Court agrees with Defendant
that the requests are overbroad on their face. Although Plaintiff demonstrated
a framing under which the requests are relevant, the requests also provide
absolutely no temporal limitation and do not define the phrase “affiliated with,”
which may also have an unreasonably broad meaning. Although, in context, it is
readily apparent that Plaintiff is seeking complaints from other firms where Mr.
Pitts served as CEO, no such deduction can be made to narrow the scope of the
requests as to time. Plaintiff does not directly address these objections, nor
does she provide a narrower framing of the requests which would correct these
defects. In light of Plaintiff’s failure to substantively respond to this
argument, the Court finds that Plaintiff is not entitled to an order compelling
further responses on this basis. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions in connection with this motion. However, as Plaintiff is not
the prevailing party, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment (Set One) is DENIED IN
PART as to Interrogatory Nos. 206.2 and 206.3 and otherwise GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
