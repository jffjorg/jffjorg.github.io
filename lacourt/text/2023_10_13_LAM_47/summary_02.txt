Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies in part and grants in part Plaintiff Molly Steele's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production. The judge finds that Defendant Bar-Ray Products, Inc.'s responses to interrogatories Nos. 206.2 and 206.3 are evasive and incomplete and orders further responses. The judge also finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for further responses to requests for production Nos. 60 and 61, but denies the motion due to the overbreadth of the requests.

The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that neither party fully prevailed on the motion to compel further responses. The judge orders the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling and allows for further submissions.
