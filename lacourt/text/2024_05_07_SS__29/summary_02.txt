And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motions to compel the depositions of the plaintiffs. The defendants have noticed the depositions of the plaintiffs three times, but the plaintiffs did not serve a timely objection and did not appear for the depositions. The judge finds that the defendants have satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for their motions, and the plaintiffs have not filed any opposition. The judge grants the motions to compel and orders the plaintiffs to appear for deposition and give testimony under oath. The judge also grants the defendants' requests for sanctions in the amount of $530.
