And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial due to good cause. The defendant has shown that it has not been able to obtain necessary testimony, medical records, and witness statements, and that the plaintiff has not agreed to examinations and has not provided contact information for non-party witnesses. The court finds that the defendant has been diligent in obtaining discovery but has been unable to complete it. The trial is continued to late February 2025, and all deadlines are reset.
