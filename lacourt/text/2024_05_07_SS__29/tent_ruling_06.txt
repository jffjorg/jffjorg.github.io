 Case Number:  22STCV00277    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for an Order of Contempt against Keilani Todd
filed by Defendants 25 Art, LP, and Frederick Leeds.
 
Tentative
The motion for an order of contempt is
denied, without prejudice, on procedural grounds.
Background
On January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Lester Jimenez (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action
against Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved, and Does
1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability.
Plaintiff alleges that he was seriously injured when he fell down a flight of
stairs on a fire escape attached to a building on South Hobart Boulevard in Los
Angeles, California, that is owned, operated, managed, or controlled by Defendants.
 
On
March 25, 2022, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved filed an
Answer to the Complaint. On the same day, they filed a Cross-Complaint for
indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief against Roes 1 through 25. 
On
April 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to named Fred Leeds Properties,
an unknown entity, as Doe 1, and Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP as Doe 2.

On
May 3, 2023, Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP, filed an Answer to the
Complaint, on its own behalf and as an entity erroneously named as Fred Leeds
Properties. 
On
July 18, 2023, Plaintiff named Olga Avalos as Doe 3. Defendant Avalos filed an
Answer on August 30. 
On
August 14, 2023, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved amended
their Cross-Complaint to name Sharol Batres as Roe 1. On September 1, they
filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (the “FACC”). The FACC includes, as the
Fourth Cause of Action, a claim against Batres and Roes 2 through 10 for breach
of lease agreement/contract.  Batres
filed an Answer on December 15, 2023.
As
is relevant to the matter set for hearing on May 7, 2024, Defendants 25 Art,
L.P. and Frederick Leeds (collectively, “Defendants”) served non-party witness Keilani
Todd (“Todd”) with a deposition subpoena on October 29, 2023.  She did not appear for her deposition.  On March 5, 2024, the Court issued an order
compelling Todd to appear for deposition on March 21.  (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Defendants served a notice of ruling on Todd
by mail on March 6.  (Id., ¶ 3
& Exh. B.)  Todd did not appear for
deposition, as ordered, on March 21.  (Id.,
¶¶ 4-5 & Exh. C.)  
On April
5, 2024, Defendants filed this motion for an order of contempt. No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The following acts
or omissions in respect to a court of justice, or proceedings therein, are
contempts of the authority of the court: . . . (5)¿Disobedience of any lawful
judgment, order, or process of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1209, subd. (a)(5).)
“When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the
court or judge, a warrant of attachment may be issued to bring the person
charged to answer, or, without a previous arrest, a warrant of commitment may,
upon notice, or upon an order to show cause, be granted . . . .” (Code Civ.
Proc. §¿1212.)  
 
“The facts essential
to establish jurisdiction in the contempt proceeding are: (1) the making of the
order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability of the accused to render
compliance, and (4) willful disobedience of the order.” (Application of Ny¿(1962)
201 Cal.App.2d 728, 731.) “All elements of charged contempt must be averred in
affidavit of accuser and must be developed in the proofs.” (Id.) The
party seeking to have a person held in contempt has the burden of proving the
ability to comply beyond a reasonable doubt. (Application of Liu¿(1969)
273 Cal.App.2d 135, 141-42; In re Cassil¿(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1081,
1087.) 
 
Discussion
 
Contempt proceedings
are different from, and require far more procedure than, a standard
law-and-motion matter.  Because a
contempt places a person’s liberty at issue, these procedures must be strictly
followed.
 
The alleged contempt
at issue is an indirect contempt.  In
general, the first step in an indirect contempt proceeding is an application
for an issuance of an Order to Show Cause. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211, subd. (a).) 
The application must be supported by an affidavit or declaration that
sets forth the facts of the alleged contempt, and the moving party must submit a
proposed order (the proposed OSC re Contempt). 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211-1211.5; 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial [2023], ¶¶ 9:713-714.1.)  The application may be made through the ordinary
procedures for an ex parte application (including ex parte notice to opposing
counsel).  (2 Weil & Brown, supra, ¶ 714.2.)
 
If the application is
granted, the Court will then issue an OSC re Contempt that, among other things,
describes the alleged contempt and sets the date and time for a hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1212; 2 Weil & Brown,
supra, ¶ 9:715.)  (The Judicial Council
has published an OSC re Contempt form for use in family law cases; although
that form is not used in civil law cases, it may provide some guidance to
counsel in how to prepare an OSC re Contempt in a civil law matter.)  The moving/citing party must then serve the
OSC re Contempt and supporting affidavits/declarations on the cite/respondent
in the same manner as a service of summons – usually personal service.  (Lund v. Super. Ct. (1964) 61 Cal.2d
698, 713; Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v. Super. Ct. (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286.)
 
At the date and time
set for hearing, the citee will be arraigned; the arraignment generally
includes (among other things) advisements of the charges against the citee and the
rights of the citee, including the right to counsel.  Most commonly, at the arraignment, the matter
is set for an evidentiary hearing, or trial, on a future date.  
 
There is no right to
a jury trial in civil contempt proceedings, even though such proceedings may
result in a fine or imprisonment.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1209.)  The citor/moving
party has the burden of proof and is held to a standard similar to that of a
prosecutor in a criminal proceeding.  The
citee is presumed innocent, and the proof of the contempt must be beyond a
reasonable doubt.
 
Here, Defendants have
not followed these procedures in filing this motion for contempt.  Accordingly, the motion for contempt is
denied, without prejudice, on procedural grounds.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court DENIES, without prejudice, Defendants’ motion for an order of contempt.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
