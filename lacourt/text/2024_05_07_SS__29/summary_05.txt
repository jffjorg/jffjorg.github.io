And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial to October 7, 2024. The defendant, Angelica Bianca Diaz, argued that despite reasonable diligence, she was unable to obtain essential testimony, documents, and other material evidence due to Plaintiff Smith's failure to cooperate in scheduling a deposition. The judge found that there is good cause to continue the trial, as the defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff Smith's deposition is scheduled after the original trial date of June 6, 2024. The judge also considered that the defendant would suffer prejudice if not granted sufficient time to litigate the matter. The trial date is now continued to October 7, 2024, and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
