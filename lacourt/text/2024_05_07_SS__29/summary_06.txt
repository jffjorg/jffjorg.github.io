And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for an order of contempt filed by the defendants, without prejudice, on procedural grounds. The defendants had sought to have Keilani Todd held in contempt for failing to appear for deposition and failing to comply with court orders. However, the defendants failed to follow the proper procedures for bringing a contempt proceeding, including filing an application for an order to show cause and serving the necessary papers on the respondent. As a result, the court did not have jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the contempt motion. The judge noted that contempt proceedings are different from and require more procedure than standard law-and-motion matters, and that the defendants' failure to follow the proper procedures meant that the motion for contempt was denied.
