  Case Number:  19STCV11835    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion for Terminating Sanctions, or in the
Alternative Issue and Evidence Sanctions, and for Monetary Sanctions
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted in part and denied in part.
 
Background
This case arises
from a fall that allegedly occurred at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on April
12, 2017.  Plaintiff Samuel Aurebach
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 5, 2019, asserting a premises
liability cause of action against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”)
and Does 1 through 50.  CSMC filed its
Answer to the Complaint on May 10, 2019.
 
Plaintiff
amended his complaint on June 23, 2021, to name Defendant ABM Building
Solutions LLC as Doe 1 and Defendant ABM Global Facility Service as Doe 2.  At the request of Plaintiff, those two
entities were dismissed on April 27, 2022. 

 
Also on April
27, 2022, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Defendant ABM Industries
Groups, LLC as Doe 3.  On June 10, 2022,
Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC (“ABM”) filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
On January 4, 5,
and 19, the Court granted various discovery motions brought by CSMC and
ABM.  On January 4, the Court ordered
Plaintiff to respond to ABM’s Form Interrogatories (Set Three) and Special
Interrogatories (Set Three) and to pay monetary sanctions within 21 days of
notice.  On January 5, 2024, the Court granted
ABM’s motion for a deemed-admitted order against Plaintiff as to Requests for
Admission (Set Two), and also ordered Plaintiff to respond to ABM’s Requests
for Production (Set Two) and to pay monetary sanctions within 21 days of
notice.  On January 19, 2024, the Court ordered
Plaintiff to respond to CSMC’s Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One) and Supplemental
Requests for Production (Set One) and to pay monetary sanctions within 21 days
of notice.
 
On April 4,
2024, ABM and CSMC jointly filed this motion for terminating sanctions, or in
the alternative issue and evidence sanctions, and for monetary sanctions.  As of the date of filing, Plaintiff had not
complied with any of the three Court orders from January 2024.  (Paggabao Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Plaintiff filed
his opposition on April 24.  Plaintiff
reports that, earlier the same day, he had provided the discovery responses
required by the January 4 and 5 orders. 
Plaintiff seeks an order for sanctions against Defendants.
 
ABM and CSMC
filed their reply on April 29.  They
confirmed that they did receive discovery responses on April 24 but note (among
other things): (1) that Plaintiff has not complied with the January 19 order to
provide responses to CSMC’s supplemental interrogatories and document requests
and (2) that Plaintiff has not complied with any of the orders to pay
sanctions.
 
Legal Standard
When a party fails to comply with a court order to provide
responses to interrogatories or document requests, the Court “may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence
sanction, … a terminating sanction [or] a monetary sanction.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
& 2031.300, subd. (c); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
ABM and CSMC request terminating, issue, evidence, and/or
monetary sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with his obligations under
the Civil Discovery Act and this Court’s orders of January 4, 5, and 19, 2024.
 
The Court denies the request for terminating
sanctions.  Before entering an order for
a terminating sanction, there generally must be evidence of repeated and
willful misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to
compliance with the discovery rules.  Here,
the record does not support such a finding. 
Although Plaintiff has engaged in serious discovery abuse, he has made
recent efforts (although partial and belated) to bring himself into compliance
with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and this Courts orders.  Although further discovery abuse could lead
to a different result in the future, at this point there is not a sufficient
basis for a terminating sanction; indeed, such an extreme sanction would create a “windfall” for Defendants, placing them in a
better position than they would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238 Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
For essentially the same reasons, the Court
denies the request for issue sanctions.  Although
it is unclear from the moving papers precisely what issue sanctions ABM and
CSMC are seeking, a ruling that, on the merits, one or more of Plaintiff’s
claims for relief is barred (or one or more of Defendants’ defenses is
established) would be a windfall for Defendants.
The Court grants, in part, the request CSMC
for an evidence sanction.  On January 19,
2024, the Court granted CSMC’s motion to compel Plaintiff to provide responses
to CSMC’s Supplemental Interrogatory (Set One) and Supplemental Request for
Production (Set One).  (The Court notes
that to the extent ABM argues that the Court granted its motion to compel responses
to ABM’s supplemental discovery, rather than CSMC’s, that appears to be an
error.)  Even now, when facing a motion
for non-monetary sanctions and further monetary sanctions, Plaintiff has not
responded to this discovery, in a clear and serious violation of his
obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s order.  Monetary sanctions have not been sufficient
to obtain compliance.  Accordingly, the
Court issues the following evidence sanctions: 
First, Plaintiff is prohibited from introducing into evidence in this
matter (whether at trial or at any other proceeding in this matter, other than
a motion relating to compliance with Defendant’s discovery obligations under
the Civil Discovery Act and the Orders of this Court) against CSMC any document
or other writing responsive to CSMC’s Supplemental Request for Production (Set
One) that was within Plaintiff’s possession, custody, or control prior to May
7, 2024, and that Plaintiff did not produce in discovery in this matter prior
to May 7, 2024 (the date of the hearing on this motion).
Second, Plaintiff is prohibited from introducing into evidence in this
matter (whether at trial or at any other proceeding in this matter, other than
a motion relating to compliance with Defendant’s discovery obligations under
the Civil Discovery Act and the Orders of this Court) against CSMC any factual
information responsive to CSMC’s Supplemental Interrogatory (Set One) that was
within Plaintiff’s knowledge prior to May 7, 2024, and that Plaintiff did not refer
to in discovery in this matter prior to May 7, 2024 (the date of the hearing on
this motion).
The Court finds that this evidence sanction is
an appropriate measure to enforce the obligations of the Civil Discovery Act
and this Court’s order of January 19, 2024. 
The Court further finds that it does not create a windfall or place CSMC
or ABM in a better position than it would have been if Plaintiff had simply
complied with his obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act.
The Court also GRANTS in part Defendants’ request for a
further monetary sanction to compensate Defendants for the fees incurred in
connection with the bringing of this motion, which was a necessary and proper step
to obtain Plaintiff’s compliance.  The
Court sets the additional monetary sanctions at $847.50, calculated based upon
3.5 hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225
per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Paggabao
Decl., ¶ 15.)
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions, which
have no apparent basis in law or fact.
 
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES Defendants’ request for terminating sanctions or an issue sanction.
The
Court GRANTS in part the request for an evidence sanction.
Plaintiff is prohibited from introducing into evidence in this
matter (whether at trial or at any other proceeding in this matter, other than
a motion relating to compliance with Defendant’s discovery obligations under
the Civil Discovery Act and the Orders of this Court) against CSMC any document
or other writing responsive to CSMC’s Supplemental Request for Production (Set
One) that was within Plaintiff’s possession, custody, or control prior to May
7, 2024, and that Plaintiff did not produce in discovery in this matter prior
to May 7, 2024 (the date of the hearing on this motion).
Plaintiff is also prohibited from introducing into evidence in this
matter (whether at trial or at any other proceeding in this matter, other than
a motion relating to compliance with Defendant’s discovery obligations under
the Civil Discovery Act and the Orders of this Court) against CSMC any factual
information responsive to CSMC’s Supplemental Interrogatory (Set One) that was
within Plaintiff’s knowledge prior to May 7, 2024, and that Plaintiff did not refer
to in discovery in this matter prior to May 7, 2024 (the date of the hearing on
this motion).
The Court GRANTS in part Defendants’ request for a
further monetary sanction.

Esq., jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act to Defendants in the amount of $847.50, within 30 days of notice.
