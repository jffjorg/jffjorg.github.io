     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses
  to interrogatories (CRS# 9654) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff
Salvador Suarez filed this action against Defendants Southern California Truck
Bodies and Sales, Inc. and Miguel Sanchez. The complaint asserts ten causes of
action arising from wage violations, unfair business practices, retaliation,
and wrongful termination.  
            On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel Defendants to respond to interrogatories.
Defendants have not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
            Discovery responses are due 30 days
after service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject discovery
on August 30, 2023. (LaCour Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant did not respond by the
statutory deadline of September 29, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4.) On October 3,
2023, Defendant requested an extension. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff requested
the information be provided by November 22, 2023. (Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant
did not provide the information by that date. (Id., ¶ 8.) Mediation took
place on November 29, 2023, but failed because Defendant did not provide
sufficient information. (Id., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff followed up on the discovery
in December 2023 and January 2024. (Id., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff granted three
more extensions, with the last one being January 23, 2024. (Id., ¶ 13.)
To date, Defendant has not provided any responses to discovery. (Id., ¶
14.) 
            Defendant has not filed an
opposition to the motion, thereby conceding these facts and the merits of the
motion. Therefore, a court order is necessary to compel the responses, and
sanctions are warranted because there is no substantial justification.  
            Plaintiff’s counsel requests $2,500
in sanctions without substantiation. (See LaCour Decl. ¶ 16.) No information is
provided as to counsel’s hourly rate or the hours spent on the motion. Based on
the simplicity of the motion and lack of opposition, the Court awards $900 as
the reasonable amount. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel is
GRANTED. Defendants shall serve responses to the subject interrogatories within
15 days of this order. Objections are waived except as to privacy and
privilege. The Court sanctions Defendants and their counsel in the total amount
of $900, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
