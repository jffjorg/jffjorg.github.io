NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION, 
                        
                        Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  23STCV31160
  Hearing Date:  March 8, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to reclassify 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff
Monica Sanchez filed this action against National Instruments Corporation,
alleging violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant secretly deploys spyware to access the devices of
visitors to its website. Plaintiff alleges that she visited Defendant’s website
in 2023, whereupon Defendant accessed Plaintiff’s device and installed “pen
register” and “trap and trace” tracking software.
            The complaint asserts a single cause
of action under CIPA, or Penal Code sections 630 et seq. Plaintiff
alleges economic injury and intangible injury to her dignity. Plaintiff alleges
that she is entitled to statutory damages of $5,000 under Penal Code section
637.2(a)(1). Additionally, Plaintiff prays for punitive damages, attorneys’
fees, and all other relief as may be deemed appropriate. 
            On February 8, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited
jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed her opposition on February 26, 2024. Defendant
filed its reply on March 1, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“A trial court has authority to conduct a
pretrial hearing [a Walker hearing] to obtain information about whether the
amount of the judgment will require reclassification.” (Stern v. Superior
Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223, 229.) “Under the Walker standard, a
matter may be
reclassified
as a limited civil action ‘when (i) the absence of jurisdiction is apparent
before trial from the complaint, petition, or related documents, or (ii) during
the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’
result in a verdict below the superior court's jurisdictional amount....’” (Ytuarte
v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 276.) 
            A “defendant or cross-defendant may
file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party to
respond to the initial pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040(a).) “The court
shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification, regardless of
any fault or lack of fault, if the case has been classified in an incorrect
jurisdictional classification.” (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
The Applicable Jurisdictional Minimum
            As an initial matter, the
jurisdictional minimum applicable here is $25,000. At the time the complaint
was filed, the prior versions of Code of Civil Procedure sections 85 and 86
were in effect, and the jurisdictional minimum was $25,000. The amended Sections
85 and 86, which increased the minimum to $35,000, did not go into effect until
January 1, 2024. In California, “statutes ordinarily are interpreted as
operating prospectively in the absence of a clear indication of a contrary
legislative intent.” (Quarry v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945, 955.) “[A]
statute may be applied retroactively only if it contains express language of
retroactivity or if other sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication
that the Legislature intended retroactive application.” (Myers v. Philip
Morris Companies, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 844.) 
Sections 85 and 86 do not contain any
express language of retroactivity, nor is there a clear and unmistakable
indication that the provisions were meant to apply retroactively. Defendant’s
interpretation is unsupported by legal authority. Therefore, the amended
versions of Sections 85 and 86 do not apply to this case, and the relevant
jurisdictional minimum is $25,000.    
II.
Whether Plaintiff’s Claim Possibly Exceeds the Jurisdictional Minimum
            Defendant argues that because
Plaintiff is a “tester” who visits different websites in search of violations
and only visited Defendant’s website once, her damages are de minimis
and only slightly exceed the statutory penalty of $5,000. 
            However, the unlikelihood of
Plaintiff recovering more than $25,000 is not sufficient to reclassify the
case. Rather, it must “appear[] to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot
recover the amount.” (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 277.) “This
standard of ‘legal certainty’ is not met when it appears a verdict within the
unlimited court's jurisdiction is ‘possible.’” (Ibid.) CIPA allows
recovery of $5,000 per violation or three times the amount of actual damages,
whichever is greater. (Pen. Code, § 637.2(a).) Defendant has presented no
evidence or legal authority to preclude the possibility, as a matter of law,
that Plaintiff suffered sufficient damages which would exceed $25,000 when trebled.
Plaintiff never admitted in the complaint that she suffered de minimis
damages. To the contrary, Plaintiff alleges that she suffered economic and
intangible injuries, and that the amount in controversy is up to $75,000.
(Compl. ¶¶ 21, 24.) Therefore, it is “possible” for Plaintiff to recover more
than $25,000. To the extent that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts,
it is subject to demurrer, not reclassification. 
            Defendant argues that the $5,000-per-violation
penalty and treble damages from Penal Code section 637.2(a) do not apply
because the narrower $2,500 fine from Section 638.51 applies instead. Section 637.2(a)
applies to violations of CIPA as a whole, whereas Section 638.51 applies
specifically to pen register and trap/trace. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
violated Section 638.51 by installing a pen register and trap/trace software on
her device. (Compl. ¶¶ 22-23.) Defendant relies on De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile
Estates Homeowners Assn. v. De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 890, 911, which held that “a general statute must bow to a more
specific statute addressing the same subject.” 
However, De Anza addressed whether
the statutory remedy provided in Civil Code section 798.86, part of the
Mobilehome Residency Law (MRL), precluded recovery of punitive damages under
Civil Code section 3294. (De Anza, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p. 911.) The
court held that “a plaintiff who proceeds solely on a cause of action for
violation of the provisions of the Mobilehome Residency Law is limited to the
statutory penalty provided in Civil Code section 798.86.” (Id. at pp. 915-16.)
This is because “a plaintiff cannot recover both punitive damages and statutory
penalties, as this would constitute a prohibited double penalty for the same
act.” (Id. at p. 912.) 
By contrast, Penal Code sections 637.2 and
638.51 do not implicate the potential for double recovery. While Section 638.51
applies specifically to pen register and trap/trace, the penalty discussed
therein is a fine and/or imprisonment, not an award of damages going to the
victim. Section 638.51 imposes a criminal penalty, which is unrelated to a victim’s
recovery of civil damages. Private recovery is instead governed by Section
637.2, which authorizes a civil action against a person who has violated any provision
of CIPA. Therefore, Sections 637.2 and 638.51 do not conflict. Section 638.51
is not “a more specific statute addressing the same subject.” (See De Anza,
supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p. 911.) Rather, Section 638.51 addresses a
different subject—criminal penalties—and leaves civil damages to Section 637.2.

III.
Injunctive Relief
Additionally, a limited civil case is one
in which “[t]he relief sought is a type that may be granted in a limited civil
case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 85(b).) Injunctive relief cannot be sought in a
limited civil case. (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 275.)
Although Plaintiff currently alleges that she is not seeking injunctive relief
(Compl. ¶ 21), the complaint can be amended. If Plaintiff asserts injunctive
relief, the case would be correctly classified as unlimited for that independent
reason.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to reclassify is
DENIED.
