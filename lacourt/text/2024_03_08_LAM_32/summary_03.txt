Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant National Instruments Corporation's motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction. The case involves Plaintiff Monica Sanchez's allegations that Defendant deployed spyware on her device when she visited its website in 2023, violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). Plaintiff is seeking damages and injunctive relief. The Judge found that while Defendant argued that Plaintiff's damages are de minimis and only slightly exceed the statutory penalty of $5,000, it is possible for Plaintiff to recover more than $25,000 when trebled. The Judge also rejected Defendant's argument that the narrower $2,500 fine from Section 638.51 applies instead of the $5,000-per-violation penalty from Section 637.2(a). The Judge concluded that Sections 637.2 and 638.51 do not conflict and that Defendant's motion to reclassify is denied.
