And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The proposed order grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to interrogatories, requiring the defendants to serve their responses within 15 days. The court also awards $900 in sanctions against the defendants and their counsel, as there is no substantial justification for their failure to respond to the discovery requests. The court notes that the defendants have not filed an opposition to the motion, conceding the facts and merits of the motion. The court's order also waives any objections to the discovery responses, except for those related to privacy and privilege.
