And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by plaintiffs Michael LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta to allow their expert witness Robert Moss to testify at trial. The motion was filed after Paul Hittelman, the expert previously designated by the plaintiffs, passed away. The court has determined that the defendants will not be unduly prejudiced by the addition of Moss as an expert, and that the plaintiffs would not have reasonably discovered Moss's qualifications and availability in a timely manner. The court has also ordered that Moss's testimony be limited to the scope outlined in the plaintiffs' November 16, 2021 designation, and that Moss appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by the defendants.
