plaintiffs’ motion to allow additional
  expert testimony
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Michael LaPorta and
Beverlee LaPorta
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendants Affeld Grivakes LLP and David W.
Affeld 
Motion to Allow Additional Expert Testimony
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Michael LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta (“Plaintiffs”) move
the court for an order allowing their expert witness Robert Moss (“Moss) to
testify at trial in this action against defendants Affeld Grivakes LLP and
David W. Affeld (“Defendants”). 
Plaintiffs request this relief on the ground that (1) Plaintiffs
designated Paul Hittelman as their expert and intended to rely on his testimony
for issues of liability, and (2) on December 15, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel was
advised that Mr. Hittelman passed away. 
(Tillipman Decl., p. 1:8-12.) 
Plaintiffs therefore seek to designate Moss as an expert in lieu of Mr.
Hittelman.  (Id., p. 1:21-22.) 
The court (1) has taken into account the extent to which Defendants
have relied on Plaintiffs’ designation of their experts, (2) has determined
that Defendants will not be unduly prejudiced in maintaining their defense on
the merits if Plaintiffs augment their expert witness list to add Moss as an
expert, and (3) has determined that Plaintiffs would not, in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, have determined to call Moss in place of Mr.
Hittelman.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2034.620, subds. (a), (b), (c)(1).) 
The court further notes that “Defendants do not oppose allowing
Plaintiffs to augment their expert witness list to add [Moss] as their standard
of care expert in place of the deceased Paul Hittelman.”  (Opp., p. 2:6-8.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiffs’ motion
and shall permit Plaintiffs to augment their expert witness list to add Moss,
who shall be permitted to testify regarding the matters that were previously
set forth in Plaintiffs’ November 16, 2021 designation, as requested by
Defendants in their opposition and agreed to by Plaintiffs in their reply.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.260; Opp., p. 4:6-10
[“Mr. Moss’s testimony must be limited to the scope outlined in Plaintiff’s
November 16, 2021 designation”]; Reply, p. 1:25-26 [Plaintiffs “do not oppose
the requested limitation in the scope of testimony”].) 
Further, the court will set a date for Moss’s deposition pursuant to
(1) Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.620, subdivision (d), and (2) the
parties’ agreement, as expressed in their opposition and reply papers.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.620, subd. (d)
[“Leave to augment or amend is conditioned on the moving party making the
expert available immediately for a deposition”]; Reply, p. 1:25-26 [Plaintiffs
“do not oppose . . . the [request for the] Court to set a deposition date”].) 
The court denies Defendants’ request that the court require Plaintiffs
to pay the costs and expenses incurred in taking the deposition of Moss.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.620, subd.
(d).)  
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Michael
LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta’s motion to allow additional expert witness
testimony. 
            The court orders that plaintiffs
Michael LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta may augment their expert witness list to
add Robert Moss as an expert.  The court
orders that Robert Moss may testify on the issues set forth in “Plaintiffs’
Expert Witness Designation” served on November 16, 2021 by plaintiffs Michael
LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta.
            The court orders Robert Moss to
appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel for defendants
Affeld Grivakes LLP and David W. Affeld on _______________, 2024, at ____ a.m.,
at ________________________________________________________________.
            The court orders plaintiffs Michael
LaPorta and Beverlee LaPorta to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
