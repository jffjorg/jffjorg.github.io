```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to appoint a discovery referee to monitor and adjudicate issues arising at future depositions. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's counsel passed a note to and coached defendant Pamela Maxwell during her deposition, necessitating the appointment of a discovery referee. The judge found that while the defendant's conduct was improper, it did not necessitate the appointment of a discovery referee. The judge instead orders the defendants to give notice of this ruling and expects all counsel to comply with the Los Angeles County Bar Association's "Guidelines for Civility in Litigation" and the Los Angeles Superior Court's local rules.
