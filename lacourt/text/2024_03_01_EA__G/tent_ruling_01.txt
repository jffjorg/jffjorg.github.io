TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Donald G. McWhirter, Jr. and Carolynn T.
McWhirter’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs Donald G. McWhirter, Jr. and Carolynn T. McWhirter
filed a complaint against Defendant Anthony J. Venti, Jr., individually and as
trustee of the Venti, Jr. Family Trust, dated May 31, 1990 (Venti Trust), and
Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) quiet title, (2)
declaratory relief, and (3) accounting.
On January
11, 2024, the McWhirters filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that the
court denied on January 30.
On February
7, 2024, the court granted the McWhirters’ request for a temporary restraining
order and set an OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction for March 1. A case management
conference and OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service are set for June 3.
ANALYSIS
The
McWhirters seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the pending foreclosure of
their personal residence. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS their
motion.
Legal
Standard
“[A]
court will deny a preliminary injunction unless there is a reasonable
probability that the plaintiff will be successful on the merits, but the
granting of a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the
merits.” (Beehan v. Lido Isle Community Assn. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 858,
866.) “The function of a preliminary injunction is the preservation of the
status quo until a final determination of the merits.” (Ibid.)
In
evaluating a party’s request for a preliminary injunction, courts consider “(1)
how likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits, and (2) the
relative harm the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.” (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.) “[T]he greater the . . . showing on one, the less must be shown on
the other to support an injunction.” (Ibid, quoting Butt v. State of
California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.) The balancing of harm between the
parties also “involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other
remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the
status quo.” (Husain v. McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860,
867, quoting Abrams v. St. John’s Hospital & health Center (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 628, 636.)¿The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as the moving
party “to show all elements necessary to support issuance of a preliminary
injunction.” (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452,
1481.)
Likelihood of
Prevailing on the Merits
In this case, the McWhirters
are seeking to quiet the title to their property in Glendora on the grounds
that a deed of trust recorded against the Glendora property by Venti on
February 18, 2009, is invalid.
The McWhirters argue the deed
of trust is invalid because it secures the repayment of $300,000 business loan
from Venti that Venti allegedly never made. (McWhirter Decl., ¶ 10-11.) In
opposition, Venti argues the purpose of the deed of trust was to secure the
McWhirters’ prior indebtedness to Venti which Venti alleges arose after they alleged
misappropriated business funds. (Venti Decl., ¶ 3-4.) But the court need not
determine which of these contrary assertions is likely to be correct. Instead,
even if Venti’s representations are taken as true, the court finds the McWhirters have a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits as
the time period for Venti to foreclose on the deed of trust has lapsed.
Historically, “California
cases had continuously held that the power of sale under a deed of trust was
not barred, or ‘never outlaws,’ and that the power of sale might be exercised
by the trustee who held the title even though the statute of limitations had
barred any action on the debt.” (Miller v. Provost (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th
1703, 1707.) But in 1982, the California Legislature abrogated this common law
principle by enacting Civil Code section 882.020. (Id., at p. 1707-1708.)
Civil Code section 882.020, subdivision (a) provides as follows:
“Unless
the lien of a mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument that creates a
security interest of record in real property to secure a debt or other
obligation has earlier expired pursuant to Section 2911, the lien expires at,
and is not enforceable by action for foreclosure commenced, power of sale
exercised, or any other means asserted after, the later of the following times:
(1)
If the final maturity date or the last date fixed for payment of the debt or performance
of the obligation is ascertainable from the recorded evidence of indebtedness,
10 years after that date.
(2)
If the final maturity date or the last date fixed for payment of the debt or
performance of the obligation is not ascertainable from the recorded evidence
of indebtedness, or if there is no final maturity date or last date fixed for
payment of the debt or performance of the obligation, 60 years after the date
the instrument that created the security interest was recorded.
(3)
If a notice of intent to preserve the security interest is recorded within the
time prescribed in paragraph (1) or (2), 10 years after the date the notice is
recorded.” (Civ. Code, § 882.020, subd. (a).)
“[E]vidence of indebtedness
is a security, such as a deed of trust. [Citation.] A notice of default is not
a security or evidence of indebtedness. It is an allegation of the existence of
a debt, and thus cannot be an evidence of indebtedness for purposes of [Civil
Code] section 882.020.” (Schmidli v. Pearce (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 305,
315-316.) Once a deed of trust has been rendered unenforceable by Civil Code
section 882.020, it becomes “equivalent for all purposes to a certificate of
satisfaction, reconveyance, release, or other discharge of the security
interest, and execution and recording of a certificate of satisfaction,
reconveyance, release, or other discharge is not necessary to terminate or
evidence the termination of the security interest.” (Civ. Code, § 882.030.)
In this case, the deed of
trust states as follows:
“The
Trustor agrees to pay the Principal Amount with interest before and after
maturity and before and after default at the rate of 10.75 percent calculated
annually, (the ‘Interest Rate’). The Interest Rate will be calculated from the
date this Trust begins (the ‘Interest Adjustment Date’) and accrues until the
whole of the Principal Amount is paid. The Loan will be repaid on the following
terms:
a.
The Principal and interest will be repaid in consecutive monthly installments
of $2,800.00 each on the 10th of each month;
b.
The Interest Adjustment Date for this Trust is January 15, 2009;
c.
The balance, if any, of the Principal Amount and any interest thereon and any
other moneys owing under this Trust will be due and payable on the January
15, 2011 (the ‘Maturity Date’).” (McWhirter Decl., Ex. B, ¶ 4 (emphasis
added).)
Because the deed of trust
fixes the maturity date of Venti’s $300,000 loan as January 15, 2011, Civil
Code section 882.020, subdivision (a)(1) required Venti to foreclose on that lien
within ten years of that date. But according to the McWhirters, the first
communication they received from Venti occurred on April 26, 2023, when they
received a letter from Venti’s counsel that requested information regarding any
liens that were senior to Venti’s deed of trust. (McWhirter Decl., ¶ 6-7, Ex.
A.) On July 20, they received another letter from Venti’s counsel that warned
foreclosure proceedings would commence if payment was not made within ninety
days. (McWhirter Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. C.) On November 1, a notice of default and
election to sell under deed of trust was recorded. (Moldo Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. D.)
In opposition, neither Venti
nor Venti’s counsel dispute that a payment demand letter was first sent to the
McWhirters on July 20, 2023. (Tripodes Decl., ¶ 4-7.) Nor do they provide any
evidence that a notice of intent to preserve security interest was recorded
pursuant Civil Code section 882.020, subdivision (a)(3). Because it appears
Venti failed to timely foreclose on the deed of trust within ten years of
January 15, 2011, Civil Code section 882.020, subdivision (a)(1) likely bars Venti
conducting the present nonjudicial foreclosure and entitles the McWhirters to
the release or discharge of Venti’s security interest in their property. Thus,
the McWhirters have a very high probability of prevailing in their quiet title
action.
Balancing of the Harms
Here, the McWhirters argue
they will suffer irreparable injury if this injunction is not granted in the
form of the foreclosure and sale of their Glendora property. In comparison,
they argue the harm to Venti if this injunction is granted is minimal as Venti
could still pursue remedies of foreclosure if the McWhirters are ultimately
unsuccessful in this action. Furthermore, as noted above, the harm to Venti is
likely nonexistent as Venti does not appear to have the legal ability to
foreclose on their property in the first place. Because the balance of the
harms overwhelmingly favors the McWhirters and in light of their very high
probability of prevailing on the merits, they have adequately established
grounds for a preliminary injunction.
Accordingly, the McWhirters’
motion is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the McWhirters’
motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED.
