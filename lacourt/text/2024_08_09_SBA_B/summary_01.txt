```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for an ex parte order to enter default against the defendant, Space Exploration Technologies, Corp. The defendant had previously removed the case to federal court, which means that the state court lost jurisdiction over the case. According to California law, the state court's jurisdiction is suspended when the defendant gives notice of removal, and it is reacquired only when the federal court remands the case back to the state court. Until that happens, the state court cannot take any further action. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request to enter default.
