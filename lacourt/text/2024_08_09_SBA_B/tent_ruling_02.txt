 Case Number:  24TRCV02068    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  B Soileau v. Space Exploration Technologies, Corp.  24TRCV02068
Plaintiff has filed an Application for ex parte Order for
Entry of Default of Defendant Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  Plaintiff notes “This application is made on
the grounds that the Defendant’s attempt to remove the case to federal court is
unlawful.”  Indeed, on July 30, 2024
Defendant filed a Notice to State Court of Removal of Civil Action to Federal
Court.  Attached is a copy of the Notice to
Federal Court of Removal of Civil Action.
This Court lost jurisdiction when the action was removed to
federal court.  Unless and until the
federal court remands this action to this Court, this Court may not take the
requested action.
“Thus, according to the plain
language of these statutes, the state court's jurisdiction is suspended when
the defendant seeking removal gives notice to the state court clerk, and it is
reacquired when the district court clerk gives notice to the state court clerk
in the form of a certified copy of the remand order.”  Spanair S.A. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 348, 356 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 864, 869]
Ex parte application denied.
