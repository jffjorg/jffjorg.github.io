And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for an ex parte order for entry of default against the defendant, Space Exploration Technologies, Corp. The plaintiff had sought to enter default judgment against the defendant, claiming that the defendant's attempt to remove the case to federal court was unlawful. However, the judge has determined that the court lost jurisdiction when the action was removed to federal court, and that the court may not take the requested action until the federal court remands the action back to the state court. The judge has cited a relevant case, Spanair S.A. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (2009), which supports this conclusion. The judge's tentative ruling is based on the plain language of the statutes governing removal of cases to federal court.
