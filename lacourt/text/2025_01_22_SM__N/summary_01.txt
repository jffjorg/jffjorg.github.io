And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiffs' motion to tax the defendant's costs is granted. The defendant is ordered to pay $517,206.48 in costs, but is entitled to recover $22,309.73. The judge has taxed the defendant's costs for deposition expenses, courtesy copy fees, legal research, and electronic document hosting. The judge found that the defendant's costs for expedited transcripts, courtesy copies, legal research, and electronic document hosting were unreasonable or unauthorized. The judge also overruled the defendant's objection to the declaration of Colin H. Rolfs, supporting the plaintiffs' reply in support of their motion.
