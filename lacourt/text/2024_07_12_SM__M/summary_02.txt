And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests without objections. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests within the original due date, and the defendant properly served the requests by mail. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to justify their failure to respond and therefore awards sanctions of $2,280.00, inclusive of costs, against the plaintiff and their counsel. The sanctions are payable within 30 days. The judge also orders the plaintiff to serve responses to the discovery requests within 10 days without objection.
