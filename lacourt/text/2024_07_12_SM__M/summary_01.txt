And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Gabriel Sanchez. The motion is related to an order granting Defendants Kasra and Nasser Mizban's motion for summary adjudication, which limited Plaintiff's damages to economic damages. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff has not satisfied the procedural requirements for reconsideration. The judge also notes that the proffered declaration from Allstate merely provides a legal conclusion regarding the interpretation of a contract, and does not attempt to show any ambiguity in the agreement or dispute any of the material facts. The judge further finds that discretionary relief under CCP ยง473(b) is unavailable since the motion does not comply with the requirements of section 1008.
