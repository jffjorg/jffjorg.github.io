et al.
CASE NO.:                21STCV02647

for Reconsideration; Vacate Order per CCP §473(b)
HEARING DATE:   July 12, 2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
A non-prevailing party may make a
motion to reconsider and enter a different order under the following
conditions: (1) brought before the same judge that made the order sought to be
reconsidered; (2) made within 10 days after service upon the party of the
notice of entry of the order (extended under CCP § 1013 for type of service);
(3) based on new or different facts, circumstances or law than those before the
court at the time of the original ruling; (4) supported by a declaration
stating the previous order, by which judge it was made, and the new or
different facts, circumstances or law claimed to exist; and (5) the motion must
be made and decided before entry of judgment. (CCP, § 1008.)  
 
The legislature
intended to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party
offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some
valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995)
32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)¿¿Thus, “[t]o be
entitled to reconsideration, a party should show that (1) evidence of new or
different facts exist, and (2) the party has a satisfactory explanation for
failing to produce such evidence at an earlier time.” (Mink v. Superior
Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) The moving party must demonstrate
that such newly discovered evidence could not,
with reasonable diligence, have previously discovered and produced. (Wilcox
v. Ford (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1170.) The court may also reconsider its prior interim orders on
its own motion to correct its own errors. (Le Francoise v. Goel (2005)
35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107-09.)¿ 
 
“No application
to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be
considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.” (CCP §
1008(e)); see Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573,
1577 [“The name of a motion is not controlling, and, regardless of the name, a
motion asking the trial court to decide the same matter previously ruled on is
a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.”].)
Therefore, the moving party must comply with the requirements of section 1008,
regardless of the title of the noticed motion.
 
A motion for reconsideration must be made to the same
judge. (CCP § 1008(a).) “A trial court’s discretion to reconsider
another judge’s prior ruling is necessarily narrow and usually only appropriate
when the prior judge is unavailable.” (Marriage of Oliverez (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1247.) “[O]ne trial court judge may not reconsider and overrule a
ruling by another trial court judge, unless the first judge is
unavailable.”  (Davcon, Inc. v. Roberts & Morgan (2003) 110
Cal.App.4th 1355, 1361.) 
 
Reconsideration cannot be granted
based on claims the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling because
this is not a “new” or “different” matter.¿ (Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Gabriel Sanchez moves for
reconsideration of this Court's April 11, 2024, order granting Defendants Kasra
and Nasser Mizban’s motion for summary adjudication as to Defendants’ Eleventh
Affirmative Defense, limiting Plaintiff’s damages to economic damages pursuant
to pursuant to Civil Code section 3333.4. In the alternative, Plaintiff moves to
vacate the Court’s April 11, 2024, order under Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b)’s discretionary relief provision.
 
New or Different Circumstances
 
Plaintiff argues new or different
facts exist that were not previously considered by the Court and that they
could affect its ruling. To wit, Plaintiff cites a declaration from Allstate
which is “conclusive on the issue” of coverage. (Hakim Decl., Ex. 3.)
 
Plaintiff admits that the declaration
is not truly a “new or different” fact within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, and fails to provide an excuse for failing to produce this
evidence at the hearing. Plaintiff was aware that he needed to marshal evidence
to oppose the motion and create a dispute of fact as to the existence of
insurance coverage. For example, Plaintiff discusses how discovery was
conducted in 2023 for Allstate to confirm coverage. (Hakim Decl., ¶¶4-7.)
Plaintiff therefore had access to all such documentation well before the
hearing. Plaintiff has therefore not satisfied the procedural requirements for
reconsideration. For this reason alone, the Court cannot grant the motion.
 
Even if considered, the proffered
declaration merely provides a legal conclusion regarding the interpretation of
a contract. It is black letter law that the interpretation of an insurance
contract is the role of the Court. (Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union
Fire Insurance Company (1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 879.) This declaration does
not attempt to show any ambiguity in the agreement which would create a dispute
of fact. (Id.) Moreover, the declaration does not put into
dispute any of the material facts, including the express terms of the insurance
agreements at issue.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
 
Discretionary Relief under CCP §473(b)
 
Such relief is
unavailable. “No application to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a
previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless made according
to this section.” (CCP § 1008(e)); see Powell v. County of Orange (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577 [“The name of a motion is not controlling, and,
regardless of the name, a motion asking the trial court to decide the same
matter previously ruled on is a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008.”].) Therefore, the moving party must comply with the
requirements of section 1008. Moreover, in considering such requirements, the
Court would not exercise its discretion under section 473(b) to vacate the
order.
