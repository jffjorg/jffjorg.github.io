And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The defendant, Passes Inc., is seeking documents related to FanFixApp LLC's process or work efforts in learning or creating alleged trade secrets. The judge finds that these documents are relevant to the trade secret misappropriation claims and that FanFixApp LLC has failed to provide a code-complaint response.

The judge also finds that FanFixApp LLC's objections to the request are unsupported and that the request is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge orders FanFixApp LLC to provide further responses within 30 days.

The judge has denied FanFixApp LLC's objections to the request, which included claims of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and trade secret privilege. The judge finds that these claims are not supported by evidence and that the requested documents are relevant to the claims and defenses in the case.

The judge has also denied FanFixApp LLC's objections to the request on the grounds that it seeks information that is not relevant to the claims and defenses, or that has probative value significantly outweighed by the burden of and/or potential harm resulting from its disclosure. The judge finds that the request is reasonably tailored to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence relating to FanFixApp LLC's lost profits resulting from the alleged trade secret misappropriation.
