EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court sustains plaintiffs
Jing Du, Yu Bai, and Ye Qiu’s evidentiary objections to defendant Andrew Khun’s
request for judicial notice.  (Carbajal
v. CWPSC, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 227, 241 [“‘new evidence is not
permitted with reply papers’”].) 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court denies defendant
Andrew Khun’s request for judicial notice, filed on November 30, 2023, as an
improper attempt to introduce new evidence in reply.  (Carbajal, supra, 245
Cal.App.4th at p. 241.) 
The court denies plaintiffs
Jing Du, Yu Bai, and Ye Qiu’s request for judicial notice but has considered
the issue as to which motions are on calendar below.
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
Defendant Andrew Khun
(“Defendant”) filed the pending motion to compel plaintiff Jing Du’s further
responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, on July 24,
2023.  In the omnibus opposition papers
filed by plaintiffs Jing Du (“Du”), Yu Bai (“Bai”), and Ye Qiu (“Qiu”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), Plaintiffs contend that they served verified
supplemental responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories in July
2023.  (Opp., p. 2:8-10.)  In reply, Defendant (1) asserts that the
omnibus reply is filed in support of Defendant’s “three Motions to Compel
Further Responses and to Compel Production of Responsive Documents to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One,” and (2) states that Plaintiffs’
assertion that they served supplemental responses to the Special
Interrogatories is “[i]rrelevant[,]” because “[t]hese motions involve Requests
for Production of Documents[.]”  (Reply,
pp. 1:23-2:1, 4:16-20.)  Defendant’s assertions,
however, are incorrect, because Defendant’s motion to compel Du’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories is now pending before the court. 
It appears that Defendant made
an inadvertent clerical error in failing to take off calendar the motion to
compel Du’s further responses to Special Interrogatories.  On November 13, 2023, Defendant filed a
“Notice of Taking Motions Off Calendar,” stating that he was taking off
calendar, inter alia, “[t]he motion of Defendant Andrew Khun to Compel
Further Discovery Responses to Special Interrogatories, regarding Plaintiff
Jing Du, previously scheduled for November 21, 2023, Reservation No. 4190 5971
5280[.]”  (Nov. 13, 2023 Notice, p. 1, ¶
1.)  However, the motion belonging to the
reservation ID number ending in 5280 is not the pending motion to compel Du’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, but rather Defendant’s motion to
compel Du’s further responses to Requests for Production. 
Thus, it appears that
Defendant (1) intended to take off calendar the motion to compel Du’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories, but (2) instead erroneously took off
calendar the motion to compel Du’s further responses to Requests for
Production. 
The court therefore exercises
its discretion to order the following. 
First, the court takes off
calendar Defendant’s motion to compel Du’s further responses to Special
Interrogatories pursuant to Defendant’s November 13, 2023, Notice of Taking
Motions Off Calendar.  (Nov. 13, 2023 Notice,
p. 1, ¶ 1.) 
Second, the court resets
Defendant’s motion to compel Du’s further responses to Requests for Production
of Documents for hearing on February 13, 2024, in order to give plaintiff Du an
opportunity to file an opposition to that motion.  
MOTION TO COMPEL BAI’S FURTHER RESPONSES
TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Defendant moves the court for
an order (1) compelling plaintiff Bai to serve further responses and to produce
responsive documents to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents,
numbers 1-16, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Defendant and against
plaintiff Bai in the amount of $3,210.
The court notes that, in
opposition, Bai has presented evidence showing that Bai served supplemental
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production, numbers 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9-16.  (Shikai Decl., ¶ 22; Shikai Decl., Ex. 8
[Bai’s Supplemental Response to Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One].)  The court exercises its
discretion to consider the supplemental responses to those requests in ruling
on Defendant’s motion.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409 [“Whether a
particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion
is best determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based
on the circumstances of the case”].) 
The
court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Bai’s further responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, numbers 1, 3-4, and 8 because Bai’s representations
of his inability to comply with those demands are not inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(1).) 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Bai’s further responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, numbers 2, 5-7, and 9-16 because Bai’s statements
of compliance to those demands are incomplete since Bai does not state whether
the production will be allowed in whole or in part.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd.
(a)(1), 2031.220.)
In
light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling, the court finds that the
circumstances presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore
denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff Bai.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL QIU’S FURTHER RESPONSES
TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Defendant moves the court for
an order (1) compelling plaintiff Qiu to serve further responses and to produce
responsive documents to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents,
numbers 1-19, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Defendant and against
plaintiff Qiu in the amount of $3,210.
The court notes that, in
opposition, Qiu asserts that supplemental responses were served and has
presented evidence showing that Qiu served supplemental responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1, 5, 6, 7, 9-16, and
18.  (Shikai Decl., ¶ 22; Shikai
Decl., Ex. 9 [Qiu’s Supplemental Response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One].)  The court
exercises its discretion to consider the supplemental responses to those
requests in ruling on Defendant’s motion. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 409.)
            The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Qiu’s
further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 3-4, 8, 17,
and 19 because Qiu’s representations of her inability to comply with those
demands are not inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(1).)
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Qiu’s further responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, numbers 1-2, 5-7, 9-16, and 18 because Qiu’s
statements of compliance to those demands are incomplete since Qiu does not
state whether the production will be allowed in whole or in part.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(1), 2031.220.)
In
light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling, the court finds that the
circumstances presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore
denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff Qiu.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
ORDER
            The court orders that defendant
Andrew Khun’s motion to compel plaintiff Jing Du’s motion to compel further
responses to special interrogatories is taken off calendar. 
            The court resets defendant Andrew
Khun’s motion to compel plaintiff Jing Du’s motion to compel further responses

February 13, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53.

Khun’s motion to compel Yu Bai’s further responses to requests for production
of documents as follows.

Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to defendant Andrew
Khun all documents and things in plaintiff Yu Bai’s possession, custody, or
control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date of
this order. 
            The court denies defendant
Andrew Khun’s request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff Yu Bai. 
            The court grants defendant Andrew
Khun’s motion to compel Ye Qiu’s further responses to requests for production
of documents as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, the court orders plaintiff Ye Qiu (1) to serve on defendant
Andrew Khun further written responses to defendant Andrew Khun’s Requests for
Production of Documents, numbers 1-2, 5-7, 9-16, and 18 that comply with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to defendant
Andrew Khun all documents and things in plaintiff Ye Qiu’s possession, custody,
or control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date
of this order. 
            The court denies defendant
Andrew Khun’s request for monetary sanctions against plaintiff Ye Qiu. 
            The court orders defendant Andrew
Khun to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
