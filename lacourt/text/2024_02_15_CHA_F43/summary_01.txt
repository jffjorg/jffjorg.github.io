And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant had argued that the arbitration agreement was valid and that it should be allowed to compel arbitration as a third-party beneficiary. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to provide admissible evidence to support its claims. Additionally, the judge ruled that the defendant was not a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement, as the agreement only benefited the parties who signed the contract, not the manufacturer.

The judge based its decision on several factors, including the language of the arbitration agreement, which did not explicitly mention third-party beneficiaries, and the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which would not apply in this case because the causes of action against the defendant were not intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.

The judge also distinguished this case from a previous case, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, where the court allowed a car manufacturer to compel arbitration as a third-party beneficiary. However, the judge found that the facts of this case were different, and that the defendant was not a party to the arbitration agreement.
