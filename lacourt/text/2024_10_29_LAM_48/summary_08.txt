```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to bifurcate the trial, which would separate the trial into two phases: a liability phase and a damages phase. The plaintiff argued that bifurcation would be efficient and promote settlement discussions, but the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support these claims. The judge also noted that it is premature to order bifurcation at this stage of the case, as the action is less than six months old and a trial date has not yet been set. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion at a later date if circumstances change.
