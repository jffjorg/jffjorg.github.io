The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, Jamshid Goltche, 26 Global Infinity, LLC, and Rodeo Enterprises, LLC, to the various causes of action brought by the plaintiff, Ebby Shakib. After reviewing the pleadings, the judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the 1st, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th causes of action is OVERRULED.

The judge has also tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the 4th cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is MOOT, as the plaintiff had previously dismissed this cause of action.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has properly pled the elements of breach of contract, conversion, and theft, and that the defendants' demurrer to these causes of action is OVERRULED.

The judge has also tentatively ruled that the plaintiff has standing to bring the derivative claims on behalf of the entities, and that the causes of action are not uncertain.

As a result, the judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the 10th through 13th causes of action is OVERRULED.
