And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's claims as a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) is GRANTED. The court finds that the speech at issue is not commercial, and that the plaintiff has not met his burden to prove the probability of prevailing on his claims.

The plaintiff, Adam J. Tenser, sued the defendants for allegedly using his identity and image in a video program without permission. The defendants argued that the claims arose from constitutionally protected speech, and the court agrees.

The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are baseless and intended to intimidate the defendants into silence. The court also finds that the defendants did not have a duty to obtain a written clearance from the plaintiff as claimed by the plaintiff.

The court strikes all of the plaintiff's claims, including the claims for invasion of privacy, fraud, and unfair competition. The court finds that the speech at issue is not commercial, and that the plaintiff has not met his burden to prove the probability of prevailing on his claims.

The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 425.16, which allows for the dismissal of a lawsuit that is intended to chill free speech. The court also relies on various case law, including Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021), JAMS, Inc. v. Superior Court (2016), and FilmOn.com Inc. v. DoubleVerify Inc. (2019).

The defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's claims as a SLAPP is GRANTED, and the plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed.
