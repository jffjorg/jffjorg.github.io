RULING
            Defendants
GNH Productions, Inc, Telepictures Productions Inc., Warner Horizon Television
Inc. and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc.’s Special Motion to Strike
Pursuant to CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) is GRANTED.  All causes of action within Plaintiff Adam J.
Tenser’s First Amended Complaint are stricken as to Defendants GNH Productions,
Inc, Telepictures Productions Inc., Warner Horizon Television Inc. and Warner
Bros. Home Entertainment Inc.  Defendants
GNH Productions, Inc, Telepictures Productions Inc., Warner Horizon Television
Inc. and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc.’s meet their burden to prove the
Plaintiff Adam J. Tensor’s claims arises from constitutionally protected speech.
Plaintiff Adam J. Tensor does not meet his burden of proving the probability of
prevailing on all claims in the FAC.  Defendant’s
the proposed judgment of dismissal
 
            Defendants
Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) are GRANTED as to the existence of articles,
court documents, and the administrative ruling documents, but not to the “truth
of the hearsay statements in the documents.” (In re Vicks (2013) 56
Cal.4th 274, 314.)
 
            Plaintiff
Adam J. Tenser’s RJN is GRANTED as to the existence of the documents filed with
the Secretary of State, and the statements made therein, but not the truth of
those statements. 
 
            Defendants
GNH Productions, Inc, Telepictures Productions Inc., Warner Horizon Television
Inc. and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc.’s objections to evidence
submitted by Plaintiff in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Strike Pursuant
to CCP § 425.16 1 through 19 are SUSTAINED.
 
            “Litigation of an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step
process. First, the moving defendant bears the burden of establishing that the
challenged allegations or claims arise from protected activity in which the
defendant has engaged.  Second, for each claim that does arise from
protected activity, the plaintiff must show the claim has “at least ‘minimal
merit.  If the plaintiff cannot make this showing, the court will strike
the claim.”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th
995, 1009 [where moving party seeks to strike an entire cause of action
alleging multiple factual bases, court does not determine whether 1st
step is met based on “gravamen” test; but rather must determine whether each
factual bases supplies the element of claim or merely provides
context].)  
 
I.               
CCP § 425.17
Commercial Speech Threshold Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
Adam J. Tenser (“Tenser”) argues Defendants GNH Productions, Inc, et al.
(“Warner Defendants”) speech is commercial in nature, and Tenser’s interview
was a “pitch” that was also commercial in nature, and therefore, the motion
fails pursuant to the commercial speech exception to the anti-SLAPP statute
under CCP § 425.17(c).  The Court disagrees.
 
            “What
matters for purposes of the commercial versus noncommercial speech analysis is
whether the speech at issue is about the speaker's product or service or about
a competitor's product or service, whether the speech is intended to induce a
commercial transaction, and whether the intended audience includes an actual or
potential buyer for the goods or services.” (JAMS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 984, 995.) "[T]his narrow commercial speech exemption
applies to speech or conduct by a person engaged in the business of selling or
leasing goods or services when ... that challenged conduct pertains to the
business of the speaker or his or her competitor." (FilmOn.com Inc. v.
DoubleVerify Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 133, 147.)
 
            The
Court finds that the speech at issue within the complaint is not commercial.
Tenser seeks relief arising from dissemination of a video about the Blake
Leibel murder case in which Tenser was interviewed (the “Program”) (See FAC, ¶¶
12, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 34–38, 44–47.) The manner in which the distribution
of the Program occurred, or whether revenue was generated does not make the
Defendant’s speech commercial in nature. This Program falls squarely within an exception
to the commercial speech exception. (See CCP § 425.17, subd. (d) [the
commercial speech exception does not apply to 
“[a]ny action … based upon the creation [or] dissemination … of any
dramatic … or artistic work,” including a “television program ….”]; see also Ingels
v. Westwood One Broad. Servs., Inc. (2009) 129 Cal. App. 4th 1050, 1067-68 [Senate
analysis described 425.17(d) as “exempt[ing] the news media and other media
defendants (such as the motion picture industry),” from this section for
underlying acts “involving the creation or dissemination of any works of a
motion picture or television studio. For claims arising from these activities,
the current SLAPP motion would remain available to these defendants.”].).
 
II.            
1st
Step of Anti-SLAPP Analysis – Defendants burden to show the challenged claim
arises from Defendants Constitutionally Protected Speech.
 
            On the first step of
the anti-SLAPP analysis , “courts are to consider the elements of the
challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and
consequently form the basis for liability.  The defendant’s burden is to
identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts
are protected under a statutorily defined category of protected
activity.”  (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
 
            “First, the moving defendant must
show that the challenged claim or claims arise from the defendant's
constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh v. Brown
(2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of identifying
all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong of
SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the
act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories
spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 
            The Warner Defendants argue Tenser’s
claims arise from the content and dissemination of the Program, thus the claims
arise from constitutionally protected speech within the broad scope of CCP §
425.16. (Motion, p. 16.) Tenser argues the claims arise do not arise from the content
or creation of the Program, but to the Warner Defendants’ “failure to obtain
authorization for use of [Tenser’s] identity on Youtube.com,” and for “cataloguing
the 2016 Video on Google’s video sharing platform Youtube.com for commercial
exploitation without obtaining [Tenser’s] consent.” (Oppo., p. 14.)
 
            The Court finds that Tenser’s claims
the arise from constitutionally protected speech, under CCP § 425.16(e)(4), the
subsection which applies to “conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the
constitutional right … of free speech in connection with a public issue or an
issue of public interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subs., (e)(4).)  Within each of the causes of action in FAC, Tenser
alleges the claims specifically arise from the creation and distribution of the
Program. (See FAC, ¶ 25 [privacy claim based on “us[e] and authorizing use of
[Plaintiff’s] identity” in the Program]; FAC, ¶ 38 [fraud claim purporting to
arise from posting of Program on YouTube, and for “assigning or licensing” the
Program]; FAC,  ¶ 47 [alleging Defendants
engaged in unfair competition by using Plaintiff’s “name, voice and photograph”
in the Program “for commercial exploitation”].) The Program’s content focused
on the reporting of a high-profile criminal case including comments made by
Tenser, a long-time friend and legal representative of the accused. (FAC,
¶ 12, 14; Exh., 1–5.) “[N]ews reporting is free speech,” for the purposes
of the SLAPP statute. (Sipple v. Found. For Nat’l Progress (1999) 71
Cal. App. 4th 226, 240; see also Lieberman v. KCOP Television, Inc.
(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 156, 164 [“News reports concerning current criminal
activity serve important public interests.”].) 
            
            Tenser’s status as a non-celebrity,
or not holding himself out as a public figure is irrelevant because the Warner
Defendants are “not required to show a specific public interest” in Tensor. (Doe
v. Gangland Productions, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 730 F.3d 946, 955; see also Tamkin
v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 133, 144 [finding “no
requirement in the anti-SLAPP statute that the plaintiff's persona be a matter
of public interest.”] Furthermore, the high-profile criminal was extensively
covered by the media, including new reports about Tenser, thus demonstrating
public interest in the matter. (See Exhs. 4–5; Cross v. Cooper (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 357, 378 fn. 13, as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 4,
2011) [“extensive media coverage” of speech established public interest]; Sipple,
supra, 71 Cal. App. 4th at 238–39 [“public interest can be ‘evidenced by
media coverage’”].)
 
            Thus, the Warner Defendants have met
their SLAPP statute first prong burden of establishing Tenser’s claims arise
from constitutionally protected speech.
 
III.          
2nd
Step of Anti-SLAPP Analysis – Plaintiff’s Burden to probability of prevailing
on the claims
 
            Once defendant demonstrates that a
cause of action arises from protected conduct, the plaintiff must demonstrate
that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient
prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence
submitted by the plaintiff is credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88–89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits
early intervention in lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that
implicate free speech concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct
discovery, the plaintiff's burden of establishing a probability of prevailing
is not high: We do not weigh credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the
evidence. Instead, we accept as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff
and assess the defendant's evidence only to determine if it defeats the
plaintiff's submission as a matter of law.  Only a cause of action that
lacks ‘even minimal merit' constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v.
Gradient Analytics, Inc. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)
 
            “The second prong of the statute
deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated a probability of prevailing
on the claim.  Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the superior
court, in making these determinations, considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting
and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense
is based.’ For purposes of an anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the
pleadings and evidence submitted by both sides, but does not weigh credibility
or compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to
accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need
only establish that his or her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken
as a SLAPP.  With these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause
of action under the anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal
merit.”  (Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)
 
            The “probability of prevailing” is
tested by the same standard governing a motion for summary judgment, nonsuit,
or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's
burden to make a prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment in
plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads Investors, L.P. v. Federal National
Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 757, 785; Taus v. Loftus
(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a “summary-judgment-like
procedure”].)     
 
            Tenser’s does not supply any admissible
evidence to substantiate his claims, and his only argument is that the Warner
Defendants did not supply any evidence or declarations which defeat each cause
of action as a matter of law. (Oppo., p. 21.) However, it is not the Warner Defendants
burden to prove the probability that Warner Defendants will defeat the claims
as a matter of law.  To meet the burden
of the SLAPP’s second prong, Tenser is statutorily required to show “competent
and admissible evidence, that [he] would probably prevail on,” on his claims. (Macias
v. Hartwell (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 669, 675; see CCP § 425.16, subd. (b).)  
 
            Regardless, based on the allegations
of Tenser’s complaint, the Program is an undisputed “expressive work” that bars
all of Tenser’s claims under the First Amendment. “Under the First Amendment, a
cause of action for appropriation of another's “name and likeness may not be
maintained” against “expressive works, whether factual or fictional.” (Daly
v. Viacom, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2002) 238 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1123; see Guglielmi
v. Spelling-Goldberg Prods. (1979) 25 Cal. 3d. 860, 871–72 (Bird, J.
concurring) [“Whether the publication involved was factual and biographicalor
fictional, the right of publicity has not been held to outweigh the value of
free expression.”] Tenser’s claims arise from the
alleged appropriation and distribution of his name and likeness within the
Program, and thus all claims have no probability of prevailing. Furthermore,
the Warner Defendants had no duty to obtain a written clearance from Tensor as
claimed by Tensor in the FAC. (See De Havilland v. FX Networks, LLC
(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 845, 861 [“First Amendment simply does not require such
acquisition agreements”].) 
 
            Additionally, Tensor’s 3rd
cause of action fails because a claim based on Business & Professions Code
§§ 17200, et seq., California’s unfair competition law applies to commercial
speech only. The claim is related to the Program which is noncommercial speech
and thus cannot meet the requirement for unlawful, unfair or fraudulent conduct
under the UCL. (See Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation of
America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 342, 350 [striking Section 17200 claim;
finding statements were noncommercial speech, outside the scope of the false
advertising law].) Commercial speech is “usually defined as speech that does no
more than propose a commercial transaction.” (Id. at p. 343.)  The Program, as analyzed above, involves
noncommercial speech regarding a topic of public interest, in this instance, a
high-profile criminal trial. Thus, Tensor’s 3rd cause of action for
unfair competition not only fails under the First Amendment bar on expressive
speech, but fails as a matter of law since the speech involved is noncommercial
in nature. 
 
            The
Court finds Tensor has not met his burden to prove the probability of
prevailing on his claims. Thus, the Warner Defendant’s SLAPP motion is GRANTED
on all claims in the FAC.
