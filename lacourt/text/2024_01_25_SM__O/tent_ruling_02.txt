Jamshid Goltche, 26 Global Infinity, LLC and Rodeo Enterprises, LLC Demurrer to
1st, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th,
12th, and 13th causes of action are OVERRULED. Defendants
Jamshid Goltche, 26 Global Infinity, LLC and Rodeo Enterprises, LLC Demurrer to
the 4th cause of action for IIED is MOOT as the Plaintiff Ebby
Shakib dismissed the cause of action on 9-26-23. Plaintiff Ebby Shakib has
successfully plead all the elements of the 1st, 6th, 8th,
10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th causes
of action in the FAC. 
 
Defendants Jamshid Goltche, 26
Global Infinity, LLC and Rodeo Enterprises, LLC Request for Judicial Notice of
the MOU is DENIED.
 
I.               
1st cause of action—Breach of Written
Contract - OVERRULED
 
The essential elements of breach of
contract are “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff." (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.)
 
            Plaintiff
Ebby Shakib (“Shakib”) pleads an existence of a contract through stating Shakib
and Defendant Jamshid Golche (“Goltche”) entered into a written Memorandum of
understanding (“MOU”), modifying the partnership previously entered into. (FAC,
¶ 41.)  Shakib pleads the contents of the
MOU in regards to the change of ownership percentage between Shakib and Golche,
the voting power remaining 50/50, the debt to Shakib, and the date in which
Shakib should be paid that debt. (FAC, ¶¶ 42–55.) Shakib pleads the debt was
not paid in full by December 31, 2018 thus pleading breach. (FAC, ¶ 132.) Damages
are plead by stating “remaining amount of the Debt to Shakib can only be
ascertained by an accounting.” (FAC, ¶ 133.) Thus, elements of a breach of
contract are properly plead. 
 
            The Court
finds the Defendants Jamshid Goltche, 26 Global Infinity, LLC and Rodeo
Enterprises, LLC (the “Goltche Defendants”) demurrer to the first cause of
action is OVERRULED.
            
II.            
4th cause of action—Intentional
Infliction Of Emotional Distress –  MOOT
as cause of action was dismissed on 9-26-23
 
This cause of action was dismissed
by Shakib on 9-26-23. (See 9-26-23 Request for Dismissal.) The demurrer to the
fourth cause of action for IIED is MOOT. 
 
III.          
6th cause of action - Conversion
(Derivative) and 7th cause of action - Penal Code § 496(C) Damages
(Derivative)
 
            “Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.  The
elements of a conversion are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to
possession of the property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant's
conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3)
damages.  It is not necessary that there be a manual taking of the
property; it is only necessary to show an assumption of control or ownership
over the property, or that the alleged converter has applied the property to
his own use.”  (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 441, 451-452.)
 
            “Every
person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been
obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to
be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in
concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner, knowing the
property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment in a
county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision
(h) of Section 1170.” (Pen. Code §496(a).)
 
            Theft is
defined in Penal Code §484(a). “Every person who shall feloniously steal, take,
carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another,
or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him
or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent
representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or
personal property…is guilty of theft.” Pen. Code §484(a).
 
            Shakib pleads
the derivative cause of action is being brought on behalf of the partnership.
(FAC ¶ 180.) Shakib pleads the portions of the entities owned by Shakib and
Goltche “assets of the Partnership.” (FAC, ¶ 35.) Shakib pleads “[p]ursuant to
the Partnership Agreement, Shakib and Goltche formed a number of legal entities
(‘Entities’) and have become shareholders, directors, and officers or members
and managers of said entities to be engaged in the Partnership’s business.”
(FAC, ¶ 33.) Shakib pleads “Goltche took Partnership assets for his own
personal use without the consent of Shakib,” and, “Goltche took Partnership
assets for the use of 26 Global, Rodeo, and Does 1 through 50 without the
consent of Shakib” (FAC, ¶¶ 174–175.) Shakib pleads the Goltche Defendants knowingly
“obtained assets from the Partnership in a manner constituting theft.”
(FAC,  ¶¶ 182–86.) Shakib pleads the
damages can only be ascertained by an accounting, and estimates damages “to be
$50 million.” (FAC, ¶¶ 178–179.)  Thus,
all the elements of conversion and a Penal Code § 484 claim are properly plead
as to the derivative action. 
 
            Thus, the
Court finds the Goltche Defendants’ demurrer to the 6th and 7th
causes of action are OVERRULED. 
 
 
IV.       8th cause of action - Quiet
Title To Personal Property (Derivative) – OVERRULED
 
            Under that CCP §761.020, the elements of a quiet title
claim are (a) A description of the property that is the subject of the action;
(b) The title of the plaintiff as to which a determination under this chapter
is sought and the basis of the title; (c) The adverse claims to the title of
the plaintiff against which a determination is sought; (d) The date as of which
the determination is sought; (e) A prayer for the determination of the title of
the plaintiff against the adverse claims. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.)
 
            “The date [as to which the determination of title is
sought] is to be the date of filing the complaint or, if the plaintiff so
chooses, an earlier date.” (Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. McGurk
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 201, 213.)
 
            Shakib describes the property subject to the action through
stating facts regarding the creation of 26 Global Infinity, LLC (“Global”) and
Rodeo Credit Enterprises LLC (“Rodeo”),   and the Goltche Defendants diverting
Partnership funds to 26 Global Infinity, LLC (“Global”) and Rodeo Credit
Enterprises LLC (“Rodeo”). (FAC, ¶¶ 87–93, 104–109, 191.)  Shakib alleges the Partnership’s claim to the
title when pleading “[b]y virtue of its (involuntary) contributions to 26
Global and Rodeo, the Partnership is the true owner of Goltche’s, 26 Global’s,
Rodeo’s and Does 1 through 50’s interests in 26 Global and Rodeo,” and, “[b]y
virtue of its (involuntary) contributions to these entities, the Partnership is
the true owner of Goltche’s, 26 Global’s, Rodeo’s and Does 1 through 50’s
interests in these other entitles.” (FAC, ¶¶ 192–194.) 
 
            The date of which determination is sought is not plead
within the FAC but that date is implied as the date the complaint was filed,
12-15-22.  (See Deutsche Bank National
Trust Co. v. McGurk (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 201, 213 [“The date [as to which
the determination of title is sought] is to be the date of filing the complaint
or, if the plaintiff so chooses, an earlier date.”]
 
            Thus, all elements of quiet title have been plead, and the
Goltche Defendants demurrer to the 8th cause of action is OVERRULED.

 
 
V.   
      10th
cause of action – breach of fiduciary duty, 11th cause of action –
conversion, 12th cause of action- Penal Code § 496, 13th cause
of action – accounting
 
            Goltche
does not argue the 10th through 13th causes of action
elements are not properly plead, but argues the Shakib does not have standing
to bring the claims on behalf of the entities, and the cause of action are
uncertain because the “FAC lumps all fourteen entities together.” (Demurrer, p.
10:26–28.) However, Shakib pleads demand futility. (FAC, ¶ 123.) Shakib pleads he
is a member of the limited liability entities in question (FAC, ¶ 202), and that
each LLC is member-managed, managed by either Goltche alone or both Goltche and
Shakib (FAC, ¶¶ 203–205). Thus, Shakib as a member of the LLC’s, has standing
to bring the 10th through 13th causes of action as a
derivative claim. 
 
            The Goltche
Defendants have responded to the specific causes of action by successfully
moving to appoint a referee for an accounting determination for all the LLC
defendants and thus the FAC is not so incomprehensible that Goltche Defendants cannot
reasonably respond. (See A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc.
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695 [“Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored, and
are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.”].) The Court finds the causes of
action are not uncertain.
 
            Thus, the
Goltche Defendants’ demurrer to the 10th through 13th
causes of action are OVERRULED.
