I. BACKGROUND
On April 29, 2022, Paul Falzon (Plaintiff) filed a
Complaint against his former employers. The operative Third Amended Complaint
(TAC) alleges five causes of action: (1) Retaliation in violation of Lab. Code
§1102.5; (2) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy; (3)
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (4) Negligent
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (5) Failure to Provide
Personnel Files in violation of Lab. Code §1198.5.
The motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
from Defendant SMG Holdings, Inc. for Production of Documents to Set One (the
Motion). Plaintiff filed a notice of Non-Opposition on July 8, 2024.     
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
Legal
Standard
            “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party making the demand may move for
an order compelling response to the demand. (c) Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2031.300)
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff provides the Declaration
of Patricio T.D. Barrera (Barrera Decl.) which states that on September 22,
2023, Plaintiff served the initial Request for Production of Documents, Set 1.
Barrera Decl., ¶3.) After an extension was granted, unverified responses were
delivered on November 7, 2023. (Barrera Decl., ¶4.) Plaintiff contends that
these responses were simply boilerplate objections. (Barrera Decl., ¶7.) As of
the date of filing the instant Motion on November 29, 2023, no further
responses were received. Therefore, the Motion is granted, and sanctions are
warranted. 
 
Sanctions
            Plaintiff’s counsel provides the
following calculations:
·      
Counsel Patricio Barrera hourly fee is $850.00 
·      
The Motion was initially drafted by attorney David Saldana whose
hourly rate is $650 per hour
·      
David Saldana spent 6 hours drafting the Motion
·      
Counsel Patricio Barrera spent 3 hours on the Motion
·      
Counsel anticipated spending another 1 hour drafting a reply and
attending the hearing
·      
Counsel incurred a $60.00 filing fee
·      
Counsel requests in total $7,165.00
 
            Considering no opposition nor reply
was filed, and the routine nature of the Motion, the Court will impose
sanctions against Defendant SMG
Holdings, Inc. and award them to Plaintiff in the amount of $2,610.00.
 

III. CONCLUSION
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
from Defendant SMG Holdings, Inc. for Production of Documents to Set One is GRANTED. Compliance within 20 days.
 
The Court will impose sanctions against Defendant SMG Holdings, Inc. and award them to
Plaintiff in the amount of $2,610.00.
Responses and the monetary
sanctions are due within 10 days of the date of this order.
