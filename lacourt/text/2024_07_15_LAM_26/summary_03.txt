```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the second amended complaint is sustained, which means that the complaint does not state a valid cause of action. The judge grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the lack of specificity in the complaint regarding the alleged contract and the lack of particularity in the allegations of fraud. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's own allegations contradict the conclusion that a contract existed between the parties. The judge's ruling is intended to give the plaintiff an opportunity to cure the defects in the complaint and re-file it.
