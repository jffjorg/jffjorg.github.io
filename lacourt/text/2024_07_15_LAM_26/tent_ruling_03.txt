I. BACKGROUND
 
Factual &
Procedural Background
            On April 20,
2023, Andrew Friedman (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Wire Industries
(Wire), Zachary Doctor (Doctor), and Guy Dotan (Dotan, collectively,
Defendants) alleging breach of contract and fraud. On May 16, 2023, a First
Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed, followed by the operative Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) filed on August 28, 2023. 
            
            The SAC alleges
that on May 12, 2021, Plaintiff spoke with Dotan and Doctor about the position
of Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at Wire. (SAC, ¶19.) Plaintiff then alleges
that the parties reached an agreement that, when Wire received adequate
funding, Plaintiff would be employed as CTO with a salary of $240,000.00 per
year for three years with a 15% equity stake in the company (the Employment
Agreement). (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that although the Agreement was
never memorialized in writing the agreement had been reached orally on May 12,
2021. Plaintiff alleges that further discussions regarding the terms of
Plaintiff’s employment and an agreement regarding shares in the company (Shares
Agreement) occurred on May 18, 2021. (SAC, ¶21.) Plaintiff alleges that during
this period, Plaintiff turned down at least one job offer. (SAC, ¶24.) In April
of 2022, Wire received adequate funding, however, in September of 2022, Dotan
informed Plaintiff that they would not be hiring anyone for the CTO position.
Plaintiff then filed suit. 
            
            The SAC alleges
the following causes of action:
1.     Breach of
Oral Contract (as against all defendants)
2.     Breach of
Implied Contract (as against all defendants)
3.     Intentional
Misrepresentation (as against all defendants)
            
            The motion now
before the Court is Defendants’ Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the motion, and Defendants file a reply.  
 
Meet and Confer
            “Before filing a demurrer…the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections
to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §430.41(a).) Defendants offer
the Declaration of Darin T. Beffa (Beffa Decl.) which states that the parties
conferred several times, including a final time with the Court at a hearing on
October 27, 2023, however, the parties did not reach an agreement as to the
issues Defendants expressed with the SAC, therefore, Defendants filed this
demurrer. Nonetheless, the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. §430.41(a) have been
satisfied, therefore the Court will now turn its attention to the
demurrer.  
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
A.     Legal
Standard for Demurrer
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on
the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading
that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal 3d 311,
318.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking
demurrers”). (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881.)
A demurrer
for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th
1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 968, 994.) 
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies
only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.”  (SKF Farms v. Superior Ct.
(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.)
 
B.     Breach of Oral Contract & Breach of
Implied Contract – 
            To state a
cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish
“(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.) If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written
contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a
copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.”
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.)
In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)
            
            Upon
Demurrer, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s own allegations contradict the
conclusion that a contract existed, specifically that in both the initial
Complaint and the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that: “On or about May 18, 2021, Dotan
contacted Plaintiff on behalf of Defendant in order to ascertain Plaintiff’s
desired compensation as CTO. Defendant even e-mailed Plaintiff the specific
terms regarding their offer to be the CTO.” (Complaint and FAC, ¶19.)
Defendants argue that a defect in the pleadings cannot be cured by omitting the
allegations in a subsequent pleading without explanation, citing to Hendy v. Losse, (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742-743. The Court
agrees. Although plaintiffs are permitted to cure defects, where an amended
complaint attempts to avoid defects set forth in a prior complaint by ignoring
them, the Court can examine the pleadings to ascertain whether prior complaints
were merely a sham. (Vallejo Development Co. v. Beck Development Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946.) Here, Plaintiff provides no explanation
for why the details of further negotiations regarding the Employment Agreement
were omitted in the SAC, but present in the initial Complaint and the FAC.   
            
            Additionally,
although Plaintiff alleges a contract existed, the SAC fails to demonstrate the
offer, acceptance, or consideration that makes up the contract. The Complaint
pleads that Plaintiff would be hired in the future, but there is no indication
of consideration for this alleged promise. Nor does the Complaint provide any
information on when the negotiations stopped and the Employment Agreement was
reached, for it appears that after May 12, 2021 when the Employment Agreement
was allegedly reached, the parties were still engaged in discussions regarding
the terms of employment as CTO. (SAC, ¶21 [“On May 18, 2021, DEFENDANTS engaged
Plaintiff in further discussions regarding terms of Plaintiff’s employment.”])
The Complaint fails to harmonize these two opposing allegations. Without
allegations properly alleging a contract existed both the first and second
causes of action fall to demurrer.      
 
C.     Intentional
Misrepresentation – 
            “The elements of a cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its
falsity, (3) with the intent to induce another’s reliance on the
misrepresentation, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting
damage.” (Daniels v. Select Portfolio
Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.) The facts constituting
the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every
element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will
not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud
against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons
allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
            
            The third cause of action falls to
demurrer because the SAC fails to plead the second element of knowledge of its
falsity and the cause of action lacks the required particularity demanded by
causes of action grounded in fraud. 
            
            First, it is unclear from the SAC
whether Defendants knew that they would not be able to hire Plaintiff at the
time negotiations were taking place. In fact, the SAC even alleges that
Defendants were engaged in discussions and working with an attorney to draft
the Shares Agreement. (SAC, ¶22.) Second, the SAC alleges the third cause of
action against all Defendants, including Wire. This mandates that the SAC plead
the names of the persons who made the statement on behalf of Wire, what was
said, and when it was said. However, the SAC only provides verbal
representations were made by Dotan and Doctor telephonically during the
negotiation stage. (SAC, ¶40.) As aforementioned, these negotiations, appear to
be nothing more than negotiations. A promise to hire is unclear from the SAC.
The rest of the allegations in the third cause of action provide no specifics,
but only that “Defendants” made further representations. Without more, the
third cause of action falls to demurrer. 

 
D.     Leave to
Amend - 
            Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]. As there is
reasonable possibility of amendment, the Court will grant Plaintiff 20 days to
amend.
 

III.CONCLUSION
            Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer
to the Second Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff is
granted 20 days leave to amend.
