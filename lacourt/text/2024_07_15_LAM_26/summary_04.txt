Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Unite Eurotherapy, Inc., filed a motion to strike paragraphs 30 and 31 of the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the complaint does not support a request for punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The court denied the motion, holding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a request for punitive damages and that the plaintiff is entitled to seek both punitive damages and statutory penalties under California Penal Code Section 638.51. The court also held that the plaintiff may be awarded attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5 if she ultimately prevails in the action.
