Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The County of Los Angeles has moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff Sandra Garcia's complaint and all related cross-complaints. The County argues that Plaintiff's claims must fail as a matter of law because the County had no actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect and that the alleged defect, if it even existed, was trivial in nature. The County also argues that Plaintiff cannot show causation between the sidewalk's condition and her injury.

The Court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the County has met its initial burden by showing that there is no evidence of the County's negligence or causation. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's opposition fails to set forth specific facts showing the County's negligence or causation.

As a result, the Court grants the County's motion for summary judgment and finds that no triable issue of material fact exists as to the County's negligence. The County is ordered to give notice and submit a revised proposed order with the correct date of hearing, judicial officer, and department for the Court's signature.
