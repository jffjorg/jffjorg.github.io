 Case Number:  22STCV17299    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  B TENTATIVE RULINGPARVIN SHAKIBIAN, Plaintiff, vs. AJR Investment Partnership, LP, et al., Defendants. Case No.: 22STCV17299 Hearing Date: November 14, 2024Defendant AJR Investment Partnership, LLC (“Defendant”)’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Parvin Shakibian (“Plaintiff”)’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is granted. Plaintiff is ordered to serve Defendant with verified, objection-free responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of this hearing. Additionally, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay $585.00 in sanctions to defense counsel within 20 days.LEGAL STANDARDSIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilegeand work product. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel . . . responses to interrogatories or production demands, absent substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the sanctions unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Similarly, “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d) and (g).)DISCUSSIONDefendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $585.00, comprised of a $60.00 filing fee and three hours of work at an hourly rate of $175.00. (Cavanna Decl. ¶ 17.)Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s response to discovery because Plaintiff failed to provide any responses. Defendant propounded discovery requests on Plaintiff on September 6, 2023. (Cavanna Decl. ¶ 3; Exh A. [Form Interrogatories, Set One].) On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff requested an extension to November 7, 2023, which Defendant granted. (Ibid. at ¶ 4; Exh. B [correspondence].) In November 2023, Defendant granted Plaintiff an extension to January 12, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 6; Exh. D [correspondence].) On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff served discovery responses with objections only. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. F [responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One].) On April 17, 2024, an informal discovery conference was held, at which Plaintiff agreed to provide further verified responses by May 20, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 14; Exh. L [correspondence].) Plaintiff never provided further responses. (Ibid. at ¶ 16.)Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is granted. Plaintiff is to serve Defendant with verified, objection-free responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of this hearing.Considering Plaintiff’s total failure to comply with their discovery obligations, the Court orders Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions in the amount of $585.00, payable to defense counsel within 20 days of this hearing.Moving party to give notice.Dated: November 13, 2024Hon.
