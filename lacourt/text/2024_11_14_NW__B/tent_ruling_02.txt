PARTY: NoneEXPEDITED PETITION FOR APPROVAL OFMINOR’S COMPROMISE OF A DISPUTED CLAIM(CCP § 372, CRC Rules 7.950 and 7.950.5)TENTATIVE RULING:The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor DEONTRE LUTTON is GRANTED.ANALYSIS:I. BackgroundOn November 19, 2021, Plaintiff Deontre Lutton (“Claimant”), by and through hisguardian ad litem Breeana Moncrief (“Petitioner”), filed an action for general and motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Leylemirle J. Fregozo Hernandez (“Hernandez”), Victor M. Villarrealrodriguez (“Villarrealrodriguez”), and Does 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”). Petitioner was appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant on December 2, 2021.On June 7, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. Petitioner was ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of the Court’s notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of said notice. The Court notes that Petitioner failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.On October 9, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant expedited petition for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor.II. Legal StandardCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (CCP § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Prob. Code § 3500.Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claim, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.950)(italics added.)Under CRC Rule 7.950.5, an expedited petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain additional conditions.III. Discussion & ConclusionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive$15,000.00. (MC-350EX 11a.) Medical fees will be deducted in the amount of $296.31. (MC-350EX 13c.) Attorney’s fees will be deducted in the amount of $3,750.00, per Claimant’s retainer agreement. (MC-350EX 17c; Attachment 14a.) Filing costs will be deducted in the amount of $370.00. (MC-350EX 14b.) Claimant’s proposed net settlement amount is $10,583.69. (MC-350EX 16.)Additionally, Petitioner provides information and medical records that bear upon the reasonableness of the compromise. (MC-350EX Attachments 7 and 8.) Notably, Petitioner will also receive $15,000.00 from Defendants. (MC-350EX 12b.) Petitioner provides evidence bearing upon the reasonableness of the settlement apportionment. (MC-350EX Attachment 12.)Accordingly, the petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Deontre Lutton is GRANTED.Petitioner is ordered to give notice and file a corrected Order approving the compromise as follows: The proposed order on file reflects an incorrect attorney's fees amount. The petition requests$3,750.00, while the proposed order reflects $4,120.00; Item 8b is not complete; Item 10 is not complete.
