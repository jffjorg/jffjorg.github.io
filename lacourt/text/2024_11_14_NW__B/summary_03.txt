And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Mehran Temechi's motion for summary judgment. The Judge finds that Temechi has met his initial burden by showing that he was not involved in the underlying incident and cannot be held personally liable. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff Krystyn Chavez has failed to provide any evidence supporting their claim that Temechi was involved in the incident. Therefore, the Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Temechi, dismissing the claims against him.
