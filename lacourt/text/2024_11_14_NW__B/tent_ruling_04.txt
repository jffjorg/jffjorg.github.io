The FAC alleges that Claimant witnessed the attack on Benjamin. Claimant alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress against Defendant as a result.On September 27, 2022, Petitioner Hourash Khazan (“Petitioner”)’s application for appointment as Claimant’s guardian ad litem was granted.On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On August 23, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of settlement.On October 16, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on behalf of Claimant.ANALYSISPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant receive $20,000.00 from Defendant.Legal StandardAn enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.)Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:The court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code § 3601(a).)In cases pursuant to § 3601, “unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)DiscussionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $20,000.00 from Defendant. (MC-350 Item 10.) From this amount, $5,500 will be deducted for medical expenses, $5,000 for attorney’s fees, and $3,472.47 for costs. (MC-350 Items 12, 13, and 16c; Attachments 13b and 17a.) Attorney’s fees represent 25% of Claimant’s total settlement amount, as agreed upon in counsel’s retainer. (See Attachment 17a.) Accordingly, Claimant’s proposed net settlement amount is $6,027.53.The Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromisepursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (See MC-350 Attachment 8.) Benjamin is to receive a settlement amount of $30,000.00. (MC-350 Item 11b.) Attachment 11b(6) provides information on the settlement apportionment, noting Benjamin’s injuries as the reason for the larger settlement amount.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the petition to confirm minor’s compromise. Petitioner to submit Order approving the compromise and an Order to deposit funds into blocked account. The Court will set an OSC re: Minor’s Compromise Orders and an OSC re: proof of deposit at the hearing.Moving party to give notice.
