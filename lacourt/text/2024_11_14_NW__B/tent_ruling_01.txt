B DATE: NOVEMBER 14, 2024 TIME: 8:30 A.M. COMPLAINT FILED: MAY 29, 2020 TRIAL DATE: FEBRUARY 25, 2025I. BACKGROUNDOn May 29, 2020, Plaintiff Sandra Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the instant action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”), Drive Medical, Inc. (“Drive Medical”), and Does 1 to 100 alleging three causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property; (2) strict liability; and (3) negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on June 5, 2019, while seated in her walker being pushed by her daughter on a sidewalk adjoining 1731 W 122nd Street, Plaintiff encountered an uneven surface, and her walker folded unexpectedly. Plaintiff claims she fell and sustained injury as a result. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-16.)On September 10, 2020, the County filed a cross-complaint against Drive Medical for three causes of action: (1) indemnification; (2) apportionment of fault; and (3) declaratory relief.On October 6, 2023, the County filed the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint and all related cross-complaints.On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On November 7, 2024, the County filed their reply.II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTThe County moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint and all related cross-complaints. The County argues that Plaintiff’s claims must fail as a matter of law because the County had no actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect. (Motion p. 2:9-11.) The County also argues that the alleged defect, if it even existed, was trivial in nature, thereby relieving the County of any liability. (Ibid.)III. LEGAL STANDARDSIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the partyhas shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)A moving defendant may satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant must present evidence… showing that plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)Unless and until a defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.On the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro MedicoUrgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)IV. DISCUSSIONEvidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff’s October 30, 2024, evidentiary objections are overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.The County’s November 7, 2024, evidentiary objections to the declaration of Eris J. Barillas (“Barillas”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. To support their opposition, Plaintiff provided the declaration of Eris J. Barillas, a Certified Playground Safety Inspector (“CPSI”) from the National Recreation Park Association. (Barillas Decl. ¶ 2.) On August 25, 2023, Barillas inspected the location of the underlying incident and, based on this inspection, opined that the subject sidewalk’s uplift created a dangerous condition for Plaintiff. (Barillas Decl. ¶ 10.) However, an investigation of the subject location conducted four years after the underlying incident fails to have probative value. Therefore, the County’s objections are sustained.Defendant’s BurdenThe County meets their initial burden.To succeed on a claim of premises liability, plaintiff must show that: (1) defendant was the owner, occupant, or lessor of the subject premises; (2) defendant was negligent in the use, maintenance, or management of the subject premises; and (3) defendant’s negligence was the cause of injury, damage, loss or harm to plaintiff. (Brooks v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.) “Because the owner [of the premises] is not the insurer of[a] visitor’s personal safety [citation], the owner’s actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1206.) Landowner liability as to trivial defects is generally a question of fact, but where reasonable minds cannot differ, courts may rule that the landowner has no liability as a matter of law. (Ursino v. Big Boy Rests (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 394, 397-398.)It is undisputed that the County inspects and maintains the subject sidewalk. (County Separate Statement of Facts “C-SSF” No. 14.) The County asserts that it was not negligent in its maintenance and management of the sidewalk. The County Road Maintenance Superintendents conduct annual visual reviews of sidewalks within the County. (C-SSF No. 15; Desai Decl. Exh. C [Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 2-3].) These reviews constitute a “basic level of review to locate maintenance conditions that need attention.” (C-SSF No. 17; Patterson Decl. ¶ 4.) As sidewalks are reviewed, facilities maps are marked to indicate that the review has been completed. (C-SSF Nos. 19 and 20; Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 6 and 7.) At this time, the reviewing superintendent notes any substantial problems that have been corrected or any temporary protective measures taken. (C-SSF No. 21; Patterson Decl. ¶ 8.) Maintenance issues that the reviews note include “potholes, broken off corners, sunken areas, washouts and other damage, large rocks, broken/hanging tree limbs, foreign objects or substances obstructing the traveled way.” (C-SSF No. 24; Patterson Decl. ¶ 11.) The County conducted an annual review of the subject sidewalk twelve months prior to Plaintiff’s incident, on June 11, 2018. (C-SSF No. 27; Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 15 and 16.) During this review, the County did not see a condition which required significant correction, but instead simply required a patch, which was completed. (C-SSF No. 28; Patterson Decl. ¶ 17.) The County did not receive any complaints or work orders regarding the subject sidewalk between its June 11, 2018, review and Plaintiff’s incident. (C-SSF No. 30; Patterson Decl. ¶ 19.) Therefore,the County provides specific facts showing its proper maintenance and management of the subject sidewalk.The County also argues that Plaintiff cannot show causation between the sidewalk’s condition and her injury. Plaintiff sat on her walker with her back towards the direction she was being pushed and, thus, did not observe the condition of the sidewalk over which she was being pushed. (C-SSF No. 4; Desai Decl. Exh. A [Garcia Depo. at 41:18-42:13].) Plaintiff is unsure as to what caused her fall. (C-SSF No. 6; Gacia Depo. 46:19-23 and 52:14-53:17.) Plaintiff’s daughter also failed to see what caused the accident. (C-SSF No. 8; Desai Decl. Exh. B [Aguilar Depo. at 25:16-18.) Plaintiff’s daughter did not see anything that she was concerned about rolling over. (C-SSF No. 10; Aguilar Depo. at 25:25-26:2.) She did not feel the walker hit anything before Plaintiff fell off. (C-SSF No. 13; Aguilar Depo. at 28:4-7.) Therefore, the County sets forth facts showing that Plaintiff cannot prove causation between the sidewalk’s condition and Plaintiff’s injuries.Plaintiff’s BurdenThe burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact as to the County’s ownership, control, or maintenance of the subject sidewalk, and any causation between its condition and Plaintiff’s injuries.Plaintiff largely relies on the Barillas investigation to show the County’s negligent maintenance of the subject sidewalk. Barillas opines that an uplift at the subject sidewalk constituted a hazardous condition and therefore was the cause of, or contributed to, Plaintiff’s fall. (Plaintiff’s Response to County’s Separate Statement of Facts (“PR-CSSF”) No. 5.) However, as previously discussed, an investigation of the subject sidewalk four years after theunderlying incident holds little to no probative value.Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Plaintiff and her daughter cannot be expected to prove causation because they are not experts. However, pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code § 800, witnesses that are not testifying as experts may provide opinions that are “(a) [ra]tionally based on the perception of the witness; and (b) [h]elpful to a clear understanding of [their] testimony.” (Cal. Evid. Code § 800.) Plaintiff and her daughter provide lay person testimony based on their perception of the subject sidewalk’s condition and what possibly caused Plaintiff’s fall. Therefore, the County appropriately relies on this testimony as relevant to Plaintiff’s ability to establish causation.Finally, Plaintiff argues that the June 11, 2018, inspection and repair does not pertain to the actual location of Plaintiff’s fall. Plaintiff relies on a Google Street View photo of the subject sidewalk taken in February 2019, which purports to show “an obvious vertical displacement that appears to be in need of repair.” (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts “P-SSF” No. 10; Plaintiff’s Exh. 1 Figure 1 [Barillas Decl.].) Plaintiff claims this vertical uplift measures approximately 1” in height. (P-SSF No. 11; Plaintiff’s Exh. 1 Figure 1.) However, this claim is pure speculation and fails to set forth any evidence other than guesswork from an unauthenticated Google Street View photo. To defeat summary judgment, the plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 468.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at 467.)Here, Plaintiff fails to set forth specific facts showing the County’s negligence orcausation. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to meet their burden.V. CONCLUSIONNo triable issue of material fact exists as to the County’s negligence. Accordingly, the County’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.Moving party is ordered to give notice and submit a revised proposed order with correct date of hearing, judicial officer and department for the Court’s signature.Dated: November 13, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
