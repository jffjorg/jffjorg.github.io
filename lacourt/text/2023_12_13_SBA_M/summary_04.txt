Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has granted the motion for relief from Gov. Code §945.4 and permission to file a late government claim filed by the plaintiff, Paul Workman. The plaintiff was injured in a bicycle accident on November 4, 2022, and filed a timely government claim against the City of Los Angeles on December 2, 2022. However, the plaintiff later discovered that the 11” vertical drop in the curb was constructed by the State of California and Caltrans, and the one-year limitation to file motions for relief from the six months deadline to file a government claim will expire prior to the 45-days for the denial or acceptance of the claim and/or request. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely present a claim was the result of counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and grants the motion for relief from Gov. Code §945.4 and permission to file a late government claim.
