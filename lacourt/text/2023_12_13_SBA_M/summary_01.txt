```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel the deposition of the person most qualified for Orb Tertius LLC, but has denied the motion without prejudice. The court finds that the deposition notice was properly noticed, but the motion does not comply with the requirements of CCP §2025.450(b) as it does not set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of documents and is not accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. The court declines to award sanctions, despite plaintiff's request, due to the ruling on the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
