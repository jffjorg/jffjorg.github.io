BACKGROUND
On April
19, 2023, plaintiff Paul Workman filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles,
T.C. Real Estate Ltd., and Coral Realty, Inc. for dangerous condition of public
property and negligence.  Plaintiff
alleges that on November 4, 2022, plaintiff was riding his bicycle through the
parking lot intending to ride onto the city sidewalk to continue his
journey.  However, as plaintiff rode from
the parking lot toward the nearest crosswalk by the city sidewalk, the front
wheel of his bicycle reached a drop of approximately 11 inches between surface
of the parking lot and the surface of the city sidewalk.  Said drop was a concealed trap not marked in
any meaningful manner and constituted a dangerous condition since the drop in
elevation between the parking lot and the sidewalk could not be seen by
plaintiff.  As a result, plaintiff
flipped off his bicycle onto the sidewalk and sustained serious injuries.
On June
9, 2023, T.C. Real Estate and Ltd. and Coral Realty, Inc. filed a
cross-complaint against City of Los Angeles.
On July
3, 2023, City of Los Angeles filed a cross-complaint against T.C. Real Estate
and Coral Realty.
On
September 12, 2023, plaintiff filed an amendment designating ADR/Preferred
Business Properties as Doe 1.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Before a suit for damages may be
filed against a public entity, a claimant must present a timely written claim
to the public entity and the claim must have been acted upon by the board or
deemed rejected.  Gov. Code §945.4; Munoz
v. State of Cal. (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 1777.  A claim relating to a cause of action for
injury to person or personal property must be presented to the public entity
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.  Gov. Code §911.2.  Munoz, supra, 33 Cal. App. 4th
at 1777.
If a claimant fails to present a
claim within the statutory period, he may apply “within a reasonable time not
to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action” to the public
entity for leave to present a late claim. 
Gov. Code §911.4.  If the public
entity denies leave to present a late claim, a claimant may petition the Court
under Government Code §946.6 for relief from the requirements of Government
Code §945.4.  Munoz, supra, 33
Cal. App. 4th at 1777.
Additionally, a petition pursuant
to Government Code §946.6 must be “filed within six months after the
application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to Section
911.6.”  Gov. Code §946.6(b); see also City
of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal. App. 4th 621, 627.  This requirement is mandatory.  Lineaweaver v. S. Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.
(1983) 139 Cal. App. 3d 738, 741.
If the §946.6 petition is timely
filed, the court may relieve a claimant from the requirements of §945.4 if it
makes certain findings, including:  (1)
the claimant made a timely application to the public entity for leave to
present a late claim; (2) the application was denied; and (3) the failure to
timely present a claim was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect; and/or that the injured person was a minor during the claim period, or
incapacitated during the claim period, or deceased prior to the deadline for
filing a claim.  Gov. Code
§946.6(c).  In determining whether relief
is warranted under Government Code §946.6, the court considers the petition,
any affidavits submitted in support of or in opposition to the petition, and
any other evidence presented at the hearing. 
Gov. Code §946.6(e); Munoz, supra, 33 Cal. App. 4th at 1778.
“The
showing required for relief under [§] 946.6 because of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect is the same as required under [CCP] [§] 473 for
relieving a party from a default judgment.” 
Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435.
DISCUSSION
            Under
Gov. Code §946.6, plaintiff Paul Workman requests relief from the government
claims statute under Gov. Code §945.4 as against State of California.
            As
alleged in the complaint, the incident occurred on November 4, 2022.  The herein motion for relief was filed on
October 27, 2023.
            Plaintiff
explains that on December 2, 2022, plaintiff filed a timely government claim
against defendant City of Los Angeles, believing that the sidewalk and its curb
where the incident occurred, were within the possession and control of the City
of Los Angeles.  The City of Los Angeles
denied the claim on January 25, 2023, but did not indicate that the denial was
based on lack of possession or control over the site of the incident.  During discovery, defendants T.C. Real Estate
and Coral Realty responded on August 21, 2023 to plaintiff’s special
interrogatories that “based on information and belief the City of Los Angeles
or its contractors constructed the vertical drop.”  On September 26, 2023, defendant City of Los
Angeles responded to plaintiff’s form interrogatories that “[t]he construction
of the vertical drop was performed by State of California [Caltrans] or by
persons acting on behalf of the State of California” and that “[t]he subject
vertical drop is the property of State of California.”  Plaintiff argues that from the date of his
injuries through September 26, 2023, there was no reasonable way for plaintiff
to know that the 11” vertical drop in the curb was constructed by the State of
California and its department Caltrans.
            Plaintiff
asserts that on October 27, 2023, plaintiff filed a government claim against
the State of California and Caltrans, along with a Request for Leave to Present
a Late Claim.  Plaintiff contends that
due to the fact that the one-year limitation to file motions for relief from
the six months deadline to file a government claim will expire prior to the
45-days for the denial or acceptance of the claim and/or request, he seeks
relief.
The court
finds that the §946.6
petition was timely filed and the claimant made a timely application to the
public entity (State of California and Caltrans) for leave to present a late
claim.  Although the court is unaware
whether the State denied the application, the failure to timely present a claim
was the result of counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
            The
motion is thus GRANTED.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice of ruling.
