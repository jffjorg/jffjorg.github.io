And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving a plaintiff who purchased a used, certified pre-owned 2017 Honda Pilot. The defendant demurred to the second cause of action (fraudulent inducement) and moved to strike references to punitive damages in the first amended complaint. The judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent inducement by concealment were sufficient. The judge also denied the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the allegations were sufficient to maintain a punitive damages claim. The judge set the jury trial date to December 9, 2025, and the final status conference to November 20, 2025. The judge also ordered the parties to comply with the Court's Trial Preparation Order and to personally appear in court for the final status conference with a copy of their lodged binders.
