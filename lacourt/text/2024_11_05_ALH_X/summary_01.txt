**Significant Statements**
```
The Court agrees that certain third-party privacy interests may require redactions, but any responses by Hules should be disclosed.
The Commission's objections to the subpoena are not persuasive, and the Court finds that the Commission must comply with the majority of Plaintiff's subpoena requests.
The Court finds that certain records may be protected by the Deliberative Process privilege, but withholding "purely factual, investigative" documents is only proper upon an additional showing that the requests are "actually . . . related to the process by which policies are formulated" or "inextricably intertwined with policy-making processes."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) to produce all records related to defendant Jeremy Hules in response to the plaintiff's deposition subpoena. The commission had objected to the subpoena, claiming that it sought confidential information, privileged information, and information subject to statutory privacy protections. However, the judge finds that the commission's objections are not persuasive and that the commission must comply with the majority of the plaintiff's subpoena requests.

The judge notes that certain third-party privacy interests may require redactions, but any responses by Hules should be disclosed. The judge also finds that certain records may be protected by the Deliberative Process privilege, but withholding "purely factual, investigative" documents is only proper upon an additional showing that the requests are "actually . . . related to the process by which policies are formulated" or "inextricably intertwined with policy-making processes."

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California Education Code, the Evidence Code, and other relevant laws and statutes. The ruling is subject to modification or reversal at the hearing on November 5, 2024.
