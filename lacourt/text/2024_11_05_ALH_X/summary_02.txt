Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash the subpoena and modifies the subpoena request. The court finds that the subpoena seeks information and documents from a liability insurer's claim file, which is not discoverable in a third-party context due to work-product privilege. The court also finds that the subpoena seeks irrelevant and private information and that the defendant has shown the extent and seriousness of the prospective invasion of the right to privacy.

However, the court determines that the subpoena requests records which may be relevant to the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff learned in discovery that the HOA started a property damage insurance claim in November 2023, and the subpoena seeks records related to that claim. The court orders the defendant to provide a privilege log of any documents withheld and to comply with the order within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.

The court declines to award sanctions on behalf of either party and orders the moving party to give notice.
