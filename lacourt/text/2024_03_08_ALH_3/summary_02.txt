And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., in response to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Julia Sarabi. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant concealed the existence and nature of a defect in the computerized driver-assistance safety system of a new 2022 Honda Odyssey that the plaintiff purchased, and that she relied on the defendant's representations and marketing materials in making the purchase.

The court has ruled that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to establish a duty to disclose information to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to establish a fraud claim. Therefore, the court will overrule the defendant's demurrer on these grounds.

The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. The plaintiff's allegations of fraud are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and the defendant has not demonstrated that the plaintiff has failed to plead facts with requisite specificity to support this claim.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to submission by the parties and may be vacated or modified at the hearing on March 8, 2024.
