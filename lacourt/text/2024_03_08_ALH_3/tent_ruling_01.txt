This is a medical malpractice
action that was filed on April 26, 2022. 
Defendant Richard Dale Gentile, D.D.S. ( “Defendant”) filed two motions
on October 2, 2023, which seek orders: (1) compelling Plaintiff Rosevianney C.
Ogumsi (“Plaintiff”) to serve responses to Form Interrogatories (Set Two) and
(2) deeming the truth of the matters in Requests for Admission (Set One)
admitted.  Defendants also request the
Court impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiff is currently self-represented.
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) However, on December 4, 2023, Plaintiff
served responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set Two). Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel her responses is DENIED. 
Plaintiff also filed responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One) on December 4, 2023. Therefore,
Defendant’s motion for an order deeming admitted the truth of any matters
specified in those requests is DENIED. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
Nevertheless, Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions is GRANTED because Plaintiff failed to provide a timely
response to Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One). (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
Accordingly, Defendant’s request for
sanctions is GRANTED and the Court imposes sanctions on Plaintiff in the
reduced overall amount of $240, consisting of 2 hours at defense counsel’s
hourly rate of $180 and $60 in filing fees, to be paid within 20 days of the
date of this order. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
 
Dated
this 8th
 day of March 2024
