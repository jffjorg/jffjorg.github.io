III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
The function
of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as
to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (See
Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In
analyzing such motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify
the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has
negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) Thus, summary
judgment or summary adjudication is granted when, after the Court’s
consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable
inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist, and the moving party
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) [1]; Villa
v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.) 
As to each
claim as framed by the complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to negate or establish an essential element. (See Scalf v. D.B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
be denied where the moving party’s evidence does not prove all material facts,
even in the absence of any opposition or where the opposition is weak. (See
Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v.
Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384 & 387.) When a
plaintiff is the moving party, the plaintiff has a higher burden: it must “present
evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying
material fact more likely than not.” (See Aguilar, 25
Cal.4th at 845 (emphasis added).) “The burden of the moving party is to persuade
the court that there is no material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find.”
(PP Mortgage, Ltd. v. Bizar (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 773, 776 (emphasis in
original) (cleaned up).) 
Once the
moving party has met its burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
show via specific facts that a triable issue of material fact exists to a cause
of action or a defense thereto. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(o)(2).)
IV.     ANALYSIS 
A.            
Undisputed Material Facts
On or about June 2021, Plaintiff had a
consultation with Griffin over Zoom for cosmetic surgery. (See Spivak’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) No. 1.) On October 16,
2021, Plaintiff presented to Griffin at Squlpt, where Griffin performed her liposuction
surgery and Brazilian butt lift procedure. (See UMF Nos. 2-3, 5.) Spivak
was not present during the surgery on October 16, 2021, nor has Spivak ever
met, treated, or physically examined Plaintiff. (See UMF Nos. 7-8.) On
May 9, 2023, Plaintiff had a Zoom discussion with her lawyer and Spivak to “resolve
the complaints” that Plaintiff had with her surgery; the sole purpose of the
Zoom meeting was to resolve Plaintiff’s complaints about the surgery performed
by Griffin. (See UMF Nos. 12, 20.) During this Zoom discussion, Spivak
did not provide any treatment to Plaintiff; physically examine her; perform any
surgery or procedure on her; prescribe any medication for her; or provide any
recommendations for post-surgery care. (See UMF No. 13.)

B.            
No
Triable Issues of Material Fact Exist.
To state
a cause of action for medical malpractice, a plaintiff must allege (1) duty of
the professional to use skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the
profession possess and exercise commonly; (2) breach of that duty; (3) proximate
cause; and (4) actual loss or damage. (See Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente
Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 468, fn.2; Hanson v. Grode
(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 601, 606.)
The
elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) are: (1) that
defendant’s conduct was outrageous; (2) that defendant intended to cause
plaintiff emotional distress or that defendant acted with reckless disregard of
the probability that plaintiff would suffer emotional distress, knowing that
plaintiff was present when the conduct occurred; (3) that plaintiff suffered
severe emotional distress; and (4) that defendant’s conduct was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s severe emotional distress. (See Huntingdon
Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1259.) 
Spivak has met his initial
burden on summary judgment. Spivak submitted evidence demonstrating he was not
present the day of her surgery and did not provide treatment to Plaintiff (on
the day of the surgery or during the Zoom meeting) and thus did not breach the
applicable standard of care or cause injury to Plaintiff. (See Motion,
pg. 7; see also UMF Nos. 7-8, 13.) Spivak’s submitted evidence also
supports his argument he could not have intentionally caused Plaintiff
emotional distress, as the basis of Plaintiff’s IIED claim is the alleged
harassment she experienced during the surgery and the botched result of the
surgery. (See Motion, pg. 11.) Because Spivak was not present on the day
of the surgery, he could not have botched her surgery, nor could he have made
harassing comments towards Plaintiff during the surgery. (See id.) 
The burden thus shifts
to Plaintiff to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact. Plaintiff has not
met her burden. Plaintiff filed a separate statement of material facts on
January 15, 2025, the day before the hearing on Spivak’s Motion. (See Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“AUMF”).) Not only is Plaintiff’s
AUMF late, it is procedurally improper, as an opposing party’s separate
statement of material facts must respond “…to each of the material facts
contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if the opposing
party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed…” (Code Civ. Proc.
437c(b)(3)(emphasis added); see also Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(e)(2).)
Plaintiff’s AUMF only sets forth her proposed additional facts in opposition
and does not address Spivak’s UMF. For these reasons alone, Plaintiff has not
met her burden on summary judgment.
Even if the Court were
to consider Plaintiff’s AUMF or the referenced declarations, Plaintiff still
does not meet her burden. Plaintiff attempts to introduce two new legal
theories in opposition. Her AUMF implies Spivak’s liability is based on
Spivak’s supervisory role at Squlpt.
(See AUMF Nos. 1, 7.) Her Opposition, however, states “Dr. Spivak’s
participation in the Zoom meeting constituted the provision of medical advice”
and “Dr. Spivak’s statements during the Zoom meeting fell below the standard of
care.” (Opposition, pg. 3.) Her FAC does not allege Spivak’s liability based on
either of those legal theories. Pleading new legal theories, even if the
underlying papers are procedurally correct, is improper in opposition to a
motion for summary judgment. (See Champlin/GEI Wind Holdings, LLC v. Avery (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 218, 224-225.)
Accordingly, the Court
GRANTS Spivak’s Motion for Summary Judgment.
V.    
CONCLUSION
         
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court GRANTS Spivak’s Motion for Summary Judgment.
Accordingly, the Court dismisses Spivak from this action with prejudice. 
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
