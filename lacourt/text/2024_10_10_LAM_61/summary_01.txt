Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and the motion to strike portions of the SAC. The demurrer was filed by Ed Carrasco, who is a defendant in the case, and argues that the SAC does not allege facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the SAC does not allege actual reliance on the alleged misrepresentations made by Carrasco. The Judge also denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages filed by Allstate Insurance Company, finding that the SAC now includes allegations that Allstate's conduct was directed or ratified by its managers and managing agents, which satisfies the requirements for punitive damages.
