And here's a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the court in a case brought by plaintiff Hamilton against the Regents of the University of California, the University of California Police Department, and officers Salazar, Amezcua, and Carrillo. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated his civil rights by arresting him without probable cause and without a warrant, and that they used unreasonable force and issued coercive orders. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under the Bane and Ralph Acts. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the first cause of action, finding that the plaintiff failed to allege force, intimidation, or coercion separate from the arrest. The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action, finding that the plaintiff failed to allege violence or the threat of violence. Despite being given leave to amend, the plaintiff still fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under the Bane and Ralph Acts.
