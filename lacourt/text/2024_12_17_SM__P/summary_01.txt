And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Doe v. The Frederick P. Lenz Foundation, Case No. 23SMCV05954. The defendant has demurred and moved to strike portions of the complaint, including the alleged successor-in-interest theory and the prayer for punitive damages and fees.

The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the certificate of dissolution issued by Lakshmi, Inc. on April 15, 1987.

The judge has also denied the defendant's demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately alleges a successor-in-interest theory of liability and that the defendant is the successor-in-interest to Lakshmi, Inc. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the allegations of secondary liability.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the request for attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, finding that the lawsuit does not qualify for a fee award under this statute.

The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations of an indemnification agreement between the defendant and the executor of Lenz's estate, finding that these allegations are irrelevant.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on the tentative ruling for December 17, 2024.
