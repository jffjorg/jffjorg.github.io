Here,
Plaintiff has complied with all requirements for a default judgment.  
 
Plaintiff
seeks a judgment in the amount of $4,000.00 in statutory damages. Generally, a
plaintiff may obtain statutory damages for Unruh violations “if the plaintiff
personally encountered the violation on a particular occasion, or the plaintiff
was deterred from accessing a place of public accommodation on a particular
occasion.” (Civ. Code, § 55.56, subd. (b).) To establish that a plaintiff was
deterred, plaintiff must establish that plaintiff had actual knowledge of the
violations and that the violations would have denied plaintiff “full and equal
access” on that occasion. (Civ. Code, § 55.56, subd. (d).) Here, Plaintiff
submitted a declaration stating he visited Defendant’s restaurant on October
22, 2022 and personally encountered the ADA violation, specifically the lack of
toe clearance under the outdoor dining surfaces. (Whitaker Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.)
Plaintiff also seeks $6,355.00 in attorney fees and $2,149.22 in
costs as set forth in the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel. (Price Decl., Ex.
2.)
 
Since
Plaintiff has complied with the requirements, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment in the amount of $12,504.22.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
