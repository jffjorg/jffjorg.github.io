And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge in this case has denied the defendant's motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil case. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claimed damages fall below the $25,000 jurisdictional minimum. The judge found that the defendant had shown good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier, as the defendant needed to conduct initial discovery to assess the plaintiff's claimed damages. However, the judge did not find that the defendant had sufficiently shown that the plaintiff's general damages would not meet the jurisdictional minimum. The judge noted that the plaintiff's complaint alleged that she had suffered from physical and emotional pain and distress as a result of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant had not presented any evidence that would support a finding that the plaintiff's damages would not exceed $25,000. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion without prejudice.
