 Case Number:  22STCV33127    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  30 ISRRAEL RESENDEZ MARQUEZ, et al. vs RAYMOND GARCIATENTATIVEPlaintiffs Isrrael Resendez Marquez and Ricardo Camacho’s motions to compel Defendant to provide responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production for documents are GRANTED.Defendant Raymond Garcia is ordered to provide responses without objection to Defendant’s request for form interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and request for production, set one, within 20 days of this order.Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiffs served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant. (Juhn Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 1.) Responses were due on or before October 27, 2023 after extensions were granted to Defendant. (Id., ¶ 6.) To date, responses have not been provided. (Id., ¶ 9.)As Plaintiffs properly served discovery requests and Defendant has failed to serve responses, the Court finds Plaintiffs are entitled to a court order directing Defendant to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on Defendant. Therefore, the motions are granted.Plaintiffs also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) allow for sanctions when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motions were not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
