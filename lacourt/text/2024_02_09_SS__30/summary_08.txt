Significant Statements:
  - "A public entity…is subject to direct liability only as provided by statute or required by the state or federal Constitution."
  - "Direct tort liability of public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714."
  - "To state a claim against a public entity, every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer is sustained, meaning the complaint fails to state a claim against the public entity. The court finds that the plaintiff has not identified the statute providing for the public entity's liability for the alleged accident in the complaint. As a result, the public entity's immunity from liability is not waived. The court will allow the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint, as this is the first demurrer and there is a reasonably possibility of successfully amending the complaint.
