And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the motions of Plaintiffs Israel Resendez Marquez and Ricardo Camacho to compel Defendant Raymond Garcia to provide responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The Defendant is ordered to provide responses without objection within 20 days of the order. The Plaintiffs' request for sanctions is denied, as the Defendant did not oppose the motions. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs are entitled to a court order directing the Defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery requests served on him. The request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as the section does not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
