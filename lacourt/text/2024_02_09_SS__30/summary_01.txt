English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Temple Israel of Hollywood's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint adds allegations under the cause of action for breach of contract, relating to Charter's alleged breach of certain additional provisions in the lease agreement between Temple and Charter. The court finds that Temple has complied with the necessary procedures and that the delay in amending the complaint is not unwarranted. The court also finds that permitting Temple to file an amended complaint would not prejudice Charter. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments and grants the motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
