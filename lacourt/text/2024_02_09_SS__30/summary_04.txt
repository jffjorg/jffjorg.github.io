And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise settlement of a minor (KP) and an adult with a disability (Decole Snowball). The court finds the settlement to be reasonable and approves it for KP. However, the court cannot approve Decole's petition at this time due to defects in the proposed distribution of the settlement proceeds. Specifically, the court finds that the 40% fee request for Decole is excessive and unreasonably high. Instead, the court approves a 25% fee request for Decole, which is reasonable based on the factors set forth in Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b). The court also orders the payment of medical expenses and costs. The matter is continued for 60 days at 1:30 p.m. in Department SS-30, with counsel ordered to correct the defects by filing a corrected proposed order for Decole. Additionally, the court sets an OSC RE PROOF OF DEPOSIT (FOR KP) in 60 days in Department SS-30 at 8:30 a.m.
