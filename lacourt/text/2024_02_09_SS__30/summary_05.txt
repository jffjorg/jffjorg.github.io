Summary in English:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Cathy Mason regarding a demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles and George Anderson, who are defendants in a lawsuit filed by Cathy Mason. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the amended complaint, which alleges negligence and/or premises liability against the defendants. The Court finds that the amended complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action against the defendants and overrules the demurrer. The Court also disagrees with the defendants' argument that the original complaint did not state a valid cause of action against them. The relation back doctrine applies because the plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of the defendants' identity at the time the complaint was filed.
