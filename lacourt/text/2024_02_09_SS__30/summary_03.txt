Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to consolidate the case with a related case (21STCV26619) is continued. The plaintiff's motion was incomplete because the notice of motion was not filed in the related case, and the plaintiff's counsel had not been served with notice of the motion. The court finds that both cases arise from the same collision and involve the same cause of action for negligence, with the same defendants. The court will allow the plaintiff to file the notice of motion to consolidate in the related case and serve the plaintiff's counsel with the motion, and will then consider the motion at a later date.
