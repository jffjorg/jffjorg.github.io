And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has not yet ruled on the petition filed by J.R. to approve the compromise of a pending action on behalf of John Roe, as the court requires additional information. The court is deferring its ruling until the hearing on August 9, 2024, at which time J.R. is expected to address two specific issues. First, the court needs documentation regarding Claimant's mental and emotional injuries, including any doctor's reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. Second, the court is questioning the reasonableness of the 40% attorney's fee request, and J.R. is expected to provide justification for why this percentage is not excessive. The court notes that it will apply the California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, when evaluating the reasonableness of the attorney's fees.
