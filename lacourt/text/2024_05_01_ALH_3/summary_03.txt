And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a preliminary decision by the court regarding the demurrer filed by Defendant Li Cui, M.D. to Plaintiff's NIED claim. The court found that Defendant's demurrer on the ground that Plaintiff's NIED claim is untimely was overruled, as the applicable statute of limitations period is 2 years, not 1 year. However, the court sustained Defendant's demurrer on the ground that Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court found that Plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate that she was aware of Decedent's deteriorating condition or that Defendant had failed to provide necessary care. The court granted Plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend.
