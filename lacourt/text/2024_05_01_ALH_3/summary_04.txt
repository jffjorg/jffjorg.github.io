And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling addresses the motion of Joe Utzurrum, counsel for defendant Argiri Bratakos, to be relieved as counsel of record. The court notes that irreconcilable differences have arisen, and absent a showing of resulting prejudice, the motion should be granted. The court also notes that trial in this matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion. The proposed order does not state the defendant's current telephone number in Item 6, and the court requests that a new proposed order be submitted separately. The hearing on this matter is continued to May 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse."
