Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The plaintiff filed the motion on January 24, 2024, but failed to pay two filing fees and notify the parties of the correct hearing date. The court has found that the defendant was not served with the discovery requests, and therefore the court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel. The parties are required to file written submissions on the tentative ruling by email to the court. If no submissions are received, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar."
