English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Defendant, Katherine R. Harter, M.D., moved for summary judgment on grounds that the Plaintiff, Darryl Abbinante, cannot establish a triable issue of material fact regarding the alleged professional negligence. The Plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Park, testified that the Defendant's treatment met the standard of care. The Defendant's expert declaration, supported by evidence, demonstrated that the Defendant's treatment was consistent with the standard of care. Since the Plaintiff failed to present competing expert evidence, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not met their burden to raise a triable issue of material fact. The motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case is effectively dismissed.
