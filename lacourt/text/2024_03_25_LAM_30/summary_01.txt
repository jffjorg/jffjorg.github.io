English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to strike the fifth cause of action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint, which alleges negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, as well as the related language in the prayer for relief. The ruling is based on the waiver clause in the contract between the parties, which waives claims for consequential damages, including damages incurred by the owner for rental expenses, losses of use, income, profit, and reputation. The judge finds that the clause is clear and explicit and that the allegations in the fifth cause of action implicate the waiver clause. Additionally, the judge strikes the allegation of "loss of revenue" from Paragraph 65 of the First Amended Cross-Complaint, which is related to the sixth cause of action for unfair competition, as this claim is barred by the waiver language in the contract.
