Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the evidence presented by both parties and has granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Adjudication on the claim for punitive damages. The Court has found that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact and that Defendants have met their burden of showing that Frankie, the subject dog, exhibited no dangerous or violent propensities known by them. The Court has further found that the evidence presented by Plaintiff does not show that Defendants were aware of any potentially dangerous propensity of Frankie's. As a result, the Court has granted the Motion for Summary Adjudication and has ordered that Defendants give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
