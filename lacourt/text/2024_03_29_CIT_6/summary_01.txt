And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this slip-and-fall case. The defendant, Super Center Concepts, Inc. dba Superior Grocers, argued that they did not have actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition that caused the plaintiff, Amelita Reyes Diaz, to slip and fall on November 28, 2020. The defendant presented evidence that they conducted regular sweeps of the store floor, inspected the area in question less than an hour before the incident, and that a third-party customer spilled water on the ground, which was only on the ground for approximately 10 seconds before the plaintiff slipped and fell. The judge finds that this evidence shows that the defendant did not have notice of the hazardous condition and that the plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact. The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders the defendant to submit a proposed judgment.
