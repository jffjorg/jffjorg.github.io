And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for protective order, in part, and denied it, in part. The court finds that the plaintiffs have shown good cause to prevent additional depositions, but only insofar as they seek to limit the scope and duration of the depositions. The court orders that all depositions and related production requests of the plaintiffs be limited to matters that are not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, and that all depositions and related production requests of the plaintiffs be limited to discovery that is not available from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.

The court also finds that only the defendants who had not appeared in the action prior to the initial depositions may, without a court order, notice depositions of the plaintiffs. The remaining defendants would have to move for a court order permitting further depositions of the plaintiffs.

The court denies the motion insofar as it seeks to limit the depositions to written form, as depositions are an authorized method of discovery. The court also denies the motion insofar as it seeks to prevent all further depositions, as the defendants are entitled to take the plaintiffs' depositions.
