BACKGROUND 
 
            On December
13, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel initiated the process for scheduling depositions
by emailing defense counsel for Defendants and asking that they provide
availability for, among other witnesses, Defendant Victor Daniel Reyes Mendez.
(Silver Decl. ¶3; Exhibit B.)
 
            From January 6, 2023, to January 23,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel repeatedly requests dates for the depositions of
Defendant Victor Daniel Reyes Mendez. (Silver Decl. ¶4; Exhibit C.)
 
            On January 24, 2023, counsel for
Defendant Reyes Mendez provided March 14, 2023, for Defendant Reyes Mendez. (Silver
Decl. ¶5; Exhibit D.) 
 
On March 8, 2023, counsel for Defendant Kitross
contacted counsel for Plaintiff indicating a need to reschedule both
depositions scheduled for the following week due to staffing and trial. (Silver
Decl. ¶7; Exhibit E.) The next day, counsel for Plaintiff reinitiated the
process of scheduling the previously noticed depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶8;
Exhibit E.)
 
On March 27, 2023, the parties agreed to take the
Deposition of Defendant Reyes Mendez on April 26, 2023. (Silver Decl. ¶9;
Exhibit E.)
 
Depositions for the witnesses at issue were noticed
for March 28, 2023. (Silver Decl. ¶10; Exhibit F). 
 
On April 21, 2023, Counsel for Defendant Kitross
contacted counsel for Plaintiff indicating a need to reschedule both
depositions scheduled for the following week due to “a serious family medical
emergency.” Based on this representation, Plaintiff agreed to reschedule the
depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶11; Exhibit H.)
 
On May 1, 2023, to May 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
relayed availability and Counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez agreed to May 22,
2023, for Defendant Reyes Mendez’ deposition. Plaintiff waited a week for
counsel for Defendant Kitross to respond. (Silver Decl. ¶12; Exhibit H.)
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel conveyed an
intent to unilaterally notice the depositions for the deposition of Defendant
Victor Daniel Reyes Mendez for July 19, 2023. (Silver Decl. ¶16; Exhibit K.)
 
On June 23, 2023, Counsel for Defendant Kitross
responds and indicates the family emergency situation at their firm is ongoing
and involved a “life-or-death situation.” (Silver Decl. ¶17; Exhibit L.)
 
On June 26, 2023, Counsel for Defendant Kitross agreed
to the proposed dates in July, but stated it required the depositions to be by
remote means. (Silver Decl. ¶18; Exhibit L.)
 
On July 7, 2023, hearing no objection, Plaintiff’s
counsel served an amended notice of deposition for Defendant Reyes Mendez for
July 19, 2023. (Silver Decl. ¶19; Exhibit M.)
 
On July 17, 2023, Counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez
contacted Plaintiff’s counsel and conveyed his unavailability for the July 19,
2023, deposition. That same day, Plaintiff proposed new dates for the
depositions of Defendant Reyes Mendez. (Silver Decl. ¶20; Exhibit N.) That same
day, Plaintiff agreed to those new dates for the deposition of Defendant Reyes
Mendez. (Silver Decl. ¶20; Exhibit O.)
 
On July 25, 2023, after
several rescheduling attempts Defense Counsel said they had availability to
defend a deposition of Defendant’s Reyes Mendez on August 2, 2023, Plaintiff
then served notice. (Silver Decl. ¶¶22, 23; Exhibit O and P.)  On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel and
Defendant Reyes Mendez counsel spoke on separate matter, where Defendant Reyes
Mendez counsel indicated that Defendant Kitross’ Counsel were interested in a
later start time.  (Silver Decl. ¶24;
Exhibit Q.)  Further, On August 1, 2023,
at 8:55 p.m., Counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez contacted Plaintiff’s counsel
and relayed a “significant personal issue” and no coverage for the deposition
the following morning and called off the deposition. (Silver Decl. ¶24; Exhibit
Q.)  
On August 2, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel conveyed they would not take a notice of nonappearance in
order to reduce costs and sought reimbursement for the late cancelation fees
that resulted from the 12-hour notice of cancelation. (Silver Decl. ¶25;
Exhibit Q.) Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel asked counsel for Defendants to
provide new availability by August 4, 2023, or Plaintiff would be forced to
compel the depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶25; Exhibit Q.)
On August 14, 2023,
Counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez agreed to “handle” the invoices. (Silver
Decl. ¶26; Exhibit R.) 
At the time of filing,
neither counsel for Defendant Kitross nor counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez
have provided availability for the at-issue depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶26;
Exhibit R.)
 
DISCUSSION 
Applicable Law
 
Any party may obtain discovery, subject to restrictions, by
taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) A party desiring to take an oral deposition
shall give a notice in writing which states the specification of reasonably
particularly of any materials to be produced by the deponent. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.220, subd. (a)(4).) A properly served deposition notice is effective to
require a party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce documents for
inspection and copying. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) The party
served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity unless that
party promptly serves a written objection at least three calendar days prior to
the date for which the deposition is scheduled. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subd. (a).)  
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action … without having served a valid objection … fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
… described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for
an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document … described in the deposition notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)   
   
If a motion to compel deposition is granted, sanctions are
mandatory in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
 
Application to Facts
Plaintiff moves for
orders compelling Defendant Victor Daniel Reyes Mendez to appear for deposition.
Plaintiff’s counsel
testifies that he originally sent a deposition notice to Defendant
Victor Daniel Reyes Mendez on December 22, 2023.  (Silver Decl. ¶3; Exhibit
B.)  After conferring, the parties set an
initial date of March 14, 2023. (Silver Decl. ¶5; Exhibit D.) Between March 8,
2023, and July 25, 2023, a series of dates were negotiated and then pushed back
due to a family emergency by Defense Counsel. (Silver Decl. ¶¶ 8-22; Exhibit E-
O.)
On July 25, 2023, after
several rescheduling attempts Defense Counsel said they had availability to
defend a deposition of Defendant’s Reyes Mendez on August 2, 2023, Plaintiff
then served notice. (Silver Decl. ¶¶22, 23; Exhibit O and P.)  On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel and
Defendant Reyes Mendez counsel spoke on separate matter, where Defendant Reyes
Mendez counsel indicated that Defendant Kitross’ Counsel were interested in a
later start time.  (Silver Decl. ¶24;
Exhibit Q.)  Further, On August 1, 2023,
at 8:55 p.m., Counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez contacted Plaintiff’s counsel
and relayed a “significant personal issue” and no coverage for the deposition
the following morning and called off the deposition. (Silver Decl. ¶24; Exhibit
Q.)  
On August 2, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel conveyed they would not take a notice of nonappearance in
order to reduce costs and sought reimbursement for the late cancelation fees
that resulted from the 12-hour notice of cancelation. (Silver Decl. ¶25;
Exhibit Q.) Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel asked counsel for Defendants to
provide new availability by August 4, 2023, or Plaintiff would be forced to
compel the depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶25; Exhibit Q.)
At the time of filing,
neither counsel for Defendant Kitross nor counsel for Defendant Reyes Mendez
have provided availability for the at-issue depositions. (Silver Decl. ¶26;
Exhibit R.)
Given
that Defense Counsels did not serve a written
objection at least three calendar days prior to the date the deposition is
scheduled the motion to compel is GRANTED. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).)  
 
Sanctions are mandatory
in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or
the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
Here, the Court does not
find that either Defense Counsel acted with substantial justification in
failing to appear for the deposition. Further, Defense Counsels have not filed
opposition.  Plaintiff requests sanctions
in the amount of $5,810 due to Defendant Kitross’ repeated
failure to produce Defendant Reyes Mendez. (Silver Decl. ¶28.)  The Court finds the amount unreasonable.  Given the similarity of the motion to another
motion to compel deposition in the instant matter, the simplicity of motion to
compel depositions, and the lack of response from Defense counsel, the Court
reduces the total sanction amount to $1,800, plus the $60 filing fee.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The Motion to Compel
Deposition for Defendant Reyes Mendez is GRANTED. (CCP
§ 2025.450(a).)  Defendant is ordered to
appear for deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by Plaintiff.
Plaintiff must give at least ten days’ notice of the deposition (notice
extended per Code if by other than personal service).
 
The Sanctions are granted in the
reduced total amount of $1,860. Defendant and defense counsel, jointly
and severally, are ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through his
counsel of record, in the reduced total amount of $1,860, within thirty days.  
 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
