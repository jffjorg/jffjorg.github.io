And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions for change of venue filed by the defendants, Treasure Management, Inc., Euphoric Life, Inc., and Aiden Rafii. The defendants had argued that the proper venue for the action was Santa Clara County, while the plaintiff, Bespoke Financial, Inc., argued that the proper venue was Los Angeles County.

The judge found that the loan agreement and indemnification agreement were executed in Los Angeles County and that the loan payments were made to the plaintiff in Santa Monica, CA, which is located in Los Angeles County. The judge also found that the defendants failed to establish that the plaintiff's joinder of Euphoric was a sham or that it was a corporation not properly joined as a defendant.

The judge noted that the loan agreement and indemnification agreement did not contain a forum selection clause, but that the indemnification agreement did contain a venue selection clause that designated "any court sitting in the state in which the Controlling City is located" as the proper place for venue. The judge found that the Controlling City was the location of the plaintiff's chief executive office, which is in Los Angeles County.

The judge also denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of the truth of the allegations in the complaint.

In conclusion, the judge has denied the motions for change of venue and has ruled that the proper venue for the action is Los Angeles County.
