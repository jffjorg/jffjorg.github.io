ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Moldovan, Inc. dba
Servicemaster Restoration By Disaster Recovery Experts (“Plaintiff”) served
Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Alfreda V. Adger (“Defendant”). (Motion, Supp. Tovar Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a
meet and confer effort, to date, Defendant Couture has not served verified
responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions, on March 29, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories, are granted.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and
confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to
serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections.
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for a
simple and unopposed motion. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Defendant in the amount of $533.30 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $375.00 per hour, plus costs of 158.30. (Motion, Supp.
Tovar Decl., ¶¶9-15.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Moldovan, Inc. dba Servicemaster Restoration By
Disaster Recovery Experts’ Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ALFREDA V. ADGER IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE INTERROGATORIES, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20
DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $533.30 TO
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
