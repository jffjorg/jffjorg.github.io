ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Toby Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov
Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) on March 18, 2020. The case was not at
issue until Defendants filed an answer on May 10, 2023.
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Attendance at Deposition. No opposition has been filed to
date.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Defendants served Plaintiff with a Notice of Deposition on
May 10, 2024, setting the deposition for June 10, 2024. (Motion, Rickett Decl.,
Exh. A.) Defendant did not attend the deposition or otherwise communicate with
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) Attempts to reach Defendant
regarding the deposition, made on June 13, 2024, have been unsuccessful. (Id.
at ¶4 and Exh. C.) Based on this history and the lack of any opposition,
Defendants have demonstrated that the meet and confer requirement is satisfied
and that there was no good cause for Plaintiff’s failure to attend the
deposition or communicate regarding discovery. Due to Plaintiff’s failure to
cooperate in the taking of their deposition, Defendants are entitled to an
order compelling their appearance. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Attendance at Deposition is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF TOBY LEE JONES IS ORDERED TO APPEAR FOR
DEPOSITION AT A DATE AND TIME DETERMINED BY DEFENSE COUNSEL, WITHIN 20 DAYS OF
THIS ORDER.
