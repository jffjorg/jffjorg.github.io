And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs failed to comply with discovery orders, despite being served notice of the court's ruling. The defendant filed a motion to compel responses to discovery requests and the court granted the motion on October 9, 2023. The plaintiffs have not fully complied with the order, instead serving responses with objections and failing to pay sanctions. The court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted due to the plaintiffs' willful non-compliance with discovery orders.
