And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the defendants, Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel, to compel the plaintiff, Toby Lee Jones, to attend a deposition. The defendants had served the plaintiff with a notice of deposition on May 10, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to attend the deposition on June 10, 2024, and did not communicate with the defendants regarding the deposition. The judge found that the defendants had demonstrated that the meet and confer requirement was satisfied and that there was no good cause for the plaintiff's failure to attend the deposition or communicate regarding discovery. As a result, the plaintiff is ordered to appear for a deposition at a date and time to be determined by the defense counsel, within 20 days of the order.
