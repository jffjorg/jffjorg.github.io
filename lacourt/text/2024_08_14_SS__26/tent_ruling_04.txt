ANALYSIS: 
 
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiffs
Yohanson Walkir Castellanos Orozco and Ana Lucia Elizabeth Lantan Garcia (“Plaintiffs”) filed this motor vehicle action against Defendant
Manuel Ocampo (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint on
April 28, 2023. Defendant filed (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request for
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Request for Sanctions, on August 14, 2023. The Court granted the discovery
motions on October 9, 2023 and ordered Plaintiffs to serve responses and pay
sanctions to Defendant within 20 days of the order. (Minute Order, 10/09/23.) 
 
Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions on April 23, 2024. The Motion came for
hearing on June 13, 2024 and was continued due to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
representation that the case had settled. (Minute Order, 06/13/24.) No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging
in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendant’s (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Sanctions, on October 9, 2023.
(Minute Order, 10/09/23; Motion, Okunor Decl., Exh. A.) Defendant served
Plaintiffs with notice of the order on the same date. (Ibid.) To date,
Plaintiffs have not fully complied with the order to serve responses or pay
sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶5, 8.) Instead, Plaintiffs served responses that
contained objections and have not paid sanctions. (Ibid.)  
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiffs’ non-compliance with the discovery orders. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiffs failed to serve responses without objections or pay
sanctions as ordered. Nor have Plaintiffs filed an opposition to this noticed
motion. This demonstrates that their compliance with the Court’s orders cannot
be achieved through lesser sanctions. Although terminating sanctions are a
harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to
continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 280.)
