And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Sunrun, Inc. (the plaintiff) and Victor M. Rivera (the defendant). The plaintiff brought an action for possession of personal property, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit, alleging that the parties entered into a lease agreement for a photovoltaic solar system in 2017. The plaintiff installed the system on a property in Reseda, California, and the defendant promised to purchase all the energy produced by the system. However, the defendant removed the system from the property without permission, and the plaintiff filed a complaint and motion for summary judgment. The judge denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not demonstrate that there is no defense to the action. The judge also noted that the motion was mis-noticed as a motion for summary judgment, and that the plaintiff should have filed a motion for summary adjudication instead.
