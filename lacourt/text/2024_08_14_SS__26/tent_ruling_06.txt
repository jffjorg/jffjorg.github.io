Cal. Automobile Ins. Co. v. , et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff California Automobile
Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request
for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT BENSON CRANE, INC. IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $260.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff California Automobile Insurance
Company(“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Benson Crane, Inc. (“Defendant”). (Motion, Espinosa Decl., Exh. A.) To date,
Defendant has not served verified responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id.
at ¶2.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted (“the Motion”) on July 9, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $260.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $200.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion,
Espinosa Decl., ¶3.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff California Automobile
Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request
for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT BENSON CRANE, INC. IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $260.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
