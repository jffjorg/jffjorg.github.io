And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of compromise of claim for minor Rhyot Manor, who sustained personal injuries due to mold exposure in her apartment. The settlement amount is $3,000.00, and the court finds the amount for attorney's fees ($750.00) and litigation costs ($149.72) to be reasonable. However, the court notes several deficiencies in the petition, including the lack of a copy of the final Medi-Cal demand letter or letter agreement, a copy of the retainer agreement, and duplicated payments listed for Medi-Cal lien satisfaction. Therefore, the court has continued the petition to address or clarify these issues.
