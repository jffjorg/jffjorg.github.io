 Case Number:  23STCV11143    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Josephine Schreiber’s Motion to Lift Stay and Request for $6,550 in Sanctions
Plaintiff Josephine Schreiber moves to lift the stay
of this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97.  “[I]f the fees or costs
to initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration.”  (CCP § 1281.97(a)(1).)  If the drafting party does not timely pay,
the employee may “[w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in”
court.  (CCP § 1281.97(a)(2).)
Section
1281.97 does not apply because the parties’ arbitration agreement adopts the procedural rules
of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).  “[T]he
parties may limit the trial court’s authority to stay or deny arbitration under
the CAA by adopting the more restrictive procedural provisions of the FAA.”  (Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)  “[T]he FAA’s
procedural provisions do not apply in state court unless the parties expressly
adopt them.”  (Id. at p. 177.)
The
Court of Appeal has held that the FAA’s procedural provisions apply instead of
the CAA’s where a “contract specifies that claims shall be arbitrated ‘pursuant
to the FAA.’ ”  (Rodriguez v. American
Technologies, Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1122.)  The court reasoned, “There is no other
contract provision suggesting the parties intended to incorporate California
arbitration law, nor is there any language suggesting the parties intended to
arbitrate ‘in conformance to’ some provisions of the FAA but not others.”  (Ibid.)  The court held the parties “adopted the FAA …
to govern their arbitration.”  (Ibid.)  The Court of Appeal reached the same
conclusion where a contract provided, “ ‘Enforcement of this agreement to
arbitrate shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.’ ” (Victrola
89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346, italics
added (Victrola).)
Here,
the parties’ arbitration agreement provides, “This agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.”  (Ameripour Decl., Ex. 2, p. 14, italics
added.)  The agreement has no
provision incorporating California law nor any provision limiting which parts
of the FAA apply.  (Id., pp.
12-14.)  As discussed above, the Court of
Appeal has interpreted the term “ ‘governed by the Federal Arbitration Act’ ” to
constitute an agreement to use the FAA’s procedural rules.  (Victrola, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th at p.
346.)  The arbitration agreement in this
case uses identical language.  The
parties thereby expressly agreed to adopt the FAA, including its procedural
rules.  Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97
is a procedural rule of arbitration.  (Espinoza
v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 782-783; Gallo v. Wood
Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 644.)  The CAA’s procedural rules, including section
1281.97, do not apply.
Even
if section 1281.97 applied, defendants did not waive their right to
arbitrate.  Plaintiff’s motion relies on
the premise that defendants were required to pay the arbitration fee by October
20, 2023.  Their deadline was October
23.  The drafting party waives the right
to arbitrate if fees “are not paid within 30 days after the due date.”  (CCP § 1281.97(a)(1).)  JAMS’s “notice of intent to initiate
arbitration” and “deposit request” are dated September 20, 2023.  (Davoodi Decl., Ex. B, pp. 1-2.)  The notice of intent to initiate arbitration,
however, provides, “Respondent must pay the remaining $1,750.00 of the
non-refundable Filing Fee.  Payment is
due upon receipt.”  (Id., p. 1.)  JAMS’s email to defendants’ counsel similarly
stated, “Please find your Deposit Request attached for the above referenced
matter.  Please note that payment is due
upon receipt.”  (Tahsildoost Decl., Ex.
1.)  Defendants’ counsel did not receive
the deposit request until September 21, 2023. 
(Id., ¶ 2, Ex. 1 [showing email sent “Thursday, September 21,
2023 5:12:49 AM”].)  
Thirty
days after September 21, 2023, was October 21, 2023—a Saturday.  The payment was therefore due October 23, the
following Monday.  “The time in which any
act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day, and
including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also
excluded.”  (CCP § 12.)  “If the last day for the performance of any
act provided or required by law to be performed within a specified period of
time is a holiday, then that period is hereby extended to and including the
next day that is not a holiday.”  (CCP §
12a(a).)  “Holiday” includes Saturdays (ibid.)
and Sundays (CCP § 10).  (See also Doe v. Superior Court (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 346, 355, fn. 4 [noting
parties did not dispute that 30-day deadline under CCP § 1281.98 was extended from
Saturday to following Monday].)
Defendants paid their fee on October 23,
2023.  (Tahsildoost Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 2.)  Thus, even if Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.97 applied, defendants did not materially breach the arbitration agreement
and did not waive their right to compel arbitration.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Josephine Schreiber’s motion to lift stay and
request for sanctions is denied.
