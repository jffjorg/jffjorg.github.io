- "Close proximity in time of an adverse action to an employee's resistance or opposition to unlawful conduct is often strong evidence of a retaliatory motive."
- "The court cannot find that, as a matter of law, plaintiff's evidence is too weak to support a rational inference that defendant retaliated against her."
```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and has denied it. The plaintiff, Alma Fonseca, brought three causes of action against the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District: whistleblower retaliation, retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), and failure to prevent discrimination and harassment.

The judge found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's whistleblower retaliation claim, including whether the defendant's "housing" of the plaintiff was a legitimate reason or a pretext for retaliation. The judge also found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's FEHA claim, including whether the defendant failed to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment.

The judge rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of showing a prima facie case of retaliation, finding that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support a reasoned inference that the defendant retaliated against her. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's evidence was too weak to support a rational inference of retaliation, finding that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further review and argument.
