And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, GR0.com, LLC, has moved to compel binding arbitration and stay all proceedings in this action. The defendant argues that it did not waive its right to compel arbitration, but the court has found that the defendant waived its right to compel arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98. The court has also found that the arbitrator, not the court, should have decided the issue of waiver.

The defendant did not pay the fees required to continue the arbitration proceeding within 30 days after the due date, and although it mailed the payment before the deadline, AAA did not receive it until after the deadline. The court has held that sending payment before the deadline is insufficient and that the arbitrator must receive the payment by the deadline.

The defendant argues that AAA received the payment by the deadline, but AAA's records were not current to reflect the payment due to technical issues. The court has rejected this argument and found that the defendant waived its right to compel arbitration.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and has ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days.
