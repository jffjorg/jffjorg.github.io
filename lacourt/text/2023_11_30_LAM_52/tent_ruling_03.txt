 Case Number:  23STCV17249    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendant GR0.COM, LLC’s Motion to
Compel Binding Arbitration and Request for Stay of All Proceedings
Defendant GR0.com, LLC moves to compel arbitration
and stay this action by plaintiff Aaron Friedman.
Defendant waived its right to compel arbitration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98. 
“[I]f the fees or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding
are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party is in
material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration,
and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that
arbitration as a result of the material breach.”  (CCP § 1281.98(a)(1).)  If the drafting party does not timely pay,
the employee may “[w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in”
court.  (CCP § 1281.98(b)(1).)  
“[T]he Legislature intended courts to apply the
statute’s payment deadline strictly.”  (Espinoza
v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 771 (Espinoza).)  “[T]he triggering event is nothing more than
nonpayment of fees within the 30-day period—the statute specifies no other
required findings, such as whether the nonpayment was deliberate or
inadvertent, or whether the delay prejudiced the nondrafting party.”  (Id. at p. 776.)  The statute makes no exceptions for “clerical
error” (id. at p. 775) or other “minor errors” by the drafting party (id.
at p. 777).  
The parties participated in an arbitration
proceeding that included this dispute.  Defendant
did not pay fees required to continue the arbitration proceeding within 30 days
after the due date.  Defendant’s counsel
states, “On June 12, 2023,” the American Arbitration Association (AAA) “issued
an invoice to the parties with a balance of $74,750, due upon receipt.”  (Eanet Decl., ¶ 6.)  She further states, “On July 10, 2023, I
mailed payment for the final invoice of the outstanding Arbitrator fees that
was due on July 12, 2023.”  (Id.,
¶ 8, Ex. B.)  
Though defendant mailed the payment before the July
12 deadline, AAA did not receive it until after the deadline.  On July 18, 2023, AAA sent the parties an
email stating, “[I]t appears that the Respondent’s payment of $74,750.00 has
not been received.”  (Horacek Decl., ¶ 21,
Ex. I.)  After further correspondence, on
July 21, 2023, AAA sent an email stating, “This will confirm that the payment
has finally been received in this matter.”  (Eanet Decl., Ex. G, italics added.)  Plaintiff also submits evidence that on July
14, 2023, plaintiff’s counsel visited AAA’s online payment portal, which stated
there was a balance due of $74,750. 
(Horacek Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. G.)
Sending payment before the deadline is insufficient.  The arbitrator must receive the payment by
the deadline.  The statute requires “payment
made and received within 30 days of the due date.”  (Doe v. Superior Court (2023) 95
Cal.App.5th 346, 358 (Doe).)  “This
construction provides a clear, bright-line rule for determining compliance with
the 30-day statutory grace period as the arbitrator can readily and
definitively determine whether funds have been received to satisfy any
outstanding fees or costs owed for a pending arbitration.  If such fees are not received by the
conclusion of the statutory grace period, an employee may immediately elect to
pursue options for relief.”  (Ibid.)  
In Doe, court rejected the argument that
“sending funds within 30 days of the due date satisfies the deadline” because
it “risks delay and uncertainty as to the timeliness of payment given possible
delays and the need to allow for an appropriate period for delivery.”  (Id. at p. 358.)  The court further noted the “need to strictly
construe and enforce the terms of section 1281.98 without exception.”  (Id. at p. 362.)  Defendant’s reply does not address Doe.  
Defendant argues AAA received the payment by the
deadline, but AAA’s “records were not current to reflect” the payment due to
AAA’s technical issues.  (Eanet Decl., ¶
12.)  On July 14, 2023, AAA sent an email
stating, “I am so sorry for the delay in getting back to the parties regarding
the financials in this matter.  We are
experiencing technical issues with our computer network due to a fire and we
are working to bring the systems up as soon as possible.”  (Id., Ex. E.)  This email indicates technical issues with confirming
that AAA received the payment, not technical issues with receiving mail.  When AAA stated on July 18 that it had not yet
received the check, it wrote, “This will confirm that the AAA had a fire,
however, it is my understanding that everything is back up and running.”  (Horacek Decl., Ex. I.)  
Although defendant argues this court should rule
that the parties’ dispute is subject to arbitration, it also contends that
pursuant to the agreement’s delegation clause, the arbitrator—not the
court—must decide the issue of waiver. 
Assuming so, the arbitration provider (if not the arbitrator, per se)
already decided defendant waived its right to compel arbitration.  Denise Crow, a manager of ADR services at AAA,
wrote to the parties: “This will confirm that the deposits were due to the AAA
on or before July 12, 2023.  I understand
that the check was dated and issued on July 10, 2023, however, it was not
received until July 20, 2023, therefore, pursuant to [plaintiff’s] request to
withdraw the matter pursuant to CCP the AAA closed our file.”  (Eanet Decl., Ex. K.)  Defendant did not seek reconsideration by the
arbitrator.
Defendant argues the Federal Arbitration Act
preempts Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98.  Defendant relies solely on non-binding
authority.  (Belyea v. GreenSky, Inc.
(N.D. Cal. 2022) 637 F.Supp.3d 745, 756.) 
Defendant does not acknowledge binding authority holding the opposite.  “[T]he FAA does not preempt section 1281.97
or section 1281.99.”  (Gallo v. Wood
Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 643.)  The Court of Appeal noted, “[O]ur analysis applies
with equal force to the parallel provisions of section 1281.98.”  (Id. at p. 633, fn. 4; accord Espinoza,
supra, 83 Cal.App.5th at pp. 778-785.)
