And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Josephine Schreiber's motion to lift stay and request $6,550 in sanctions. The motion is denied. The Judge finds that the parties' arbitration agreement adopts the procedural rules of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which do not apply in state court unless the parties expressly adopt them. The Judge concludes that even if section 1281.97 of the Code of Civil Procedure applied, the defendants did not waive their right to arbitrate because they paid the filing fee on October 23, 2023, which was the due date. The Judge notes that the deadline for payment was extended to October 23, 2023, because October 21, 2023, was a Saturday.
