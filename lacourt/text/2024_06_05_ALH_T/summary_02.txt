The judge concludes that the breakdown of the working relationship with the client and the client's failure to cooperate and respond warrant the attorney's withdrawal. The judge notes that the attorney has made reasonable efforts to locate the client's current address and has provided notice and papers to the client. The judge also cites the Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 as the basis for the attorney's withdrawal.
