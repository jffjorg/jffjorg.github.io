  Case Number:  20STCV03496    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  T Motions to Compel Discovery Responses
BACKGROUND
Defendant HD Supply Construction Supply, Limited Partnership
(“Defendant”) now moves to compel Plaintiff’s discovery responses. Plaintiff
opposes.
LEGAL STANDARD
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for
an order compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b),
provides that if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, “[t]he
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted”.
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300,
subdivisions (c), provides a court shall impose sanctions against a party who
successfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), provides, in part: “It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary . . . on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”
The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even where no
opposition is filed, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
DISCUSSION
Here, the requested discovery has been provided as well as
the verifications, and as such the motions are MOOT. However, sanctions are
still warranted as Plaintiff’s conduct necessitated motion practice. (See Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of
$440 (2 hrs. x $220/hr.) for the motion related to request for admissions, $660
(3 hr. x 220/hr.) for the motion related to special interrogatories, $550 (2.5
hrs. x 220/hr.) for the motion related to form interrogatories, and $660 (3
hrs. $220/hr.) for the motion related to request for production of documents.
The Court finds these amounts reasonable. 
Based on the foregoing, the motions are MOOT. Sanctions are
imposed against Plaintiff and counsel of record in the amount of $2,310 total,
payable within 20 days of Defendant giving notice of this ruling.  Defendant give notice.
