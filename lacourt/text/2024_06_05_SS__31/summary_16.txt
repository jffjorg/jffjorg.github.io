And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: the plaintiff's motion to compel initial discovery responses and the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted against the defendant, Soledad. The plaintiff argues that the defendant failed to serve timely responses and waived his right to object. The judge finds that the defendant's responses were untimely, but the substantive portions of the responses are compliant with the law. The judge grants the motions, deeming the requests for admissions admitted against Soledad. The judge also awards $1,000 in attorney's fees to the plaintiff and imposes sanctions of $1,000 against Soledad and his attorney.
