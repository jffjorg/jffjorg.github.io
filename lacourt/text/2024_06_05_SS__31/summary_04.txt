And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request for default judgment against defendants Jose R. Herrera and Elia Herrera. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to comply with several court rules and procedures. Specifically, the plaintiff has not submitted a proposed judgment on judicial council form JUD-100, has not dismissed all other parties against whom default judgment is not sought, and has not filed a declaration under penalty of perjury supporting the amount of damages sought. The court therefore denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment. The plaintiff is ordered to correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to a later date.
