BACKGROUND Plaintiff Robert Eubanks (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Lavida Marie Childs, et al. for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision.  Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling defendant Lavida Marie Childs (“Defendant Childs”) to provide further responses to his form interrogatories, set one, as to Nos. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 9.1, 9.2, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11 because no response was served, and as to Nos. 12.1-12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, and 17.1. The motion is unopposed.   II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS Meet and Confer A motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  Under the circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff met the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(2).   Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) Per the Eight Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, “PI Hub Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery.” Additionally, “Reserving or scheduling an IDC does not extend the time to file a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses.” (Ibid.) Here, the Court finds Plaintiff complied with the Standing Order in scheduling and attending an IDC on April 17, 2024. The issues were unresolved. (Min. Order, April 17, 2024.)   Separate Statement A motion to compel further responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed a separate statement for the motion to compel further.  III. MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES CCP § 2030.300(a) provides that, “On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:   (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.   (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.   (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” The Court has reviewed Defendant Childs’ responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories and finds them to be not code compliant with CCP §2030.220 because they are incomplete, and the objections are without merit. Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is GRANTED.¿Defendant Childs is ordered to provide further verified responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, as to Nos. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 9.1, 9.2, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11, and as to Nos. 12.1-12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, and 17.1., within fifteen (15) days.  IV. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response. (CCP §2031.310(h).) Plaintiff requests $1,260 in monetary sanctions against Defendant Childs and her counsel of record for the motion. Here, the Court finds it appropriate to grant sanctions against Defendant Childs only, and not on her counsel. Plaintiff is awarded 2 hours for preparing the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing at the requested rate of $300 per hour, for a total of $900 in attorney’s fees. Further, Plaintiff is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.  Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Childs. Defendant Childs is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $960, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 4th day of June 2024      Hon.
