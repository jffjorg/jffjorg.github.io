 Case Number:  22STCV07640    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  06/05/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV07640 DAVID WILLIAMS vs EDWARD DAMAS REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Manuel Hernandez (Doe 3) RECOMMENDATION:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff David Williams (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Edward Damas (“Damas”) and Does 1 through 20 for damages arising from an automobile collision. Plaintiff filed amendments to complaint, naming Shawn Esrawi as Doe 1, Scott Shulman as Doe 2, and Manuel Hernandez (“Hernandez “) as Doe 3. Only Damas has appeared in the action.  Dismissals were entered against Shawn Esrawi (Doe 1) and Scott Shulman (Doe 2) on October 16, 2023.   Plaintiff now seeks default judgment against Hernandez (Doe 3), asserting that Hernandez was the driver of the vehicle involved in the incident.  The request for default judgment submitted on May 22, 2024 is DENIED for the following reasons:  First, for personal injury cases, Plaintiff must submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on the defendant whom default is sought against. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).) The Court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages served on Hernandez.   Second, Plaintiff has not dismissed all other parties against whom default judgment is not sought and against whom Plaintiff is not applying for separate relief (i.e. Does 4 through 20.) (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)  Third, Plaintiff seeks separate relief for severable claims, requesting that the action continue against Damas. The Court notes that if Damas' only involvement is merely as the vehicle owner, the damages against him are statutorily capped by Vehicle Code §17151(a) to no more than $15,000 for injury to one person in any one accident, and $5,000 for property damage in any one accident. Here, Plaintiff's application for separate relief has not demonstrated that the amounts sought against Hernandez are not duplicative as to those which will be sought against Damas, such that the claims are severable.   Further, Plaintiff requests 40% for attorney's fees on CIV-100. There is no apparent contractual or statutory basis for an award of attorney's fees in this personal injury action, nor does Plaintiff cite to any.   Fourth, there must be a declaration by a percipient witness with personal knowledge (i.e. Plaintiff”) attesting to the damages incurred. Here, Plaintiff submits only the declaration of his Counsel. Counsel was not personally involved in the incident, nor did Counsel incur the medical treatment and expenses to have the requisite personal knowledge to attest to the damages and to authenticate the records as true and correct. Plaintiff must submit his own declaration, under penalty of perjury under, attesting to his own damages and authenticating his own records.   Lastly, the Court requests Plaintiff to use the most current CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023] instead of the outdated CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2018].  No later than __________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ____________.
