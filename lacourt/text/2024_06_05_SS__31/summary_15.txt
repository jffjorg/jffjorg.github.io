And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court declines to approve the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, Jaylen Langford, at this time. The Court finds that the petition contains several defects, including the use of an outdated form (MC-350EX [Rev. January 1, 2010] instead of the updated form [Rev. January 1, 2021]), the absence of required attachments, and the lack of a proposed custodian for the transfer of funds under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. The Court also notes that the petition does not include an Order Approving Compromise on MC-351 [Rev. January 1, 2021]. The Court orders the petitioner to file an amended petition curing the defects and to provide the required attachments. The petitioner must also reserve a new date and file a new petition at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
