The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The case involves a motor vehicle incident and a dispute over the production of medical records. The plaintiff, Jack Shulkey, received treatment at VA Long Beach Healthcare System for injuries sustained in the incident. The defendant, Jane Loreg, served VA Long Beach with a subpoena seeking production of the medical records. However, the custodian of records at VA Long Beach refused to comply with the subpoena without an authorization form signed by the plaintiff.
