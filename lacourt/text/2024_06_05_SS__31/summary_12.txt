"In this case, plaintiff Annalise Fujii seeks a default judgment against defendant Jocelyn Carbajal for damages and costs arising from an assault and battery. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendant is in default and has not responded to the complaint. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's request for a default judgment in the amount of $17,467 for principal damages, $595 for costs, and a total of $18,062. The court also notes that the plaintiff's therapy bills for 35 sessions with psychotherapist Alisha Garr amount to $2,467 and are being granted. Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for $15,000 in general damages and $595 in costs. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the default judgment."
