And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The court found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed 70 days after the production deadline. The court also expressed concerns about jurisdiction over the out-of-state non-party. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line 'SUBMIT' followed by the case number."
