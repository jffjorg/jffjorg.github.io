And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Petitioner Velone A. Poydras' Motion to Vacate Dismissal with Prejudice. The case concerns a mechanic lien placed on Petitioner's property by Defendant Donald L. McGowan. After the Respondent was served, default was entered against him, and an order voiding and canceling the mechanic lien was entered. However, due to an error made by Petitioner's counsel, Shirley Chiu appeared on behalf of Petitioner at an OSC re-entry judgment hearing and dismissed the case with prejudice. Petitioner's counsel, Levi R. Uku, asserts that Chiu did not have authority to dismiss the case and that he was not aware of the dismissal until June 27, 2023. The Judge finds that Petitioner's counsel's error was excusable and that the dismissal was caused by his attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. Therefore, the Judge grants the Motion and vacates the dismissal with prejudice.
