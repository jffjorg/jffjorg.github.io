The Judge's tentative ruling grants Petitioner Velone A. Poydras' Motion to Vacate Dismissal with Prejudice. The case concerns a mechanic lien placed on Petitioner's property by Defendant Donald L. McGowan. After the Respondent was served, default was entered against him, and an order voiding and canceling the mechanic lien was entered. However, due to an error made by Petitioner's counsel, Shirley Chiu appeared on behalf of Petitioner at an OSC re-entry judgment hearing and dismissed the case with prejudice. Petitioner's counsel, Levi R. Uku, asserts that Chiu did not have authority to dismiss the case and that he was not aware of the dismissal until June 27, 2023. The Judge finds that Petitioner's counsel's error was excusable and that the dismissal was caused by his attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. Therefore, the Judge grants the Motion and vacates the dismissal with prejudice.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling grants Velone A. Poydras' motion to vacate the dismissal of her case against Donald L. McGowan. 

The case involved Poydras seeking to release a mechanic's lien placed on her property by McGowan. After the lien was canceled, Poydras' attorney, Levi R. Uku, mistakenly hired another attorney, Shirley Chiu, to represent Poydras at a hearing where the case was dismissed with prejudice. 

The court found that Uku's mistake was excusable and that the mandatory relief provision of CCP § 473(b) requires the court to vacate the dismissal.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Petitioner's Motion to Vacate Dismissal is granted. The Petitioner, Velone A. Poydras, had filed a petition to release a mechanic lien placed on her property by the Respondent, Donald L. McGowan. After the Respondent was served, default was entered against him and an order voiding and canceling the mechanic lien was entered. However, the Petitioner's counsel, Levi R. Uku, had hired another attorney, Shirley Chiu, to appear on a limited scope appearance for an OSC re-entry judgment hearing, and she had dismissed the case with prejudice without the Petitioner's knowledge or consent. The judge finds that the Petitioner's counsel's error in hiring another attorney was excusable and that there is no prejudice to the Respondent since the subject of the petition, the mechanic lien, is stale and statutorily barred. Therefore, the court lacks the discretion to refuse relief and grants the Petitioner's motion.

The Judge's tentative ruling is granting the Petitioner's Motion to Vacate Dismissal based on the attorney's affidavit of fault and neglect. The dismissal was entered on June 2, 2023, without the Petitioner's counsel's knowledge or intent. The attorney, Levi. R.

The Judge finds that the Petitioner's motion is mandatory and should be granted since it was timely filed within six months and is based on an attorney's affidavit of fault. The Judge also states that any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.
