Background
 
On
November 7, 2022, Velone A. Poydras (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to release
the mechanic lien placed on her property by Donald L. McDonald (“Respondent.”)
After the respondent was served, default was entered against the Respondent on
March 6, 2023, and an order voiding and canceling the mechanic lien was entered
on May 2, 2023. 
 
Petitioner’s
counsel believed that upon entry of the May 2, 2023 Order, there was nothing
left for the court to do. However, Petitioner asserts that the court in error
set the OSC re-Entry Judgment for June 02, 2023, wherein another attorney,
Shirley Chiu, appeared on behalf of the Petitioner and asked that the case be
dismissed with prejudice. Petitioner’s counsel asserts that this was in error
and requests that the June 2, 2023, dismissal be vacated. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP § 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief. (See Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A.
(2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) Mandatory relief from default, default
judgment, or dismissal is available based on an attorney’s affidavit attesting
to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Minick v. City
of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-26 (“Mink”).) 
 
The mandatory provision states in
the pertinent part:  
 
[T]he court shall, whenever an application for relief is
made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is
accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by
the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a
default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered
against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal
was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.
 
(CCP § 437(b).) 
 
“The purpose of this mandatory
relief provision is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose their day in
court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys.” (Rodriguez
v. Brill (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) Whenever relief is granted based
on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, the court shall direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to the opposing party. (CCP §
473(b).)
 
II.        Motion
to Set Aside/Vacate the Dismissal Entered on June 2, 2023
 
Petitioner seeks an
order vacating the dismissal entered on June 2,2023, wherein this court
dismissed the case with prejudice. Petitioner’s counsel, Levi. R. Uku, stated
that he was unavailable for the June 2, 2023, OSC: re-entry of default judgment
hearing because he had a hearing before the California Parole Board. (Uku Decl.
¶ 3.) Mr. Uko used the “Appearme App” to request a limited scope one-time
special appearing counsel to appear on his behalf for the June 2, 2023,
hearing. (Id. ¶ 4.) Shirley Chiu accepted the assignment and appeared at
the hearing. (Id. ¶ 5.) 
Mr. Uku states that
Ms. Chiu was specifically instructed and authorized to ask the court to take
the OSC:re-default judgment off-calendar since the May 2, 2023 Order voided and
canceled the mechanic lien, and a judgment is no longer necessary.  (Uku Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7.) Mr. Uku asserts that Ms.
Chiu was not instructed to dismiss the case, let alone dismiss it with
prejudice. (Id. ¶ 8, Ex. B.) Mr. Uku only became aware of the dismissal
when he checked the case status online on June 27, 2023. (Id. ¶ 9.) 
Mr. Uku asserts that
Ms. Chiu refused to sign a declaration claiming that the “incident happened a
long time ago” and that as a result she was not prepared to sign any
declaration. (Id. ¶¶ 12, 16, 18.) Mr. Uku asserts that Ms. Chiu did not
have authority from him or the Petitioner to ask the court to dismiss the case
with prejudice, and that Ms. Chiu acted in excess of her instructions and the
court should vacate the June 2, 2023 Order. (Id. ¶ 20.) Mr. Uku asserts
that no contractual relationship exists between Petitioner and Ms. Chiu and
that fault lies with Mr. Uku for asking Ms. Chiu to appear on behalf of
Petitioner without researching her background and professionalism. (Id.
¶¶ 21, 22, Ex. E.)
“The law strongly favors trial and disposition on the
merits. Therefore, any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor
of the party seeking relief. When the moving party promptly seeks relief and
there is no prejudice to the opposing party, very slight evidence is required
to justify relief.” (Mink, supra, 2
Cal.App.4th at p. 1343.)  
Petitioner asserts the Motion should be granted
because there is no prejudice to Respondent since the subject of the petition,
the Mechanic Lien, is stale and statutorily barred since Respondent failed to
file an action to enforce the mechanic lien within the statutorily allowed
time. (Mot. at 11:25-28.) Moreover, the court finds that Mr. Uku’s error in
hiring another attorney to appear on a limited scope appearance for an OSC
hearing is neglect that is excusable because “a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances
might have made the same error.”
(Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918,
929.)
Since the Plaintiff’s
Motion was timely filed within six months and is based on an attorney’s
affidavit of fault, relief is mandatory, and the court lacks the discretion to
refuse relief. (Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 215, 226 [“‘If the prerequisites for the application of the
mandatory relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial
court does not have discretion to refuse relief.’ [Citation].” Therefore,
Petitioner’s motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner’s Motion is granted.
