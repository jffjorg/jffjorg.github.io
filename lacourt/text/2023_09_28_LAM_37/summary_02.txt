* The demurrer to the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action is sustained with leave to amend because the SAP does not adequately allege intentional interference with contract and conspiracy to interfere with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and conspiracy to interfere with prospective economic advantage, and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.
* The demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend because the SAP does not adequately allege an inverse condemnation claim.
* The demurrer to the tenth cause of action is sustained without leave to amend because the SAP does not adequately allege a claim for unjust enrichment.

**Significant Statements**

* "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures." (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc.)
* "A demurrer may only be sustained when a defendant cannot reasonably determine to what he or she is required to respond." (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc.)
* "The court grants Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the May 26, 2023 Amended Order to Plug and Abandon Wells, Decommission Attendant Facilities, and Restore Well Site, No. 1174A, issued by CalGEM."
