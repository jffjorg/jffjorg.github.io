The tentative ruling by the Judge in this case, 22STCP03824, relates to a dispute between cousins over the valuation of shares in a family-owned business. Plaintiff Abbie Gougerchian moves to compel the deposition of Defendant Patrick Gogerchin and seeks the imposition of sanctions. The Court finds that Defendant's non-appearance at the deposition on September 7, 2023, without serving written objections or filing motions, justifies the Court's action. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer regarding a deposition date, and if they agree, the hearing on this motion will be continued. If they do not agree, the motion to compel deposition will be granted. The Court also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant Patrick Gogerchin and his counsel of record in the reduced amount of $2,311, to be paid within 20 days.
