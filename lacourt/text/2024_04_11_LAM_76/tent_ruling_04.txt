ANALYSIS
Motion To Lift
Discovery Stay
Plaintiff Lance Frederick Mann,
individually and as Trustee of The Milton and Rae Mann Intervivos Trust
Agreement, dated April 14, 1992’s motion to lift the stay on discovery pursuant
to Civ. Proc. Code, § 425.16(g) is placed OFF-CALENDAR.
Procedurally, this motion was only
served on 8 days’ notice, not the 16 court days’ notice, plus 2 court days for
electronic service, required by Civ. Proc. Code, § 1005(b) and § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).
Moreover, Defendant in pro per was only served electronically, but there is no
indication Defendant agreed to accept electronic service. Unrepresented
persons are exempt from any mandatory electronic filing imposed pursuant to
this subdivision.” (Civ.
Proc. Code § 1010.6(f)(2).)
 
In this regard, Defendant’s opposition which was filed only
three days prior to the hearing is also untimely, but the motion itself was
untimely. As noted below, however, all of this is neither here nor there.
 
In determining whether to lift the
stay on discovery, “[t]he court should also consider the plaintiff’s need for discovery in the context
of the issues raised in the SLAPP motion.” (The Garment Workers Center v.
Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1156, 1162.) In this regard, substantively, the Court has examined
Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and indicates that it will be denied because it
far exceeds the 15-page limit set forth in Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(d).
Indeed, the SLAPP motion is 31 pages, and Defendant in pro per did not obtain
permission to file a memorandum of points and authorities which is more than
double the page limit. Defendant wasted most of the brief discussing irrelevant
matters and did not address facts pertaining to the first prong of the
SLAPP analysis—as to which a moving Defendant bears the burden[1]—until
Page 16 of the brief.
The Court
showed lenience by allowing Defendant to file a late SLAPP motion, but the
Court will not excuse Defendant’s egregious violation of the page limit. Pro per litigants are not entitled to more
favorable or lenient treatment than other litigants or attorneys when it comes
to adherence to the California Rules of Court or Code of Civil Procedure.  (See Harding
v. Collazo (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1056; Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276,
1284.).
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s SLAPP motion scheduled to be
heard on May 6, 2024 is ADVANCED TO THIS DATE AND DENIED. The automatic
discovery stay imposed by Civ. Proc. Code, § 426.16(g) is no longer in effect.
As such, the motion to lift the
stay of discovery is MOOT, and therefore taken OFF-CALENDAR.
