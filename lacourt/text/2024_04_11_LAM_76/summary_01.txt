Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion for leave to amend the answer filed by Defendant Repwest Insurance Company and Matt Tokasey. The motion is granted, and the defendants are required to file their stand-alone answers today, which will be deemed served as of the date of this order. The proposed amendment adds two defenses: (1) Repwest is required to report suspicious claims to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) under California law, and (2) the common interest privilege covers statements made between Repwest and the NICB. The court finds that the amendment is necessary in light of the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication, and that there is no prejudice to the plaintiffs.
