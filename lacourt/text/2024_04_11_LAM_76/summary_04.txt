And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the SLAPP motion filed by Defendant Leticia Roa Saguanpong. The defendant's motion exceeded the 15-page limit and did not obtain permission to file a memorandum of points and authorities. The court also found that the defendant's opposition was untimely filed. The court notes that the motion to lift the stay on discovery is moot since the automatic discovery stay has been lifted. The court will not excuse the defendant's egregious violation of the page limit. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any responses received from the parties.
