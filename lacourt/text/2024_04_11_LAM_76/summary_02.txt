This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint by Plaintiff Roberto Bustamante. The Plaintiff seeks to add new allegations and theories to the complaint, including alter-ego and joint enterprise allegations. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendants defrauded him into taking out a short-term bridge loan with exorbitant up-front costs and an enormous balloon payment as a step towards obtaining a reverse mortgage. The Defendants argue that the delay in seeking leave to amend the complaint is inexcusable and will cause prejudice due to the delay in trial. The Court will permit leave to amend on condition that Plaintiff shall sit for a second session of deposition pertaining to the new allegations if Defendants deem such to be necessary.
