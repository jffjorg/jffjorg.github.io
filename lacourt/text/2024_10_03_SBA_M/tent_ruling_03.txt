U.S. Bank Trust National Association’s Demurrer to Complaint
U.S. Bank Trust National Association’s Motion to Strike Portions
     of Complaint  

 
TENTATIVE RULING
      
            U.S. Bank Trust National
Association’s Demurrer to Complaint is sustained without leave to amend, in
part, and sustained with 20 days leave to amend, in part.
 
U.S. Bank Trust National Association’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Complaint is deemed moot.
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June
10, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. This action arises from the recordation
of the notice of default and notice of trustee’s sale and resulting trustee’s
sale of Plaintiff’s former real property located at 15111 Freeman Ave Unit 50,
Lawndale, CA 90260. Plaintiff alleges multiple violations of the Homeowner’s
Bill of Rights Act (“HBOR”) as well as other causes of action. Plaintiff
alleges causes of action for: 1. Violation of Civ. Code 2923.5; 2. Violation of
Civ. Code 2924.9; 3.  Wrongful
Foreclosure; 4. Promissory Estoppel; 5. Unfair Business Practices. 
 
            Defendant Selene Finance was
dismissed on July 24, 2024. Defendant U.S. Bank Trust N.A. filed a demurrer and
motion to strike.
 
            Meet
and Confer 

            Defendant set forth an adequate meet
and confer declaration in compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Declaration, Stephen M. Dailey, ¶¶ 2-5.) 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 452(c)(d) and (h). Pursuant
to Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265, overruled on other grounds in Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016)
62 Cal.4th 919:  “[A] court
may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the date the
document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in
a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative language, assuming
there is no genuine dispute regarding the document’s authenticity.” Id.
 
Demurrer
 
            A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the
sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.)  Because
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each
cause of action.  (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
            Defendant demurs to the Complaint and each cause of
action on the grounds that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. CCP § 430.10(e)(f).
 
            First Cause of Action for
Violation of Civ. Code § 2923.5
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the first
cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
            “[U]nder the plain language of
section 2923.5, read in conjunction with section 2924g, the only remedy
provided is a postponement of the sale before it happens.” Mabry v. Superior
Court (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 208, 235. Here, upon matters to which the
Court may take judicial notice, the trustee’s sale has already occurred, and
Plaintiff has no remedy under Section 2923.5. (Defendant’s RJN, Ex. 19.)
 
            Thus, the demurrer to the first
cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.

Second Cause of Action for Violation of Civ. Code
2924.9
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the second
cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
Civ. Code, § 2924.9 states:
“(a) Unless a borrower has previously exhausted the
first lien loan modification process offered by, or through, his or her
mortgage servicer described in Section 2923.6, within five business days after
recording a notice of default pursuant to Section 2924, a mortgage servicer
that offers one or more foreclosure prevention alternatives shall send a
written communication to the borrower that includes all of the following
information:
(1) That the borrower may be evaluated for a
foreclosure prevention alternative or, if applicable, foreclosure prevention
alternatives.
(2) Whether an application is required to be submitted
by the borrower in order to be considered for a foreclosure prevention
alternative.
(3) The means and process by which a borrower may
obtain an application for a foreclosure prevention alternative.
(b) This section shall not apply to entities described
in subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18.
(c) This section shall apply only to mortgages or
deeds of trust described in Section 2924.15.”
 
            Civ. Code, § 2924.15 states: “(a)
Unless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 2924 and
Sections 2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18
shall apply only to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust[.]”
 
            Thus, the statutes identified above
only apply to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust. Upon matters specifically
alleged by Plaintiff and to which the Court may take judicial notice, demurring
Defendant U.S. Bank foreclosed on a second lien, and not on a first lien.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 12-19; Ex. A; RJN, Exs. 1-2.) 
 
            Therefore, the demurrer to the second
cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Third Cause of Action for Wrongful Foreclosure
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to
state a cause of action. 
 
The cause of action is based on the same statutory
violations set forth above in the first two causes of action. Thus, as the
demurrer to those causes of action was sustained, no underlying facts to
support a cause of action for Wrongful Foreclosure exists.
 
            “The elements of a wrongful
foreclosure cause of action are: (1) [T]he trustee or mortgagee caused an
illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to
a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the
sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or
harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale,
the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was
excused from tendering.” Sciarratta v.
U.S. Bank National Assn. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 552, 561–562 (internal
quotations and citations omitted.)  Here,
in addition to the deficiencies noted above because Plaintiff has not alleged
facts to demonstrate that the foreclosure sale was void as opposed to voidable,
Plaintiff is also required to allege that she has tendered the amount of the
indebtedness. Plaintiff has failed to do so. 
 
            Thus, the demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
            Fourth Cause of Action for
Promissory Estoppel
 
As to the fourth cause of action for Promissory
Estoppel, the demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to
state a cause of action.
 
            “The elements of a promissory
estoppel claim are (1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2)
reliance by the party to whom the promise is made; (3)[the] reliance must be
both reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must
be injured by his reliance.” Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 218, 225.  
 
Plaintiff fails to allege that Defendant U.S. Bank
made a clear and unambiguous promise. Plaintiff appears to allege on this
purported ambiguous promise: “PLAINTIFF’s single point of contact advised her
and reassured her that the 2nd mortgage would NOT sell her house because the
first and second mortgage were held by the same lender and thus the first lien
position out ranks the second, so not to worry.” (Complaint, ¶ 17
(capitalization in original).)  First, as
noted, the promise is not clear and unambiguous. Second, there is no showing
that the promise was made by demurring Defendant.  In fact, the next allegation makes it appear
that the alleged promise was made by former Defendant Selene Finance: “SF
DEFENDANT told PLAINTIFF that this will be given to their legal team to resolve.”
(Complaint, ¶ 18 (capitalization in original).)  Second, Plaintiff fails to allege facts to
show that the reliance was reasonable and foreseeable. 
 
            Thus, the demurrer to the fourth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
            Fifth Cause of Action for
Unfair Business Practices
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to
state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
            “California Business and Professions
Code Sections 17000, et seq., and 17200, et seq., states [sic] that unfair
competition shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
practices.” Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 618–19. “By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business act or practice, the UCL
“borrows” rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules
independently actionable. [Citation.] However, a practice may violate the UCL even
if it is not prohibited by another statute.” Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
Com. v. Insomniac, Inc. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 803, 835. “The unfair
competition law is independent of the Unfair Practices Act and other laws. Its
remedies are “cumulative ... to the remedies or penalties available under all
other laws of this state” (§ 17205), but its sanctions are less severe than
those of the Unfair Practices Act. Prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited
to injunctive relief and restitution. (§ 17203; see ABC Internat.
Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Corp. (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1247,
1268 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 931 P.2d 290].) Plaintiffs may not receive damages,
much less treble damages, or attorney fees.” Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163, 179.
 
            Based on the underlying allegations
noted above, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate
unlawful, fraudulent, and/or unfair business practices on the part of demurring
Defendant. 
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendant moves to strike the following items: “1. The words “PLAINTIFF is entitled to punitive
damages for wrongful foreclosure. See Kachlon v. Markowitz (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 316, 345. The managing agents of SF DEFENDANT and MEB DEFENDANT
were responsible for setting their illegal and unauthorized foreclosure and
related tort actions,” appearing at page 7, paragraph 37. 2. The words “For
punitive damages for wrongful foreclosure,” appearing at page 9, paragraph 6 of
the Prayer. 3. The words “For compensatory, special and general damages in an
amount subject to proof at trial,” appearing at page 9, paragraph 1 of the
Prayer. 4. The words “of damages,” appearing at page 9, paragraph 8 of the
Prayer.” (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 13-24).
 
The motion to strike is moot pursuant to the Court’s
order sustaining the demurrer to the Complaint in its entirety.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
