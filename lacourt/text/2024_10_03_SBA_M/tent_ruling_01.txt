CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom

rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
CCP § 2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(b)).
 
Defendant served upon Plaintiff Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, on February 3, 2024.  (Decls., Eric Dabiri, ¶¶ 3-9.)  Defendant contends that no responses were
