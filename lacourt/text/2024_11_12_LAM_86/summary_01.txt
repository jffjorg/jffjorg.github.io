And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has ruled in favor of the City of Rancho Palos Verdes and the City Council, granting their motion to dismiss the first cause of action in the lawsuit. The lawsuit is about the City's approval of a project, and the judge has found that the plaintiff, Tangerine Holdings, LLC, did not follow the proper procedures to challenge the approval.

Specifically, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff did not object to the City Council's approval of the project during the public hearing, and did not file a request for a hearing within 90 days of filing the lawsuit. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not a valid reason to challenge the approval.

The judge has considered the plaintiff's arguments, including their claim that the City delayed in providing the administrative record, but has found that this does not excuse the plaintiff's failure to timely request a hearing. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the failure to timely request a hearing should be excused due to attorney fault.

As a result of the judge's ruling, the first cause of action in the lawsuit, which alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), is hereby dismissed.
