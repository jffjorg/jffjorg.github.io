[TENTATIVE] RULING ON (1) ORDER TO SHOW
  CAUSE RE: WHY THE COURT SHOULD NOT ORDER NON-DISCLOSURE OF SUBJECT MATERIAL
  AND (2) MOTION TO FILE RECORDS UNDER SEAL
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



I.           
FACTUAL
AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
This
proceeding concerns petitioner’s response to Request for Proposal No. C5611414
(“RFP”) for Global Positioning System (“GPS”) and Electronic Monitoring
Services. (Pet. at 2:1-7.) Petitioner BI Incorporated is the largest provider
of GPS tracking technologies in the United States. (Pet. ¶ 3.) 
 
On
September 5, 2024, respondent California Department of Technology (“CDT”)
notified petitioner that it received a California Public Records Act request
for documents that petitioner submitted to the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation in response to the RFP. (Pet. ¶¶ 4, 6.) CDT
allowed petitioner to provide proposed redactions to petitioner’s submission
materials. (Pet. ¶ 7.) CDT disagreed with the extent of petitioner’s proposed
redactions and provided petitioner with a version of its submission materials
with fewer redactions than petitioner desires. (Pet. ¶ 7; Hansen Decl. re: Ex
Parte Application ¶ 3 & Ex. C.) 
 
On
October 11, 2024, CDT provided petitioner up to October 21, 2024 to obtain a
court order preventing disclosure of petitioner’s response to the RFP. (Hansen
Decl. re: Ex Parte Application ¶ 3 & Ex. C.) On October 17, 2024,
petitioner filed an ex parte application seeking to stay the release of
petitioner’s response to the RFP, as well as a motion to seal the parties’
competing redacted versions of petitioner’s submission materials. (See Hansen
Decl. re: Motion to Seal ¶ 3 & Exs. A, B.) Respondent stood by its proposed
redactions but indicated that it would not oppose petitioner’s proposed
redactions in court and that it would comply with the Court’s orders regarding
disclosure. (Hansen Supp. Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. 1.) 
 
On
October 28, 2024, the Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining CDT
from releasing its proposed redacted version of petitioner’s response to the
RFP. The Court also issued an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction
should not be ordered enjoining CDT from releasing the redacted version
proposed by it, instead of the redacted version proposed by petitioner, which
contains more redactions. 
 
No
opposition to the Order to Show Cause has been filed.
 
II.         
ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE RE: WHY THE COURT SHOULD NOT ORDER NON-DISCLOSURE OF SUBJECT
MATERIAL
 
BI
Incorporated seeks a preliminary injunction restraining respondent California
Department from releasing the lesser redacted version of the Response for
Proposal Number C56111414 proposed by respondent instead of the more redacted
version as proposed by petitioner.
 
“[T]he
question whether a preliminary injunction should be granted involves two
interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the
merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is likely to result from the
granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528,
554.)
 
Under the California Public Records Act (“CPRA”),
“every person has a right to inspect any public record” of a state or local
agency subject to statutory exemptions. (Gov. Code § 7922.530(a).) Agencies may
withhold any record upon a showing that “on the facts of the particular case
the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the
public interest served by disclosure of the record.” (Gov. Code § 7922.000.)
Third parties seeking to prevent an agency from producing their records can
file a “reverse-CPRA” action to obtain a determination that such records are
exempt from disclosure. (See Marken
v. Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School Dist. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1265-67.) “The burden
of proof as to the application of an exemption [to the CPRA] is on the
proponent of nondisclosure, who must demonstrate ‘that on the facts of the
particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly
outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.’” (Humane
Society of U.S. v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1255.)
 
The CPRA also does not require disclosure of records
that are privileged under the Evidence Code. (Gov. Code §7927.705.) Under
Evidence Code § 1060, “the owner of a trade secret has a privilege to refuse to
disclose the secret, and to prevent another from disclosing it, if the
allowance of the privilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work
injustice.” (Evid. Code § 1060.) A “trade secret” is “information, including a
formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:
(1) [d]erives independent economic value… from not being generally known to the
public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or
use; and (2) [i]s the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the
circumstances to maintain its secrecy.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 3426.1(d).) “[T]he party claiming the [trade
secret] privilege has the burden of establishing its existence.” (Bridgestone/Firestone,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1393.)
 
Based on the “catch-all” provision of Government
Code § 7922.000 and its assertion that certain information in the response to
RFP is confidential and/or implicates public safety concerns if disclosed,
petitioner proposes redactions to which respondent has not agreed. Based on the
authorities cited above, the Court rules as follows concerning petitioner’s
proposed redactions:
 



Proposed Redaction Number


Page Number
( __ of 562)


Ruling


Reason




1


28


GRANT


Petitioner takes measures to ensure that the
  identity of its supplier remains confidential, from which it derives economic
  value due to having vetted the supplier over time. (Murnock Decl. ¶¶ 15-17.)




2


30


DENY


The title, business telephone number, and business
  email address (as opposed to home phone numbers and addresses) of
  petitioner’s customer do not implicate any public safety concern that would
  outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Petitioner also does not show
  that it has taken measures to maintain the secrecy of the identity of its
  customer.

DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate how knowing the
  numbers describing its market reach could confer any advantage on its
  competitors or would jeopardize public safety by providing information to
  offenders to side step, challenge, or defeat the device. (See Murnock
  Decl. ¶ 4.)




6


40


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate how its
  competitors could obtain economic value from knowing how much petitioner
  spent on research and development. (See Murnock Decl. ¶¶ 4, 13.)





 



7


42


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate how it derives
  economic value from maintaining the secrecy of the number of products it
  manufactured. 




8


43


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate that it has taken
  measures to keep secret that it has a trainer on the specified manufacturing
  standards or that it derives any economic value from having such a trainer. (See
  generally Murnock Decl.) The assertion in the RFP that there are 3,600
  certified trainers globally suggests that the possibility of petitioner
  having such a trainer on staff is not a trade secret.




9


44


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate how knowing the
  numbers describing its market reach or the number of monitored individuals on
  its systems confers any advantage on its competitors. 




10


45


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate that it has taken
  measures to keep the amount of square feet it utilizes for equipment
  production secret or that such information has any economic value.




11


46


GRANT


Petitioner uses multiple security measures to
  protect and maintain the security of its server room and has a valid interest
  in preventing the widespread dissemination of the particular security
  features employed.  There is minimal
  public interest in knowing petitioner’s precise security measures.




12


47


DENY


Petitioner asserts that it has contractual
  obligations to keep information about the SmartLINK mobile application
  confidential. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 19.) However, the number of individuals who
  use SmartLINK does not appear to give insight into how the application works
  or the terms of any contract between petitioner and an agency. 




13


48


GRANT


Petitioner seeks to redact information regarding
  how it determines whether an offender was near an area where a crime was
  committed. The Court finds that the information could be used to evade
  monitoring, which implicates public safety and outweighs the public interest
  in disclosure. (Murnock Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 22, 23.)




14


49


GRANT


Same as #13.





 



15


50


GRANT IN PART


The response time of petitioner to parole agent
  calls could potentially be information that would assist an offender in
  evading monitoring.  Accordingly, the
  phrase beginning with “in less” and ending in “average” may be redacted.  The number of outbound calls it places and
  the number of hours of its training program do not appear to be information
  that offenders could use to evade monitoring. The public interest in
  disclosure outweighs any public interest in non-disclosure of such
  information.




16


54


DENY


Petitioner has not demonstrated how it derives any
  economic value from keeping secret the number of program managers it would
  assign to support personnel at the California Department of Corrections and
  Rehabilitation (“CDCR”). 




17


55


GRANT


Petitioner seeks to redact information concerning
  how its technology could be used to track an offender’s movements in critical
  situations. The Court finds that the information could be used to evade
  monitoring, which implicates public safety and outweighs the public interest
  in disclosure. (Murnock Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 22, 23.)




18


56


GRANT


Same as #17




19


57


GRANT


Petitioner seeks to redact information concerning
  how it can be determined whether an offender has tampered with a monitoring
  device. The information could be used to evade monitoring, which implicates
  public safety and outweighs the public interest in disclosure. (Murnock Decl.
  ¶ 24.)





 



20


58


GRANT IN PART


Petitioner seeks to redact information regarding
  the contents of TotalAccess reports (paragraph beginning with “Total Access
  reports include” and ending with “discharges”). It is not readily apparent
  how an offender could use this information to evade monitoring. The
  information concerning the TotalAccess reports shall not be redacted.  
 
The other highlighted information which petitioner
  seeks to redact concern tamper detection technology. The information could be
  used to evade monitoring, which implicates public safety and outweighs the
  public interest in disclosure. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 24.) This information
  concerning tamper detection shall be redacted. 




21


63


DENY


Petitioners do not show how numbers concerning the
  GPS locations processed per day and the comparison of GPS points with
  reported crimes could be used to evade monitoring.




22


64


GRANT IN PART


Petitioner seeks to redact information concerning
  crime scene correlation. The Court finds that the information could be used
  to evade monitoring, which implicates public safety and outweighs the public
  interest in disclosure. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.) The information concerning crime
  scene correlation shall be redacted.
 
With respect to the location of petitioner’s
  Monitoring Operations, however, petitioner does not demonstrate any threat to
  public safety that would result from disclosure of this information.
  Petitioner only asserts that the information should remain confidential and
  non-public. Petitioner does not show that the public interest in
  non-disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The
  location of petitioner’s Monitoring Operations shall not be redacted.





 



23


65


DENY


Respondent CDT’s proposed redactions are
  sufficient and strike the proper balance between withholding any information
  that could be used to evade monitoring and the public’s right to inspect any
  public record. Petitioner only speculates that an experienced IT professional
  could guess the redacted information. Even if such a professional guesses the
  redacted information, petitioner does not state how an offender could use the
  information to evade monitoring. 




24


70


DENY


Same as #23




25


72


GRANT


It is unclear what independent economic value
  petitioner derives from how it trains supervision authorities. Nevertheless,
  offenders could use the training subjects to determine what supervision
  authorities know and exploit such determination accordingly to evade
  monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 10.) 




26


73


GRANT


Same as #25




27


74


GRANT


Information concerning petitioner’s
  troubleshooting processes and process to ensure its location map data is
  updated every 60 seconds could be exploited to evade monitoring. 




28


75


GRANT


Information concerning petitioner’s tracking
  processes could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




29


76


GRANT


Information concerning petitioner’s data storage,
  data retrieval, and contingency plans in the event of an emergency could be
  exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




30


77


GRANT


Information concerning how petitioner’s geo-fence
  monitoring works could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




31


78


GRANT


Information concerning how the device is monitored
  and how motion is detected could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock
  Decl. ¶ 7.)




32


79


GRANT


Information concerning how the device works during
  electrical power-related events, how a device can confirm signal coverage,
  and how the device can detect if its case has been compromised could be
  exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




33


80


GRANT IN PART


Information concerning how the device can detect
  if its case has been compromised and petitioner’s quality assurance processes
  prior to delivery of devices could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock
  Decl. ¶ 7.) This information shall be redacted.
 
However, the number of GPS products that
  petitioner manufactured neither sufficiently implicates public safety nor
  imparts any independent economic value on petitioner. This information shall
  not be redacted.




34


81


GRANT


Petitioner takes measures to ensure that
  information concerning its suppliers remains confidential and derives
  economic value due to having vetted the suppliers over time. (Murnock Decl.
  ¶¶ 15-17.)




35


82


GRANT IN PART


Information concerning petitioner’s inventory
  management capabilities and how petitioner’s devices operate in the event of
  low battery could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.) This
  information shall be redacted. 
 
However, the amount of money that petitioner
  spends for research and development, set forth in Figure 20 on page 82, shall
  not be redacted. Petitioner does not demonstrate how its competitors could
  obtain economic value from knowing how much petitioner spent on research and
  development.




36


83


GRANT


Information concerning how petitioner’s devices
  operate in the event of low battery could be exploited to evade monitoring.
  (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




37


84


GRANT IN PART


Information concerning petitioner’s monitoring
  operations could be exploited to evade monitoring.
 
However, for the reasons stated above with respect
  to #22, the location of petitioner’s Monitoring Operations shall not be
  redacted.




38


86


GRANT


Information concerning petitioner’s monitoring
  operations could be exploited to evade monitoring.




39


87


GRANT


Same as #38.




40


88


GRANT


Same as #38.




41


89


DENY


Information concerning petitioner’s testing
  requirements for staff prior to working in monitoring operations does not
  sufficiently implicate public safety to warrant non-disclosure. 




42


90


DENY


Information concerning petitioner’s data center
  transition is not specific enough to implicate any public safety concerns or
  warrant non-disclosure. Petitioner also does not set forth efforts it has
  taken to keep secret information concerning the two federal agencies for
  which petitioner currently serves as a cloud service provider. 




42 (sic)


91


DENY


Petitioner does not demonstrate any threat to
  public safety that would result from disclosure of the cities where its data
  centers are located. Petitioner does not show that the public interest in
  non-disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 




43


92


DENY


It is not readily apparent how offenders could
  exploit information concerning petitioner’s accreditation and the fact that
  it takes anti-virus software practices to evade monitoring. 




44


93

Details concerning the measures petitioner takes
  to secure its systems, as well as how its systems are designed, could be
  exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)

  monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




48


97


GRANT


Same as #47.





 



49


98


GRANT IN PART


With respect to how petitioner’s software will
  interface with CDCR’s systems, respondent CDT’s proposed redactions are
  sufficient and strike the proper balance between withholding any information
  that could be used to evade monitoring and the public’s right to inspect any
  public record. Petitioner only speculates that an experienced IT professional
  could guess the redacted information. Even if such a professional guesses the
  redacted information, petitioner does not state how an offender could use the
  information to evade monitoring. This information shall not be redacted.
 
With respect to the number of agencies that
  petitioner currently supports, it is not readily apparent how this
  information could be exploited to evade monitoring. This information shall
  not be redacted.
 
With respect to petitioner’s TotalAccess
  architecture and how agencies could use the software, this information could
  be exploited to evade monitoring. The paragraph beginning with “TotalAccess
  architecture” and ending with “contacting BI” shall be redacted.

99


GRANT


Information concerning the possible configurations
  in TotalAccess could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




51


100


GRANT


Information concerning the possible configurations
  in TotalAccess and how the software identifies locations visited by an
  offender could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)




52


101


GRANT


Information concerning how petitioner’s software
  identifies locations visited by an offender could be exploited to evade
  monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.) As the information pertains to petitioner’s
  central goal of tracking the location of offenders, petitioner derives
  independent economic value from its efforts to keep the information secret.

GRANT IN PART


It is not readily apparent how offenders could
  exploit information concerning petitioner’s accreditation and the fact that
  it takes anti-virus software practices to evade monitoring. This information
  shall not be redacted. 
 
However, details concerning the measures
  petitioner takes to secure its systems, i.e., the information after
  the sentence “Key aspects of BI’s approach to anti-virus software include:”,
  could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.) This information
  shall be redacted.

GRANT IN PART


Details concerning the measures petitioner takes
  to secure its systems, i.e., the information above the “Hiring
  Practices” section, could be exploited to evade monitoring. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.)
  This information shall be redacted.
 
With respect to the “Hiring Practices” section,
  however, it is not readily apparent how offenders could exploit information
  concerning the background checks of its employees and the goals of staff
  training to evade monitoring. This information shall not be redacted.




65


116


GRANT IN PART


It is not readily apparent how information
  concerning petitioner’s background check and data segmentation requirements
  could be used to evade monitoring. This information shall not be redacted. 
 
With respect to petitioner’s crime scene
  correlation capabilities, however, the Court finds that the information could
  be used to evade monitoring, which implicates public safety and outweighs the
  public interest in disclosure. (Murnock Decl. ¶ 7.) The information
  concerning crime scene correlation shall be redacted.

How CDCR Parole Agents can use SmartLINK to verify
  offender attendance at appointments and treatment locations may defeat
  monitoring of the offender and shall be redacted.
 
With respect to the identities of petitioner’s
  employees, the Court agrees that, for personal safety reasons, this
  information shall be redacted. 




71


122


GRANT IN PART


Information concerning how petitioner would
  respond to a subpoena does not implicate public safety that would warrant
  non-disclosure. Nor does this information imparts any independent economic
  value on petitioner. On its face, how petitioner would respond to a subpoena
  does not reveal communications between a client and lawyer. (See Evid.
  Code § 954.) This information shall not be redacted.
 
With respect to the goals of its Quality Control
  program, i.e., the information after Question 50, the Court agrees
  that the information imparts independent economic value on petitioner and
  would pose a threat of competitive harm if revealed. This information shall
  be redacted.

132


DENY


The title, business telephone number, and business
  email address (as opposed to home phone numbers and addresses) of
  petitioner’s customers do not implicate any public safety concern that would
  outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Petitioner also does not show
  that it has taken measures to maintain the secrecy of the identity of its
  customers.



 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that petitioner has demonstrated a
probability of demonstrating at trial that certain information, as specified in
the table above, should be redacted in the interest of public safety and/or to
protect trade secrets.  This is
particularly so given that the CDT has not provided the identity of the
requestor to petitioner (Supp. Hansen Decl. ¶ 4),
 
Petitioner has also demonstrated the harm that would
result from denial of a preliminary injunction to enjoin disclosure of the
information that the Court has deemed should be redacted, as set forth above.
Should respondent CDT disclose the information subject to redaction prior to
trial, confidentiality of the information can no longer be ensured. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, petitioner’s request for
a preliminary injunction is GRANTED IN PART as set forth in the table above. The Court’s Temporary
Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause re: Preliminary Injunction issued on
10/28/24 is DISCHARGED.
 
III.       
MOTION
TO FILE RECORDS UNDER SEAL
 
For
the reasons stated above with respect to petitioner’s request for a preliminary
injunction, petitioner’s UNOPPOSED motion to seal is GRANTED IN PART. Exhibits
A and B to the declaration of Lisa Kralik Hansen in support of the motion to
seal (i.e., the parties’ respective proposed redaction to petitioner’s
response to the Request for Proposal) shall be filed under seal, as it is
impracticable to separate redactable information from non-redactable
information contain in electronic files located on USB drives. 
 
However,
“the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing and assessing the
performance of its public judicial system, and that interest strongly supports
a general right of access in ordinary civil cases.” (NBC Subsidiary
(KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1210.) California
recognizes a common law and First Amendment right of access to court records. (Overstock.com,
Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 483; see
also Rule of Court 2.550(c) [court records presumed to be open].) 
 
Accordingly,
pursuant to the general right of access to court records, by no later than
11/20/24, petitioner BI Incorporated shall file a version of its response to
the RFP with the redactions approved by the Court as set forth in the table
above, so there is a public record of what this Court decided may and may not
be preliminarily enjoined from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.
