MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
      


 
MOVING
PARTY:              Defendant Wilma Almaraz 
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:     Plaintiff Audra Iovino
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff Audra Iovino (Plaintiffs) filed
this case against Defendant Wilma Almaraz (Almaraz), individually and as
Trustee of the Wilma Almaraz Trust, for wrongful eviction from the residential property
at 17061 Lisette St., Granada Hills, CA 91344.
 
On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of
Summons by substituted service.  The
Proof of Service states that the summons was served on a “John Doe” co-resident
on April 7, 2024, and thereafter mailed by first-class mail.  Service of process was effected by a
registered California process server.
 
On June 13, 2024, Almaraz filed this Motion to Quash Service
of Summons.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  No reply was filed.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
            Personal
service may be accomplished by personally delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint to the person to be served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) 
If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot, with reasonable diligence, be
personally delivered to the person being served, substitute service may be
effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s
“dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual
mailing address ... in the presence of ... a person apparently in charge ...
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail ... to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons
and complaint were left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).)  
 
A defendant must file a motion to quash service of summons
on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead unless the time is
extended by stipulation or by a judge’s order for good case.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  Although the notice of motion must
designate a hearing date not more than 30 days after the notice is filed,
scheduling a hearing date beyond the 30-day time period does not deprive the
court of jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.  (Olinick
v. BMB Entertainment (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1295-96.) 
 
Filing a proof of service by a registered process server
creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390 (Zara);
Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return of a process server registered pursuant to ...
the Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in
the return”].)  This evidentiary presumption also applies in unlawful
detainer actions and is “consistent with the purpose of the unlawful detainer
procedure to afford a relatively simple and speedy remedy for specific
landlord-tenant disputes.”  (Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1427 (Palm Property).) However, the
presumption only arises if the proof of service complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-42.)  Proof of service of summons may
be impeached by evidence that contradicts it. 
(City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726,
731.) 
 
When a defendant moves to quash service of summons, the
plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”¿  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Almaraz is not
entitled to an order quashing service of the summons and complaint.  Filing a proof of service by a registered
process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. 
(Zara, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 390; see also Evid.
Code, § 647.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons by substituted service which is
supported by her registered process server Ronny DelCid’s declaration of due
diligence.  According to the declaration,
Mr. DelCid made thirteen separate attempts at personal service between 2/26/24 to
4/7/24 at 27542 Crossglade Avenue, Canyon Country, California 91351 (the
Premises).  (See Proof of Service of
Summons, 5/2/24.)  After personal service
failed, Mr. DelCid delivered the summons and complaint to an unnamed male on
April 7, 2024.  Plaintiff meets her
burden to create a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.
 
            Almaraz
attacks Mr. DelCid’s alleged service by substituted service.  In support, Almaraz  explains she was out of the country on April
7, 2024 and that no other person occupied or was authorized to be present at
the Premises.  (Almaraz Decl., ¶ 4.)  Almaraz further explains Mr. DelCid’s
description of the person who was delivered the summons does not match any
member of Almaraz’s household, or of any person with whom she is familiar.  (Id.) 
In other words, Almaraz challenges the veracity of Mr. DelCid’s
declaration.  
 
            The court
is not persuaded by Almaraz’s showing.  As
Plaintiff points out, if Almaraz was out of the country on April 7, 2024, Almaraz
could not and would not know whether anyone was present at the Premises at the
time Mr. DelCid effected substituted service. 
Plaintiff also submits evidence to show Almaraz’s insurance company was
informed of the lawsuit and that  Almaraz’s personal attorneys did not allow her
insurance carrier to accept service.  (See
Chung Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. B.)  The point
being, if no one associated with Almaraz received the complaint how did Almaraz
and/or her insurance company learn of the lawsuit.  Almaraz does not rebut the presumption that
service was proper.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the Motion To Quash is DENIED.   
 
Almaraz is ordered to file and serve her Answer to the
Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
