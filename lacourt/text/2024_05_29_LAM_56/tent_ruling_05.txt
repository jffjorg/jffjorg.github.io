BACKGROUND
 
             On February 28,
2023, Plaintiff Jessica Margarita Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendant JCKY Property Investment, LLC (“Defendant”). On May 19, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) against
Defendant. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings where the court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that
defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(1)(B).)  A
non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before
or during trial.  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100
Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)  
 
“A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is subject to the same rules governing
demurrers.”  (Hardy v. America’s Best Home Loans (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 795, 802.)  “Like a demurrer, the grounds for the motion must
appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice and the [cross-complainant’s]
allegations are accepted as true.”  (Id.)  “A motion for
judgment on the pleadings may be brought . . .  on the grounds the [cross]
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.”  (Id.)  In the context of a motion
for judgment on the pleadings a court “accept[s] as true the
[cross-complainant’s] factual allegations and construe[s] them
liberally.”  (Stevenson Real Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis
Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1220.)   
Here, Defendant’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings (the “Motion”) contends that Plaintiff’s FAC fails to
plead sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. 
Initially, the Court notes that the
address at which Defendant served the Motion on Plaintiff, who is
self-represented, is different than Plaintiff’s address in the Court’s record.
Defendant served the Motion on Plaintiff with the Motion by mail at 1211 E.
64th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90044. However, the address Plaintiff has listed
on her forms is 1211 W. 64th Street Los Angeles, CA 90044. 
Further, the Motion was also served by email. Service
by electronic service on self-represented litigants is authorized only with
their express consent.  (CCP § 1010.6; California Rule of Court Rule
2.251(a).) There is no notice of Plaintiff’s consent to electronic service on
record with the Court and Defendant has not set forth any other evidence that
Plaintiff consented to electronic service. 
As a result, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
