RESPONDING PARTY:        Defendant Dolly Hwang (“Responding Parety”)
            
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a habitability case. On
November 28, 2022, plaintiffs William Demarest, Moving Party, Helen Ortega,
George Calderon, Maria Ybarra (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against defendants Responding Party, Guochang International, Inc., and Does 1
through 10, alleging causes of action for: (1) recission; (2) negligence –
premises liability; (3) breach of implied warranty of
habitability/tenantability; (4) breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment;
(5) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) violation of
Civil Code section 1942.4; (7) unfair business practices; and (8) and Rosenthal
Act violation – Civil Code section 1788 et seq.
 
            On January 31, 2024, Moving Party filed
the instant motion (the “Motion”) to compel the deposition of Responding Party.
On February 15, 2024, Responding Party filed an opposition to the Motion and on
February 20, 2024, Moving Party filed a response.
 
MEET AND CONFER
             A motion to compel deposition attendance
requires the moving party to provide a declaration setting forth the parties’
meet and confer efforts, or in the case of a nonappearance, a declaration
indicating that the moving party contacted the deponent about the nonappearance.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The Court finds Moving Party’s
declaration satisfactory. (Ackerman Decl., ¶ 9.)
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
            Analysis
            Moving Party seeks to compel the
deposition of Responding Party following Responding Party’s nonappearance at a
deposition scheduled on January 30, 2024. (Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) Moving
Party indicates that she originally served Responding Party with a notice of
deposition on November 13, 2023, with the deposition set for December 22, 2023.
(Ackerman Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Responding Party’s counsel, Mr. Uzoh, objected to
the date due to his and Responding Party’s unavailability, but offered three
alternate dates, one of which was January 30, 2024. (Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 4-5,
Exs. B, C.) Moving Party then served Responding Party with an amended notice of
deposition on December 19, 2023, with the rescheduled deposition date for
January 30, 2024. (Ackerman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. D.) On January 24, 2024, Mr. Uzoh
objected to the deposition on the grounds that he was unavailable on that date
and time due to a trial in another matter. (Ackerman Decl., ¶ 6; Uzoh Decl.,
Ex. 1.)[1]
Counsel for Moving Party subsequently learned that the trial start time was in
the afternoon on January 30, 2024, rather than in the morning. (Ackerman Decl.,
¶ 7, Ex. F.) Responding Party and Mr. Uzoh failed to appear at the deposition.
(Ackerman Decl., ¶ 8; Notice of Lodging.) Counsel for Moving Party inquired
about the nonappearance, but no response was received as of the filing of this
motion. (Ackerman Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. G.)
 
            In opposition, Responding Party contends
that the objection was served because of Mr. Uzoh’s unavailability due to a
scheduled trial, but that before Responding Party could confer with Mr. Uzoh to
propose a new deposition date within the five business days demanded by counsel
for Moving Party, Moving Party proceeded with the deposition on January 30,
2024 in Responding Party’s absence. (Uzoh Decl., ¶¶ 3-10, Exs. 1-3.) Mr. Uzoh
sent an email to counsel for Moving Party on January 31, 2024, proposing other
dates for the deposition. (Uzoh Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. 4.)
 
            The Court finds Responding Party’s
objection to the deposition on January 30, 2024, was invalid. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.410; Id., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) Responding Party’s opposition
does not address the fact that Responding Party provided the date that the
parties agreed upon for the deposition. (Ackerman Decl., Ex. C.) Responding
Party does not explain why Mr. Uzoh failed to account for the trial in the
unrelated matter when offering the date of January 30, 2024. The deposition
date was set one only month out, and there is no evidence to support why Mr.
Uzoh did not either know or should have known whether he would be in trial that
day. (Ackerman Decl., Ex. C.) The Court does, however, find that although the
objection claims that the trial in the unrelated matter was scheduled for the
same time as the deposition in this action, where the deposition was set for
9:30 a.m. on January 30, 2024 and the conflicting trial in the unrelated matter
was set for 1:30 p.m. that day [Ackerman Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. F; Uzoh Decl., Ex. 1],
having a trial set for the afternoon of the deposition may in fact constitute a
conflict.
 
            Nevertheless, the Court GRANTS the motion.
 
With
respect to monetary sanctions, the Court finds that Responding Party acted with
substantial justification in opposing the Motion, and that Moving Party should
have worked with Responding Party to find another mutually agreeable date for
the deposition.  As such, the Court
DENIES the request for monetary sanctions.
 
            The Court GRANTS the motion to
compel Defendant Dolly Hwang’s deposition. Defendant Hwang must appear for
deposition within 30 days of the Court’s ruling.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 29th day of May, 2024
