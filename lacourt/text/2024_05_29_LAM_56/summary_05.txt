And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argues that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action. The court notes that the defendant served the motion on the plaintiff by mail at an address that differs from the address listed in the court's records, and that the plaintiff did not consent to electronic service. The court concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice, and orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court's website.
