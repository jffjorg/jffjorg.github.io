And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The Plaintiffs, Greislye Parada and Bryan Andrew Carrillo, filed a complaint against Hyundai Motor America for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d), violation of Civil Code §1793.2(b), and breach of express warranty and implied warranty of merchantability.

The Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses was granted because the Plaintiffs established good cause for further production. The Plaintiffs' requests for production sought documents relating to the "Powertrain Defect" allegedly present in their vehicle. The Plaintiffs argued that whether the defect was present in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model and whether there were bulletins, customer complaints, and internal communications about this defect was relevant to the Defendant's knowledge of the defect, the Defendant's ability to cure the defect, and whether the Defendant undertook reasonable investigations to cure the defect.

The Defendant, Hyundai Motor America, objected to the requests for production on the ground that they were overinclusive. However, the Plaintiffs established good cause for further production, and the burden shifted to the Defendant to justify its objections as meritorious. The Defendant did not file an opposition, and the Court granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses. The Defendant is ordered to serve further, complete, Code-compliant, verified responses to the requests for production within 20 days of the date of the order.
