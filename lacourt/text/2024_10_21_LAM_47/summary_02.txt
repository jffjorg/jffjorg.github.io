Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's Motion to Disqualify Richard Sherman and John Begakis as counsel for Defendants. The Judge found that while Attorney Sherman's preliminary consultation with Plaintiff's CEO, Lida Ghaderi, pertains to a matter substantially related to this action, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Attorney Sherman had access to material confidential information that would warrant his disqualification. The Judge also found that even if disqualification were warranted as to Sherman Law Group, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Attorney Begakis should be disqualified, as there is no authority that establishes that attorneys working for separate firms should be vicariously disqualified in the event that one attorney has access to material confidential information.
