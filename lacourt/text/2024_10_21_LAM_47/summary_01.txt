Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, finding that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the most basic procedural requirements for a motion to compel further responses and failed to demonstrate that the motion was timely brought such that the court has jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. The court has also awarded the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $2,000, finding that the request reflects the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing a motion of this nature.
