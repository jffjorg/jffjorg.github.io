And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to be relieved as counsel. The moving party, Dev Das, counsel for the defendants Arcturian Light, LLC and Memory Buss, has requested to withdraw from representation. The Court has considered the moving papers and has granted the motions. Counsel is required to file proofs of service of the order on the defendants within 5 days of the ruling. Once this is done, counsel will be relieved from representation. The Court has determined that there is good cause for counsel's withdrawal, as the attorney-client relationship has broken down and no prejudice will result from the withdrawal.
