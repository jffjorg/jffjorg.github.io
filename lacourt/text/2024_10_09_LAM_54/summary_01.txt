Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication regarding the defendant's statute of limitations affirmative defenses. The plaintiffs had argued that the statute of limitations did not accrue until the insurer denied coverage, but the defendant presented evidence showing that the plaintiffs had already tendered claims and settled the claims related to the subject insurance policies in 2008-2014, creating a triable issue of fact. The judge found that the plaintiffs had not shown as a matter of law that they may revive an expired claim under the "unconditional denial" standard.
