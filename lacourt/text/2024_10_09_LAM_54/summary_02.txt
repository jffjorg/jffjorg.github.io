And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to enforce a subpoena for business records served on Adult Protective Services. The defendants are seeking to discover a report made to Adult Protective Services in 2021 alleging possible abuse by plaintiff Darnley Scantlebury against his mother, decedent Carolyn Parker. The report is relevant to the wrongful death damages relating to the closeness of the family unit. No opposition was filed to show otherwise. The judge orders Adult Protective Services to comply with the subpoena within 15 days of notice of the ruling and notifies the defendants to take note of the ruling.
