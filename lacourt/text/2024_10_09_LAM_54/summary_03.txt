And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, WFG National Title Company of California, granting their motion for an order directing service of summons on Freedom Financial Group, Inc. dba Freedom Financial Group. The plaintiff has requested that the service be made by delivering the process to the Secretary of State, as the agent for service listed for Freedom Financial has passed away and the addresses listed by the Secretary of State no longer exist or are no longer associated with Freedom Financial. The judge has determined that this is sufficient to establish reasonable diligence for service. The plaintiff's motion is granted, and the service will be made on the Secretary of State.
