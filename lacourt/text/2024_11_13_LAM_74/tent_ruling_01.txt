  Case Number:  21STCV01740    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  74 Defendant EMCO Chemical
Distributors, Inc.’s Demurrer with Motion to Strike
 
BACKGROUND 
             This case arises out of a products liability
claim.  Plaintiffs allege that
defendants, fourteen chemical companies, manufactured products that exposed
Mamdouh Habib (Habib) to toxic chemicals that led to fatal kidney cancer. On
December 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint. On February
20, 2024, defendant EMCO Chemical (EMCO) filed a demurrer and motion to strike.
Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition in response.
The
court will sign defendant EMCO’s unopposed proposed orders sustaining the
demurrer without leave to amend and granting the motion to strike, except the
court modifies the order to strike to correct the second request to strike,
which the proposed order misidentifies as page 46 lines 7 through 11 when it is
correctly page 38 lines 7 through 11 (i.e. ¶ 159).
EMCO
shall give notice.
