And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"The court has reviewed the case arising from a products liability claim, where plaintiffs allege that 14 chemical companies, including defendant EMCO Chemical Distributors, Inc., manufactured products that exposed Mamdouh Habib to toxic chemicals, leading to fatal kidney cancer. Despite plaintiffs' failure to file an opposition, the court will sustain defendant EMCO's demurrer without leave to amend and grant the motion to strike. However, the court will modify the order to strike to correct the incorrect page and line numbers. Defendant EMCO shall provide notice of the court's ruling."
