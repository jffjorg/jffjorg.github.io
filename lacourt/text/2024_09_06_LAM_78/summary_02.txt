And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of General Motors LLC's person most knowledgeable (PMK) about the subject vehicle and the cooling system defect. The plaintiff, Edder Rodriguez, filed a lawsuit against General Motors LLC under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and is seeking to compel the deposition of the PMK to gather information about the subject vehicle and the cooling system defect.

The judge granted the motion in part, ordering General Motors LLC to produce its PMK for deposition on certain categories of discovery related to the subject vehicle and the cooling system defect. The judge found that General Motors LLC's objections to the motion, citing lack of meet and confer effort and concerns about trade secrets, were without merit.

The judge denied the motion as to certain categories of discovery, finding that they were overbroad and unduly burdensome. The judge also noted that General Motors LLC had already agreed to produce a PMK for certain categories of discovery and that the plaintiff's arguments regarding the need for the PMK were already covered by other categories of discovery.

The judge ordered General Motors LLC to produce its PMK for deposition within 20 days and scheduled a hearing on the matter for September 6, 2024.
