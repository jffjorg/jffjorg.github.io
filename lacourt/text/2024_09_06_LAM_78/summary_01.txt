And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion to compel discovery to December 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The motion was filed by the Encino Newcastle Homeowner's Association (Plaintiff) on June 24, 2024, seeking to compel Sinitsin's deposition due to allegations that she evaded questions at her previous deposition. The defendants, Del Sol Property Management, Inc. and Sinitsin, filed a related motion to quash the deposition notice and for a protective order regarding Sinitsin's deposition on August 19, 2024. The judge has decided to consolidate the two motions and hear them together on December 13, 2024, in the interests of judicial economy.
