[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO COMPEL SUBSEQUENT
  DEPOSITION



 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff Encino Newcastle Homeowner’s
Association (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant motion to compel
defendant/cross-defendant Sinitsin’s deposition on the grounds that Sinitsin
evaded questions at her deposition, setting the hearing for September 6, 2024.
On August 19, 2024, defendants Del Sol and Sinitsin
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed a related motion to quash the deposition
notice served on Sinitsin, and for a protective order regarding Sinitsin’s
deposition. Defendants’ motion is set to be heard on December 13, 2024.
The Court has briefly reviewed the briefs. Because the
motions brought by both parties are related to the same issue, and the outcome
of one would have an effect on the other, the Court finds it in the interests
of judicial economy to continue Plaintiff’s motion to compel to be heard on the
same day as Defendants’ motion to quash and for a protective order.
The Hearing on Motion to Compel Discovery (not "Further
Discovery") filed by Plaintiff is CONTINUED to December 13, 2024 at
8:30 a.m. in Dept. 78 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
