 Case Number:  23STCV27315    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Defendants Dignity Health
and CommonSpirit Health’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint
Defendants
Dignity Health and CommonSpirit Health move for leave to file a cross-complaint
against non-party Total Professional Network, Inc. dba Core MedStaff.  A
cross-complaint that does not bring compulsory cross-claims “may be filed at any time before the court
has set a date for trial.”  (CCP §
428.50(b).)  Courts may grant leave to
file an untimely cross-complaint “in the interest of justice at any time during
the course of the action.”  (Id., subd. (c).)  The court finds
that granting this motion serves the interests of justice by avoiding “a
multiplicity of actions.”  (Heshejin
v. Rostami (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 984, 993.)  
Disposition
Defendants
Dignity Health and CommonSpirit Health’s motion for leave to file a
cross-complaint is granted. 
Defendants shall file their cross-complaint (attached as exhibit A to
the amended declaration of Zachary Schwake) forthwith.
