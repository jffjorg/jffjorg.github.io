And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Tyrod Taylor and 22594 Zaltana Street, LLC. The court has sustained the demurrer to plaintiff Andraya Howard's first, second, third, fourth, and seventh causes of action, but has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend. The court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action. The court has granted the motion to strike three portions of the complaint, including allegations of emotional distress and a prayer for attorney fees.

The court has ruled that plaintiff does not have sufficient facts to establish an enforceable contract, and therefore cannot recover emotional distress damages or attorney fees under the contract. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's reliance on the alleged promise of defendant Tyrod Taylor was reasonable and foreseeable, and that the plaintiff was deceived into making improvements and paying the mortgage on a property that defendants knew she was neither going to own nor benefit from any appreciation.

The court has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address the defects identified in the tentative ruling.
