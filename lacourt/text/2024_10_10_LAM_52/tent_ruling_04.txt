 Case Number:  24STCV05798    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling
            Defendant Michael Niro’s Motion for Attorney Fees
            Defendant
Michael Niro moves for an award of $16,669 in attorney fees.  In his reply brief, Niro seeks an additional
$2,000 in fees.  Niro prevailed in this
action.  A prevailing party can only
recover attorney fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)  Plaintiff WF Chateau Partners, LLC’s verified
complaint alleges, “A written agreement between the parties provides for
attorney fees.”  (Comp., ¶ 15.)  Pursuant to Civil Code section 1717, any such
provision permits fees to whichever party prevails.  Defendant is entitled to recover attorney
fees.
            Niro
represented himself in this action.  He
may still recover attorney fees incurred for the services of a lawyer who was
not counsel of record.  (Mix v.
Tumanjan Development Corp. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1325.)  Niro did not, however, reasonably incur all
$18,669 in attorney fees he claims.  
            In
determining what constitutes a reasonable fee, the court ordinarily begins with
the lodestar, that is, “the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by
the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
In calculating the lodestar, the court must determine whether the
tasks performed by an attorney were necessary and whether the amount of time
billed for each task was reasonable.  (Baxter v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th
775, 793.)  Niro has the burden of proof
regarding whether the fees he seeks are reasonable and necessary.  (Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of
Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162, 169.)
Niro did not reasonably incur attorney fees for his first motion to
quash service of summons.  He filed that
motion before any proof of service of summons was filed.  It was not necessary to seek to quash service
that had not happened.  The court will
reduce Niro’s lodestar by $676.50 to account for those entries.  (Carlson Decl., ledger.)  
Niro also did not reasonably incur attorney fees related to the two petitions
for writ of mandate he filed.  Both petitions
were unnecessary and unsuccessful.  The
court will reduce Niro’s lodestar by $3,550 to account for those entries.  (Carlson Decl., ledger.)  
Niro’s attorney fee ledger includes 59 entries for “Consultation
[hotline]” for $3,791.  (Carlson Decl.,
ledger.)  While the court can infer that
some consultation is reasonable, Niro did not meet his burden of showing that
he reasonably and necessary incurred all of the fees charged for “consultation”
regarding unspecified matters.  The court
will reduce Niro’s loadstar by $2,000 for consultations regarding unspecified
matters.
 
Niro also requests reimbursement of attorney fees for four administrative
tasks: $125 to email his first motion to quash; $50 to obtain a reservation for
a demurrer; $175 to reserve and file his third motion to quash; and $125 to
e-file the opposition to an ex parte application.  (Carlson Decl., ledger.)  A party cannot recover attorney fees for
secretarial tasks.  The court will reduce
Niro’s loadstar by $475.
Finally, the court will not award the $2,000 Niro claims for reviewing
the opposition and drafting the reply brief. 
(Reply, p. 5.)  He did not give
plaintiff notice that he would seek additional fees.  He also does not present evidence he incurred
those fees.  
The court finds Niro reasonably incurred all other fees he
claims.  The court therefore reduces the
lodestar of $16,669 by $6,701.50.  Niro
shall recover $9,967.50 in attorney fees from plaintiff.
            Defendant
Michael Niro’s motion for attorney fees is granted in part.  Defendant Michael Niro shall recover $9,967.50
in attorney fees from plaintiff WF Chateau Partners, LLC.
