And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit brought by Key Star Capital Fund III, L.P. against Light Days Hospice, Inc. and Avedis Avedissian. The court has entered a default against Light Days Hospice, Inc., but has vacated the default against Avedis Avedissian. The court has not yet received a request for default judgment from the plaintiff.

The court has ruled that it cannot enter default judgment against only one defendant when the other defendant may have a defense that applies to both parties. The court has also ruled that liability is generally presumed to be joint, not several.

The plaintiff has failed to serve Avedis Avedissian with summons within 60 days, as required by California law. The court has ordered the plaintiff to show cause why it should not pay monetary sanctions to the court for this failure.

The court has also continued the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to February 11, 2025. The court has ordered the plaintiff not to file a request for entry of default against Light Days Hospice, Inc. unless Avedis Avedissian has been dismissed or a default has been entered against Avedis Avedissian.

The plaintiff must file a written response to this order to show cause by December 27, 2024. The court will hear arguments on January 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
