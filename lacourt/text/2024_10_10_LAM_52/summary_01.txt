Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, Tammy Woloski, in her motion to set aside the default judgment and quash the service of summons. The judge finds that the service of summons was invalid because it did not include the Doe amendment substituting Woloski for Doe 12, and because it was not served at her usual place of abode or business. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Woloski was served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute, and that she was not notified of her duty to defend. As a result, the judge grants Woloski's motion and sets aside the default judgment and quashes the service of summons.
