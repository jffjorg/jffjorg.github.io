And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge on the motion for attorney fees filed by Defendant Michael Niro. Niro is seeking an award of $16,669 in attorney fees, plus an additional $2,000 in fees. The judge notes that a prevailing party can only recover attorney fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law, and that Niro prevailed in the action. The judge finds that the written agreement between the parties provides for attorney fees, and that Niro is entitled to recover attorney fees.

However, the judge reduces the lodestar amount by $6,701.50 due to unreasonable or unnecessary fees incurred by Niro. Specifically, the judge reduces the lodestar by $676.50 for Niro's first motion to quash service of summons, which was not necessary since no proof of service had been filed. The judge also reduces the lodestar by $3,550 for Niro's two unsuccessful petitions for writ of mandate, and by $2,000 for consultations regarding unspecified matters. Additionally, the judge reduces the lodestar by $475 for administrative tasks, such as emailing and e-filing, which are not recoverable as attorney fees.

The judge ultimately awards Niro $9,967.50 in attorney fees from the plaintiff, WF Chateau Partners, LLC. The motion for attorney fees is granted in part.
