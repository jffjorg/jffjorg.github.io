 Case Number:  23STCV25548    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling
Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Key Star Capital Fund III, L.P. brings
this action against two defendants: Light Days Hospice, Inc. and Avedis
Avedissian.  The clerk entered the
default of defendant Light Days Hospice, Inc. on June 5, 2024.  On August 5, 2024, the court vacated the
default of defendant Avedis Avedissian.  
Plaintiff has not yet requested default judgment
against defendant Light Days Hospice, Inc. 
A court cannot enter default judgment against only one defendant when it
is allegedly jointly liable with a co-defendant who may later prevail under a
defense applicable to all defendants.  (Adams
Mfg. & Engineering Co. v. Coast Centerless Grinding Co. (1960) 184
Cal.App.2d 649, 655; Mirabile v. Smith
(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 685, 689.) 
Liability is generally presumed to be joint, not several.  (Civ. Code, § 1431.)
Since the court vacated Avedissian’s default,
plaintiff has not filed proof of service of summons on him (or any other
papers).  Plaintiff was obligated to serve
Avedis Avedissian within 60 days after filing its complaint.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b).)
Plaintiff Key Star Capital Fund III, L.P. is hereby
ordered to show cause, on January 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., why it should not pay
monetary sanctions to the court pursuant California Rule of Court, rule
3.110(f) for failure to timely serve defendant Avedis Avedissian, or
alternatively, why defendant Avedis Avedissian should not be dismissed from
this action.  Plaintiff may file a
written response to this order to show cause no later than December 27, 2024.
The court also hereby continues the order to show cause re: entry of default
judgment to February 11, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. 
Plaintiff shall not file a request for entry of default against
defendant Light Days Hospice, Inc. unless (1) defendant Avedissian has been
dismissed or (2) a default has been entered against Avedissian.
