And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the Defendants/Cross-Complainants Ta-Chung Han and Linlin Zhang's Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer. The court is inclined to continue the hearing to December 8, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. due to the omission of the proposed amended answer in the proof of service. Counsel for Defendants is instructed to lodge a copy of the proposed amended answer with the court and serve a copy upon Plaintiff within five calendar days from the date of the instant hearing. The court's decision is based on its application of the legal standard, which allows a party to amend a pleading in furtherance of justice, and the need to ensure compliance with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a)(1).
