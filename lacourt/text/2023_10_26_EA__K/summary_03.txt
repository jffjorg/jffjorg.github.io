And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Allstate Insurance Company's application for default judgment without prejudice. The application is denied due to two defects: the plaintiff failed to provide a brief summary of the case, as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1800, and the plaintiff's representative, Jane Snyder, failed to attach a copy of the policy between the plaintiff and its insured, and did not provide information regarding the damages allegedly incurred to the insured premises. The judge notes that it appears the plaintiff is seeking subrogation, but Snyder failed to provide the necessary information. The case management conference is set for October 26, 2023.
