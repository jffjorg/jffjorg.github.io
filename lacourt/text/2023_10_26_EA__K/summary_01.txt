And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and proposed cross-defendants, Chung Chin Tsai and Kenny Tsai. The defendants' proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claims. The court finds that the defendants have acted in good faith and that there is no evidence of bad faith. The motion is granted, allowing the defendants to file their cross-complaint.
