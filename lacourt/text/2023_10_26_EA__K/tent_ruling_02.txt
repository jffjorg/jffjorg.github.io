 Case Number:  22PSCV00595    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  K The hearing on Defendants/Cross-Complainants
Ta-Chung Han’s and Linlin Zhang’s 
Motion for Leave to
File Amended Answer is CONTINUED to December 8, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. [see below].
Background   
Plaintiff Shuai Wang (“Wang”) alleges
as follows:
In October 2018, Wang entered
into a verbal contract with Linlin Zhang (“Zhang”) and Ta-Chung Han (“Han”) to
lease Zhang/Han’s backyard addition located at 3701 S. Ferntower Ave., West
Covina, CA 91792-3214 (“subject property”). The parties agreed rent would be
$1,500.00 a month, paid in cash. Wang advised Zhang/Han of certain habitability
issues, which Zhang/Han failed to remedy. Zhang told Wang’s wife in
mid-December 2021 that rent would be increased to $2,000.00/month beginning
January 2022. Zhang got into an argument with Wang on Christmas Eve 2021
regarding the rent increase, which resulted in the police being called. Wang vacated
the subject premises in January 2022. 
On June 17, 2022, Wang filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Han, Zhang and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Negligent Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability
2.                 
Intentional Breach of Implied Warranty
3.                 
Nuisance
4.                 
Negligence
5.                 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
6.                 
Negligent Violation of Statutory Duty
7.                 
Intentional Violation of Statutory Duty
On December 6, 2022, Han and Zhang
filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint, asserting causes of action against Wang
and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
3.                 
Negligence
4.                 
Civil Assault
5.

6.

The Final Status Conference is set
for July 30, 2024. Trial is set for August 13, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting
amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including
trial, when no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However,
“even if a good amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in
presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest
upon the element of lack of diligence in offering the amendment after knowledge
of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44
Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324,
subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Han and Zhang
(collectively, “Defendants”) move the court for leave to amend their respective
answers to include one additional affirmative defense of Statute of
Limitations.
The “Notice of Motion
and Motion for Leave to File Defendants’ Amended Answer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint” indicates that it was “Filed Concurrently with Memorandum of Points
and Authorities; Declaration of Long Z. Liu Esq. in Support Thereof; [Proposed]
Amended Answer.” (Emphasis added). The court, however, does not appear to
be in receipt of the proposed amended answer. The proof of service accompanying
the motion reflects service of the following:
“1. NOTICE OF MOTION AND
MOTINO [sic] FOR LEAVE TO FILE DEFENDANTS' AMENDED ANSWER TO PLAINTIFF'S
COMPLAINT 2. DECLARATION OF LONG Z. LIU, ESQ.” The proof of service makes no
reference to service of any proposed amended answer. The foregoing omission
renders the instant motion non-compliant with California Rules of Court Rule
3.1342, subdivision (a)(1).
The court is inclined to
continue the hearing to December 8, 2023 at 9:00 a.m., based on the above
omission. Counsel for Defendants is instructed to lodge a copy of the proposed
amended answer with the court and to serve a copy of same upon Plaintiff within
five calendar days from the date of the instant hearing.
