Proc., § 416.10.)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 418.10 provides in part:  “A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her  time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause  allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following  purposes:  “(1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack  of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10.  subd. (a)(1).)  A  motion made under Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 does not constitute an  appearance unless a court denies the motion.   (See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure  Before Trial (Rutter 2023) (Cal. Practice Guide) ¶ 3:376, p. 3-116 [“If the  motion is denied, defendant is deemed to have made a general appearance –  waiving any jurisdictional objection – upon entry of the order denying the  motion” (emphasis omitted)].)  “  ‘Although a proper basis for personal jurisdiction exists and notice is given  in a manner which satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process,  service of summons is not effective and the court does not acquire jurisdiction  of the party unless the statutory requirements for service of summons are met.’  ” (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 443 (Engebretson),  quoting Schering Corp. v. Superior Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 741.)  “  ‘When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of  improper service of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove … the facts  requisite to an effective service.’ “   (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:421.5, p. 4-72, quoting Summers  v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)  DISCUSSION  A.   Motion to quash Plaintiff's service of summons and  complaint  On  February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service asserting that Plaintiff  personally served the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other  documents on Devonshire by serving “Evelyn, Supervisor” at 17925 Devonshire  St., Los Angeles, CA 91325 on February 1, 2024.  Devonshire  argues that Plaintiff failed to serve the summons and complaint on its agent  for service of process, Ritesh Desai.  In  addition, Devonshire asserts that it has not received copies of the summons and  complaint.  Devonshire has submitted  declarations supporting these contentions.  Plaintiff  has filed a statement of non-opposition to Devonshire’s motion.   The  Court grants the motion and quashes Plaintiff’s February 1, 2024 attempted service  of Plaintiff’s summons and complaint on Devonshire.  B.   Motion to quash City’s service of summons and cross-complaint  On  February 28, 2024, the City filed a proof of service asserting that the City  personally served the summons, cross-complaint, and other documents on  Devonshire by serving “Evelyn Guliyan (Supervisor)” at 17925 Devonshire Street,  Northridge, CA 91325 on February 21, 2024.  Devonshire  argues that Evelyn Guliyan is not authorized to receive service of process on  its behalf for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10.  Devonshire has submitted declarations  supporting this contention.  The City has  not submitted any response or responsive evidence.  Therefore, the City has not carried its  burden of proving the facts requisite to an effective service.  The  Court grants Devonshire’s motion and quashes the City’s service of the City’s summons  and cross-complaint on Devonshire.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant 17925 Devonshire Street,  Inc.’s motion to quash service of Plaintiff Nouritza Geukgeuzian’s summons and complaint on Defendant 17925 Devonshire  Street, Inc.  The Court quashes service  of the summons and complaint.  The  Court GRANTS Defendant 17925 Devonshire Street, Inc.’s motion to quash service  of Defendant and Cross-Complainant City of Los Angeles’s summons and cross-complaint  on Defendant 17925 Devonshire Street, Inc.   The Court quashes service of the summons and cross-complaint.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
