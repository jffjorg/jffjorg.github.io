And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente's claims without prejudice. The court's denial is based on the lack of evidence to support the reimbursement of medical expenses for treatment at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as well as the absence of proof that the non-medical expenses (Administrative/Misc. fee) qualify as an allowable cost under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The court has ordered the petitioner to provide additional information and evidence to support the petition and has given notice of the ruling.
