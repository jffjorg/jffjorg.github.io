 Case Number:  22STCV26120    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On August 12, 2022, Plaintiffs Jonathan Vargas and Ivan Vargas filed this
action against Defendants Lena Meyer, Mimi Meyer, and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort. 
On December 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel. 
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiffs substituted new
counsel to represent them. 
On January 26, 2024, no parties or counsel appeared at the
scheduled final status conference or contacted the Court. 
On February 9, 2024, no parties or counsel appeared for the
scheduled trial or contacted the Court. 
The Court dismissed the case without prejudice. 
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for relief
from dismissal.  The motion was set to be
heard on July 17, 2024. 
No trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTIES’ REQUEST 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to vacate the dismissal. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides in part: 
“Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or
her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The
court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of
fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs
to opposing counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the
time within which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section
583.310.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiffs argue the dismissal resulted from their counsel’s
inadvertent failure to calendar the January 26, 2024 final status conference
and the February 9, 2024 trial.  Plaintiffs’
counsel has submitted an attorney affidavit of fault. 
          The Court grants the motion and vacates the default. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion for relief from dismissal filed by Plaintiffs Jonathan Vargas and Ivan Vargas.  The Court vacates the dismissal entered on February
9, 2024. 
The
Court sets an OSC re: dismissal for failure to file proof of service of the summons
and complaint on August 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
