And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving and non-opposition papers and rules as follows. The motion to quash service of Plaintiff's summons and complaint on Devonshire is granted. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to serve the summons and complaint on Devonshire's agent for service of process, Ritesh Desai, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10. The Court also finds that Plaintiff did not provide Devonshire with copies of the summons and complaint. Therefore, the Court quashes service of Plaintiff's summons and complaint on Devonshire.

The motion to quash service of the City's summons and cross-complaint on Devonshire is also granted. The Court finds that the City failed to prove that it served the summons and cross-complaint on Devonshire in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10. The City did not provide any evidence or response to support its claim of service, and therefore the Court finds that the City has not carried its burden of proving the facts requisite to an effective service. Therefore, the Court quashes service of the City's summons and cross-complaint on Devonshire.

The Court orders moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
