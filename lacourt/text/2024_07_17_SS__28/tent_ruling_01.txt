  Case Number:  21STCV04307    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
February 3, 2021, July 29, 2022, Plaintiffs Hernan Vicente, Ani Piliposian, and
Nicholas Vicente filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort. 
Also
on February 3, 2021, the Court appointed Ani Piliposian to serve as Plaintiff
Nicolas Vicente’s guardian ad litem. 
On
May 3, 2021, Plaintiffs Hernan Vicente, Ani Piliposian, and Nicholas Vicente, a
minor by and through his guardian ad litem, filed a first amended complaint
against Defendant and Does 1-50 for negligence—motor vehicle (Government Code
section 815.2, subdivision (a)). 
On
May 24, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On June
20, 2024, Petitioner Ani Piliposian (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas
Vicente’s claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the action of minor
Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente ("Plaintiff"). 
DISCUSSION 
          In Section 8 of the petition, Petitioner states that Plaintiff received treatment at Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles.  However, the petition does not
include medical expenses for this treatment (see Section 13a) or provide
medical or billing records from Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.  The Department of Health Care Services’ February
5, 2024 letter does not state that Medi-Cal paid for Children’s Hospital
Los Angeles’ treatment.  Petitioner
should explain whether Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for treatment at Children’s
Hospital Los Angeles, the amount of those expenses, and whether those expenses
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  The Court cannot approve the petition unless
it shows that the minor’s compromise will reimburse all of Plaintiff’s medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
          The non-medical expenses include $100.02 for “Administrative/Misc.
fee.”  (Section 14b.)  The Court will not award this amount without evidence that it qualifies as an allowable cost under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5., subdivision (a), or is allowable as a cost expressly
authorized by law (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)). 
          Section 19b(2) of the petition states that Petitioner will
provide the name, address, and branch of the depository in Attachment
19b(2).  The petition does not include an
Attachment 19b(2). 
          The Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Nicolas Vicente’s action filed by Petitioner Ani Piliposian on June 20,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
