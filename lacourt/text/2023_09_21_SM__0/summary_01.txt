**English Summary:**

The judge has ruled that New Holland LLC's Demurrer (a request to dismiss the case) is successful based on the current state of the Plaintiff's complaint.

The Plaintiff has 20 days to fix these issues by amending the complaint and re-submitting it to the court. If the Plaintiff fails to amend the complaint within the allotted time, the case could be dismissed.
