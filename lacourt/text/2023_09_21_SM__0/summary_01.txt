And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant New Holland LLC with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint fails to plead sufficient facts of the existence of a contract for the 1st cause of action, and the pleadings are uncertain or ambiguous as to the 2nd and 3rd cause of action. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to:

* Plead whether the alleged land sale contract was written, oral, or implied
* Specify the material terms of the specific agreement breached by the defendant
* Attach a copy of the written instrument to the complaint
* Alleg facts that state the defendant committed intentionally wrongful acts designed to disrupt the relationship
* Specify which defendant is the third party and which is the party that intentionally interfered with the plaintiff and the third party
* Plead facts of the defendant's knowledge that the relationship would be disrupted if the defendant failed to act with reasonable care
* Plead the defendant's failure to act with reasonable care

The plaintiff is given 20 days leave to amend the complaint to cure these deficiencies.
