And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The dismissal was entered on May 19, 2023, after the Plaintiff failed to appear at the jury trial. The Plaintiff argues that the dismissal was due to a clerical error by counsel, who accidentally removed the trial dates from their calendar. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has established good cause to set aside the dismissal, citing the mandatory relief provision of CCP § 473(b) and the purpose of promoting the determination of actions on their merits. The Judge orders that the trial be reconvened in 60 days, with an OSC re sanctions in the amount of $60 for failure to file Proof of Service, and that the moving party give notice of this order.
