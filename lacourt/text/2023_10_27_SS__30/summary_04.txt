And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Allison Wu, alleges that the defendants, Payman Joseph, MD, and Payman Joesph, MD (d/b/a Van Nuys Women’s Care Medical Center), negligently failed to diagnose her with an ectopic pregnancy and discharged her without providing proper treatment. The defendants argue that they acted within the standard of care and that the condition suffered by the plaintiff was a heterotopic pregnancy, an extremely rare condition. The defendants also argue that even if they had met their burden, the plaintiff's expert's opinions regarding breach and causation lack foundation.

The Judge finds that the defendants have met their burden of production as moving parties, but the plaintiff's expert, James Wheeler, raises a triable issue of fact regarding breach and causation. The Judge also finds that Wheeler is qualified to attest to the applicable standard of care, despite being a physician who practices in Texas, not California. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff's expert opinion that Payman's treatment of the plaintiff fell below the standard of care, because he failed to properly take her medical history, failed to perform a proper physical exam, failed to perform a proper sonogram, and failed to make a reasonable medical record, is enough to raise triable issues of fact regarding breach and causation.
