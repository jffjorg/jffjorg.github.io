Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Jonathan Shifren, M.D., and Wave Plastic Surgery Center, Inc. The plaintiffs, Lidia West and Brian Jeff West, had alleged causes of action for medical negligence, negligence, and loss of consortium against the defendants. The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that there were no triable issues of material fact and that the plaintiffs failed to establish the elements necessary for their causes of action.

The judge finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that the cause of action for medical negligence has no merit, as the plaintiffs failed to present expert testimony to refute the defendants' expert declarations. The judge also finds that the defendants are entitled to judgment on the cause of action for negligent hiring and supervision, as the plaintiffs failed to dispute the defendants' arguments.

The judge grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all three causes of action, finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish the elements necessary for their claims.
