MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Florian Schmitz (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Jason
Muller (“Defendant”) to Plaintiff’s Post-Judgment Request for Production of
Documents (“RPD”).  In its order of
September 23, 2024, the Court continued the matter to this date for Plaintiff
to serve notice of the hearing on Defendant. 
Plaintiff did so.  As such, the
Court now rules on the matter.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff, by mail
and electronically, served the RPD on Defendant on October 23, 2023.  Defendant’s responses were thus due by November
27, 2023.  To date, Defendant has not
responded to the discovery.  Accordingly,
the motion to compel responses to the RPD is granted pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300.  Defendant is
ordered to serve responses to Plaintiff’s RPD, without objections, within 30
days of service of this order.
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in connection with the motions. The Court finds Defendant’s failure
to respond to the discovery is an abuse of the discovery process and imposes
sanctions on Defendant in the amount of $2,145, which represents three hours of
attorney time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing at $695 per hour,
plus the motion’s filing fee.  Defendant
is to pay $2,145 in sanctions to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Plaintiff is to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
