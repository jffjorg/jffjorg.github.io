Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion by the plaintiffs, Chase Love and Steve Love, to compel General Motors LLC (GM) to produce further discovery responses. The plaintiffs are seeking discovery related to a 2021 Chevrolet Bolt vehicle that GM allegedly failed to repair after a reasonable number of attempts. GM is opposing the motion, arguing that certain information is a trade secret and that the plaintiffs are seeking irrelevant information.

The judge has granted the motion and ordered GM to produce responsive documents regarding other vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the plaintiffs' vehicle. The judge has also ordered GM to respond to special interrogatories that were previously opposed by GM.

The judge has declined to impose sanctions on GM, despite GM's failure to produce complete responses to the interrogatories. The judge has found that GM's agreement to produce some documents mitigates the need for sanctions.
