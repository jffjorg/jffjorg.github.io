Motion to Compel Discovery Responses

OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
594 Mapleton LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Mirga
Phipps White (“Defendant”) to (1) Request for Production of Documents, set one
(“RPD”), (2) Form Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”), and (3) Special Interrogatories,
set one (“SROG”).  Plaintiff also moves
to deem admitted matters specified in Requests for Admissions, set one (“RFA”) and
to compel Defendant and Defendant Nicholas Pipps White (“Nicholas”) to appear
for deposition.  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff served
the written discovery on Defendant on August 24, 2024.  Plaintiff agreed Defendant had until October
2, 2024 to respond.  As of the filing
date of this motion, nor since, Plaintiff had not received responses from Defendant.  Accordingly, the motion to compel responses
to the RPD, FROG, and SROG is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Defendant
is ordered to serve responses to such discovery without objections within 30
days of service of this order.
Plaintiff also
moves to deem admitted the matters specified in the RFA.  When a party fails to respond to requests for
admissions, the propounding party may
move for an order the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).)  The Court
“shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests
for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
As Defendant has not responded to the RFA, the Court grants the motion
to deem admitted matters specified in the RFA.
 
Plaintiff also
moves to compel Defendant and Nicholas to appear for their depositions.  Plaintiff has the right to depose Defendant
and Nicholas and to take such depositions without leave of court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.210, subd.
(a).)  Plaintiff noticed the subject depositions
to take place on September 11, 2024.  Defendant
and Nicholas did not appear. 
Accordingly, the motion to compel their depositions is granted.  
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in connection with the motion. 
The Court finds that Defendant’s failure to submit to discovery
procedures is an abuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions.  Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions
against Defendant in the amount of $2,000, which represents four hours of
attorney time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing at $500 per hour.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the
RPD, FROG, and SROG is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300.  Defendant is
ordered to serve responses to Plaintiff’s RPD, FROG, and SROG, without
objections, within 30 days of service of this order.
Defendant is
deemed to have admitted matters specified in the RFA.
Defendant and Nicholas are to appear for their
depositions within 30 days of notice of this order, unless Plaintiff stipulates
otherwise.  
Defendant is to
pay sanctions in the amount of $2,000 to Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
