If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
If a party fails to provide a timely
response to a request for admission, the party waives any objection to the
requests.  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).)  Moreover, “[t]he requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction….”  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).)  When timely
responses to interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
 
Plaintiff ODG moves compel responses to
FIs and to deem RFAs admitted against Defendant Courtney Mota. Plaintiff served
the subject discovery on February 23, 2024. Responses were due on March 26,
2024. As of the filing of these motions, Plaintiff has not received responses.
Defendant does not oppose these motions to show that responses have been
served.
 
Plaintiff’s motions are GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $2,535.00 total,
as the motions are largely duplicative.
