The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted and to compel responses to discovery. The court finds that the defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite having served the discovery on February 23, 2024, with responses due on March 26, 2024. As a result, the court orders the defendant to provide responses to form interrogatories within 15 days. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,535.00 total. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280 and 2030.290.
