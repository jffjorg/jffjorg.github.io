And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by the defendant, Travis Bayles, et al. The defendant argues that the court improperly determined that the action was not stayed, but the motion is DENIED. The Judge found that the motion was filed 169 days after the order granting summary judgment, which is grossly untimely and cannot be considered. The motion was filed outside of the 10-day time frame allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). The Judge will not reconsider the matter based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law.
