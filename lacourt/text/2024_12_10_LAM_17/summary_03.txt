And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to vacate the renewal of judgment. The defendant, Maria Torabzadeh, argues that the renewal of judgment must be set aside because she received a bankruptcy discharge on January 21, 2020, which discharged her debts. However, the judge finds that the defendant did not obtain a hardship discharge on the underlying student loan, which is not discharged by a standard bankruptcy discharge. Therefore, the judge denies the defendant's motion to vacate the renewal of judgment.
