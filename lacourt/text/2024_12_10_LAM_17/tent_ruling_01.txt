  vs.
 
TRAVIS BAYLES et al.   
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV39704
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 10, 2024



 
 
Defendant’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
On
12/21/2022, Plaintiffs You Li and Jane Wenjun Sha (collectively, Defendants)
filed suit against Travis Bayles, Alan Quach, Sanborn Collective, LLC, and
Urban Asset Group, LLC, alleging: (1) promissory fraud; (2) fraudulent
concealment; (3) violation of Penal Code section 496; (4) breach of promissory
note; (5) intentional interference with contract; (6) breach of guaranty; and
(7) breach of guaranty. 
 
            On
5/29/2024, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment was granted.
 
            On
11/14/2024, Defendant moved for reconsideration of the Court’s 5/29/2024 Order
granting summary judgment. 
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant
argues that Court improperly determined this action was not stayed. 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), a motion for
reconsideration must be brought “within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.”  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
 
Here,
Defendant’s motion for reconsideration was filed 169 days after the order
granting summary judgment. As such, it is grossly untimely, and cannot be
considered.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
