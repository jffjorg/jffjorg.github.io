And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to complaint filed by Defendant Angelita Carag, which was filed on December 15, 2023. Rather than responding to the demurrer, Plaintiff Real Food Daily, LLC filed a First Amended Complaint on January 2, 2024, six court days before the hearing. Although this filing was late, the Court is willing to accept it since it likely would have granted leave to amend had the demurrer been heard on its merits. As a result, the Defendant's demurrer is moot. However, the Court emphasizes that going forward, Plaintiff must file its opposition and other pleadings by the required deadline.
