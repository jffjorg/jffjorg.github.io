  Case Number:  23STCV23590    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  68 Real Food Daily, LLC vs. Adaline Bettcher, et al., 23STCV23590
Demurrer to Complaint
Moving Party: Defendant Angelita Carag

Responding Party: Plaintiff Real
Food Daily, LLC

Demurrer
            Defendant
Angelita Carag (Defendant) filed a demurrer to Plaintiff Real Food Daily, LLC’s
(Plaintiff) complaint on December 15, 2023. Rather than file an opposition,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on January 2, 2024. This was only six
court days before the hearing, and therefore was filed late pursuant to CCP §
472(a). However, because the Court likely would have given Plaintiff leave to
amend had the Court heard the demurrer on its merits, the Court will accept the
late filing of the First Amended Complaint. Defendant’s demurrer to the
complaint is moot. 
            However,
from now on, Plaintiff must file its opposition and other pleadings by the filing
deadline.
