Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories 
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 11, 2022, plaintiffs Raul and Maria Angelica Gutierrez were involved
in an automobile accident with defendant Hector Vidal-Ramirez. On March 27, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint for Negligence. Defendant answered on June 1,
2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
Raul Gutierrez move to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) served
on Defedant Hector Vidal-Ramirez. Plaintiff represents service of Form
Interrogatories (set one) (set one) on May 31, 2023. [Declaration of Stephanie
Perez, ¶ 2, Ex. A.] According to Plaintiff, at the time of the filing of the
motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 8.] 
 
Defendant
in opposition “anticipates” providing responses to Form Interrogatories by
December 4, 2023. Responses are delayed due to internal issues with the law
firm.
 
The court electronic filing system shows no reply filed at
the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. 
 
The motion is granted. Defendant Hector Vidal-Gutierrez is
ordered to serve verified responses to form interrogatories (set one) without
objections within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a-b).) If
Defendant presents proof of service of responses prior to the hearing, the
court will deem the order compelling responses moot.
 
Because the motion was required to prompt a promise for
responses, the court as a matter of policy imposes sanctions in the amount of
$250 against defendant and counsel joint and several, and payable within 30
days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c),)
 
Case Management Conference set for September 12, 2023.
