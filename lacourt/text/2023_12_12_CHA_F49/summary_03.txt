Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the supplemental hearing on the bond for the vexatious litigant order. The order was issued on August 17, 2023, and designates Ashley Anderson a vexatious litigant. The court has requested supplemental briefing to determine the bond amount, which is set at $37,000. The moving defendants incurred $36,986 in attorney fees defending the action, and the court has accepted the unopposed declaration.

The court has denied the ex parte application to stay the pending unlawful detainer case and the ex parte order for a restraining order. The court has also granted the motion to dismiss Michel Perry from the lawsuit and sustained the demurrer of Nasch Properties, LLC with 30 days leave to amend.

The court has set a hearing date for December 12, 2023, to determine the bond amount and has instructed Ashley Anderson to update the court regarding her medical condition and ability to appear. The court has also set an OSC re: Status of the Appeal for 90 days from the date of this hearing.

The court has noted that the notice of appeal stays enforcement of the order pending appeal and has set a 10-day response window for the order designating Anderson a vexatious litigant. The court has also set a follow-up hearing regarding the posting of the bond and dismissal of the entire action for non-compliance.

Finally, the court has noted that the motion deeming Anderson a vexatious litigant remains in place pending the appeal, barring a reversal by the Appellate Division. Any new action filed by Anderson pending the appeal can and will be subject to dismissal and potential contempt sanctions.
