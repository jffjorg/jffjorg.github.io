Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel expert depositions filed by the plaintiff, Vanessa Silvas. The defendants, Prohealth Professional Services, et al., oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and that they have already produced all necessary documents. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is timely and that the parties have not yet agreed on deposition dates. As a result, the judge orders the parties to meet and confer regarding deposition dates and extends the discovery cutoff to allow for completion of the depositions. The judge also warns that if the parties fail to agree on deposition dates, the plaintiff may take a notice of non-appearance and file a renewed motion to compel.
