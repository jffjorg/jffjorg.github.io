```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the objections filed by Thomas D. Williamson to the audit report and has overruled each of them. The judge finds that the audit report was properly issued to facilitate the distribution of assets to beneficiaries and that the objections lack merit. The judge also finds that the receiver's report is not a substitute for litigation and that Thomas's claims of liability are beyond the scope of the audit. The judge concludes that the audit report is properly approved and that the receiver may proceed with making distributions to beneficiaries.
