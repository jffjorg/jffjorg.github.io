Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a case involving a receiver's distribution motion. The judge has taken judicial notice of several previous orders and has sustained an objection to the receiver's declaration. The judge notes that the "family looseness" rule, if it exists, is premature at this point and will need to be reviewed in conjunction with the receiver's final report. The judge also rejects an attempt to use the audit report to expedite the trial through an OSC filing and hearing. The judge notes that the receiver's distribution motion was granted, but that the scope of the report is still a dispute. The judge declines to reach the issue of whether the report exceeded the scope of what was authorized, instead leaving it for a later objection to the receiver's request for discharge and final approval of his services.
