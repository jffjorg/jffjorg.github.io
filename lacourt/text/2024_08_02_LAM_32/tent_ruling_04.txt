  Case No.:  23STCV03486
  Hearing Date:  August 2, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff
Haley Chapman, individually and as successor-in-interest to Noelle Glotfelty
(Decedent), filed this action against various Defendants for (1) wrongful
death, (2) survival cause of action, and (3) negligence. The complaint stems
from the death of Decedent, who committed suicide inside a Marriott hotel room.

            On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Marriot International,
Inc.’s person most knowledgeable (PMK). Defendant has not filed an opposition
but submitted the declaration of its counsel on July 24, 2024.    
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or
to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the deposition
notice on May 6, 2024, setting the deposition for May 22, 2024. (Maxwell Decl.
¶ 6, Ex. A.) Defendant served its response on May 17, 2024, objecting to each
request for production of documents (RFP). (Id., ¶ 7, Ex. B.) On May 23,
2024, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter regarding the deposition. (Id.,
¶ 8, Ex. C.) On May 24, 2024, Defendant replied to the letter and stated that
it would respond “shortly.” (Id., ¶ 9, Ex. D.) On June 3, 2024,
Plaintiff left a voicemail with defense counsel and also sent another email. (Id.,
¶ 10, Ex. E.) Defendant has not responded. (Id., ¶ 11.) 
            The record shows that Defendant was
properly served with a deposition notice but failed to designate or produce a
PMK by the scheduled date of May 22, 2024. Defense counsel avers that Defendant
“is in the process of identifying the person or persons most knowledgeable” and
“is not refusing to produce a witness.” (Heffernan Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) However, the
deposition notice was served back in May 2024, and Defendant ignored
Plaintiff’s follow-up communications. Plaintiff is not required to wait
indefinitely until Defendant is ready to produce a PMK. An order compelling the
deposition is warranted. 
The records requested by the RFPs shall
also be produced to the extent Defendant possesses them, as Defendant does not
attempt to justify any of its objections nor provide any other reason to
withhold the records. Plaintiff’s motion and separate statement sufficiently
set forth good cause for the requested documents. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Defendant Marriott International, Inc. shall produce its
Person(s) Most Knowledgeable for deposition and produce responsive documents
within 20 days of this order.
