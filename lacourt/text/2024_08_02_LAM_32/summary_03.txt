And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical negligence case. The plaintiff, Mario Rosales, alleges that Dr. Richard Roe, who works at Retina-Vitreous Associates Medical Group (RVAMG), negligently diagnosed him and failed to render proper treatment. The defendants have presented uncontested expert testimony that Dr. Roe's actions complied with the applicable standard of care. Since the plaintiff has not presented any contrary evidence, the judge has determined that there is no triable issue of fact and that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge has also noted that RVAMG cannot be vicariously liable without any underlying liability.
