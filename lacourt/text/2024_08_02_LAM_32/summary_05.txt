And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial into liability and damages phases. The defendants argued that bifurcation was warranted because the damages issue would be moot if they are found not liable, but the judge found that this is true in every case involving damages and does not justify creating two separate trials. The judge also noted that the witnesses and evidence for both liability and damages would be the same, and bifurcation would lead to duplication and waste. The judge's ruling means that the trial will proceed as originally scheduled, with the judge determining both liability and damages in a single trial.
