And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Justin Smith against Alla Zorikova and others. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants ran an illegal dog breeding operation and falsely advertised their dogs as healthy, trained, and top quality. The judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Joycelyn Lew, finding that the service was proper. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the complaint filed by defendant Alla Zorikova, finding that the allegations state a claim under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) and the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, alleging fraud, finding that the allegations do not meet the heightened standard for pleading fraud. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to plead fraud with specificity.
