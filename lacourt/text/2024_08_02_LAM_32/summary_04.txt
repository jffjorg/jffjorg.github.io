Judge's Tentative Ruling: Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Deposition

On August 2, 2024, the court will consider Plaintiff Haley Chapman's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Marriott International, Inc.'s person most knowledgeable. The motion was filed on June 20, 2024, after Defendant failed to respond to the deposition notice served on May 6, 2024. The court finds that Defendant was properly served with the deposition notice, but failed to designate or produce a person most knowledgeable by the scheduled date of May 22, 2024. The court also finds that Defendant ignored Plaintiff's follow-up communications and failed to justify its objections to the requested documents.

The court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition and orders Defendant to produce its person(s) most knowledgeable for deposition and to produce responsive documents within 20 days of this order. The court finds that Plaintiff's motion and separate statement sufficiently set forth good cause for the requested documents.
