     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
     demurrer and motion to
  strike 
     cross-complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 27, 2020, Plaintiffs Craig
Sallin, Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, Sun Coast
Distributing, Inc., Sun Pacific Group, Inc., and Jerry James filed this action
for breach of contract against Defendants Joe Samuel Bailey and Renew Spinal
Care, Inc. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed on March 27,
2020.  
            The FAC asserts a single cause of
action for breach of written settlement agreement. The FAC alleges that
Plaintiffs invested money to Defendants in 2014 and 2015 and that the parties
reached a settlement in 2019 resolving disputes over the amount owed. This
action stems from Defendants’ alleged failure to pay the amounts required by
the 2019 agreement.  
            On April 10, 2024, Defendants filed
a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs for declaratory relief and usury.
Defendants allege that the 2019 agreement was designed to impose an interest
rate above 10% on repayment of the prior loans and is thus a disguised usurious
loan agreement.
            On June 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant demurrer and motion to strike against the cross-complaint.   
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Plaintiffs have complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Kent Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Demurrer

a. Declaratory Relief
“Any person interested under a written
instrument . . . or under a contract . . . may, in cases of actual controversy
relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an
original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of
his or her rights and duties . . . arising under the instrument or contract.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) 
The cross-complaint alleges that the sole
consideration provided by Defendants under the 2019 agreement was the promise
to pay an effective interest rate exceeding 10%. (Cross-Compl. ¶¶ 122-133.)
Thus, the cross-complaint seeks declaratory relief that the 2019 agreement
constitutes a loan agreement with a usurious interest rate. (Id., ¶
160.) The cross-complaint alleges that there is a present controversy between
the parties regarding the legality and enforceability of the 2019 agreement. (Id.,
¶ 159.)  
This sufficiently states a claim for
declaratory relief. As the Court found in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for
summary adjudication of Defendants’ usury defense, and as reiterated below,
there are triable issues on whether the 2019 agreement constituted a usurious
transaction. (See Nov. 6, 2023 Order re MSJ.) Conflicting interpretations of
the 2019 agreement cannot be resolved by demurrer. Defendants need only allege
that a controversy exists, not that they are entitled to judgment in their
favor. (See Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 592, 606.) Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first
cause of action.
b. Usury
The California Constitution limits the
interest rate on a loan or forbearance to the higher of 10% per annum or 5% per
annum plus a certain prevailing rate. (Cal. Const., Art. XV § 1.) “The
essential elements of usury are: (1) The transaction must be a loan or
forbearance; (2) the interest to be paid must exceed the statutory maximum; (3)
the loan and interest must be absolutely repayable by the borrower; and (4) the
lender must have a willful intent to enter into a usurious transaction.” (Ghirardo
v. Antonioli (1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 798.) 

            1.
Loan or Forbearance
Plaintiffs argue that the 2019 agreement
and the 2014/2015 funding transactions on which the agreement is based were
neither loans nor forbearances. Plaintiffs contend that the underlying
transactions were investments. 
However, the cross-complaint alleges that
for each funding transaction, Defendants were contractually required to repay
within a certain time period regardless of the success of the business venture
being funded. (Cross-Compl. ¶¶ 16-58.) The cross-complaint further alleges that
the 2019 agreement was a “forbearance of the repayment obligations under the .
. . Promissory Notes” and “modif[ied] the repayment obligations under the . . .
Promissory Notes” such that the agreement “include[d] an effective rate of
interest that exceeds 10% per year.” (Cross-Compl. ¶¶ 98-121.) 
These allegations must be accepted as true
on a demurrer. The facts suggest that the 2014 and 2015 funding transactions
were loans rather than investments. Furthermore, as addressed in the
aforementioned motion for summary judgment, a settlement agreement may “itself
violate the usury law” as an extension of a usurious transaction. (See Hardwick
v. Wilcox (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 975, 990.) Therefore, Defendants have
sufficiently pled that the 2019 agreement constitutes a loan or forbearance
subject to usury law. 
            2.
Principal Not Fully Repaid
A cause of action for usury “does not
accrue until the usury has been actually paid either in money, or money's
equivalent.” (Westman v. Dye (1931) 214 Cal. 28, 39.) “[U]sury is not
paid until after the whole legal debt is satisfied.” (Ibid.) The
creditor on a usurious loan is still entitled to repayment of the principal
sum. (Gibbo v. Berger (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 396, 403.) 
Here, the allegations and incorporated
exhibits reveal that several of the cross-defendant creditors have not been
repaid the full principal amount: (i) Croesus Investments, LLC funded $161,000
and has been repaid $124,205 (Cross-Compl. ¶ 93, Ex. 2); (ii) Linda
Snyder-Kelbaugh funded $92,000 and has been repaid $77,726 (id., ¶ 94,
Ex. 3); and (iii) Jerry James funded $138,000 and has been repaid $58,500.00 (id.,
¶ 97, Ex. 6). Because these creditors have yet to be repaid their respective
principals, Defendants have not paid any usurious amounts to them. Therefore,
as a matter of law, no cause of action for usury lies against these creditors.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend as to cross-defendants Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh,
and Jerry James.    
            3.
Converting a Non-Usurious Transaction into a Usurious One
Plaintiffs reiterate the exact argument
that was rejected in the prior summary judgment, i.e., that a
non-usurious transaction can be converted to a usurious one and remain immune
from usury law under the credit sale exception. As stated in the Court’s prior
ruling, there are factual disputes regarding whether the 2014 and 2015
transactions were loans or forbearances, and whether the credit sale exception
applies. (See Nov. 6, 2023 Order re MSJ 9:1-22.) Plaintiffs rely on the same
two cases that were distinguished in the summary judgment. (See Ghirardo v.
Antonioli (1994) 8 Cal.4th 791; DCM Partners v. Smith (1991) 228
Cal.App.3d 729.) Plaintiffs’ repeated argument fares no better on demurrer than
it did on summary judgment. 
            4.
Waiver
Plaintiffs also reiterate their argument
that Defendants waived the usury defense through a general release in the 2019
agreement, relying again on Credit Finance Corp. v. Mox (1932) 125
Cal.App. 583, which the Court again distinguished. (See Nov. 6, 2023 Order re
MSJ 6:18-7:17.) As stated previously, Mox is limited to the proposition
that a settlement agreement removes usury if there was a bona fide dispute over
usury that was resolved by the settlement agreement. (See Hardwick, supra,
11 Cal.App.5th at p. 990.) Usury is not otherwise waived in every instance
where an agreement contains a general release or waiver. Here, the
cross-complaint alleges that the 2019 agreement did not resolve a preexisting
usury dispute. (Cross-Compl. ¶¶ 152-157.) Instead, as discussed above, the
facts establish that the 2019 agreement was an extension of a usurious
transaction or itself created usury.  
            5.
Contradictory Position 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer from
Defendants’ prior filings and external facts that Defendants have disavowed the
usury theory. (See Dem. 12:17-15:5.) The Court does not consider extrinsic
evidence on a demurrer, and Defendants’ prior filings do not contradict their
present position. 
            6.
Intent
Plaintiffs argue that the element of
intent is missing. However, the only intent necessary for usury is the intent
to take an interest rate higher than the legal maximum, regardless of the
lender’s intent to violate the law. (See Thomas v. Hunt Mfg. Corp.
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 734, 740.) “The existence of the requisite intent is always a
question of fact.” (Ibid.) The allegations sufficiently establish that
Plaintiffs intended to take an interest rate above 10%. 
II.
Motion to Strike
            “A plaintiff may not avoid a
demurrer by pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradict
the facts pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing facts which prove
the pleaded facts false. Likewise, the plaintiff may not plead facts that
contradict the facts or positions that the plaintiff pleaded in earlier actions
or suppress facts that prove the pleaded facts false.” (Larson v. UHS of
Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336, 344, internal citations
omitted.) 
            Plaintiffs seek to strike the
cross-complaint as a sham pleading. However, Defendants have not filed a prior
complaint, cross-complaint, or other pleading. And as discussed above, none of
the filings cited by Plaintiffs contradict Defendants’ current theory of usury.
Therefore, the motion to strike is DENIED. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ demurrer to
cross-complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to Croesus Investments,
LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, and Jerry James. The demurrer is OVERRULED in all
other respects. The motion to strike is DENIED. 

            Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §436, an
OSC re Striking the Answer and Cross-Complaint of Renew Spinal Care, Inc. as an
Unrepresented Corporation is set for August 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
