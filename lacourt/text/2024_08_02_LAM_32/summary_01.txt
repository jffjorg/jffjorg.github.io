And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the plaintiffs against the cross-complaint of the defendants. The court finds that the cross-complaint sufficiently states a claim for declaratory relief and that there are triable issues regarding the legality and enforceability of the 2019 agreement.

The court also finds that the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges that the 2019 agreement constitutes a loan or forbearance subject to usury law, and that the defendants have not paid any usurious amounts to the creditors. However, the court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to cross-defendants Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, and Jerry James, as they have not been repaid the full principal amount.

The court denies the motion to strike the cross-complaint, as it is not a sham pleading and does not contradict the defendants' current theory of usury. The court sets an OSC re Striking the Answer and Cross-Complaint of Renew Spinal Care, Inc. as an Unrepresented Corporation for August 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument.
