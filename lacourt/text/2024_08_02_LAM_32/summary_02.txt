And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena is granted. The subpoena was served on April 19, 2024, and the deposition was scheduled for May 14, 2024. However, the defendant, Alexander Sinclair, failed to appear for the deposition. Despite attempts by the plaintiff to communicate with Sinclair, he has not responded. The judge finds that Sinclair was properly served with the subpoena and that an order compelling compliance is warranted. The judge orders Sinclair to appear for the deposition on September 4, 2024, at 10am.
