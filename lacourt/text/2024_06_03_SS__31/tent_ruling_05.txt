BACKGROUND Plaintiff Brittany Moore (“Plaintiff”) propounded on defendant Alvaro Alacon (“Defendant”) (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for production of documents, set one, on December 1, 2023. To date, Plaintiff has not received responses. Plaintiff therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before May 20, 2024. No opposition has been filed.   II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Therefore, because the evidence shows Defendant was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Plaintiff’s unopposed motions are GRANTED.  Defendant Alacon is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for production of documents, set one, all without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿Defendant did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,268.91 for each motion to compel.    A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)         Plaintiff is awarded one hour for the motion to compel at the reduced rate of $200 per hour, for a total of $600 as attorney’s fees. Further, Plaintiff is awarded three motion filing fees of $68.91, for a total of $206.73 as costs.       Sanctions are sought and imposed against Defendant Alacon and his counsel, jointly and severally. Defendant Alacon and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff Brittany Moore, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $806.73, within twenty (20) days.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 31st day of May 2024      Hon.
