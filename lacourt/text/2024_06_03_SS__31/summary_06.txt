And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the request of defendants David Posner, et al. to advance the hearing dates on their motions to compel further responses to written discovery and to continue the trial date. The plaintiff, Juan Vazquez, had filed the action against the defendants on August 4, 2022, and the trial is currently set for August 5, 2024. The defendants requested a continuance to obtain necessary discovery prior to the discovery cut-off date. The court denied the motion to advance the hearing dates, stating that the Personal Injury courts do not have the capacity to add hearings to their fully booked motion calendars. The court granted the request to continue the trial date, finding good cause to do so. The trial date is now continued to a later date. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement on the tentative ruling.
