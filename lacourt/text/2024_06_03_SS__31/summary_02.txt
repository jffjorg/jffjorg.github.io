```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for premises liability, general negligence, and negligence per se. The defendants argued that they had no duty to inspect the premises to determine the dog's dangerous propensities, and that they had no knowledge of any vicious or dangerous propensities of the dog. The judge found that the defendants met their prima facie burden and that the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge also found that the defendants were not the owners or keepers of the dog, and therefore were not liable under Civil Code section 3342. The motion for summary judgment was granted, and the case will proceed no further.
