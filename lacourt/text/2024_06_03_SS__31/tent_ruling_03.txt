BACKGROUND Plaintiff Paul Martin (“Plaintiff”) filed First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendants Smart & Final Stores, LLC, Lincoln LT, Inc. (“Lincoln LT”), and Does 1 to 30 for damages arising from an alleged dangerous condition of property.  On April 23, 2024, Lincoln LT filed its Answer to the FAC. Plaintiff now demurs to Lincoln LT’s Answer, arguing affirmative defenses 1 through 21 fail to state facts sufficient to constitute an affirmative defense, and that the defenses are uncertain, ambiguous, and/or unintelligible. Lincoln LT opposes the demurrer, and Plaintiff filed a reply.   II. DEMURRER TO ANSWER Meet and Confer Under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), before filing a demurrer, the objecting party shall meet and confer with the opposing party for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the objections to the pleading. The motion was initially set to be heard on May 22, 2024, and the Court continued the motion on the grounds that the parties must first properly meet and confer prior on the issues presented. (Min. Order, May 22, 2024.) On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating the parties met and conferred by telephone, and that they could not reach an agreement.   Legal Standard A party against whom an answer has been filed may object by demurrer to the answer. (CCP § 430.20.)  The effect of a general denial in an answer is to put in issue the material allegations of the complaint. (Advantec Group, Inc. v. Edwin’s Plumbing Co., Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 621, 627.) In addition to denials, the answer should contain whatever affirmative defenses or objections to the complaint that defendant may have, and that would otherwise not be in issue under a simple denial.  Such defenses or objections are “new matter.”  (CCP §431.30(b).)  In general, defendant bears the burden of proving “new matter” and, as such, must be specifically pleaded in the answer. (California Academy of Sciences v. County of Fresno (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436, 1442.)  The same pleading of “ultimate facts” rather than evidentiary matter or legal conclusions is required as in pleading the complaint.  The answer must aver facts as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and which are alleged in the complaint. (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashimi (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)  The various affirmative defenses must be separately stated and must refer to the causes of action to which they relate “in a manner by which they may be intelligently distinguished.”  (CCP §431.30(g).)   In sum, California is a fact pleading jurisdiction, not a notice pleading jurisdiction like the federal courts, such that merely putting an opposing party on notice is not sufficient.  (Bach v. County of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 561; see Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 244, 250.)  The critical inquiry when a plaintiff demurs to an answer is whether the answer raises a defense to plaintiff’s stated cause of action. (Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 879-880.)  The demurrer raises the objection that the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. (Id. at 880.)   Demurrers to a complaint or an answer generally follow the same rules; however, there are some important differences. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) First, for a demurrer to an answer, the defect in question need not appear on the face of the answer. (Id.)  “The determination of the sufficiency of the answer requires an examination of the complaint because its adequacy is with reference to the complaint it purports to answer. [Citations.] This requirement, however, does not mean that the allegations of the complaint, if denied, are to be taken as true, the rule being that the demurrer to the answer admits all issuable facts pleaded therein and eliminates all allegations of the complaint denied by the answer. [Citations.]” (Id.)  Second, for purposes of a demurrer to an answer, each defense in the answer must be considered separately without regard to any other defense. (Id. at 733-34.)  Thus, a separately stated defense that is sufficient in form and substance when viewed in isolation does not become insufficient when, on looking at the answer as a whole, that defense appears inconsistent with other parts of the answer. (Id.) Third, because a defendant is entitled to plead inconsistent defenses, where one separate answer denies all of the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff is not excused from making proof of the material facts because of admissions of some or all of them found in other and separate answers of the defendant. (Id. at 734.)    B. 1st, 15th, and 17th Affirmative Defenses Lincoln LT’s first affirmative defense provides, “Plaintiff's Complaint and each and every cause of action therein, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against this responding party.” (Answer at p. 2.)  Here, this affirmative defense is not in the style of “yes, the allegations are true, but,” as is required to state an affirmative defense. (See FPI Development, Inc., 231 Cal.App.3d at 383; see also Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College Dist. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546 [Where, however, the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true, such facts are not ‘new matter,’ but only a [denial].”].) This issue is already properly joined by Lincoln LT’s general denial, and is not appropriately pled as affirmative defenses. (Alpha Mechanical, Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America (2005) 133 Cal. App. 4th 1319, 1330; see LL B Sheet 1, LLC v. Loskutoff (2019) 362 F.Supp. 3d 804, 818 [“[f]ailure to state a claim is not a proper affirmative defense but, rather, asserts a defect in [the plaintiff's] prima facie case.”].) For the same reasons, the 15th affirmative defense regarding causation, 17th defense for due diligence, which relates to the issue of duty, are encompassed in the general denial, and are not appropriately pled as affirmative defenses. (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 721, 725 [“Where, however, the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true, such facts are not ‘new matter,’ but only a traverse.”). Lincoln LT’s general denial puts all elements of Plaintiffs’ claims at issue, including causation and damages.  Accordingly, the demurrer to the 1st, 15th, and 17th affirmative defenses are SUSTAINED without leave to amend.   2nd Affirmative Defense Lincoln LT’s second affirmative defense pleads, “Plaintiff's Complaint is barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, including but not limited to, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 336 - Section 349.” Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, Lincoln LT need not explain how each cause of action would be barred by an applicable statute of limitations. The defense of the statute of limitations need not include specific facts, but instead it may be stated generally with the applicable statute. (CCP § 458.) “Under California law, a defendant pleading a statute of limitations defense may do so in one of two ways: (1) citing the applicable statutory section, and if the statutory section has subdivisions, the subdivision pursuant to which the defense is raised; or (2) pleading all of the facts showing that the action is barred.” (Schaeffer v. Gregory Vill. Partners, L.P. (2015) 105 F. Supp. 3d 951, 962.) The word “applicable” is key here. Lincoln LT’s 2nd affirmative defense cites generally to CCP sections 336 – 349, none of appear to apply in this matter for allegations arising from a failure to protect Plaintiff from a dangerous condition on the property: CCP § 336 [five year limitation for mesne profits of real property], CCP § 337 [four years for written contract], CCP § 338 [three years for recovery of real property], CCP § 339 [two years for oral contract], CCP § 340 [one year for penalty or forfeiture], CCP § 341 [six months for action against officer to recover goods or stocks], CCP § 341 [actions against public entities], CCP § 343 [four year catchall provision where no specific limitations period applies], CCP § 344 [recovery of balance due upon mutual, open, and current account], CCP § 345 [actions in name of state or county], CCP § 346 [action to redeem mortgage; adverse possession], CCP § 347 [action to redeem mortgage; multiple mortgagors], CCP § 348 [action to recover deposit of money or property], and CCP § 349, which has been repealed by Stats.2010, c. 328 (S.B.1330), § 33.5.  The demurrer to the 2nd affirmative defense is therefore SUSTAINED. Unless Lincoln LT can articulate an applicable statutory section at the hearing, this affirmative defense will otherwise be sustained without leave to amend.   3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 16th, 20th, and 21st Affirmative Defenses Lincoln LT cites Cahill Bros. v. Clementina Co. (1962) 208 Cal. App. 2d 367, which does not support its contention that the bulk of its affirmative defenses are but mere denials, and not a new matter. Cahill provides, in relevant part, “The basic consideration is whether the matters of defense are responsive to the essential allegations of the complaint, i. e., whether they are contradicting elements of plaintiff's cause of action or whether they tender a new issue, in which case the burden of proof is upon the defendant as to the allegation constituting such new matter. [Citation].” (Id. at 385.)  In other words, if the answer admits the truth of all essential allegations, but sets forth facts in which no cause of action existed in the plaintiff at the time the action was brought, then those facts are a new matter. (Id. at 386, in reference to Goddard v. Fulton (1863) 21 Cal. 430.) If the answer only shows that some essential allegation of the complaint is not true, then such facts are not a new matter, but only traverse. (Ibid.)  Affirmative defenses 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 16th, 20th, and 21st are in the style of “yes, the allegations are true, but ...” (FPI Dev., Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 383), which constitutes new matters requiring the same pleading of “ultimate facts” as would be required in a complaint. The answer must aver facts as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and which are alleged in the complaint. (Id. at 384.) The above do not allege any specific facts to properly support an affirmative defense. The Court suggests Lincoln LT plead only affirmative defenses for which supporting facts are known. Although common, the practice of pleading affirmative defenses which have no basis in known facts is no more appropriate than pleading a complaint without factual support. If facts are subsequently discovered that support the addition of affirmative defenses, Lincoln LT may bring a motion to amend the answer based on the new facts. (See Hulsey v. Koehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1159 [liberality is displayed in allowing amendments to answers].)   Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 16th, 20th, and 21st affirmative defenses are therefore SUSTAINED.   18th, 19th and 20th Affirmative Defenses In demurring to an answer, the defect in question need not appear on the face of the answer. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) “The determination of the sufficiency of the answer requires an examination of the complaint because its adequacy is with reference to the complaint it purports to answer. [Citation].” (Ibid.) The 18th affirmative defense denies that Lincoln LT committed any fraud, oppression, malice, or despicable conduct to entitle Plaintiff an award of punitive or exemplary damages, and the 18th affirmative defense pleads that punitive or exemplary damages would violate Lincoln’s rights to due process. Here, the FAC does not pray for punitive damages, nor are there any allegations that any defendant engaged in any malicious or oppressive conduct. There are also no allegations of discrimination for the 20th affirmative defense denying discriminatory practice under Civil Code section 52 to be applicable. The purpose of Civil Code section 52, which is a claim under California’s Unruh Civil Rights Acts, is to prevent a business from falling into discriminatory practices, and to advance Legislature’s intent to encourage and aid private parties to help in enforcing civil rights laws by bringing civil suits against perpetrators of hate crimes. (Los Angeles Cnty. Metro. Transportation Auth. v. Superior Ct. (2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 261). These affirmative defenses do not appear to have any bearing or relation to the operative complaint.  Accordingly, the demurrer to Lincoln LT’s 18th, 19th, and 20th affirmative defenses are sustained without leave to amend.   III. CONCLUSION The 1st, 5th, 17th, 18th, and 19th affirmative defenses are SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 16th, and 21st are SUSTAINED. The burden is on Lincoln LT to demonstrate there is a possibility it can state valid affirmative defenses if given leave to amend.  (See Dudley v. Department of Transportation (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 260.)  Lincoln LT does not offer any facts in its opposition – rather, Lincoln LT argues generally that these affirmative defenses are not “new matters” such that it must plead facts. This contention is not supported by the authority provided, as analyzed above. However, this ruling will not bar Lincoln LT from later seeking leave to amend on these very same affirmative defenses should Lincoln LT later discover facts that properly support it.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 31st day of May 2024      Hon.
