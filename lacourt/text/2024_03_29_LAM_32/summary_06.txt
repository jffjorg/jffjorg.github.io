And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The case is about an employment discrimination action brought by Keilyn Medina Alcerro against Hardage Hospitality and Does 1 through 50. The defendant has filed a demurrer and motion to strike the defamation cause of action, and the plaintiff has not filed an opposition.

The judge notes that the defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement. The judge also discusses the elements of a defamation claim, which include a publication that is false, defamatory, unprivileged, and has a natural tendency to injure or cause special damage.

The judge rules that the defamation claim is sufficient to state a cause of action, as it alleges that the defendant made a false accusation of sexual harassment against the plaintiff in order to terminate her employment in retaliation for her request for accommodation. The judge also finds that the demurrer and motion to strike should be denied.

The judge concludes that the defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied.
