     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to vacate judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff Jamison 5455
Wilshire, LLC filed this unlawful detainer action against Tyler & Wilson,
LLP. On August 9, 2023, default judgment was entered against Defendant. 
            On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to vacate the default on the grounds that the parties have
reached an agreement for Defendant to maintain possession. There is no
opposition to the motion.  
DISCUSSION
            Because the parties have reached an
agreement, and Plaintiff seeks to dismiss the case, the Court finds good cause to
vacate the default judgment. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to vacate judgment
is GRANTED. The case is dismissed without prejudice.
