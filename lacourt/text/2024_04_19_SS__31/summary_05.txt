And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Isabella Yerena, due to improper use of an expedited petition (MC-350EX). The settlement amount exceeds $50,000, which is not eligible for the expedited process. The court also notes that the petition does not specify the name and address of the parent to whom the net balance will be delivered. The petitioner is ordered to file a new petition correcting these defects and to reserve a new date for the hearing.
