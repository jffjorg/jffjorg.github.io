Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to set aside a dismissal of a complaint filed by plaintiffs Sandra Riestra, Matthias Riestra, and Dylan Riestra against defendants Leonel Mayorquin and Leonel Mayorquin Jr. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice after no appearances or contact by either party. The plaintiffs filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal, citing a clerical error by their paralegal that prevented their counsel from appearing at the hearing. The court grants the motion and reinstates the action, finding that the plaintiffs' counsel's affidavit of mistake regarding the calendaring error is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The court also orders the moving party to give notice of the reinstatement.
