And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Nguyens, which challenges the validity of the pleading filed by the Plaintiffs. The Nguyens contend that the Plaintiffs are barred by the statute of limitations because they were not genuinely ignorant of the Nguyens' identities and therefore the Doe amendments are not relate back to the date of the filing of the complaint. The Judge is not persuaded by the Nguyens' assertion and finds that the Plaintiffs' ignorance was actual.

The Judge also sustains the Nguyens' demurrer to the first and fifth causes of action (general negligence and negligent contact) because there are no factual allegations that the Nguyens had a duty to protect the Plaintiffs from the tortious conduct of Doe Attacker. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action (intentional tort, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress) because there are no factual allegations that the Nguyens intentionally caused harm to the Plaintiffs or were otherwise directly liable and vicariously liable under respondeat superior for the actions of Doe Attacker.

The Judge grants the Nguyens' motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages because the complaint's allegations are contradictory and unclear as to the liability of the Nguyens based on the acts of Doe Attacker firing a gun at patrons. The Judge also grants the Nguyens' motion to strike the allegations contained in the second, third, and fourth causes of action that their conduct was malicious, oppressive, and fraudulent.

The Judge gives the parties notice that they may submit to the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing to argue the motion.
