And here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all related dates from May 20, 2024 to August 12, 2024. The court has considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. The defendants had requested the continuance due to their need to obtain medical records regarding the plaintiff's surgery from North Carolina. The court has granted the continuance despite the plaintiff's surgery being over a year ago, as there is a possibility of settlement and the parties have jointly stipulated to the continuance. The court has also warned the parties that any further continuances will be disfavored.
