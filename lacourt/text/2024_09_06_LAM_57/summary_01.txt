And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the upcoming court hearing. The judge grants motions in limine 1 and 2, but denies motions in limine 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The judge is concerned that the trial, estimated to last 95.5 hours, may take too long and may not be able to be held due to the court's limited time. The judge notes that the parties' case management conference statement estimated the trial would last 14 days, which is still too long. The judge also expresses concern about the nearly 250 exhibits on the exhibit list, which have not been marked as stipulated or contested. The judge plans to discuss these issues at the final status conference. The judge also intends to discuss the parties' dispute over jury instructions and the proposed verdict form at the hearing.
