And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steven Higgins v. Kambiz Razaghi, Nazanin Mojahed, and Tereza Teymourian. The case involves an unlawful detainer action, where Plaintiff Higgins seeks to recover possession of a residential property from Defendants Razaghi, Mojahed, and Teymourian.

The Defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it failed to state a cause of action. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint meets the requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1166.

The judge found that the complaint is verified by Plaintiff Higgins and contains the required facts, including the amount of rent in default and the method used to serve the Defendants. The judge also rejected the Defendants' argument that Plaintiff Higgins could not serve them by substituted service.

The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to revision or withdrawal following further briefing and oral argument.
