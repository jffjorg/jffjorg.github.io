[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEMURRER
 
Dept. 107
9:00 a.m.
October 25, 2024



 
Defendants Kambiz Razaghi, Nazanin
Mojahed aka Nazanin Bakhtar, and Tereza Teymourian (“Defendants”) demur to the
complaint brought by Plaintiff Steven Higgins (“Plaintiff”).
 
This court overrules the demurrer.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This is an unlawful detainer action. On
October 16, 2015, Kambiz Razaghi and Nazanin Mojahed entered into a residential
lease with Plaintiff. (Complaint; Ex. 1.) On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
unlawful detainer complaint against Razaghi and Mojahed.
On September 5, 2024, Razaghi and Mojahed
filed a motion to quash the service of summons. On September 9, 2024,
Teymourian filed a prejudgment claim of right to possession. On September 12,
2024, Teymourian filed a motion to quash service of summons. This court denied Defendants’ motions to
quash service. (10/03/24 Minute Order.)
On October 9, 2024, Defendants demurred
to Plaintiff’s complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 11, 2024.
Defendants filed a reply on October 18, 2024.

II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD¿ 
¿¿¿ 
As a general
matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not
the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc.
Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the
truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains “[a]¿statement¿of
the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a “complaint
ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”
(Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)
 
III.          
DISCUSSION¿ 
 
a.    
Unlawful Detainer
 
Defendants argue the complaint fails to state a cause of action.
(Demurrer pp. 2, 4.)
 
A complaint asserting a cause of action for unlawful detainer
must:
 
1.    
Be verified and include
the typed or printed name of the person verifying the complaint.
 
2.    
Set forth the facts on
which the plaintiff seeks to recover.
 
3.    
Describe the premises
with reasonable certainty.
 
4.    
If the action is based
on paragraph (2) of section 1161, state the amount of rent in default.
 
5.    
State
specifically the method used to serve the defendant with the notice or notices
of termination upon which the complaint is based. This requirement may be
satisfied by using and completing all items relating to service of the notice
or notices in an appropriate Judicial Council form complaint, or by attaching a
proof of service of the notice or notices of termination served on the
defendant.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1166(b).)
Further,  
(1) In an action
regarding residential property, the plaintiff shall attach to the complaint the
following: 
(A) A copy of
the notice or notices of termination served on the defendant upon which the
complaint is based. 
(B) A copy of
any written lease or rental agreement regarding the premises. Any addenda or
attachments to the lease or written agreement that form the basis of the
complaint shall also be attached. The documents required by this subparagraph
are not required to be attached if the complaint alleges any of the following:
(i) The lease or rental agreement is oral.
(ii) A written
lease or rental agreement regarding the premises is not in the possession of
the landlord or any agent or employee of the landlord.
(iii) An action based solely on subdivision (2) of Section 1161.
(2) If the
plaintiff fails to attach the documents required by this subdivision, the court
shall grant leave to amend the complaint for a five-day period in
order to include the required attachments.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1166(d).)
The complaint meets the
requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 1166. 
The complaint is verified by
Plaintiff, and it contains Plaintiff’s typed name. (Complaint pdf p. 42.) 
The complaint sets forth the
facts on which Plaintiff seeks to recover by alleging Defendants were served a
three-day notice to pay rent or quit on July 1, 2024. (Complaint pp. 2-3.) The
complaint further alleges that “Defendants failed to comply with the
requirements of the notice by that date.” (Complaint p. 3.) Finally, the
complaint alleges that “[a]t the time the 3-day notice to pay rent or quit was
served, the amount of rent due was $68,400.00.” (Complaint p. 3.) 
The complaint describes the
premises with reasonable certainty by listing the address of the premises.
(Complaint p. 1.) 
The complaint states the amount
of rent in default by alleging Defendants owe $68,400.00 in past due rent.
(Complaint p. 3.)
The complaint states the method
used to serve the Defendants by attaching a proof of service showing Defendants
were served the three-day notice to pay rent or quit the premises on June 26,
2024. (Ex. 3.)  The attached proof of
service shows that service was completed by posting the documents at the
property and mailing the documents to Defendants. (Ex. 3.)
Finally, the lease, the addendum
increasing the rent to $5,700 on November 1, 2018, and the termination notice
are attached to the complaint. (Ex. 1; Ex. 1 pdf p. 32 (addendum); Ex. 2.) 
Accordingly, the complaint meets
the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 1166 and sufficiently
states a cause of action for unlawful detainer.
b.     Service
Defendants
argue Plaintiff could not serve Defendants by substituted service because
Plaintiff did not allege personal service was unsuccessful. (Demurrer p. 5.)
Defendants further argue that “Plaintiff’s allegations in section 10 of the
complaint completely fail to establish that personal service was attempted due
to the failure to leave a copy with anyone at the premises before posting and
mailing a copy.” (Demurrer p. 5.) Finally, Defendants argue “the process server
failed to mail the notice to Defendants’ residence as required by California
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162(a)(3).” (Demurrer p. 6.)
 
In their
reply, Defendants attach a declaration discussing evidence that is not in the
pleadings. (Reply p. 2.) This court has also not taken judicial notice of the
evidence in Defendants’ declaration. (Reply p. 2.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co., supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at p. 994.)¿As noted, Plaintiff
attached the proof of service to the complaint. (Ex. 3.) Thus, Plaintiff’s
complaint meets the requirement under Code of Civil Procedure section 1166(b)(5).
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION 
 
This court overrules the demurrer.
