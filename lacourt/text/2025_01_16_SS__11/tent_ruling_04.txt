Section 5 of the agreement carves out a handful of claims that are required to
be carved out by law – e.g., “claims arising under the National Labor Relations
Act” and sexual-harassment claims.  (Id.
at Ex. A, p. 2, § 5.)  The overall scope,
however, is overbroad like the Cook agreement was.


[2] Plaintiff makes three more arguments.  He claims the agreement is substantively
unconscionable because (1) section 2 “require[es] [him] to waive claims against
a host of third parties” (Opposition, p. 10), (2) section 5 “requires [him] to
stay [sexual-harassment claims] in favor of arbitrable claims” (id. at p. 11),
and (3) section 8 violates Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98(a)(1) by
“permit[ting] Defendant to delay payment of arbitration fees until 60 days prior
to the commencement of the arbitration hearing[.]”  (Id. at p. 12.)
 
In
light of the Cook analysis, the Court does not need to decide these
arguments.
