TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is: 
 
* granted as to request numbers 4 through 14 and 16 through 17; and 
 
* denied as to request number 15.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a toxic-exposure case.
 
Here, Plaintiffs move to compel Defendant CTEH “to provide further
responses to the Defendants Preliminary Fact Sheet and a ‘privilege log’ for
documents withheld under claim of privilege or protection.”  (Notice of Motion, p. 2.)
 
LAW
 
The Code of Civil Procedure authorizes motions to compel further
responses to interrogatories and document requests.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (a)
[interrogatories], 2031.310, subd. (a) [document requests].)  
 
“When asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection,
the objecting party must provide ‘sufficient factual information’ to enable
other parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, ‘including, if
necessary, a privilege log.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update)
¶ 8:1474.5 [noting that the “burden to show preliminary facts supporting
application of [a] privilege [is] not met where [the defendant] fail[s] to
produce [a] privilege log or identify any specific confidential
communications”], emphasis in original.) 

 
“As the term is commonly used by courts and attorneys, a ‘privilege log’ identifies each document for which a
privilege or work product protection is claimed, its author, recipients, date
of preparation, and the specific privilege or work product
protection claimed.”  (Id. at ¶
8:1474.5a, emphasis in original.) 
 
“The information in the privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow
a determination of whether each withheld document is or is not [in] fact
privileged.”  (Ibid. [observing that a
“privilege log is deficient” if it “fail[s] to describe [the] documents or
contents (other than noting they [are] emails with counsel) since not all
communications with attorneys are privileged”].)
 
“There is no ‘burden’ defense to the ‘statutory requirement’ to produce a
privilege log.”  (Id. at ¶ 8:1474.5b.)
 
Moreover, “[i]n ruling on a motion to compel document production, the
court may require the party who objected on the ground of privilege to prepare
and serve a privilege log.” 
(Id. at ¶ 8:1474.8.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
According to Plaintiffs,
case-management order number 2 makes fact sheets a type of discovery subject to
the Code of Civil Procedure in terms of compelling further responses.  (See Motion, p. 4.)
 
The requests from the fact sheet
at issue here are request numbers 4 through 17. 
(See Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, pp. 2-8.)
 
Request Number 4
 
Request: “Identify and produce
all DOCUMENTS reflecting or related to Defendant’s communications and all
correspondence exchanged with any co-defendant concerning the of any substance
listed in paragraphs 16, 21 through 24 of the Third Amended Complaint and all
related DOCUMENTS. Substances: benzene, chromium, ethylbenzene, vinyl chloride,
mercury, trichloroethylene (‘TCE’), tetrachloroethylene (‘PCE’).”  (Id. at p. 2.)
 
Response: “The responding
Defendant objects to this Request in so far as it seeks information and
materials that are protected by the attorney/client privilege and work product
doctrines, which, in the State of California, have been extended to
communications with consulting experts. See Cal Evid Code § 952, § 954. See §
2016.010 of the Civil Discovery Act. See DeLuca v. State Fish Co., Inc., 217
Cal. App. 4th 671 (2013). See e.g. Scotsman Mfg. Co. v. Superior Court of
Orange County, 242 Cal. App. 2d 527, and Swartzman v. Superior Court of Los
Angeles County, 231 Cal. App. 2d 195 (1964). A privilege log will be provided
upon written request.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to order CTEH to produce a privilege log.  (See ibid.; see also Notice of Motion, p.
2.)  Plaintiffs claim the first and
second case-management orders require a privilege log to be produced.  (See Motion, pp. 5-6.)
 
CTEH contends it already produced a privilege log.  (See Opposition, p. 3; see also CTEH’s Sep.
Statement, p. 2.)
 
On the current record, the Court disagrees with CTEH.  There is a privilege log attached to the
declaration of attorney Teanna Buchner. 
(See Buchner Decl., Ex. 1.)  The
declaration states that the privilege log is a copy Defendant Fifteen Group
Capital LLC’s “privilege log relating to privileged CTEH documents.”  (Id. at ¶ 3.) 
It is not a privilege log submitted by CTEH itself, and it is unclear
whether the log covers all CTEH documents that are requested in request number
4.  CTEH needs to provide a privilege log
of its own that does cover all such documents.
 
CTEH’s objection to the contents of Plaintiffs’ separate statement
pursuant to rule 3.1345 has technical appeal, but it is not a sufficient reason
for denying a further response. 
 
Request Number 5
 
Request: “When did Defendant first become aware of the existence of any
substances listed in response to question 4 at SFAC? Identify the date for each
substance.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement,
p. 3.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive. This
question asks for a date. It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client
privileged communications or work product. Note that this request doesn’t ask
for documents.”  (Id. at pp. 2-3.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions.”  (CTEH’s
Sep. Statement, pp. 2-3.)  
 
Also CTEH: “A privilege log has been produced. The request seeks the
content of privileged discussions because the information was available to
responding party only by way of attorney-client privileged communications.  Accordingly, the request improperly seeks to
compel information in contravention of the attorney-client privilege.”  (Id. at p. 3.)  
 
Granted.  Request number 5 does not
seek documents and does not ask CTEH to provide the details or contents of an
attorney-client communication.  CTEH
fails to cite authority applying the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product privilege to a date.  A
further response is necessary.
 
Request Number 6
 
Request: “Specify each substance listed in response to question 4
Defendant informed Plaintiffs they were potentially exposed to at levels
associated with adverse health effects. For each substance, identify the date
and means said communication concerning exposure occurred.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 3.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  It asks for communications to Plaintiffs
about exposure, and does not seek to invade the attorney/client privilege or
work product doctrine.  Note that this
request doesn’t ask for documents.” 
(Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “This request is vague as phrased and seemed to seek information
related to specification of substances obtained by way of privileged
communications. As a practical matter, verified response regarding all
communications with tenants have been provided in response to Requests for
Production (Set One) and July 23, 2024 deposition of Shawn Wnek.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement, p. 3.)
 
Granted.  Same as request number 5.
 
Request Number 7
 
Request: “How did Defendant become aware of the existence of each
substance listed in response to question 4 at SFAC? Describe how Defendant
became aware of each substance. Identify and produce all DOCUMENTS reflecting
or related to any communications regarding substances listed in question 4.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 3.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive and
does not seek to invade the attorney/client privilege or work product doctrine.
It simply asks how responding party. Further, despite requests from Plaintiff,
no privilege log has been provided per Case Management Order No. 1 (December 7,
2023) and Case Management Order No. 2 (June 4, 2024) required CTEH to provide a
privilege log for any documents withheld under claim of privilege or work
product. Section V(A) of CMO #1 specifically states: “Parties shall serve a
privilege log pursuant to CCP section 2031.240(c)(1) if a document  is withheld under assertion of  privilege.” Section VI (A) of CMO #2 states:
Parties shall serve a privilege log pursuant to CCP section 2031.240(c)(1) if a
document is withheld under assertion of privilege.”  (Id. at pp. 3-4.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions. A privilege log has been produced. The
documents sought cannot be compelled, as reflected in the privilege log and
Declaration of Peter Modlin, as they are attorney client privileged materials
between a client (the Owners) and thereby protected by the privilege held by
Fifteen Group. (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.
App.4th 1263, 1274; see also Insurance Co. of North America v. Sup. Ct. (1980)
108 Cal.App.3d 758, 765.) Inquiry into how CTEH became aware of any information
related to the Property is necessarily protected by the attorney client
privilege as all information was provided within the scope of CTEH’s retention
by Gibson Dunn.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement,
pp. 3-4.)
 
Granted.  If CTEH became aware via
attorney-client conversations, it should say so in a further response, and CTEH
should provide a privilege log that covers all responsive documents that are
being withheld.
 
Request Number 8
 
Request: “From who or what entity did Defendant become aware of the
existence of any substance listed in response to question 4 at SFAC. State from
whom Defendant became aware of each hazardous substance listed in response to
question 4.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep.
Statement, p. 4.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for a name.  It does not ask for the substance of
attorney/client privileged communications or work product. Note that this
request doesn’t ask for documents.” 
(Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions. A privilege log has been produced. Inquiry into
the source of information, when the source is covered under the attorney client-privilege
is privileged information. If identification of the “name” of where information
was obtained would necessarily expose privileged communications then that
information is privileged and cannot be compelled.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement, pp. 4-5.)
 
Granted.  Same as request number 7.
 
Request Number 9
 
Request: “State all steps taken to protect residents of SFAC from alleged
and potential exposure to any substance listed in response to question 4 once
you learned of the potential exposure to any such chemical vapors at SFAC.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 4.)
 
Response: “The Responding Defendant denies having/having had any control
over the alleged exposure at issue in the instant suit, and thus deny any
responsibility or obligation as it relates to this request. Moreover, the
responding Defendant objects to this Request in so far as it seeks information
and materials that are protected by the attorney/client privilege and
workproduct doctrines, which, in the State of California, have been extended to
communications with consulting experts. See Cal Evid Code § 952, § 954. See §
2016.010 of the Civil Discovery Act. See DeLuca v. State Fish Co., Inc., 217
Cal. App. 4th 671 (2013). See e.g. Scotsman Mfg. Co. v. Superior Court of
Orange County, 242 Cal. App. 2d 527, and Swartzman v. Superior Court of Los
Angeles County, 231 Cal. App. 2d 195 (1964). A privilege log will be provided
upon written request.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for steps taken, if any,
to advise Plaintiffs about their exposure. 
It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged
communications or work product. Note that this request doesn’t ask for
documents.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions. A privilege log has been produced. Inquiry into
the “steps taken” necessarily seeks attorney-client privileged inasmuch as all
CTEH work was done at the “direction and to assist” Peter Modlin (Gibson Dunn).
(See Declaration of Peter Modlin.)” 
(CTEH’s Sep. Statement, p. 5.)
 
Granted.  Plaintiffs’ rationale is
persuasive.
 
Request Number 10
 
Request: “Has anyone ever told Defendant that exposure to any substance
listed in response to question 4 to which Plaintiff alleges exposure can cause
physical injuries, illnesses, or conditions?” 
(Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 5.)
 
Response: “The Responding Defendant objects to this Request in so far as
it seeks information and materials that are protected by the attorney/client
privilege and workproduct doctrines, which, in the State of California, have
been extended to communications with consulting experts. See Cal Evid Code §
952, § 954. See § 2016.010 of the Civil Discovery Act. See DeLuca v. State Fish
Co., Inc., 217 Cal. App. 4th 671 (2013). See e.g. Scotsman Mfg. Co. v. Superior
Court of Orange County, 242 Cal. App. 2d 527, and Swartzman v. Superior Court
of Los Angeles County, 231 Cal. App. 2d 195 (1964). A privilege log will be
provided upon written request.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for a yes or no
answer.  It does not ask for the
substance of attorney/client privileged communications or work product. Note
that this request doesn’t ask for documents.” 
(Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “A privilege log has been produced. The request seeks the content
of privileged discussions because the information was available to responding
party only by way of attorneyclient privileged communications.  Accordingly, the request improperly seeks to
compel information in contravention of the attorney-client privilege.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement, p. 6.)
 
Granted.  Same as request number
7.  CTEH should provide a further
response that says, definitively, whether the responsive information came from
communications with attorneys and/or attorney consultants to show that the
privilege applies.
 
Request Number 11
 
Request: “If the answer to question 10 is yes, (1) state specifically
each of the person(s) who told you of these potential injuries, illnesses, or
conditions; (2) when such communication was made; (3) when such information was
communicated to Plaintiffs; and (4) attach any copies of the communications.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 5.)
 
Response: “Not applicable. See the response to question 10.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for names and dates, and
asks for copies of communications with tenants. 
It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged
communications or work product.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “The explanation for why information should be compelled ignores
the various subsections of this request, improperly attempting to couch the
request as an effort only to identify communications with tenants. Instead, the
request clearly seeks again the identity of who told responding party the
information, which is privileged, when the information was communicated to
responding party, which is privileged, and seeks copies of such communications,
which are privileged and are reflected in the privilege log.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement, p. 7.)
 
Granted.  Same as request numbers 7
and 10.
 
Request Number 12
 
Request: “Describe in detail all representations you made regarding any
substance listed in response to question 4 at SFAC made to any defendant or
third party. Identify (1) the person(s) or entities who made the
representations; (2) the date each representation was made; (3) to whom the
representation was made; and (4) how each representation was made.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 6.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for information about
representations made to third parties. 
It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged
communications or work product. Note that this request doesn’t ask for
documents.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345.”  (CTEH’s Sep.
Statement, p. 7.)  
 
Also CTEH: “A privilege log has been produced. The information sought is
any communications with any defendant or third party (which here would include Gibson
Dunn without definition otherwise) and cannot be compelled, as reflected in the
privilege log and Declaration of Peter Modlin, as they are attorney client
privileged materials between a client (the Owners) and thereby protected by the
privilege held by Fifteen Group. ((Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2011) 196 Cal. App.4th 1263, 1274; see also Insurance Co. of North America v.
Sup. Ct. (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 758, 765.)” 
(Id. at pp. 7-8.)
 
Granted.  Same as request number
10.
 
Request Number 13
 
Request: “If Defendant communicated with a government body, organization,
or agency related to the substances listed in response to question 4 at SFAC,
identify and produce all DOCUMENTS related to or reflecting any communication
between Defendant and such governmental body, organization, or agency.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 6.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question requires production of all
communications with government entities. 
It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged
communications or work product.  A
privilege log is required per the Court’s orders if any documents are withheld
under claim of privilege.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions.”  (CTEH’s
Sep. Statement, p. 8.) 
 
Also CTEH: “A privilege log has been produced. The documents sought
cannot be compelled, as reflected in the privilege log and Declaration of Peter
Modlin, as they are attorney client privileged materials between a client (the
Owners) and thereby protected by the privilege held by Fifteen Group.

see also Insurance Co. of North America v. Sup. Ct. (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 758,
765.)”  (Id. at pp. 8-9.)
 
Granted.  Same as request numbers
4, 7, and 10.
 
Request Number 14
 
Request: “Did Defendant perform air-quality tests at SFAC or have others
perform such tests?”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep.
Statement, p. 6.)
 
Response: “See the response to Question 4.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for a “yes” or “no”
answer.  It does not ask for the
substance of attorney/client privileged communications or work product. Note
that this request doesn’t ask for documents.”
 
CTEH: “This does not provide factual or legal reasons to compel further
as required by CRC 3.1345; Does not comply with remaining portions of CRC
3.1345 as it omits definitions.”  (CTEH’s
Sep. Statement, p. 9.)  
 
Also CTEH: “A privilege log has been produced. The information sought is
if Defendant or any others performed air quality tests. Inasmuch as responding
party is an agent retained by Gisbon Dunn the information sought by this
request is privileged and confidential, as reflected in the privilege log and
Declaration of Peter Modlin. (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2011)
196 Cal. App.4th 1263, 1274; see also Insurance Co. of North America v. Sup.
Ct. (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 758.”  (Ibid.)
 
Granted.  Same as requests 5 and 9.
 
Request Number 15
 
Request: “If the answer to question 40 is yes, identify the date(s) on
which such tests were performed, the results of such tests, and produce and
documents relating to the tests or test results.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 6.)
 
Response: “A question ‘40’ is not contained in the subject document.
Nevertheless, if the question was meant to refer to question ‘14’, then see the
response to question ‘14’.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for dates, results and
production of such tests.  It does not
ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged communications or work
product.  A privilege log is required per
the Court’s orders if any documents are withheld under claim of privilege.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “The answer is entirely responsive. It highlights that the request
is unintelligible, and nevertheless seeks to provide response which is
consistent with protecting the attorney-client privileged information sought.
Specifically, the request seeks production of “documents relating to the tests
or test results.”  Inasmuch as the
information available to CTEH responsive to this request was obtained solely in
its role as an agent retained by Gibson Dunn, the information is protected by
the attorney-client privilege as reflected in the privilege log and Declaration
of Peter Modlin.”  (CTEH’s Sep.
Statement, p. 10.)
 
Denied.  There is no question 40.
 
Request Number 16
 
Request: “Is Defendant aware of any air quality tests that were performed
at SFAC? If yes, identify the date Defendant became aware of such tests, the
individuals or companies that performed the test and the date(s) of the tests,
and produce any documents relating to the tests, including any communications
and/or test results.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep.
Statement, p. 7.)
 
Response: “The Responding Defendant objects to this Request in so far as
it seeks information and materials that are protected by the attorney/client
privilege and workproduct doctrines, which, in the State of California, have
been extended to communications with consulting experts. See Cal Evid Code §
952, § 954. See § 2016.010 of the Civil Discovery Act. See DeLuca v. State Fish

of Los Angeles County, 231 Cal. App. 2d 195 (1964). A privilege log will be
provided upon written request.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for the identity and
description of any air quality tests formed at the Art Colony.  It does not ask for the substance of
attorney/ client privileged communications or work product.”  (Ibid.)
 
CTEH: “The answer is entirely responsive as the request seeks information
obtained solely through the attorney-client privilege and specifically seeks
“communications” related to the same. As reflected in the [privilege] log and
Declaration of Peter Modlin, the information and communications sought are
privileged.”  (CTEH’s Sep. Statement, pp.
10-11.)
 
Granted.  Same as request numbers
4, 5, 7, and 10.
 
 
Request Number 17
 
Request: “Identify the two tenants with whom the defendant discussed the
air-quality tests. Further, please describe the conversation including the
date, and produce any documents relating to or constituting such discussions.”  (Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 8.)
 
Response: “The Responding Defendant objects to this Request in so far as
it seeks information and materials that are protected by the attorney/client
privilege and workproduct doctrines, which, in the State of California, have

of Los Angeles County, 231 Cal. App. 2d 195 (1964). A privilege log will be
provided upon written request.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs: “The answer to this question is wholly non-responsive.  This question asks for the names of the two tenants
who discussed the air quality tests and asks for date, time and production of
any documents relating to such discussion. 
It does not ask for the substance of attorney/client privileged
communications or work product.  A
privilege log is required per the Court’s orders if any documents are withheld

(collectively “Plaintiffs”)Opposing Party:       Art Colony Property, LLC (“Art Colony”)Department:             11Judge:                       David S. Cunningham III    ______________________________________________________________________________ TENTATIVE RULING The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel. BACKGROUND This is a toxic-exposure case. Here, Plaintiffs move to compel Defendant Art Colony “to provide a
‘privilege log’ for documents withheld under claim of privilege or
protection.”  (Notice of Motion, p. 2.) LAW “When asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection,
the objecting party must provide ‘sufficient factual information’ to enable
other parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, ‘including, if
necessary, a privilege log.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update)
¶ 8:1474.5 [noting that the “burden to show preliminary facts supporting
application of [a] privilege [is] not met where [the defendant] fail[s] to
produce [a] privilege log or identify any specific confidential
communications”], emphasis in original.) 
 “As the term is commonly used by courts and attorneys, a ‘privilege log’ identifies each document for which a
privilege or work product protection is claimed, its author, recipients, date
of preparation, and the specific privilege or work product
protection claimed.”  (Id. at ¶
8:1474.5a, emphasis in original.)  “The information in the privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow
a determination of whether each withheld document is or is not [in] fact
privileged.”  (Ibid. [observing that a
“privilege log is deficient” if it “fail[s] to describe [the] documents or
contents (other than noting they [are] emails with counsel) since not all
communications with attorneys are privileged”].) “There is no ‘burden’ defense to the ‘statutory requirement’ to produce a
privilege log.”  (Id. at ¶ 8:1474.5b.) Moreover, “[i]n ruling on a motion to compel document production, the
court may require the party who objected on the ground of privilege to prepare
and serve a privilege log.” 
(Id. at ¶ 8:1474.8.)  DISCUSSION Plaintiff’s motion concerns document request number 4: “Identify and
produce all DOCUMENTS reflecting or related to Defendant’s communications and
all correspondence exchanged with any codefendant concerning the presence of
any substance listed in paragraphs 16, 21 through 24 of the Third Amended
Complaint and all related DOCUMENTS.” 
(Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 2.) Art Colony submitted an objection-only response: “Objection. This
request, as writte[n], seeks information subject to the attorney-client
privilege. Subject to the above objections, please see documents products
herewith.”  (Ibid.) Plaintiffs do not seek a further response; rather, they ask the Court to
order Art Colony to produce a privilege log. 
(See Notice of Motion, p. 2.) 
Plaintiffs claim the first and second case-management orders require a
privilege log to be produced.  (See
Motion, pp. 5-6.) Art Colony contends the motion should be denied because Art Colony
already produced a privilege log.  (See
Opposition, pp. 1, 3.) On the current record, the Court disagrees with Art Colony.  The opposition brief states that Defendants
FPI Management, Inc. and Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, LLC
(“CTEH”) served the privilege log, not that Art Colony did.  (See id. at p. 3.)  More importantly, the cited support –
paragraph 8 of attorney Brian Ning’s declaration and exhibit 1 to the
declaration of attorney Teanna Buchner – are unsupportive.  Paragraph 8 merely states that Ning “received
a copy of Property Owner’s privilege log via email[;]” there is no sentence
showing service of the privilege log on Plaintiffs.  (Ning Decl., ¶ 8).  Buchner’s declaration describes the privilege
log as a copy of Defendant Fifteen Group Capital LLC’s “privilege log relating
to privileged CTEH documents.”  (Buchner
Decl., ¶ 3.)  The log does not appear to
cover the Art Colony documents that are requested in request number 4.  Art Colony needs to provide a log that does
cover all such documents, so Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is granted.        Estate of Julie Arnoff (22STCV19686)

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a toxic-exposure case.
 
Here, Plaintiffs move to compel Defendant Fifteen Group “to provide a
‘privilege log’ for documents withheld under claim of privilege or
protection.”  (Notice of Motion, p. 2.)
 
LAW
 
“When asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection,
the objecting party must provide ‘sufficient factual information’ to enable
other parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, ‘including, if
necessary, a privilege log.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update)
¶ 8:1474.5 [noting that the “burden to show preliminary facts supporting
application of [a] privilege [is] not met where [the defendant] fail[s] to
produce [a] privilege log or identify any specific confidential
communications”], emphasis in original.) 

 
“As the term is commonly used by courts and attorneys, a ‘privilege log’ identifies each document for which a
privilege or work product protection is claimed, its author, recipients, date
of preparation, and the specific privilege or work product
protection claimed.”  (Id. at ¶
8:1474.5a, emphasis in original.) 
 
“The information in the privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow
a determination of whether each withheld document is or is not [in] fact
privileged.”  (Ibid. [observing that a
“privilege log is deficient” if it “fail[s] to describe [the] documents or
contents (other than noting they [are] emails with counsel) since not all
communications with attorneys are privileged”].)
 
“There is no ‘burden’ defense to the ‘statutory requirement’ to produce a
privilege log.”  (Id. at ¶ 8:1474.5b.)
 
Moreover, “[i]n ruling on a motion to compel document production, the
court may require the party who objected on the ground of privilege to prepare
and serve a privilege log.” 
(Id. at ¶ 8:1474.8.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion concerns document request number 4: “Identify and
produce all DOCUMENTS reflecting or related to Defendant’s communications and
all correspondence exchanged with any codefendant concerning the presence of
any substance listed in paragraphs 16, 21 through 24 of the Third Amended
Complaint and all related DOCUMENTS.” 
(Plaintiffs’ Sep. Statement, p. 2.)
 
Fifteen Group submitted an objection-only response: “Objection. This
request, as written seeks information subject to the attorney-client privilege.
Subject to the above objections, please see documents products herewith.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs do not seek a further response; rather, they ask the Court to
order Fifteen Group to produce a privilege log. 
(See Notice of Motion, p. 2.) 
Plaintiffs claim the first and second case-management orders require a
privilege log to be produced.  (See
Motion, pp. 5-6.)
 
Fifteen Group contends the motion should be denied because Fifteen Group
already produced a privilege log.  (See
Opposition, pp. 1, 3.)
 
On the current record, the Court disagrees with Fifteen Group.  The opposition brief states that Defendants
FPI Management, Inc. and Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, LLC
(“CTEH”) served the privilege log, not that Fifteen Group did.  (See id. at p. 3.)  More importantly, the cited support –
paragraph 8 of attorney Brian Ning’s declaration and exhibit 1 to the
declaration of attorney Teanna Buchner – are unsupportive.  Paragraph 8 merely states that Ning “received
a copy of Property Owner’s privilege log via email[;]” there is no sentence
showing service of the privilege log on Plaintiffs.  (Ning Decl., ¶ 8).  Buchner’s declaration describes the privilege
log as a copy of Fifteen Group’s “privilege log relating to privileged CTEH
documents.”  (Buchner Decl., ¶ 3.)  It is unclear whether the log covers all
Fifteen Group documents that are requested in request number 4.  Fifteen Group needs to provide a log that
does cover all such documents, so Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is granted.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is continued, and FPI is
ordered to provide an amended privilege log.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a toxic-exposure case.
 
Here, Plaintiffs ask the Court to “rul[e] on the claim of work product
protection claimed by” FPI regarding “the ‘inadvertently produced documents’
and other documents withheld under claim of work product protection.”  (Notice of Motion, p. 2.)
 
LAW
 
“When asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection,
the objecting party must provide ‘sufficient factual information’ to enable

Moreover, “[i]n ruling on a motion to compel document production, the
court may require the party who objected on the ground of privilege to prepare
and serve a privilege log.” 
(Id. at ¶ 8:1474.8.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs claim FPI produced the “inadvertently produced documents” on
June 7, 2024.  (See Motion, p. 5.)
 
Thirty-five days later, FPI filed a document titled “Notice to Destroy
Copies of Inadvertently Produced Documents” on July 12, 2024.  (See ibid.) 
According to Plaintiffs, the Notice pertains to 361 emails.  (See id. at pp. 5-6.)
 
Plaintiffs contend the motion should be granted because FPI took too long
to try to claw the documents back.  (See
id. at pp. 6-7.)  They assert that
case-management order number 2 (“CMO No. 2”) requires notice of inadvertent
production to be made within 30 days, not 35 days.  (See id. at p. 7.)
 
The Court disagrees.  CMO No. 2
states:
 
B. Inadvertent Production of Privileged Information. 
 
If a party inadvertently produces information
or documents that it considers privileged or protected, in whole or in part, or
learns of the production of privileged or protected material by a third person,
the party may retrieve such information or documents or parts thereof, as
follows: 
 
1. Within thirty (30) days of the date of discovery by the party of the inadvertent production by it or by a third person of such
documents, or no later than ninety (90) days before the date set for trial,
whichever occurs first, the party asserting that an inadvertent production has
occurred must give notice to all parties that the party claims the document, in
whole or in part, to be privileged or protected. In addition, the notice must
state the nature of the privilege or protection and the factual basis for
asserting it. If the party asserting inadvertent production gives notice within
thirty (30) days of production of the documents, no party will contest the
inadvertence of the production. The Court will make appropriate orders
confirming privileged status for inadvertent disclosures upon application and
showing of good cause. 
 
2. Upon receipt of such notice, all parties
who have received copies of the produced documents shall promptly (1) return
all such copies to the party asserting inadvertent production, or (2) provide
written assurance to such party that all such copies have been destroyed. In
the event that only part of the document is claimed to be privileged or
protected, the party asserting the inadvertent production shall furnish to all
parties redacted copies of such documents, removing only the part(s) thereof
claimed to be privileged or protected, together with such written notice. Upon
receipt of the redacted copy, each party shall promptly (1) return all
unredacted copies to the party asserting inadvertent production, or (2) provide
written assurance to such party that all such copies have been destroyed.
 
(Ning Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 11-12, § VI.B, emphasis added.)  FPI claims it did not receive notice of the
inadvertent production until June 24, 2024, less than 30 days before July 12th.  (See Opposition, pp. 2-3.)  More importantly, FPI’s attorney, Brian Ning,
declares that he produced the subject documents by mistake because he “was
under the mistaken impression” that counsel for the Property Owner Defendants
had “reviewed and approved” the production. 
(Ning Decl., ¶ 7.)  These factors
support finding FPI’s conduct timely under CMO No. 2.
 
The next issue is whether FPI meets its burden to show that the documents
are privileged.  The answer is no.  The privilege log states the date, author,
and recipient of each document.  (See
Mandell Decl., Ex. A to Ex. 3 [attaching privilege log to FPI’s “Notice to
Destroy Copies of Inadvertently Produced Documents”].)    One, identical privilege is asserted over
and over: “Work product in anticipation of future litigation.”  (Ibid.) 
What is missing is “a brief description of the document[s] and [their]
contents or subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege
applies[.]”  (Catalina Island Yacht
Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116,
1130.)  Consequently, the Court finds
that the hearing should be continued and that FPI should provide an amended
privilege log.  (See Tuft, et al., Cal.
Practice Guide: Professional Responsibility & Liability (The Rutter Group
December 2024 Update) ¶ 7:368.18 [advising that, when a privilege log is
deficient, the court can “order the party to provide a further privilege log
that includes the information necessary to rule on the attorney-client and work
product objections”], emphasis in original.)
 
Both sides discuss waiver.  The Court declines to reach the waiver issue
given the need for amendment.  FPI can
address waiver in the amended privilege log by explaining who each recipient is
– attorney, consultant, employee, etc.
