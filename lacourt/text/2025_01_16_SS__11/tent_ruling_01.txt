TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on FPI’s motion to compel is continued.
 
The Court grants FPI leave to file an amended separate statement.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a toxic-exposure case.
 
Here, FPI asks the Court to compel a further deposition of Sylvia
Tidwell, the person most knowledgeable (“PMK”) of Santa Fe Art Colony Tenants
Association.
 
LAW
 
“If a deponent fails to answer a
deposition question or produce documents or things designated in the deposition
notice or subpoena, the examiner may either complete the examination on other
matters or adjourn the deposition.” 
(Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial
(The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 8:787.)
 
“In either event, if the examiner
wants an answer to the question or the documents produced, the examiner must
file a motion to compel[.]”  (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The first issue concerns rule
3.1345.  Plaintiffs claim the motion
should be denied because FPI’s separate statement “does not contain the factual
and legal reasons why further responses should be compelled, it does not
contain the actual response by Plaintiff, it does not include the definitions, [and]
[i]t does not include Plaintiff’s prior responses to the Preliminary Fact
Sheets or her responses to written Requests for Production.”  (Opposition, p. 6.)
 
FPI asserts that the motion
should not be denied on procedural grounds. 
FPI contends the separate statement “sufficiently describe[s] the
factual and legal reasons why further production and deposition should be compelled[.]”  (Reply, p. 4.)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs
that the separate statement is defective. 
Rule 3.1345 requires a separate statement to set forth:
 
• Each interrogatory
(or other discovery request) to which further answer is sought, numbered and
set forth verbatim;
 
• The answer or
objection made by the opposing party to each such discovery request, also verbatim;
 
• The reason why
further responses should be ordered by the court (i.e., the factual or legal
reason why the objection is invalid or the answer given is incomplete);
 
• If necessary, the
text of all definitions, instructions and other matters required to understand
each discovery request and the response to it;
 
• Other discovery
requests and responses if they are relevant to why further responses are
necessary to the present discovery request; and
 
• A summary of any
pleadings or other documents on file by the party relying on them in the
present discovery dispute.
 
(Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
8:1151 [citing Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c)], emphasis in original.)  Importantly, FPI fails to state Plaintiffs’
answers.  (See FPI’s Sep. Statement, p.
2.)[1]  The Court cannot tell from the face of the
separate statement whether Plaintiffs objected in part, claimed privilege in
part, or agreed to produce all responsive documents.
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds
that FPI should receive an opportunity to submit an amended separate
statement.  The hearing is continued for
this purpose.
 
As a matter of guidance, based on
the current record, the Court notes the following.  The subject document requests are request
numbers 9, 10, and 11.  FPI contends
further responses should be ordered because the PMK only made a partial
production of responsive documents and failed to produce “notes, minutes,
agendas, communications, [and] member rolls” dated 2018 and 2019.  (Ibid.) 
The Court believes that FPI shows good cause (see Motion, pp. 3-4, 4-5) but
disagrees in part.  Request numbers 9 and
11 merely request “personal notes[,]” so “minutes, agendas, communications,
[and] member rolls” do not need to be produced. 
(Ibid.)  Further responses, if
ordered, would be limited to non-privileged, responsive notes
that have not already been produced.  Request
number 10 is broader.  It seeks all
“DOCUMENTS . . . regarding the condition of the PREMISES[.]”  (Ibid.) 
Assuming “notes, minutes, agendas, communications, [and] member rolls”
fall within the “DOCUMENTS” and “PREMISES” definitions, a further response, if
ordered, would require production of all non-privileged, responsive documents
that have not already been produced.  Whether
a further deposition should be ordered depends on whether further documents end
up being produced.  If further documents do
get produced, the Court would be inclined to grant a short deposition (two to
four hours) to address those documents.
