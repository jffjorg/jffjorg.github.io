```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a dispute over an agreement that requires certain claims to be carved out, such as those arising under the National Labor Relations Act and sexual-harassment claims. The Judge notes that the agreement's scope is overbroad, similar to a previous case (Cook). The Plaintiff argues that the agreement is substantively unconscionable because it requires him to waive claims against third parties, stay sexual-harassment claims in favor of arbitrable claims, and allows the Defendant to delay payment of arbitration fees. However, the Judge does not need to decide these arguments in light of the Cook analysis.
