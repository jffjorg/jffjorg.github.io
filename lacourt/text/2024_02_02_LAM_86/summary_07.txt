And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the applications for writs of possession filed by Ally Bank against We Care Auto Limited Liability Company and Mohamed Gabr. The applications were unopposed, but the judge found that Ally Bank did not meet its burden of proving that it owns the 2019 Nissan Altima, a motor vehicle, through an assignment of the Retail Installment Sale Contract executed by Mohamed Gabr. The judge found that Ally Bank's declarant, James Singleton, did not provide sufficient evidence to support his testimony about the assignment, and that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove that an assignment occurred. Therefore, the judge concluded that Ally Bank's claim is not probably valid, and the applications were denied without prejudice.
