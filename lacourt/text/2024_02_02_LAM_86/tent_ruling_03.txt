 Case Number:  23STCP01557    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  86 WOODALL v. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
AND REHABILITATION
Case Number: 23STCP01557
Hearing Date: February 2, 2024 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
SUSTAINING DEMURRER    
 
 
Respondent, California Department of Corrections
and Rehabilitation, demurs to the petition for writ of mandate and complaint
for declaratory relief filed by Petitioner, Nicky William Woodall. The demurrer
is unopposed.[1]
 
The court finds notice has been given as required
by law.
 
The demurrer is sustained. The court cannot determine
without input from Petitioner whether there is a reasonable likelihood
Petitioner can amend the petition to state a claim.
 
LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER 
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
“We assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the
truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.”  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
“[T]he complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts.”  (Doe v. City
of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
The allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of a
petitioner on demurrer. (See Mobil Oil Corp. v Exxon Corp. (1986) 177
Cal.App.3d 942, 947.) “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
BACKGROUND—PETITION ALLEGATIONS 
 
“At all
relevant times, Petitioner is/was a parolee under the supervision of CDCR’s
Division of Adult Parole Operations (‘DAPO’). Petitioner was released from
custody and placed on parole November 14,2019, in Los Angeles County.” (Pet. ¶
5.)
 
On December 9, 2021, Respondent’s
Board of Parole Hearings (Board) initiated a Parole Discharge Review (DR) of
Petitioner. (Pet. ¶ 7.) On April 4, 2022, the Board served Petitioner with a
Discharge Review Decision Form reporting the Board concluded Petitioner “has
not yet fully transitioned into the community” and discharge of parole “is not
appropriate.” (Pet. ¶ 12, Exh. A.)
 
“Petitioner submitted a timely
grievance to Respondent’s Office of Grievances with supporting documents
contending that the reasons to retain on parole are clearly mistakes of fact
requiring a change in the recommendation to retain on parole and a corrected DR
with the recommendation to discharge.” (Pet. ¶ 13.)
 
“On 11/01/2022, the Office of
Grievances issued its Decision denying Petitioner’s grievance
 . . . .” (Pet. ¶ 23, Exh. B.)  
 
“On 11/7/2022, Petitioner submitted
his written appeal of the grievance to CDCR’s Office of Appeals. Petitioner
asserted that CCR, Title 15, section 3723 was not complied with as the
Discharge Review (DR) Form, dated 3/24/2022, was based on mistakes of fact and
provided ample supporting documentary evidence, including several emails to
previously assigned parole agents with pay check stubs, tax returns, rental
lease agreement, escrow closing title, vehicle registrations, and other
miscellaneous achievements.” (Pet. ¶ 24, Exh. C.)
 
“On 1/16/2023, Respondent CDCR’s
Office of Appeals granted said appeal, stating: ‘A Board of Parole Hearing
lifetime parole decision would be outside of the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation’s jurisdiction. However, the information
contained within the report was provided by California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation’s staff, which appellant is challenging. This
claim is granted.’ ” (Pet. ¶ 26, Exh. D.) As a remedy, the Office of Appeals
directed the Office of Grievances to open a new matter to address the accuracy
of the information being contested by Petitioner. (Pet. Exh. D.)  
 
“On February 15, 2023, Petitioner
wrote the Office of Appeals requesting information on the status of said appeal
grant, to no avail. Petitioner has made several phone calls to the Office of
Appeals leaving voice messages requesting the same, with his contact
information. All to no avail.” (Pet. ¶ 29.)
 
Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate
directing Respondent to, among other things, “to ‘order an appropriate remedy’
pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR), title 15, section 3485
(g)(2), as its decision regarding Petitioner’s written appeal (Log #301616) was
‘Granted,’ meaning that the Reviewing Authority found by a preponderance of the
evidence that the decision by the Institutional or Regional Office of
Grievances pursuant to CCR section 3483(g)(1) or (2) was not proper.” (Pet. ¶
36; see also Prayer at pp. 9-10.)

ANALYSIS 
 
First Cause of Action – Writ of
Mandate 
 
The first cause of action is for
ordinary mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. There are
two essential requirements to the issuance of an ordinary writ of mandate under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1085: (1) a clear, present, and ministerial
duty on the part of the respondent, and (2) a clear, present, and beneficial
right on the part of the petitioner to the performance of that duty. (California
Ass’n for Health Services at Home v. Department of Health Services (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where . .
. the claim is that an agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at
705.)
 
Petitioner Has Not Alleged that No Plain, Speedy, and Adequate
Remedy Exists or Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
 
Respondent contends Petitioner has not alleged facts
demonstrating that no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy exists outside of
mandate. Respondent also argues Petitioner has not alleged he exhausted his administrative
remedies. 
 
Mandamus relief is available only when “there is not a
plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of the law.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1086.) “Although the statute does not expressly forbid the issuance of
the writ if another adequate remedy exists, it has long been established as a general
rule that the writ will not be issued if another such remedy was available to
the petitioner. [Citations.]” (Phelan v. Superior Court (1950) 35 Cal.2d
363, 366 [Phelan].) “The burden, of course, is on the petitioner to show that
he did not have such a remedy.” (Ibid.)
 
Relatedly, exhaustion
of administrative remedies is “a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial
review.”  (California Water Impact Network v. Newhall County
Water Dist. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1489.) “The exhaustion requirement
applies whether relief is sought by traditional (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1085) or administrative (Code Civ. Proc., §
1094.5) mandamus.” 
(Eight Unnamed Physicians v. Medical Executive Com. (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 503, 511.)  “Before seeking
judicial review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the
administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.”
(Edgren v. Regents of University of
California (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515, 520.)   
 
Petitioner alleges, generally, he exhausted all
administrative remedies that he was required to exhaust, and that he lacks a
plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. (Pet. ¶¶ 43-44.)  However, as the Supreme Court observed, “such
general allegations, without reference to any facts, are not sufficient to
sustain [the] burden of showing that [an alternative] remedy . . . would be
inadequate.” (Phelan, supra, 35 Cal.2d at 370.)
 
Petitioner alleges facts showing how he utilized the
grievance and appeals process, as set out in the state regulations, leading up
to the Office of Appeals’ decision. (Pet. ¶¶ 13-31.) Petitioner does not allege,
however, he exhausted all available administrative remedies to implement the
remedy ordered by the Office of Appeals. Specifically, California Code of
Regulations, title 15, section 3485, subdivision (j) which provides:
 
(1) If the Office of Appeals grants a claim, then the Institutional
or Regional Reviewing Authority shall ensure that the corresponding remedy is
implemented no later than 30 calendar days after the decision was sent to the
claimant. . . .
 
(2) If the remedy has not been implemented and the applicable time
constraint has passed, then the claimant may submit a CDCR Form 602-3 directly
to the Remedies Compliance Coordinator by regular mail sent to the “Remedies
Compliance Coordinator, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, P.O. Box
942883, Sacramento, California 95811.” Correspondence directed to this address
shall not be opened by any departmental staff other than those in the Office of
Appeals. (Cal. Code Regs, tit. 15, § 3485, subd. (j)(1) and (2).)
 
Petitioner has not alleged that he submitted CDCR Form 602-3
directly to the Remedies Compliance Coordinator to determine if, and ensure
that, the remedy granted by the Office of Appeals has been implemented. Petitioner
has not opposed the demurrer and has not identified any excuse from exhausting
this administrative remedy. Accordingly, because Petitioner has an adequate
administrative remedy that he has not exhausted, he has not stated a cause of
action for mandate. 
 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Petitioner
Has Not Alleged Respondent Failed to Perform a Ministerial Duty Owed to
Petitioner
 
Respondent also contends Petitioner
has not alleged that Respondent failed to perform a ministerial duty owed to
Petitioner. 
 
“Generally, mandamus is available to
compel a public agency's performance or to correct an agency's abuse of
discretion when the action being compelled or corrected is ministerial.”  (AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles
County Dept. of Public Health (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 700.) “A ministerial act is an act that a
public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in obedience to
the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own judgment or
opinion concerning such act’s propriety or impropriety, when a given state of
facts exists.” (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma
County Union High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916.)   
 
Petitioner
alleges Respondent failed to perform its mandatory duty, pursuant to California
Code of Regulations, title 15, section 3485, subdivision (g)(2), to order an
appropriate remedy. (Pet. ¶¶ 36, 47.) The exhibits to the petition reveal the
Office of Appeals ordered the Office of Grievances to “open a new Offender
Grievance Tracking system number to review this matter. The review shall
address the accuracy of the information being contested.” (Pet., Exh. D.)  Petitioner does not allege the remedy is
inadequate, only that it has not been implemented. (Pet. ¶¶ 29-30.) However, as
discussed, Petitioner has not alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies as to
the implementation of the remedy ordered by the Office of Appeals.  
 
In
his prayer for relief, Petitioner also seeks a writ directing Respondent to
comply with section 3723 of the regulations. (Pet. pp. 9-10, Prayer.)  California Code of Regulations, title 15, section
3723 provides: 
 
The
parolee shall receive a copy of the discharge review decision, including the
reasons for a decision not to discharge the parolee, if applicable. The parolee
may file a grievance regarding any mistake of fact contained in the discharge
review report pursuant to the administrative remedies procedures provided in
section 3480, et seq. If a mistake of fact is substantiated and that mistake
results in a change in the recommendation to retain on parole, the corrected
discharge review report with the recommendation to discharge shall be corrected
and submitted to the Board of Parole Hearings with a request to reconsider the
decision to retain. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3723.)
 
Since
Petitioner has not alleged exhaustion of his administrative remedies to
implement the order of the Office of Appeals, Petitioner also has not alleged Respondent
has currently failed to comply with California Code of Regulations, title 15, section
3723. Until Petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies and requested
implementation of the order of the Office of Appeals, his contention Respondent
failed to comply with the regulation is premature.  
 
The
demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED.
 
Second Cause of
Action – Declaratory Relief 
 
The second cause of action for declaratory relief
is derivative of the first cause of action. Accordingly, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is SUSTAINED.
 
Leave to Amend 
 
A demurrer may be
sustained without leave to amend when there is no reasonable possibility the
defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39
Cal.3d at 318.) Courts generally allow at least one time to amend a
complaint after sustaining a demurrer. (McDonald
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 297, 303.) In assessing whether
leave to amend should be granted, the burden is on the complainant to show the
court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v.  Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348-349.)  
 
This is the court’s
first ruling on demurrer, which generally weighs in favor of granting leave to
amend. Nonetheless, Petitioner has not opposed the demurrer, requested leave to
amend, or explained how he could amend to correct the identified defects. 
 
The court will
discuss with the parties at the hearing whether leave to amend should be
granted.   
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The demurrer to the first and second causes of
action is SUSTAINED.   
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
