**Judicial Economy and Avoidance of Duplication**

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the City of La Cañada Flintridge's motion to consolidate two related lawsuits: 600 Foothill Owner, LP v. City of La Cañada Flintridge and California Housing Defense Fund v. City of La Cañada Flintridge. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective due to a failure to comply with California Rules of Court, and that consolidation would be prejudicial to one of the parties, CHDF. The judge also finds that the two proceedings have been coordinated for trial and briefing, making consolidation unnecessary. Finally, the judge denies Respondents' proposal to file an omnibus opposition brief without prejudice. The motion to consolidate is denied.
