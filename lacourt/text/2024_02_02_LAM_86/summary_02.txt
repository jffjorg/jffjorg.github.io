And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The plaintiff (petitioner) has requested certain records from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) under the California Public Records Act (CPRA). The LAPD has produced some records, but has objected to others, citing relevance and privacy concerns. The judge has determined that the LAPD's objections are valid, particularly with regard to the redaction of street addresses. The judge has also found that the public interest in disclosure of home address information is minimal, and that there is a clear overbalance on the side of confidentiality.

The judge has also addressed the relevance of Sewell's declaration and the admissibility of certain records. The judge has ruled that the LAPD's production of Officer Fuentes' BWC video and the Petitioner's location of the Cooke OIS bullet scene diagram are relevant to the case. The judge has also ruled that the Petitioner's withdrawal of his demand for production of original Lecia data files and MDT printouts is not relevant to the case.

The judge has not decided whether the Petitioner was required to request a physical inspection of the FID investigatory files in his CPRA Requests. The judge has also not decided whether the LAPD's assignment of Frequency 35 only to the Cooke incident is relevant to the case.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the LAPD and against the Petitioner's requests for disclosure of certain records.
