And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to the petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief filed by Nicky William Woodall. The demurrer was unopposed.

The court finds that the petition does not state a cause of action for writ of mandate because Petitioner has not exhausted his administrative remedies. The petition alleges that Petitioner was denied a writ of mandate by the Office of Appeals, but does not allege that he has submitted a CDCR Form 602-3 to the Remedies Compliance Coordinator to determine if the remedy granted by the Office of Appeals has been implemented.

Additionally, the court finds that Petitioner has not alleged that the CDCR has failed to perform a ministerial duty owed to Petitioner. Petitioner alleges that the CDCR failed to order an appropriate remedy, but does not allege that the remedy has not been implemented.

The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for declaratory relief, which is derivative of the first cause of action.

The court will discuss with the parties at the hearing whether leave to amend should be granted.
