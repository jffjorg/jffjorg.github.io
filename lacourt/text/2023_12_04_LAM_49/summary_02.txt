And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to expunge the lis pendens recorded on the subject property. The lis pendens was recorded by the plaintiff, Vipan Bhola, after he alleged that the defendants, Gregory T. Royston, Yuko Royston, and YGR Living Trust, had transferred property to a revocable trust in an attempt to hinder, delay, or defraud the collection of his judgment. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff has failed to establish the probable validity of his claim and that the transfer of property to a revocable trust does not support a claim under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act. The judge has also noted that the defendants have posted a bond of almost $100,000 in the related case, which would more than adequately protect the plaintiff from collecting upon his entire judgment. As a result, the judge has determined that the lis pendens is no longer necessary and has granted the defendants' motion to expunge it.
