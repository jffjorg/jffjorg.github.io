[TENTATIVE] ORDER
TAKING OFF CALENDAR PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
 
       This
action arises from a contract dispute involving Plaintiff’s purchase of
examination gloves from Defendants. The first amended complaint alleges that
the gloves did not conform to specifications. Plaintiff alleges claims for
fraud, civil conspiracy, conversion, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.
       On
October 14, 2022, the Court stayed the action while the parties arbitrated
their dispute pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. (Ord.
10/14/22.) On January 18, 2023, the Court granted counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel of record for Defendants, who are currently unrepresented
in this action.
       The
arbitrator issued an award in favor of Plaintiff for $9,155.642. (Mot.
Ex. 8(c).) Plaintiff filed and served this motion to confirm the award on
January 22, 2024. 
       The
motion was required to be filed and served by January 12, 2024 (20 calendar
days where "either the place of mailing or the place of address is outside
the United States." (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005.) Accordingly, the motion is taken off calendar for
defective notice.
