And here is a summary of the judicial document in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling taking off calendar the Plaintiff's motion to confirm an arbitration award. The case involves a contract dispute between Icure Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Plaintiff) and SRAM and MRAM Technologies, et al. (Defendants) over the purchase of examination gloves that did not conform to specifications. The Plaintiff alleged claims for fraud, civil conspiracy, conversion, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. The case was stayed while the parties arbitrated their dispute, and an arbitrator issued an award in favor of the Plaintiff for $9,155,642. The Plaintiff filed and served the motion to confirm the award, but it was required to be filed and served by January 12, 2024, and was therefore taken off calendar for defective notice.
