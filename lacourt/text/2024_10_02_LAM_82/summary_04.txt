And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and finds that the Commission's decision to revoke Michael Coggi's teaching credentials is supported by the evidence. Coggi engaged in misconduct during his teaching assignment at Garey High School, including making sexual jokes about students and staff, asking inappropriate questions, and displaying sexual imagery in the classroom. The Commission found that Coggi demonstrated temperamental defects or inadequacies indicating evident unfitness to teach.

Coggi disputes the Commission's decision, but the judge finds that Coggi's challenges are not persuasive. The judge also finds that the Commission's decision is supported by the evidence and that Coggi's actions were a significant harm to students and the educational community.

The judge notes that the Commission had discretion to impose a lesser penalty, but finds that the penalty is not excessive and is supported by the evidence. The judge also notes that Coggi's attempts to rehabilitate himself and his claims of extenuating circumstances are not persuasive.

Overall, the judge finds that the Commission's decision to revoke Coggi's teaching credentials is supported by the evidence and is not a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
