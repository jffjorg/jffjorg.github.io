And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the petition for appointment of a provisional director for Sisters Group Corporation (TSGC). The court finds that the corporation has an even number of directors (2) who are equally divided and cannot agree on management decisions, which constitutes a deadlock. The court also finds that the directors have not held a meeting in over 9 years, and there are disputes over loan payments and rent payments. The court orders the parties to meet and confer on whether they can agree on the appointment of a specific provisional director. If they cannot agree, they must submit the names of two provisional directors, along with their qualifications and compensation, to the court. The court will then select one from the list. The court sets a non-appearance case review for October 23, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
