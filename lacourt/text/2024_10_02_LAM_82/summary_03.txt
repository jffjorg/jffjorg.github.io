And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for inspection of police records and notes that the petitioner has not submitted a declaration describing the November 3, 2022, arrest and detention. The judge also notes that the California Public Records Act (CPRA) statutes were re-numbered effective January 1, 2023. The judge points out that the CPRA requires public agencies to assist requestors in making focused and effective requests for identifiable records, and that certain categories of information are exempt from disclosure. The judge notes that while the records of investigation exemption has been narrowed by the legislature, the petitioner has not cited or discussed this exemption in their legal briefs. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the petitioner's request for inspection of records may be granted, subject to certain limitations and exemptions.
