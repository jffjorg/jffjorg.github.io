Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to augment the administrative record and compel discovery. The court granted the motion to augment the record in part, requiring the DMV to include all medical records on which the hearing officer relied and Petitioner's letter of December 16, 2023, in the administrative record. The motion is otherwise denied. The court also denied Petitioner's motion to compel discovery, finding that Petitioner failed to show grounds for discovery and that the requested information is not relevant. The court will proceed with a trial on February 5, 2025, and set deadlines for the filing of briefs.
