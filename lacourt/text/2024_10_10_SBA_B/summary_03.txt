And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Al Amarlous Family, LP, Yeconom Investments L.L.C., and Mahmood Amarlou, against the complaint filed by plaintiffs Merrily Jean Lupo and Shepard Perez Lupo.

The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unlawful retaliatory eviction. The court sustains the demurrer with twenty days' leave to amend as to the fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of action.

The court also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the allegations are conclusory and do not show oppression, fraud, or malice. The court finds that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The court orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
