And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the motion for summary judgment and granted the motion for summary adjudication in part.

The first cause of action for pregnancy discrimination is denied as there are triable issues of material fact. The judge found that defendants have not shown that plaintiff's prima facie case is lacking and that whether defendants have met their burden of showing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying plaintiff's request to work remotely is a triable issue of material fact.

The second cause of action for retaliation for taking pregnancy leave is granted as plaintiff has not presented any evidence that she engaged in "protected activity" and therefore has not met her prima facie case.

The third cause of action for violation of the Family Rights Act is denied as there are triable issues of material fact as to whether defendants restored plaintiff to employment in the same or comparable position upon her return from her protected leave.

The fourth cause of action for violation of pregnancy disability leave is denied as there are triable issues of material fact as to whether defendants denied plaintiff's request for accommodation and whether plaintiff's return to work would have been an undue hardship.

The judge also found that plaintiff has shown pretext in the first cause of action.
