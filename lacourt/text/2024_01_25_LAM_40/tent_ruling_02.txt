 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant PIH
  Health Good Samaritan Hospital’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Entire Action
  for Failure to Amend Complaint.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiffs Jessica Martinez and
Yolanda Gatica—acting in pro per—sued Defendant PIH Health Good Samaritan
Hospital (the Hospital) pursuant to a January 30, 2023 handwritten Complaint.
Unconnected to any stated cause of
action, the Complaint alleges that staff at the Hospital received and released
Plaintiff Jessica Martinez’s partner, who later died. More specifically and
among other things, the Complaint alleges that the staff at the Hospital
admitted Plaintiff Martinez’s partner for COVID-19, that the staff acted
disdainfully in mocking Plaintiff Martinez, that she was separated from her
partner on various occasions, that her partner was later released from the
Hospital’s care, that Plaintiff Martinez attempted to lodge a complaint with
the Hospital, and that her partner ultimately died.
Motion Before the Court
On May 5, 2023, the Hospital
demurred to the Complaint on the ground that the Complaint is uncertainly
stated.
Plaintiffs failed to oppose the
demurrer, which came before the Court on September 19, 2023 and was sustained
with 30 days’ leave to amend.
On November 17, 2023, the Hospital
filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ entire action for failure to amend the
pleadings following the Court’s September 19, 2023 order. The motion was set
for hearing on January 25, 2024 and includes a proposed order and a proposed
judgment.
On December 21, 2023, the Hospital
filed an ex parte for dismissal of this action on the same grounds as the
November 17, 2023 motion.
On December 22, 2023, the Court
denied the ex parte application.
The Hospital’s November 17, 2023
motion is now before the Court.
Plaintiffs have failed to in any
way amend the pleadings and failed to oppose the Hospital’s motion and ex parte
application.
 
Motion to Dismiss
Legal
Standard 
The
court can dismiss a complaint or cross-complaint if a demurrer was sustained
with leave to amend and the complaint or cross-complaint was not amended within
the time allowed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 581, subds. (a)(2), (f)(2).) A motion to
dismiss under section 581, subdivision (f)(2) can be requested by either party
or granted by the court on its own motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 581, subd. (f)(2)
[either party]; see, e.g., Ziegler v. Nickel (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 545,
547, fn. 2 [court granted dismissal on its own motion].) The motion to dismiss
is usually made by ex parte application if no late pleading has been filed and
served. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (h); Gitmed v. General
Motors Corp. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 824, 828-829 (Gitmed); see also Datig
v. Dove Books, Inc. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 964, 976-977 [ex parte
application must be served on all other appearing parties].)
If
a late pleading has been filed and served, the defendant must file a noticed
motion to strike the late pleading before moving to dismiss. (Gitmed, supra,
26 Cal.App.4th at p. 829; see Leader v. Health Indus. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 614 [motion to strike and motion to dismiss can be requested
in one noticed motion; defendant is not required to file separate motion to
dismiss after motion to strike is granted].) An order of dismissal under section
581, subdivision (f)(2) is discretionary and is granted with prejudice. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subd. (f); Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th
326, 329-330; Harlan v. DOT (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 873-874.) But a
dismissal cannot be granted under section 581, subdivision (f)(2) if the defendant
asks the court to proceed to trial (or if the court proceeds to trial on its
own) on a special defense raised by the defendant’s answer under Code of Civil
Procedure section 597. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subds. (f)(2).)
Order
Dismission Action: GRANTED, with prejudice.
On
September 19, 2023, the Court sustained a demurrer to the Complaint by the
Hospital, giving Plaintiffs 30 days’ leave to amend. (See 9/19/23 Minutes.)
30
days after September 19, 2023 was October 19, 2023.
No
First Amended Complaint appears in the record as of that date or as of this hearing.
A
dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2),
is thus warranted.
The
Hospital’s motion is GRANTED, with prejudice. 

Conclusion
Defendant PIH Health Good Samaritan Hospital’s Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiffs’ Entire Action for Failure to Amend Complaint is GRANTED, with
prejudice.
