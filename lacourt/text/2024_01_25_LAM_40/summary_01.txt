And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Petitioner Robert Luo-Wen's Motion for Award of Costs and Attorney's Fees. The Court grants fees, in part, and reduces the requested fee award by one third to $36,704.45. The Court finds that the fee rates sought for counsel are reasonable in light of each attorney's experience and background. However, the Court reduces the fee award due to the severe redactions in the billing records, which make it impossible to determine the nature of the task performed in each specific time entry.

The Court also denies the request for costs without prejudice, citing the lack of a memorandum of costs and the premature filing of the request. The Court notes that judgment has not been entered and that the request for costs is premature.
