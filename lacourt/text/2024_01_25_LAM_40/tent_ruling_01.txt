  Luo-Wen’s Motion for Award of Costs and Attorney’s Fees.



 
Background
Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award
On April 7, 2023, Claudette Selvin and Zachary Selvin (the Selvins) filed
an action (LASC No. 23STCP01081) to vacate or correct an arbitration award
against them and in favor of Roberto Luo-Wen (Mr. Luo-Wen). The Petition was
assigned to Department 40 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (the Court) for all
purposes.
On September 13, 2023, the Court set a hearing on the Petition for
October 24, 2023.
Later that day, the Selvins amended their Petition (Amended Petition to
Vacate).
The Selvins also noticed the Amended Petition for hearing on October 24,
2023.
On September 26, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen
opposed the Amended Petition to Vacate, arguing that it should be denied in its
entirety and that the arbitration award should be confirmed.
Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award
On October 5, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen
filed a separate action (LASC No. 23STCP03648) to confirm the arbitration
award. The action was assigned to Department 34 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse
for all purposes.
On October 10, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen
amended his petition to confirm (Amended Petition to Confirm).
Orders Relating Petitions
On October 12, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen
filed a notice of related case in Department 40 and in Department 34, which
sought to relate this action (LASC No.
23STCP01081) with the higher numbered action (LASC No. 23STCP03648).
On October 17, 2023, the Selvins
replied to the September 26th opposition.
On October 20, 2023, Department 40
and Department 34 issued identical minute orders, in which the two actions were
related and assigned to Department 40 (the Court) for all purposes.
Order on Amended Petition to
Vacate
On October 24, 2023, the Court
heard arguments on the Selvins’ Amended Petition to Vacate in LASC No. 23STCP01081. The Court denied
the Amended Petition to Vacate while confirming the arbitration award pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.2.
That same day, the Court issued
minutes in LASC No. 23STCP03648 indicating that the arbitration award was
confirmed and that the Amended Petition to Confirm was completed.
On December 20, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen filed
a notice of lodging a proposed judgment in LASC No. 23STCP03648.
Motion Before the Court
On December 22, 2023, Mr. Luo-Wen
filed a motion for an award of costs and attorney’s fees in LASC No. 23STCP03648.
On January 11, 2024, the Selvins
opposed the motion.
On January 18, 2024, Mr. Luo-Wen
replied to the opposition.
Mr. Luo-Wen’s motion is now before
the Court in LASC No. 23STCP03648.
 
Motion for Award of Costs and Attorney’s Fees
I.
Order Granting Fees: GRANTED,
in part.
A. 

Legal Standard
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of
right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also
recoverable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded where
a contract between the parties at issue specifically provides for such fees and
costs and one party prevails over the other on the contract. (See Civ. Code, §
1717, subd. (a).)
The Court begins this inquiry “with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a
multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of factors specific to the case,
in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty
and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
B.
Discussion
In
his motion, Mr. Luo-Wen argues that he is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant
to clauses for this relief in the August 5, 2019 Common Stock Purchase
Agreement (CSPA) and August 5, 2019 Shareholders Agreement. Mr. Luo-Wen also
briefly argues that the fees sought are reasonable based on the Selvin’s fierce
and ongoing opposition to the awards in favor of Mr. Luo-Wen and based on the
evidence attached to the motion, showing hours spent, rates charged, and other
information necessary to make a determination on fees. (Mot., pp. 3-4.)
The
motion attaches copies of the CSPA and the Shareholders Agreement. (Mot.,
Angwin Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A-B.)
The
motion also attaches a declaration from counsel, which summarizes the academic
and professional background of Edward Angwin, Esq. and attaches verified if
heavily redacted time records. The declaration clarifies that “[c]ertain work
on this matter was also performed by other attorneys and support staff employed
by the law firm of Katchko, Vitiello & Karikomi, PC.” (Mot., Angwin Decl.
re Fees and Costs, ¶¶ 1-23, Ex. A.)
In
opposition, the Selvins argue that the motion should be denied outright because
(1) Mr. Luo-Wen failed to submit proper billing records, i.e., the redactions
in the billing records are so severe as to inhibit the discernment of
meaningful information about the nature of the work performed in the billing
entries and (2) the Amended Petition to Confirm was never actually confirmed.
In the alternative, the Selvins argue that fees should be limited to no more
than $13,750 and that: (1) all fees related to filing the Amended Petition to
Confirm should be denied as duplicative; (2) the case was overstaffed by
unnecessary timekeepers who performed unrelated, menial, and duplicative work,
the time entries for which are also heavily redacted as to render the entries
incomprehensible (e.g., GianDominic Vitiello and Patrick Babajanian billing
entries); (3) Mr. Luo-Wen seeks contradictory fee rates for counsel, with
Patrick Babajanian’s rate increasing from $185 to $225 per hour on December 21,
2023 and Edward Angwin’s rate increasing from $400 to $550 per hour in other
entries (the same rate as partner Vitiello). The Selvins argue these
deficiencies merit a reduction of $17,525.47, in addition to a further
reduction of $14,345.82 based on block billing through heavy redactions.
(Opp’n, pp. 4-11.)
In
reply, Mr. Luo-Wen argues that he need not have but did submit verified time
records, which “show[] the nature of the work which was performed and the time
spent on each task.” Mr. Luo-Wen argues that all hours in the billing records
are recoverable because they were based on the hours expended on confirming or
opposing petitions to vacate the arbitration award, thus distinguishing case
law cited by the opposition. Mr. Luo-Wen otherwise argues that there was no
duplicative or unnecessary work because the filing of the Petition to Confirm
was necessary in case the Petition to Vacate was dismissed, that the staffing
in this case was appropriate, and that the award is supported by the zealous
litigation of the arbitration award and the need to respond to the petitions to
vacate the arbitration award. Last, Mr. Luo-Wen argues (1) that there was no
block billing because Mr. Luo Wen is entitled to recover all fees for time
expended confirming the arbitration award, (2) block billing is not
automatically a ground for fee reduction, and (3) there is sufficient
information in these entries to allow the Court to determine whether the case
was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and
whether the hours were reasonably expended. (Reply, pp. 3-7.)
The
Court finds that fees are merited, but in a reduced amount.
The
Court finds that the fee rates sought for counsel are reasonable in light of
each attorney’s experience and background.
The
Court also finds that recovery is permissible for both actions. Mr. Luo-Wen is
allowed to enforce his rights. He chose to file a petition to confirm the
arbitration award and then amended that petition. The Court cannot fault such
conduct as duplicative and unnecessary work. 
Moreover,
the Court notes that on October 24, 2023, the Court (1) denied the Amended
Petition to Vacate in LASC No. 23STCP01081 and confirmed the arbitration award
and (2) in essence granted the Amended Petition to Confirm in LASC No.
23STCP03648 by “confirm[ing]” the arbitration award and stating, “this matter
shall be deemed completed.” (See 10/24/23 Orders.)
However, the Court does agree with the Selvins that redactions
in the billing records are so severe as to result in block billing and merit reductions.
Fees are sought for work expended by Mr. Luo-Wen’s counsel between June 5, 2023
and December 22, 2023—i.e., between the filing of the Petition to Vacate on
April 7, 2023 and the filing of this motion on December 22nd—which totals $55,056.67
in attorneys’ fees. (Mot., Angwin Decl. re Fees and Costs, Ex. A.) Those time
entries are so heavily redacted that it is impossible to determine the nature
of the task performed in each specific time entry. (See ibid; for
example, at page 1: “Draft [redacted]. Review [redacted] in connection
with [redacted].) Nor did counsel’s declaration specify how much time was spent
on which task or otherwise describe the work done. 
This lack of clarity merits a reduction in recovery because the
Court is unable to determine whether the amount of time expended on each
individual task is reasonable when compared to the nature of the task itself. Moreover,
the redactions are so severe that the billing records constitute “[s]ubstantial
evidence … [of a] fee request with” overly redacted and perhaps overinclusive,
unculled, redundant, and padded billing entries, thereby “destroying the
credibility of the submission and … justifying a severe reduction.” (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1318-1319.) On the
other hand, the Court rejects the Selvins’ proposal as being an inadequate sum
for the substantial work expended in confirming the arbitration award.
The Court GRANTS fees, in part, but reduces the requested fee
award by one third to $36,704.45 (2/3 of $55,056.67), which the Court deems a
reasonable lodestar based on its experience and considering the totality of the
circumstances in this case.
II. Costs
Order Granting Costs: DENIED, without prejudice.
A.
Discussion
In
his motion, Mr. Luo-Wen seeks costs of $1,508.01 but does not justify those
costs other than to reference the verified time records. (Mot., pp. 3, 5; Mot.,
Angwin Decl. re Fees and Costs, ¶ 23, Ex. A [costs on pp. 2 [$17.15], 7, 8
[same], 9 [$17.15 plus $452.15], 10 [$216.92], 11 [$452.15], 12 [$313.06], 14
[$5.13].)
In
opposition, the Selvins argue that Mr. Luo-Wen improperly failed to submit a
memorandum of costs, which has deprived the Selvins of the ability to file a
motion to strike or tax costs pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700. (Opp’n, p. 11.)
The
reply fails to address costs.
The
Court finds in favor of the Selvins.
Rule
3.1700 is triggered by a judgment in the action. There is no judgment in this
action or in the lead case. As a result, if anything, the request for costs is
premature.
Moreover,
the Selvins are correct in arguing that a memorandum of costs must be filed
when seeking an award of costs. Ordinarily, a party to arbitration is entitled
to an award of certain costs as a right. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, 1293.2;
see Austin v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1812, 1815-1816.) However,
the timely filing of a costs bill is mandatory. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700 (a); see also Russell v. Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 1717, 1725-1726 [procedural requirements for obtaining costs are
mandatory; trial court lacks discretion to disregard such statutory mandates].)
The
request for costs is thus DENIED, without prejudice.
The
Court notes that because judgment has not been entered and because this motion
was denied without prejudice as to costs, no prohibitions—either ordered by the
court or set by statute, e.g., timeliness—currently exist as to the filing of a
costs memo pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subdivision
(a)(1). 

Conclusion
Petitioners Robert Luo-Wen’s Motion
for Award of Costs and Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in
part, as follows:
(1) GRANTED, in part, as to fees,
in the amount of $36,704.45; and
(2) DENIED as to costs, without
prejudice.
