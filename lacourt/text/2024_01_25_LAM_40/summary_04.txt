However, the judge has found that the Personal Injury Case was dismissed on January 11, 2024, making it unnecessary to stay the case pending its resolution. Additionally, the judge has determined that Witzer and Witzer Law are not indispensable parties and their bankruptcy proceedings do not provide a basis for staying the case.
