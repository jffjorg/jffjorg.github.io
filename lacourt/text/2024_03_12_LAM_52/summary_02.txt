This tentative ruling is regarding a court hearing scheduled for March 12, 2024, in case number 23STCV18481. The Orange Grove Village II Homeowners Association is seeking a default judgment against Nina R. Chomsky, alleging that she breached the terms of the homeowners association's governing documents. The proposed judgment submitted by the plaintiff is overly broad and not sufficiently clear, and the court has ordered the plaintiff to modify it by April 2, 2024. The court cannot enter a judgment broadly ordering Chomsky to abide by the governing documents, but rather must specify the provisions she must comply with. The order to show cause re: entry of default judgment is continued to April 9, 2024.
