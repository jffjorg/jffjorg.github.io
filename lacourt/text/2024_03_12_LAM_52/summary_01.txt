And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the action due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the summons within the statutory time limit. The plaintiff had filed the action on March 11, 2020, and was required to serve the defendants no later than March 11, 2023. Despite numerous attempts to serve the defendants, the plaintiff did not serve them by the deadline and instead obtained a default judgment against them on February 17, 2023. The judge has found that the plaintiff does not meet the burden of showing any statutory exception under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.240 applies, and the dismissal is therefore mandatory. The judge has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of process and dismiss the action, and the case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
