Dennis’ moving papers refer to himself as a “director” of Snapwize, but only in
the office of Creative Director, not as a member of the board of
directors.  Pet. Op. Br. at 7.  As such, Dennis has no inspection rights
under section 1602.


[5] In 2020
and 2021, Tote&Carry only advertised and sold bags designed by Dennis.  Reply Dennis Decl., ¶2.  The Tote&Carry website promoted Dennis as
a co-founder and highlighted his contributions to the brand.  Dennis Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.  Tote&Carry received significant
recognition, including from Oprah Winfrey’s 2021 quarterly magazine where
Dennis was acknowledged as a co-founder (Dennis Decl., ¶6, Ex. D) and the
November 25-December 1, 2021 edition of Downtown Weekly (Dennis Decl., ¶7, Ex.
E).

Respondents’ argument that Benjamin is not authorized to practice law in
California is irrelevant.  Opp. at
9-10.  Respondents cite no law preventing
a New York lawyer from sending a letter to California for the purpose of
resolving a dispute.
