And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the court. The case involves Tote&Carry, a company that advertised and sold bags designed by Dennis, a co-founder of the company. The company received recognition from Oprah Winfrey and Downtown Weekly. The judge notes that Dennis has no inspection rights under section 1602 and that the company's director, Dennis, does not have the authority to practice law in California. The judge finds that the argument that Benjamin is not authorized to practice law in California is irrelevant to the case. The judge will consider the case further at the next hearing.
