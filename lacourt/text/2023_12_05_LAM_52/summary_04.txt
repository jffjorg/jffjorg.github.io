And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production filed by Plaintiff German Palominos Cervantes. The motion was filed without a sufficient attempt to informally resolve the disputes over the requested documents, as required by law. The plaintiff failed to adequately meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion, and did not provide adequate notice or attempt to informally resolve the disputes over certain specific requests. The defendant had offered to supplement its production and requested a stipulated protective order, but the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's letter. As a result, the judge has denied the motion.
