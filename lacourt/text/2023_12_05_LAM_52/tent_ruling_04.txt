 Case Number:  23STCV03596    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff German Palominos
Cervantes’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
            Plaintiff
German Palominos Cervantes moves to compel further responses to requests for
production Nos. 13-16, 34, and 35. 
            Plaintiff
did not adequately meet and confer before filing this motion.  A motion to compel further responses to
requests for production “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts
showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each
issue presented by the motion.”  (CCP §
2016.040.)  This
requirement aims “to encourage the parties to work out their differences
informally so as to avoid the necessity for a formal order.”  (Clement
v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1293.)      
The declaration in support of this motion shows plaintiff
sent a single meet and confer letter to defendant General Motors LLC on August
17, 2023.  (Yashar Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 3.)  The letter addresses the requests for
production in general but only specifically addresses Nos. 2, 3, 8, and
13-16.  (Id., pp. 11-15.)  Plaintiff failed to give adequate notice that
he sought further responses to Nos. 34 and 35 and failed to make a sufficient
attempt to informally resolve any dispute over them.  Omitting No. 34 was particularly improper
because defendant agreed to comply in part and produce some documents.  (Id., Ex. 2, p. 26.)    
For request Nos. 13-16, defendant replied to plaintiff’s
letter on August 30 and offered to supplement its production.  (Yashar Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 4, p. 7.)  Defendant asked plaintiff to agree to a
stipulated protective order and to “provide … a proposed list of the specific
issues/repairs comprising Plaintiff’s complaint(s) so that [defendant] can
determine agreeable search parameters and search terms.”  (Ibid.)  Defendant tried to informally resolve the
dispute over Nos. 13-16.  Nothing in the
record shows plaintiff responded to defendant’s letter.  Plaintiff therefore filed this motion without
first engaging with defendant in a reasonable and good faith effort at
resolving the dispute as required.
Plaintiff German Palominos
Cervantes’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production is denied.
