And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Long Beach Unified School District, will have its demurrer to the plaintiff's entire complaint sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Brenda Estrada, has alleged harassment and discrimination, as well as adverse employment actions and retaliation, but the complaint is uncertain and lacks sufficient facts to support these claims. The plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specific details about the alleged incidents. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike three portions of the complaint, as the motion is moot since the demurrer will be sustained. The plaintiff will have the opportunity to amend the complaint within the 20-day period.
