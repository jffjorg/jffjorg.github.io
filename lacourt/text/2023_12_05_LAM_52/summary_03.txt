And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' settlement agreement and addendum, and finds that the defendant, Color Story Textile, Inc., failed to make any payments required under the agreement. The plaintiff, Yolanda Perez, has moved to enforce the settlement and enter judgment against the defendant. The court grants the motion and will enter judgment in the amount of $62,035, which includes the $60,000 settlement amount and $2,035 in attorney fees and costs. The court also finds that the plaintiff reasonably incurred $2,035 in expenses, which is less than the claimed amount of $3,212.10.
