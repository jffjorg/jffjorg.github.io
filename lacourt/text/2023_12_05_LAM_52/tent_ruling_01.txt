  Case Number:  21STCV23920    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Mikel Rastegar’s Motion for
Summary Judgment and/or Summary Adjudication
Plaintiff
Mikel Rastegar moves for summary judgment on his first amended complaint
against defendants Mark Blankenship and Jennifer Harper.  
Plaintiff
did not file adequate proof of service of his moving papers.  Self-represented
parties are not required to accept electronic service “unless they
affirmatively consent to electronic service.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B); accord CCP, § 1010.6(c).)  The proof of service submitted with the
moving papers states the papers were served only by email.  Defendants
Blankenship and Harper represent themselves in this action.  The record includes no document showing either
defendant affirmatively consented to electronic service.  The service was therefore invalid and did not
give proper notice to defendants. 
The
court notes that in their motion to quash service of the first amended
complaint, defendants advised the court that they did not agree to
accept service by email.  (See minute
order dated 6/30/23.)  Plaintiff has no
provided no evidence to the contrary.
The
court further notes that the address given by defendants to the court—6250
Hollywood Boulevard, Suite 5F, Los Angeles, California—appears to no longer be the
defendants’ address.  On September 7,
2023, the court received a return of correspondence to that address from the
U.S. Postal Service.  Defendants have not
updated their current address as required by the California Rules of
Court.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.200.)
Plaintiff
and the clerk of the court are ordered to serve future documents by (1) mailing
the documents to the defendants’ last known address of record in the court’s
file and (2) emailing the documents to defendants’ last known email address.
The
motion is denied.
