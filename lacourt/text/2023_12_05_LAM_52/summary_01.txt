And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff Mikel Rastegar's Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Summary Adjudication against defendants Mark Blankenship and Jennifer Harper. The motion was denied because Plaintiff failed to provide adequate proof of service of his moving papers. The court noted that despite Plaintiff's failure to provide proof of service, the defendants did not affirmatively consent to electronic service, and therefore, the service was invalid and did not provide proper notice to the defendants. Additionally, the court noted that the address provided by the defendants to the court is no longer valid, and they have not updated their current address as required by the California Rules of Court. As a result, the court has ordered that future documents be served by mailing them to the defendants' last known address of record in the court's file and emailing them to their last known email address.
