Summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Alma Lorena Castro's motion to set aside the dismissal of her complaint. The dismissal was entered due to Plaintiff's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect in failing to calendar the hearing date and serve discovery responses. The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as she timely sought relief and provided an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. The dismissal is vacated and the matter is placed back on the trial calendar.
