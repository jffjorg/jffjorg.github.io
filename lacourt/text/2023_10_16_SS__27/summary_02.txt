Significant Statements:
  - "In determining whether there is constructive notice, the method of inspection has been held to be secondary. The primary and indispensable element of constructive notice is a showing that the obvious condition existed a sufficient period of time before the accident." (State of California v. Superior Court (1968))
  - "We think that it would be carrying the doctrine of constructive notice too far to attribute to the city notice of the presence of the vomit on which plaintiff slipped. As a practical matter, if we were to do so, the city would have to have inspections circulating throughout the area, day and night, and particularly on Sunday nights to discover and remove such material from the sidewalks." (Kotronakis v. City (not specified))

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the issues presented in the case. The plaintiff seeks to establish a claim of dangerous condition on public property, alleging that the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) had notice of a spill in the hallway. The judge has ruled that the spill was not obvious and that LAUSD did not have constructive notice of the spill. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's evidence falls short of showing that the spill existed long enough that a reasonable inspection would have ascertained its existence. The judge has cited case law to support LAUSD's argument that the liquid's presence for 15 to 20 minutes is insufficient to establish constructive notice. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff fails to cite any case law to the contrary. The tentative ruling is subject to change based on further evidence and argument at the upcoming court hearing.
