And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories in part. The defendant, Mike Man Kim, is ordered to provide further, verified responses without objection to special interrogatories 25 and 26 within 10 days. The plaintiff's request for discovery was reasonable and relevant to establish the severity of the collision and the plaintiff's damages. The defendant's objections to the interrogatories were without merit, and the plaintiff is entitled to imposition of monetary sanctions. The court has imposed reduced sanctions of $700 and $60 in filing fees against the defendant and his counsel, payable to the plaintiff within 10 days.
