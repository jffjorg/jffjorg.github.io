And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion for a new trial filed by the defendants, Chul Woong Chung and Kiwi Co., Ltd. The defendants had argued that the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, Kris Park and SIWY Denim, Inc., was contrary to the evidence and that the damages awarded were excessive. However, the judge found that the evidence supported the jury's verdict and that the damages were not excessive. The judge also found that the defendants had not met their burden of showing that the jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision. The motion was denied because the judge was not convinced that the error or irregularity in the proceedings had prejudiced the defendants' substantial rights.
