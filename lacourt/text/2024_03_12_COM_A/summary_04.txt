And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories in part. The defendant, Mike Man Kim, is ordered to provide further, verified responses without objection to special interrogatories 25 and 26 within 10 days. The plaintiff's request for imposition of sanctions against the defendant and his counsel is also granted. The court has imposed reduced sanctions of $700 ($350 x 2) and $60 in filing fees against the defendant and his counsel, payable to the plaintiff within 10 days. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for further responses to special interrogatory No. 24, finding that the request is overbroad and not relevant to the case.
