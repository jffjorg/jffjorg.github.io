And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling takes off calendar a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Dong "Tony" Xie. The Plaintiff had previously filed a first amended complaint alleging various labor code violations, wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and obtained a default judgment against Next Generation Logistics, Inc. and David Shen. The judgment was issued in favor of the Plaintiff, totaling $16,915.06. The Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration, claiming that they failed to submit evidence of time cards supporting their damages and are submitting the time cards for reconsideration. However, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration once a judgment is signed, and therefore the motion is taken off calendar.
