Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The Defendant argued that the legislation, AB 218, which revived the plaintiff's claims, is unconstitutional because it strips statutory governmental immunity from public entities. The Judge found that the Defendant has not established that AB 218 is an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The Judge also found that the statute on which the plaintiff relies for government entity liability was enacted in 1963 and that the exemption for claims presentation requirements applicable to claims arising on or after January 1, 2009, was subsequently eliminated by the passage of AB 218. The Judge concluded that the plaintiff's claims are not barred by the statute of limitations and that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
