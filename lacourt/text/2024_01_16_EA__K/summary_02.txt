And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $11,725.00. The defendants, WT Capital Lender Services, Lexington National Insurance Corporation, and Freedom Immigration Bonds & Insurance Services, Inc., had argued that they were entitled to attorney's fees "pursuant to the deeds of trust at issue in this action." However, the court notes that the deeds of trust do not identify the plaintiff as a party and that the defendants have not provided any legal analysis entitling them to attorney's fees as against the plaintiff. The court therefore denies the motion for attorney's fees.
