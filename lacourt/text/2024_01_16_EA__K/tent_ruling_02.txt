Background   
Plaintiff Salim Qadir (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
Plaintiff was the
owner of the property located at 1508 Gide Ct., Diamond Bar, CA 91765 (“subject
property”). On or about March 9, 2018, Basel Hassolimeh obtained a mortgage
loan on the subject property from Freedom
Immigration Bonds & Insurance Services, Inc. (“Freedom”) in the amount of
$20,000.00, which was memorialized by a recorded deed of trust. The maturity
due date is undisclosed. On July 9, 2019, a “Notice of Default and
Election to Sell Under a Deed of Trust” was recorded. On March 15, 2023, a
“Notice of Trustee’s Sale” was recorded. The sale date was initially set for
April 12, 2023, but subsequently continued to May 10, 2023. The subject
property was sold on May 10, 2023.
On June 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action against Freedom, WT Capital Lender Services (“WT”), Lexington
National Insurance Corporation (“Lexington” and collectively with Freedom and

Legal Standard
“Except as attorney’s fees are specifically
provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.
. .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021).
Discussion
Defendants move the
court for an award of $11,725.00 in attorney’s fees and assert that they are entitled to
attorney’s fees “pursuant to the deeds of trust at issue in this action.”
However, Defendants
have not attached the deed of trusts (referenced as a “2018 junior deed of
trust” attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s complaint and a “2016 junior deed
of trust” attached as Exhibit B to the Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”)
accompanying their demurrer filed July 12, 2023) as exhibits to their motion.
Regardless,
the court notes that Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s complaint and Exhibit B to
the RJN are identify Hassouneh
Basel S. (“Hassaouneh”) as “Trustor,” Ronald A. Frank, or Lisa Slater as
"Trustee” and Lexington as "Beneficiary.” Both deeds of trust were
executed by Hassaouneh, not Plaintiff. Plaintiff is not identified as a party
to either deed of trust. Defendants have not provided the court with any legal analysis entitling them to
attorney’s fees as against Plaintiff.
The Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is DENIED.
