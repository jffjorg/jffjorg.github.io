The Court has concerns about the discrepancy in the figures given for Medi-Cal payments and has denied the petition without prejudice. The Petitioner is ordered to provide documentation to support the argument that Medi-Cal paid more than $10,708.96 and to explain the reason for the different figures. The Court cannot approve the minor's compromise unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.
