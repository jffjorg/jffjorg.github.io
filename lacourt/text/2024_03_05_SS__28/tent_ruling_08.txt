 Case Number:  22STCV37356    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 29, 2022, Plaintiff Matthew Adams (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Irene Kim, Richard Kim, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort
and general negligence. 
On
January 17, 2023, Defendants Irene Kim and Richard Kim (“Defendants”)
filed an answer. 
On
March 6, 2023, the Court found that this case (22STCV37356) and case number
22STCV34043 are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). Case number 22STCV34043 became the lead case. 
On
November 29, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
On
February 7, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions to be
heard on March 5, 2024.  Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition. 
The
trial is currently set for May 28, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendants
ask the Court to issue terminating and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (h),
provides in part: 
          “If [a] party or party-affiliated
deponent . . . fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and
production [at a deposition], the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated.  In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that
party deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by
attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (h).) 
          Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party
persists in disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
          A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which
should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A decision to order terminating sanctions should
not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of
abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION 
          On
January 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff to
attend his deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition on
January 15, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. or at another date and time to which the parties
agreed but no later than 30 days after January 8, 2024.  The Court also imposed monetary sanctions on
Plaintiff. 
          Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s January 8, 2024
order.  On January 15, 2024, Defendants’
counsel took a certificate of non-appearance when Plaintiff did not appear for
his deposition. 
Defendants
have not shown that Plaintiff violated any other court orders.  Plaintiff’s failure to comply with one court
order does not establish the willful persistence in disobeying court orders
that would justify terminating sanctions. 
Therefore, the Court denies Defendants’ request for terminating
sanctions. 
Instead,
the Court orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the hearing on this motion. If Plaintiff fails to appear
or fails to make a good faith effort to schedule the deposition by the deadline, Defendants may
file another motion for terminating sanctions. 
Defendants
request monetary sanctions of $585.00 based on three hours of attorney time at
a rate of $175.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent one hour drafting the motion
and anticipated spending one hour to prepare a reply to any opposition and one
hour to attend the hearing. 
The
Court awards sanctions of $410.00 based on two hours of attorney time and one
filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendants Irene Kim
and Richard Kim. 
The
Court orders Plaintiff Matthew Adams to appear for a deposition within 30 days
of the hearing on the motion.  Defendants
Irene Kim and Richard Kim are ordered to meet and confer with Plaintiff to
select an appropriate time and place and to make all necessary arrangements to
take Plaintiff's deposition by this deadline. 
The
Court GRANTS the request of Defendants Irene Kim and Richard Kim for monetary
sanctions and orders Plaintiff Matthew Adams to pay Defendants Irene Kim and
Richard Kim $410.00 in sanctions within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
