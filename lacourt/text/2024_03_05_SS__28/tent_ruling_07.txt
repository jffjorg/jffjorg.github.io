PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories, set
one, (2) to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one,
and (3) to award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
B.       Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On December
8, 2023, Defendant served form interrogatories, set
one, and requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Defendant filed notices of non-opposition to his motions on February
27, 2024. 
The
Court grants the motions.  The Court
orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form
interrogatories, set one, without objections by April 4, 2024.  The Court also deems admitted the matters
specified in requests for admission, set one. 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions on his motion to compel responses
to the form interrogatories because Plaintiff did not “unsuccessfully make[ ]
or oppose[ ] a motion to compel a response to interrogatories . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
The
Court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions on his motion to deem admitted
matters specified in requests for admission because “[i]t is mandatory that the
court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Defendant
requests $1,060.00 in sanctions based on four hours of attorney time at a rate
of $250.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent one hour drafting the motion and
anticipated spending two hours to prepare a reply to any opposition and one
hour to attend the hearing. 
The
Court awards $560.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time and one
filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Michael Fundaminsky’s motion to compel Plaintiff Demi
Bell’s responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Demi
Bell to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories,
set one, without objections by April 4, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Michael Fundaminsky’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission, set one. 
The Court deems the matters admitted. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Michael Fundaminsky’s request for sanctions on the
motion to compel Plaintiff Demi Bell’s responses to form interrogatories, set
one. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Michael Fundaminsky’s request for sanctions on his motion
to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, and
orders Plaintiff Demi Bell and her counsel to pay Defendant Michael Fundaminsky
$560.00 by April 4, 2024. 
Moving
