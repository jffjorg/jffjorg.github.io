Defendant filed replies stating that Plaintiff had not provided any
discovery responses. 
Trial

PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendant’s requests for
production, set one, (2) to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendant’s form
interrogatories, set one, and (3) to impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
On August
9, 2023, using electronic mail, Defendant served request for production,
set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff.  On November 3, 2023, using United States
mail, Defendant again served request for production, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses to the request for production or the form
interrogatories and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed replies on February 28, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s
request for production, set one, and orders Plaintiff to
provide verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by April 4, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by
April 4, 2024. 
Defendant
requests $1,000.00 in sanctions for each motion.  However, the Court may award sanctions
against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel [responses to requests for production or interrogatories]."  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  Plaintiff did not make or
oppose a motion to compel.  The Court
denies Defendant’s requests for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Denny’s Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff April Lee Gaston to respond to request for
production, set one, and orders Plaintiff April Lee Gaston to provide verified
code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by April 4, 2024.  
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Denny’s Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff April Lee
Gaston to respond to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff April
Lee Gaston to provide verified code-compliant responses to
the form interrogatories without objections by April 4, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Denny’s Inc.’s requests for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
