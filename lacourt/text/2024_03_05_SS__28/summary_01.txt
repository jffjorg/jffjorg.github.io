The motion was filed after the close of discovery, and Defendant failed to establish exceptional circumstances to justify the late filing. The Court finds that Plaintiff's amended expert witness designation and production of MRI images at Dr. Chaudhry's deposition did not constitute exceptional circumstances. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
