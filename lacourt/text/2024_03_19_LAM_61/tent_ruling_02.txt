[1] Palmdale’s
response to this request is also non-compliant, as noted in this court’s  ruling of October 12, 2023, denying Palmdale’s
motion to compel further responses to requests for production from Plaintiffs,
and as Palmdale itself argued in its motion filed on July 20, 2023.The request
that Plaintiffs cite in this motion was served on October 24, 2023,  after both Palmdale’s original motion and
this court’s order. (Mircheff Decl. Exh. D.) 


[2] Palmdale
belatedly provides the declaration of Luis Garibay, who says that nobody
employed by Palmdale has personal knowledge of such an agreement, and no city
records indicate the existence of such an agreement. (Garibay Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.)
Palmdale did not provide this information in response to Interrogatory No.
