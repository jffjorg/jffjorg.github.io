pertinent part of the statute cited in the opinion, and quoted in full therein,
is substantially similar to the same section currently operative as Government
Code § 13963, subd. (b). The relevant portion quoted in the opinion states: “If
a claim is filed within one year of the date of recovery, the state shall pay
25 percent of the amount of the recovery which is subject to a lien on the
judgment, award, or settlement, to the county probation department or the
victim responsible for recovery thereof from the perpetrator of the crime,
provided the total amount of the lien is recovered. The remaining 75 percent of
the amount and any amount not claimed within one year pursuant to this section,
shall be deposited in the Indemnity Fund.” (Opinion No. 81-208, 64 Cal. Op.
Att'y Gen. 540, at p. 1.) The statute was amended in 2016 to include a
requirement that the recipient notify the board of the action prior to
receiving any recovery.
