And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of plaintiffs Yvette Villalba, Jade Chan, Yoel Chan, Richard Cuevas, and Zachary Cuevas to expunge a notice of lien filed by the California Victim Compensation Board (Board) on January 18, 2022. The notice of lien is for $6,852.32, which represents funeral/burial expenses, relocation costs, and mental health treatment resulting from a crime that is the subject of the present action. The Board argues that the lien is valid and that plaintiffs are not entitled to a reduction, while plaintiffs argue that the Board can only claim reimbursement on a recovery for "losses suffered" that were "the basis for the receipt of the judgment, award, or settlement". The court finds that the Board is entitled to a lien on any judgment, award, or settlement in favor of or on behalf of the recipient, and that the lien is not excessive. The court also finds that plaintiffs are not entitled to a 25% reduction of the lien, as they have not pursued the administrative remedy set forth in Government Code § 13960. The court's decision is based on the plain language of the statute and the Attorney General's opinion in Opinion No. 81-208.
