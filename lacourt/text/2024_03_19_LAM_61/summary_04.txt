And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a statute requiring the state to pay 25% of the amount of a recovery subject to a lien on a judgment, award, or settlement to the county probation department or the victim responsible for the recovery. The remaining 75% and any amount not claimed within one year must be deposited in the Indemnity Fund. The statute was amended in 2016 to require notification to the board prior to receiving any recovery.
