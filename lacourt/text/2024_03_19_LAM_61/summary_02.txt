And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Palmdale, which is a response to a request for production from the plaintiffs. However, Palmdale's response is non-compliant and does not provide the required information. This is evident from Palmdale's own argument in its motion and previous court orders. Specifically, Palmdale was asked to provide information in response to an interrogatory, but failed to do so. The judge notes that Palmdale has belatedly provided a declaration from Luis Garibay, stating that no Palmdale employee has personal knowledge of an agreement and that no city records indicate the existence of such an agreement. The judge will consider this information further at the upcoming court hearing.
