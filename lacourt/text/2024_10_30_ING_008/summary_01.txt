And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, meaning that the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is granted. The plaintiff's claims of constructive fraud and actual fraud are dismissed, and the court finds that the defendant is immune from suit under the PREP Act.

The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations of misconduct by the defendant are not sufficient to overcome the demurrer, and that the PREP Act provides broad immunity for claims arising from the administration of a covered countermeasure, such as Remdesivir. The court also notes that the plaintiff's reliance on the Nelson case is misplaced, as the facts of that case are distinguishable from those alleged in this case.

The court orders the defendant to give notice of the tentative ruling, and the plaintiff may present oral argument as to how she plans to further amend the pleading in a way that would not fall under the PREP Act, or if she prefers to proceed under the statutory exception to bring the fraud claim in Washington D.C. However, if the plaintiff is unable to do so, the court's tentative ruling is to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.
