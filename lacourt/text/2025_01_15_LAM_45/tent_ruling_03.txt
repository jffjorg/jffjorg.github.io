BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff and judgment creditor Public
Broadcasting Service (PBS) filed this application for entry of judgment on
sister-state judgment against defendant and judgment debtor TS Media, Inc. on September
20, 2021.
 
On December 17, 2024, TS Media, Inc.’s
Counsel, Freeman Mathis & Gary LLP filed the instant Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel. 
 
As of January 10, 2025, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Counsel TS
Media, Inc.’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant TS Media, Inc. is
GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
Counsel
seeks to be relieved on the grounds that Defendant filed for bankruptcy and owes
Counsel over $30,000.00. (Rubin Decl. ¶¶ 4,7.) 
 
Counsel has
complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by filing forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and lodging with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053
as to each party. Counsel declares Defendant TS Media, Inc. was personally served.
Counsel also served all interested parties by mail and email. 
 
Further, it
appears no prejudice will be suffered by Defendant as no opposition was filed
and trial has not been set. 
 
Accordingly,
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Counsel’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the
proof of service.
