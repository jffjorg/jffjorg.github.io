And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Matthew Cortez, counsel for Autocom, Inc., to be relieved as counsel for the defendant. This is because Autocom, Inc. is not in good standing as a registered entity with the State of California and thus cannot be represented by counsel. Despite not having an opposing party, the judge notes that no prejudice will be suffered by Autocom, Inc. as the motion was unopposed. The judge also notes that the trial date can be continued to April 14, 2025. As a result, the motion is granted, and the court will set an order to show cause to strike the answer for a future date, informing Autocom, Inc. that it must be represented by counsel to defend the action.
