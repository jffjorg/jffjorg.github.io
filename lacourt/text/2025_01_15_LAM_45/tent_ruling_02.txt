BACKGROUND
 
Rexford Industrial – 701 Kingshill, LLC
(Plaintiff) is the owner and lessor of 16830 Avalon Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90746. On February 5, 2010, Plaintiff entered into a lease with AutoCom, Inc.
(Defendant) as lessee. Plaintiff alleges that after the last made payment in
March of 2020, AutoCom breached the lease.
 
On November 24, 2020, Plaintiff filed
the complaint, alleging (1) breach of lease agreement, (2) breach of sublease
agreement, and (3) breach of guaranty. 
 
On December 3, 2024, Matthew (“Matt”)
Paul Cortez filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
As of January 10, 2025, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Counsel
Matthew Cortez’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant Autocom, Inc. is
GRANTED.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
Counsel
seeks to be relieved on the grounds that Defendant Autocom, Inc. is not in good
standing as a registered entity with the State of California and thus
ineligible to be represented by counsel. 
 
Counsel has
complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by filing forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and lodging with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053
as to each party. Counsel served the parties by mail at each of the last known
addresses, which Counsel states he has confirmed as current within the past 30
days. 
 
Further, it
appears no prejudice will be suffered by Defendant Autocom, Inc. as no
opposition was filed. Moreover, trial may be continued since it is set for
April 14, 2025. 
 
Accordingly,
Counsel Matthew Cortez’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant Autocom,
Inc. is GRANTED.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Counsel
Matthew Cortez’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant Autocom, Inc. is
GRANTED.   The court will set an OSC re striking the answer
for a date in the future, informing Autocom, Inc. of the necessity that it be
represented by counsel if it wants to defend this action.
