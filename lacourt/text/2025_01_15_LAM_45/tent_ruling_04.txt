LEGAL STANDARD
 
A
judgment creditor may propound written interrogatories to the judgment debtor
in the manner provided by Section 2030.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., 708.020,
subd. (a).) Interrogatories pursuant to this section may be enforced, to the
extent practicable, in the same manner as interrogatories in a civil action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.020, subd. (c).) Similarly, a judgment creditor may
demand that any judgment debtor produce and permit the party making the demand
to inspect and to copy documents in the possession, custody, or control of the
party upon whom the demand is made and in the manner provided by Section
2031.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).) Inspection demands
served pursuant to this section may be enforced in the same manner as demands
in a civil action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (c).)  
 
A
party must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or
requests for production of documents are directed does not provide timely
responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to
the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of
documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before
trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to
compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
 
The court
shall impose a monetary sanction against any person who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, or request for
production, unless that party acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), and 2031.300, subd. (c).)  
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a) provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed.” 
 
ANALYSIS
 
On November 29, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant with Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One. (Stuhlbarg
Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A.)
Responses to the Discovery Requests were due on January 3,
2023. No responses were provided despite meet and confer efforts. (Id.,
¶ 4; Exh. B.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to an order that Defendant serve
verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 708.020, 708.030.) 
 
Sanctions 
 
As
Defendant failed to provide responses to the discovery and failed to provide
substantial justification for the failure to respond, sanctions are warranted. However,
the amount sought is excessive given the simplicity of this unopposed motion. As
such, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is granted in the reduced in the amount
of $361.65 ($300 per hour, for one hour, plus $61.65 filing fee), to be paid
within 20 days of this order. 
 
Further,
Plaintiff has filed only one motion, seeking two sets of discovery. As a
result, Plaintiff has only paid for one filing fee, and must pay $60 to the
court for the filing fee of the additional motion it failed to file.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for
Production of Documents, Sets One, is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered serve
verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days
of this order. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED. Defendant is
ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $361.65 within 20 days of this order.
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to pay to the court a $60 filing fee within 20 days.
