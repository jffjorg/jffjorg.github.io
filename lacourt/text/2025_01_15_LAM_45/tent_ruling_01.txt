BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Brian Rucker and Valentina
Malofiy initiated this action on September 5, 2019. Plaintiffs filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on October 26, 2020 against
Defendants ServPro Industries, Mission Critical Restoration Services, Inc. dba
ServePro of Torrance, Farmers Group, Inc., Farmers Insurance Exchange, and
Mid-Century Insurance Company, alleging causes of action for: (1) Negligence;
(2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Declaratory Judgment/Breach of Contract; (4)
Bad Faith – Tortious Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealings; and (5) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. Plaintiffs allege
that Defendants negligently failed to correctly mitigate fire and smoke damage
to Plaintiffs’ home from a wildfire, which led to the release of massive
amounts of asbestos that rendered the home unlivable. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’
motion for trial preference is denied.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may in
its discretion grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing
that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by
granting this preference. (CCP section 36(e).)
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs move for a trial preference
to ensure that CCP § 583.310 does not come into effect. Plaintiffs filed this
motion in June of 2024, and asked for a preferential trial setting as to the
previous trial date of August 5, 2024. 
The basis for their request is now moot
as the trial date is currently set for February 10, 2025, and the parties
orally stipulated to extend the deadline to the current trial date. (See
10/28/2024 Minute Order.) In any event, while Plaintiffs state that trial was
continued in 2022 and thereafter for many different reasons, there is no
indication as to why the case did not proceed to trial before then. "[A] trial court does not have a mandatory duty
to set a preferential trial date, even when the five-year deadline approaches.
Its discretion is not wholly unfettered: it must consider the 'total picture,'
... including the condition of the court calendar, dilatory conduct by
plaintiff, prejudice to defendant of an accelerated trial date, and the
likelihood of eventual mandatory dismissal if the early trial date is denied.

v. Golden State Sanwa Bank (1987)

Accordingly,
the motion for trial preference is denied.
