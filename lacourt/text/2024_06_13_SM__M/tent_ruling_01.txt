Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section¿664.6
provides:
 
“If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement.  If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” 
 
            “Section
664.6 empowers a court to enforce a settlement agreement by way of a summary
procedure if certain requirements are satisfied. In order to take advantage of
the statute’s expedited procedure, a party must first establish the agreement
at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ or was made orally
before the court.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 304, citations omitted.) “Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.” (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) In
ruling on a motion under section 664.6, the trial judge may receive oral
testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Corkland v.
Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the agreement was reached at
a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on the basis of its own
notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as any transcripts of the
proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.)
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Mark M. Mintz moves for
an order reinstating this action, enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement
between the parties entered on August 25, 2022, order Judgment in favor of
Plaintiff, and award $4,844.05 in attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
Plaintiff claims that the parties
entered into a settlement agreement on August 25, 2022. (Ex. A.) The agreement
provides that: (a) Defendants would pay Plaintiff the sum of $108,375.00; (b)
Defendants agreed to pay $3,000.00 by or before August 31, 2022; (c) monthly
$3,000.00 payments on the 1st of each month commencing October 1, 2022 and
continuing until the Settlement Amount is satisfied; and, (d) in the event that
Defendants fail to timely comply with the payment terms of the Settlement
Agreement, then Plaintiff may apply for entry of the Money Judgment. Plaintiff
asserts that Defendants made all payments through May 1, 2023. Plaintiff did
not receive the June 1, 2023, payment and any subsequent payments.
 
Plaintiff fails to show that the
court retained jurisdiction to enforce settlement. “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘If requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the
[trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a]
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.’” (Id.,
citations omitted.) “A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under
section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id.) “The ‘request must be express, not implied
from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id.)
 
On August 15, 2022, the parties
indicated to the Court that the case was tentatively settled. On
September 19, 2022, prior to the hearing on an OSC re: Settlement, Plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed this action with prejudice, and without any retention of
jurisdiction. Simply put, the parties did not expressly request on the record that
the Court retain jurisdiction prior to the dismissal. Without such a request, the
Court lost jurisdiction over this matter upon dismissal. Therefore, the Court
lacks jurisdiction to use the summary procedure embodied by Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6.
 
Plaintiff cites the term of the
settlement wherein the parties agreed that the Court would retain jurisdiction
over the action. (Ex. A, § 6.) However, the settlement’s terms alone do not
confer jurisdiction. “The settlement language purporting to vest the trial
court with retained jurisdiction after the dismissal was a nullity: Subject
matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, waiver or estoppel.” (Hagan
Engineering, Inc. v. Mills (2003) 115 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1008.) Further, the
settlement was not filed before or with the dismissal, and thus could not be construed
as a timely request to the Court to retain jurisdiction by the parties during
the pendency of the case. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
