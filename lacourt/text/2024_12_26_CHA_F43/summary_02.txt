And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set one, from the plaintiff, Marcy Linares. The defendant, Alejandra Gomez, had propounded the interrogatories on July 29, 2024, and the responses were due on August 30, 2024. However, the plaintiff failed to serve the responses, despite two deadline extensions granted by the defendant's counsel. The defendant's counsel, Michael J. Lowell, had attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel, but the plaintiff's counsel claimed to be unaware of the discovery motions until a December 11, 2024 ruling. The judge found that the defendant had shown that she had properly served the interrogatories and that the plaintiff had failed to respond within the time limits. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to the defendant's special interrogatories, set one, and granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $535.00.
