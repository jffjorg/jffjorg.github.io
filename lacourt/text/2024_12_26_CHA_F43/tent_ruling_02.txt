SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 1, 2023,[1]
Plaintiffs Enrique Gomez and Marcy Linares (Plaintiffs) were involved in a
vehicle collision with Defendant Alejandra Gomez (Defendant).  As a result of the collision, Plaintiffs
suffered damages and serious injuries. 
Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant on June 17, 2024,
alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and (2) “negligence
involvement”.  The “negligence
involvement” cause of action appears largely duplicative of the first cause of
action.  
 
On
July 29, 2024, Defendant propounded Special Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff
Linares.  Responses were due August 30,
2024.  Defendant gave Plaintiffs two
deadline extensions, but Plaintiffs did not serve responses. 
 
On
October 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to her Special
Interrogatories, Set One.  No opposition
has been filed.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
A
motion to compel interrogatory responses must include a declaration stating
facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
mentioned in the motion before filing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2016.040.)  
 
Defendant’s
counsel of record, Michael J. Lowell, declares he attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel before filing this motion.  (Declaration of Michael J. Lowell, ¶ 2, Exh.
A.)  After Plaintiffs missed the August
30 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a meet and confer letter
informing Plaintiffs they waived all objections and extending Plaintiffs’
deadline to respond to October 1, 2024. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. B.)  After
Plaintiffs missed the October 1 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a
second letter extending the time to respond to October 15, 2024.  (Lowel Dec., ¶ 4, Exh. C.)  As of October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs have not
served responses. 
On
December 13, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration stating he was
unaware of Defendant’s discovery motions until he received notice of a December
11, 2024 ruling and argued that Defendant’s counsel did not attempt to meet and
confer.  (Declaration of Bob Nehoray, ¶¶
2-3.)  On November 17, 2024, the Court
heard counsel’s arguments, and Plaintiffs’ counsel presented no evidence to
support the argument that Defense counsel did not attempt to meet and confer. 
 
ANALYSIS
A
propounding party may move to compel responses to special interrogatories where
the responding party fails to provide any responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The propounding
party must show that the interrogatories were properly served, that the time to
respond expired, and no response has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)  The
responding party must serve responses within 30 days after the interrogatories
are served or according to an agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a),
2030.270.)  Failing to respond within
these time limits waives objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Defendant
has shown that she properly served Plaintiff Linares on July 29, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not serve responses by the
original August 30 deadline or any of Defendant’s subsequent deadline
extensions.  As of October 31, 2024,
Plaintiffs have not served responses.  
 
Accordingly,
the Court orders Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to
Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
SANCTIONS
The
Court may impose sanctions against any party who “unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel responses to interrogatories unless, it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant
requests $1,135.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their
counsel.  Defendant’s counsel, Michael J.
Lowell, charges an hourly rate of $250.00. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 7.)  Defendant’s
other counsel, Meredith J. Norris, Esq., charges an hourly rate of
$225.00.  (Lowell Dec., ¶ 6.)  The request includes the following: (1) Ms.
Norris spent 2 hours preparing this motion ($450.00); (2) Mr. Lowell
anticipates 2.5 hours preparing for and attending the motion hearing ($625.00);
and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.  (Lowell
Dec., ¶ 7.)  
 
The
Court finds the hourly rates are reasonable, but the time spent on this motion
is unreasonable.  This motion is
virtually identical to five separate discovery motions Defendant filed on
October 31, 2024, and the issues are not complex. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s request in the reduced amount of $535.00: (1) 1
hour preparing this motion; (2) 1 hour preparing for and attending the motion
hearing; and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.
 
 
ORDER
1.  Defendant Alejandra Gomez’s motion to compel
responses and responsive documents to Requests for Production, Set One is
granted.
 
2.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses and
responsive documents within twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
 
3.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel of record
are ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $535.00 to Defendant’s
counsel within twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
