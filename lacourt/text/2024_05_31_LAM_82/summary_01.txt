And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Stephen I. Goorvitch regarding a petition by Oscar Rojas, a former police officer with the City of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), to augment the administrative record in his case. The petitioner was terminated from his position in February 2023 after being found guilty of two counts of misconduct: making an inappropriate ethnic remark and loaning his phone to his ex-girlfriend. The petitioner seeks to include relevant documents from a prior administrative proceeding in which he faced seven counts of misconduct. The judge grants the petition and orders the inclusion of the "Rationale and Findings" from the prior proceeding in the administrative record. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer if the petitioner intends to seek inclusion of additional documents from the prior proceeding.
