And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Olivia Jeong's motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Justin Smith, filed a complaint against Defendants Alla Zoriko, Olivia Jeong, Joycelyn Yew, and Lew, alleging violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Unfair Competition Law, and fraud. The complaint was served on Defendant Lew, but the Judge found that the service was defective because the process server did not confirm that Defendant Jeong resided at the address where the summons was left. Since Defendant Jeong denies residing at the address and the process server's own account shows that she did not reside there, the Judge concludes that the court lacks jurisdiction over her due to defective service of summons. The motion to quash service of summons is therefore granted.
