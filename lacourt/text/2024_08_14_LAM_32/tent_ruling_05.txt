  order RE:
defendant puerto loreto llc’s demurrer
  to complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff Sirak
Minasyan filed this action against Defendants Puerto Loreto LLC (Puerto) and
California TD Specialists (Cal TD), asserting causes of action for (1)
declaratory relief, (2) cancellation of written instruments, (3) wrongful
foreclosure, (4) unfair business practices, and (5) injunctive relief. The
complaint alleges the following facts.
            On July 19, 2021, Plaintiff
purchased a residential real property in Glendale, California (the Property).
(Compl. ¶ 7.) At the time of purchase, Plaintiff obtained a $1.65 million loan
from Puerto, secured by a deed of trust against the Property. (Id., ¶
8.) The loan called for interest-only payments of $12,356.46 per month, with
all principal and interest due in one year. (Ibid.) Plaintiff made
monthly interest payments from July 29, 2021 to July 10, 2022, at which time
the remainder became due. (Id., ¶ 9.) Due to financial issues caused by
the Covid pandemic, Plaintiff requested an extension on the loan. (Ibid.)
Jim Metheson, who Plaintiff understood to be Puerto’s owner or authorized
representative, told Plaintiff that the loan could be extended if Plaintiff
paid the loan down by $200,000. (Ibid.) 
            On October 28, 2022, Puerto, through
its trustee Cal TD, recorded a Notice of Default and Election to Sell under the
deed of trust, identifying the amount due as $1.7 million. (Compl. ¶ 10.) On
February 2, 2023, Puerto, through Cal TD, recorded a Notice of Trustee sale,
though the sale did not take place. (Id. ¶ 11.) In March and May 2023,
Plaintiff wired $100,000 and $180,000 to Puerto. (Id., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff
believed that the default had been cured and that the foreclosure would be
rescinded based on his transmittal of more than $200,000. (Id., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff
requested Matheson to rescind the foreclosure but received no response. (Ibid.)
 
            On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed
for bankruptcy, which stayed foreclosure proceedings. (Compl. ¶ 14.) Although
the bankruptcy was dismissed on March 1, 2024, all foreclosure proceedings were
stayed until March 9, 2024. (Ibid.) However, on March 8, 2024, Puerto,
through Cal TD, recorded a Notice of Trustee Sale, which was a violation of the
bankruptcy stay. (Id., ¶ 15.)  
            On July 10, 2024, Puerto filed the
instant demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff filed his opposition on August 1,
2024. Puerto filed its reply on August 7, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Hubbard Decl.)
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendant requests judicial notice
of (i) records in the County Recorder (Ex. A, B, D, E) and (ii) a bankruptcy
court order (Ex. C). Defendant’s request is granted. (See Evid. Code, § 452(c),
(h); Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-65.)  
DISCUSSION
I.
Declaratory Relief
“Any person interested under a written
instrument . . . or under a contract . . . may, in cases of actual controversy
relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an
original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of
his or her rights and duties . . . arising under the instrument or contract.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) 
“Declaratory relief operates prospectively
to declare future rights, rather than to redress past wrongs.” (Canova v.
Trustees of Imperial Irrigation Dist. Employee Pension Plan (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 1487, 1497.) In the foreclosure context, if “the property has been
sold, there remain no prospective claims appropriate for declaratory relief.” (Mendoza
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 802, 820.) Moreover, the
declaratory relief would be “duplicative of [the] cause of action for wrongful
foreclosure.” (Ibid.) 
Here, the Property was sold on April 2,
2024. (Def.’s RJN, Ex. E.) Therefore, the declaratory relief claim is moot to
the extent Plaintiff alleges a controversy over the validity of Puerto’s
foreclosure of the Property. However, a dispute remains as to the validity of
the written instruments Notice of Default and Notice of Sale, as discussed
further below. Thus, Plaintiff may maintain a declaratory relief claim.  
The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first
cause of action. 
II.
Cancellation of Written Instruments
            “A written instrument, in respect to
which there is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may cause
serious injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable, may, upon his
application, be so adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or canceled.” (Civ.
Code, § 3412.) “To prevail on a claim to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must
prove (1) the instrument is void or voidable due to, for example, fraud, and
(2) there is a reasonable apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary
loss or the prejudicial alteration of one's position.” (Thompson v. Ioane
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1180, 1193-94.)  
            Plaintiff’s second cause of action
alleges that “The Notices of Default and Notice of Trustee's Sale should be
cancelled because they are of record but are legally invalid.” (Compl. ¶ 19.)
For support, Plaintiff incorporates the allegations in paragraph 16 of the
complaint. (Id., ¶ 18.) Paragraph 16 alleges that: Puerto was not a
licensed lender; Plaintiff cured the default by paying $280,000; and Puerto
defrauded Plaintiff by promising to rescind the foreclosure if Plaintiff paid
down the loan by $200,000. (Id., ¶ 16.) 
            Puerto argues that “Plaintiff has
failed to set forth any facts in support of his bare allegation suggesting that
the Notice of Default and/or the Notice of Sale are invalid.” (Dem. 8:10-11.)
However, the second cause of action incorporates prior allegations, which do
contain facts explaining why the Notices are invalid. In particular, the court
in Thompson, supra, 11 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1193-94 acknowledged that an
instrument may be void due to fraud, and Plaintiff alleges fraud, among other
reasons. The allegations also support an inference that the Notices will result
in pecuniary loss or prejudice to Plaintiff. (Ibid.) Therefore,
Plaintiff has adequately alleged a claim for cancellation. 
            The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
second cause of action. 
III.
Wrongful Foreclosure
            “The basic elements of a tort cause
of action for wrongful foreclosure track the elements of an equitable cause of
action to set aside a foreclosure sale. They are: ‘(1) the trustee or mortgagee
caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property
pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party
attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced
or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale,
the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was
excused from tendering.’” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394, 408, quoting Lona v. Citibank, N.A. (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 89, 104.) 
            Plaintiff’s wrongful foreclosure
claim again incorporates paragraph 16 of the complaint and also specifically
alleges that “Plaintiff relied on Defendant PUERTO LORETO'S representations to
Plaintiff in that Defendant PUERTO LORETO would rescind the foreclosure and
extend the loan if Plaintiff would pay down the loan by $200,000.00 which was
made fraudulently because Defendant PUERTO LORETEO did not record a rescission
of the foreclosure even though Plaintiff paid the loan down by $280,040.00.” (Id.,
¶¶ 20-22.) 
            For pleading purposes, these facts
sufficiently show that the sale was procured by “illegal, fraudulent, or
willfully oppressive” conduct and that Plaintiff was “prejudiced or harmed.”
(See Miles, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 408.) Puerto argues that the
foreclosure was proper as a matter of law because Plaintiff indisputably
defaulted on the loan. However, Plaintiff alleges that he cured the default by
paying $280,000 based on Puerto’s representations. This is a factual matter
which cannot be resolved on a demurrer. 
            The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
third cause of action. 
IV.
Unfair Competition 
            Business and Professions Code
section 17200 prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or
practices. Each of the three prongs is an independent basis for relief. (Smith
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700,
718.) Unlawful conduct is defined as any practice forbidden by law. (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383.) UCL actions
alleging unlawful conduct “borrow” from other statutes or common law causes of
action outside Section 17200. (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012)
202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.)
            As discussed above, Plaintiff has
adequately pled a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure. “[W]rongful
foreclosure is a tort” (Miles, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 409), which
would make it “unlawful” within the meaning of the UCL. Thus, Plaintiff has
pled a UCL claim.
            The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
fourth cause of action.
V.
Injunctive Relief
            “[I]njunctive relief lies only to
prevent threatened injury and has no application to wrongs that have been
completed.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal
Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1266.)   
            Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action
seeks to enjoin Defendants from foreclosing on the Property. (Compl. ¶ 29.)
However, as discussed above, the foreclosure has already occurred. Therefore,
there is nothing to enjoin. 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the fifth cause of action.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Puerto Loreto LLC’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the fifth cause of action without leave to amend
and OVERRULED in all other respects.
