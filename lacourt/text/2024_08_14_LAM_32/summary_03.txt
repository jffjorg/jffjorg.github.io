And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV18233, which involves an employment action brought by Lawrence "Leon" Gibbs Avramidis against Ildico Inc. and Jean "John" Simonian. The defendant, Ildico Inc., has filed a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests, and the judge has granted this motion.

The discovery requests at issue are RFP Nos. 84, 100, and 104, which seek documents related to the plaintiff's employment and damages. The plaintiff had objected to these requests as overbroad, burdensome, and irrelevant, but the judge finds that the defendant has established good cause for the requested documents.

The judge notes that the parties have narrowed their contentions to three discovery requests after the plaintiff served supplemental responses to the remaining requests at issue. The court addresses the three outstanding requests herein.

The judge finds that the defendant has satisfied the meet and confer requirement by agreeing to narrow the requests during meet and confer. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses, subject to the limitations agreed upon by the defendant. The plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses within 15 days of this order.
