  Hearing Date:  August 14, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant ildico inc.’s motion to compel
  further responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff
Lawrence “Leon” Gibbs Avramidis filed this employment action against Defendants
Ildico Inc. and Jean “John” Simonian. 
            On July 5, 2024, Defendant Ildico
filed the instant motion to compel further responses to discovery. Plaintiff
filed his opposition on August 1, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on August 7,
2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) A moving party must demonstrate good cause to compel further
responses to inspection demands. (Id., § 2031.310(b)(1).)  
 
 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Tate Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            As an initial matter, the parties
have narrowed their contentions to three discovery requests after Plaintiff
served supplemental responses to the remaining requests at issue. The Court
addresses the three outstanding requests herein. 
            RFP No. 84 seeks “Any and all
DOCUMENTS that RELATE TO YOUR alleged employment with DEFENDANTS.” RFP No.
100 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS that RELATE TO any and all employment by
YOU with any employer or self-employment subsequent to YOUR alleged employment
with DEFENDANTS.” RFP No. 104 seeks “All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO payments
made to YOU or on YOUR behalf to any PERSON by any insurance company, public
entity, or any other source or PERSON.”  

Plaintiff objected to the requests as
overbroad, burdensome, irrelevant, invading privacy, seeking privileged
information, and not reasonably particularized. However, during meet and
confer, Defendant agreed to narrow the requests in the following manner: (i)
the term “relate to” is changed to “support;” and (ii) Defendant only seeks
documents regarding Plaintiff’s claims for lost wages, emotional distress
damages, and Plaintiff’s mitigation of damages. (Tate Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. D, E.) 
Defendant has established good cause for
the requested documents, as they pertain to Plaintiff’s employment and damages,
matters directly placed at issue by Plaintiff’s own allegations. The
information sought is related to the subject matter or reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) The narrow
scope of the requests as established in meet and confer renders Plaintiff’s
overbreadth and burden objections without merit. Plaintiff does not explain how
the requests implicate any privilege or invade any privacy interest. Therefore,
further responses are warranted.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Ildico Inc.’s motion to
compel further responses is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 84, 100, and 104, subject to
the limitations agreed upon by Defendant. Plaintiff shall provide further
responses within 15 days of this order. Sanctions are denied.
