     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant olivia jeong’s motion to quash
  service of summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff
Justin Smith filed this action against Defendants Alla Zorikova, Olivia Jeong,
and Joycelyn Yew. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) violation of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), (2) violation of the Unfair Competition
Law (UCL), and (3) fraud. 
            Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
run an illegal dog breeding operation and operate out of Defendant Lew’s home
in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely advertise their dogs
as healthy, trained, and top quality. Plaintiff allegedly purchased a puppy
from Defendants that turned out to be sick, dirty, and not properly socialized.
Plaintiff allegedly contacted Defendant Zorikova for a refund, and Defendant
Zorkova allegedly refused, instead instructing Plaintiff to sell the dog to
another buyer himself. 
            On July 18, 2024, Defendant Jeong
filed the instant motion to quash based on defective service of the summons and
complaint. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            “A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) Alternatively, a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents
thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the
same location. (Id., § 415.20.)
According to a proof of service filed June
13, 2024, a registered process server effectuated substitute service on
Defendant Lew at 3:22pm on February 29, 2024 by serving a John Doe standing
outside the front door. According to the proof of service, John Doe confirmed
that the defendants (other than Olivia Jeong) resided at the address but were
unavailable at the moment. John Doe then allegedly refused to accept the
summons and complaint, whereafter the server left the papers at the front door.

Defendant Jeong denies residing at the
address, and the process server’s own account shows that he was informed
Defendant Jeong did not reside at the address. Plaintiff cannot effectuate
substitute service at an address where Defendant does not reside. Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion and effectively concedes the service defect. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Jeong’s motion to quash
service of summons is GRANTED.
