And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted, in part, the motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents, set two, to defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. The plaintiff seeks to investigate how early VW/Audi knew about the camera defect in their vehicle. The court finds good cause for the discovery sought, as the requests are relevant to showing when Audi first had reason to know about the defect. However, the court agrees with the defendant that the requests for identifying information of third parties are improper and disagrees with the plaintiff's reliance on Pioneer Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360. The court orders the requested materials to be produced with identifying information redacted.
