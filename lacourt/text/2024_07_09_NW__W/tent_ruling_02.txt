FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff Harges
Family Partnership LP filed a complaint against Defendants Pasadena Partners LP
and Landmark Properties for breach of contract. Defendant Pasadena Partners LP entered
into a written contract with Plaintiff Harges Family Partnership for the
purchase of real property located at 7455 Hazeltine Avenue. Defendant Landmark
Properties also entered into two written contracts with Plaintiff Harges for
the purchase of real property located at 16765 Sherman Way and 13441 Victory
Boulevard. Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached the agreements by failing to
make the requisite deposits with an escrow company and breached the contracts
by failed to go forward with the transactions. 
 
This action is related to 23VECV01917, Harges
Family Partnership LP v. Chartwell Escrow, Inc. and 23VECP00458, Harges
Family Partnership, LP, et al. v. Landmark Global Management, et al.

TENTATIVE
RULING: 
 
Counsel contends there has been an irreparable breakdown of the
working relationship between counsel and client which has made it unreasonably
difficult to continue representing the client. Counsel further contends little,
if any, prejudice would result for Plaintiff if this motion is granted because
no trial date has been set and no discovery has been commenced by the parties. 
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed Plaintiff’s last known address
by doing a physical viewing of the office and also served by email.   
 
Trial is not set. There is a demurrer to the original complaint
set for August 21, 2024.  
 
Accordingly, the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.  Counsel is to warn Plaintiff that they can
only appear through counsel because it is a partnership, and legal entities
cannot proceed in pro per.
