BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. On September
7, 2023, Plaintiff Gurgen Jivarryan filed a complaint against Defendants
Sherman Oaks-A, Inc. and Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. for Violation of
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civ. Code §1790, et seq. Plaintiff  leased from Dealer a new 2022 Audi A6.
Plaintiff alleges the vehicle has a manufacturing defect which caused the
Vehicle’s cameras to malfunction. Dealer has been unable to repair the defect
for more than 30 days, in violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(b).
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff Gurgen Jivarryan’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, to Defendant
Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. is 
GRANTED, IN
PART.
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Gurgen Jivarryan moves this court for an order
compelling Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. 
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections. (CCP § 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel further
production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the material
sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also
CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1).)
 
Plaintiff argues in order to
investigate how early VW/Audi knew there was a widespread problem with the
camera systems on the model of Plaintiff’s vehicle, Plaintiff served their
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, which included the four discovery
requests at issue (RPD Nos. 24-27). Plaintiff contends the RPDs at issue are
narrowly-tailored to VW/Audi’s knowledge of the camera defect discussed in
Audi’s two TSBs 90 23 55 2055188/7 and 90 23 13 2069670/1. They seek VW/Audi’s
research and customer reports which led to TSBs 90 23 55 2055188/7 and 90 23 13
2069670/1. 
 
The court finds good cause for the
discovery sought. These requests are relevant in showing if and when Audi first
had reason to know that the model of vehicle sold to Plaintiff had a widespread
problem with its camera system. However, the court finds RPD Nos. 24 and 25
improperly seek identifying formation of third persons. Plaintiff cites Pioneer
Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, for the
position there is no “right” to third-party privacy except for financial
information provided by customers. The court disagrees. Pinoeer involved
contact information of potential class members. This is not a representative
action. Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause for identifying information
when customer complaints (without identifying information) are sufficient to
show willful or fraudulent conduct.  The
requested materials are to be produced but with identifying information
redacted (name, phone number and address). 

 
Accordingly, Gurgen Jivarryan’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, to Defendant
Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. is GRANTED, IN PART.
