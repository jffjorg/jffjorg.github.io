And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant is OVERRULED. The demurrer argued that the complaint is uncertain and that the contract is unsigned. The judge rejected these arguments, finding that the contract is sufficiently clear and that the electronic signature is sufficient to constitute an agreement. The judge also found that the second cause of action, for breach of a written contract, is sufficient despite the contract being unsigned. The judge noted that the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) allows for electronic signatures and that the key is that the signature must be sufficiently formalized to assure that the party signing agreed to use the signature to formalize the agreement. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the action is time-barred, finding that the complaint does not state when the services were rendered, when the bills were tendered, or when the refusal to pay would have matured. The judge ordered the defendant to answer the complaint within 30 days.
