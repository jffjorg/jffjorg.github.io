And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The defendant propounded a series of requests for production to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff has not responded to requests 1-51. The supplemental responses also failed to address these requests. The judge finds that the requests appear proper and that the defendant has met its burden of justification. The judge orders the plaintiff to respond to requests 1-51 within 30 days, and to provide verified responses without objection other than privilege. The plaintiff must also provide the documents and any privilege log at the same time. The judge notes that the plaintiff's response to request 52 is inadequate and orders the plaintiff to provide more information. The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and its counsel in the amount of $1320, payable within 30 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel has acted without substantial justification and orders the plaintiff and its counsel to re-configure their approach to this matter.
