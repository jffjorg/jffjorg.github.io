And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing until February 23, 2024, and has ordered the defendants to file supplemental papers making a proper showing for sealing the documents by February 2, 2024. The Judge is concerned that if the documents are made public, it will be difficult to retract the information. The defendants have not made a sufficient showing for sealing, and the Judge requires a proper showing, including a justification and explanation, to support their request. The Judge cites McGuan v. Endovascular Techs., Inc. (2010) and California statute, and emphasizes the importance of protecting the public's interest in public records.
