  Case Number:  20SMCV01766    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  I The motion is CONTINUED. 
The proper showing has not been made. 
A record is presumed public unless confidentiality is either required by
statute or a proper showing is made that there exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the public’s interest and that will be impaired absent sealing,
and further that the sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means
of protecting the overriding interest exist. 
(McGuan v. Endovascular Techs., Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th
974.)  Defendants have not even attempted
such a showing in a meaningful way.  They
assert that the documents to be sealed contain private financial information,
trade secrets, business negotiations and information about third parties and
that if the information becomes public their ability to compete would be
impaired.  The proof of that comes from
litigation counsel’s declaration.  The
court has no reason to believe that litigation counsel has any basis to make
such a declaration and she proffers no explanation or justification.  That is simply not a sufficient showing.  
That said, the court is concerned about an outright denial
because once public, it is hard to unring the bell.  So if the defense wants to file things under
seal, it must do it right.  The court
will CONTINUE the hearing for three weeks. 
The moving parties may file supplemental papers making the proper
showing no later than Friday, February 2, 2024. 
Oppositions and replies per code. 
The hearing will be held on February 23, 2024 at 9:00 am.
