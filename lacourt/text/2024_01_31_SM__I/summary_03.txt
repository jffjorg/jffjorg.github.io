And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff's claim of exemption has been denied, but the garnishment will be limited to $800/month. The Court continued the matter to allow the Defendant to explain the exemption, but since nothing was filed, the Court must rule in favor of Zions Bank. The Bank had previously indicated that it would accept garnishment of $800/month, and the Court will limit the garnishment to that amount. The Plaintiff is instructed to prepare the order and submit it within 10 court days, and to send the proposed order to the Defendant within 5 court days.
