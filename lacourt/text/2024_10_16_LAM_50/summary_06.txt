And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel discovery of attorney work product filed by Duane Morris and Roten. The moving parties argue that the requested testimony is critical to the defense, but the court notes that this argument is not made. The opposition, filed by ISCM, Zelener, and Aronson, argues that the subpoenas are defective and that the requested testimony is not necessary. The court notes that ISCM refused to produce Zelener and Aronson for deposition and that the opposition does not clearly state which parties are filing the opposition. The court construes the opposition as filed by the opposing parties (ISCM, Zelener, and Aronson). The court does not address the opposing party's argument that the subpoena to Zelener is defective on its face. The court will need to determine whether the requested discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery or result in an injustice.
