[1]The Court also
notes that the Moving Defendants do not move to strike the third and eighth
causes of action of the SAC. The Huezo Defendants joined in the Moving
Defendants’ motion and did not file any separate motion to strike. Rather, the
Huezo Defendants’ notice provides that the Huezo Defendants “hereby join in
Defendants DONALD H. JONES; SALLY FORSTER JONES; DSJ THAYER EXCHANGES, LLC; SFJ
THAYER LLC; DAJO THAYER EXCHANGES, LLC; AND CAPRI PROPERTIES’ Notice of Motion
and Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint which is scheduled
for October 16, 2024…” (Notice at pp. 1:26-2:1.) On this additional ground, the
Court denies the Huezo Defendants’ request to strike the third and eighth
causes of action of the SAC.
