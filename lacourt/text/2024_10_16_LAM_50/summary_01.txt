(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b))
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the moving defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC) due to the plaintiff's failure to file the amended complaint by the deadline specified in the court's April 26, 2024 order. The plaintiff had 20 days to file the amended complaint following the demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC), but the SAC was filed after the deadline. The court has also granted the huezo defendants' joinder in the moving defendants' motion to strike the SAC. The court has denied the moving defendants' motion to strike the first and ninth causes of action of the SAC as moot, as the SAC has been struck in its entirety.
