[1]On April 17, 2024, the
moving parties filed an IDC Statement in advance of the April 24, 2024 IDC
providing, inter alia, that “Defendants have served subpoenas for the
depositions of Howard Zelener and Robert Aronson—Plaintiff’s counsel of
record—but Plaintiff has refused to produce either for deposition.” 
 


[2]The Court notes that the opposition filed on October
3, 2024 does not appear to clearly state which parties are filing the
opposition. However, the conclusion section of the opposition provides, inter
alia, that “ISCM, Zelener and Aronson respectfully request that this Court
deny Duane Morris’ motion to compel…” (Opp’n at p. 18:20-21.) Thus, the Court
construes the opposition as filed by the Opposing Parties (ISCM and third-parties
Howard Zelener and Robert Aronson). 


[3]The Court notes that
the Moving Parties do not appear to show what Interrogatory No. 9 seeks. Thus,
it is unclear what exactly ISCM’s second amended supplemental response to
Interrogatory No. 9 is responding to.  


[4]As discussed, the instant motion is brought by both
Roten and Duane Morris. However, the Moving Parties to not appear to argue that
the requested testimony is critical to Roten’s defense. 


[5]In addition, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2018.030, subdivision (b), “[t]he work product of an attorney, other than a writing described
in subdivision (a), is not discoverable unless the court determines that denial
of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing
that party’s claim or defense or will result in an injustice.”
 


[6]In light of the foregoing, the Court need not and does
not address the Opposing Parties’ remaining argument that “the Subpoena to
Zelener is defective on its face.” (Opp’n at p. 17:7.)
