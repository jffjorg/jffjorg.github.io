[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Shaun J. Bauman, Esq.           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
The court considered
the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Shaun J. Bauman (“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel of record for plaintiff Bryan Eduardo Marroquin (“Plaintiff”) in this
action.
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
The court finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has not provided Plaintiff
with sufficient notice of this motion. 
“[A]ll
moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days
before the hearing.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1005, subd. (b).)¿ “Any period of
notice . . . which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days .
. . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B).) 
Plaintiff’s Counsel served Plaintiff with the pending motion by mail and
email on June 10, 2024.  (MC-052, ¶ 3,
subd. (2); June 10, 2024 Proof of Service, pp. 2-3.)  However, for a hearing date of July 3, 2024,
Plaintiff’s Counsel was required to serve Plaintiff with this motion by at
least June 6, 2024 (16 court days + 2 court days for electronic service).[1]  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b), 1010.6,
subd. (a)(3)(B).)  Thus, Plaintiff’s
Counsel, in serving Plaintiff with this motion on June 10, 2024, did not
provide Plaintiff with sufficient notice of the hearing on this motion.  (Ibid.) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion, without
prejudice to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s filing a new motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff that provides Plaintiff with sufficient notice. 
ORDER
            The court denies Shaun J. Bauman,
Esq.’s motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Bryan Eduardo Marroquin,
without prejudice to Shaun J. Bauman, Esq.’s filing a new motion to be relieved
as counsel that provides the client with sufficient statutory notice.
            The court orders Shaun J. Bauman,
Esq., to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 3, 2024
