[1] On
May 30, 2024, the court issued an order (1) noting that plaintiff Matthew
Arnold filed untimely opposition papers on May 29, 2024, and (2) exercising its
discretion to continue the hearing on this motion so that (i) moving defendant Michelangelo
Tatone had an opportunity to file substantive reply papers, and (ii) the court
had an opportunity to consider both the opposition and reply papers.  (May 30, 2024 Order, pp. 1:25-26, 1:27-2:2.) 


[2]
Although Plaintiff asserts that “[a] true and correct copy of the minute order
denying that motion is attached hereto as Exhibit 5[,]” the June 16, 2023
minute order attached as Exhibit 5 does not deny that motion, and instead
granted Zacky’s ex parte application for an order advancing its motion for
relief.  (Arnold Decl., p. 13:23-24
