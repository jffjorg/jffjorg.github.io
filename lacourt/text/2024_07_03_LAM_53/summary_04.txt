And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion that was previously filed. The plaintiff, Matthew Arnold, filed opposition papers to the motion, but did so after the deadline. As a result, the court exercised its discretion to continue the hearing on the motion to allow the defendant, Michelangelo Tatone, to file substantive reply papers. The court also noted that a previous minute order, dated June 16, 2023, did not deny the motion, as the plaintiff claimed, but instead granted an ex parte application by Zacky to advance a motion for relief.
