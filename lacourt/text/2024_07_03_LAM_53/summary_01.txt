And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion of Shaun J. Bauman, Esq. (Plaintiff's Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Bryan Eduardo Marroquin. The court finds that Plaintiff's Counsel did not provide sufficient notice of the motion to the plaintiff, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 1005, subdivision (b). Specifically, Plaintiff's Counsel served the plaintiff with the motion by mail and email on June 10, 2024, but was required to serve the motion by at least June 6, 2024. The court therefore denies the motion without prejudice to Plaintiff's Counsel's filing a new motion that provides the client with sufficient statutory notice. The court orders Plaintiff's Counsel to give notice of this ruling.
