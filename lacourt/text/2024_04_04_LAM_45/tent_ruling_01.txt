Background
            Plaintiff
Aldibert Esteban, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed
this action on December 11, 2020. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)
on February 26, 2021 against defendant American Airlines, Inc., alleging causes
of action for (1) Violation of the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (Labor
Code §§ 2698, et seq.); and (2) Violation of California’s Unfair
Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.). This action
involves wage-and-hour claims alleging Defendant failing to pay all hours worked,
failing to provide full meal and rest breaks, failing to provide accurate itemized
wage statements, failing to provide all wages due within time periods specified
in Labor Code § 204, and failing to timely pay all wages due to former
aggrieved employees at termination of employment. (See FAC, ¶¶ 12-22, 26.)
            The parties have agreed on a $24 million
settlement of this class and PAGA action. The gross settlement value is
inclusive of settlement payments to participating Settling Class Members, PAGA
Group Members, the LWDA, all attorneys’ fees and costs, the Class Representatives’
Enhancement Awards to Plaintiffs for their services as class representatives,
and claims administration as provided by this settlement.
On October 27,
2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the parties’ settlement. On November
9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint which combines plaintiffs and claims from other
filed cases and adds a separate Plaintiff Maisha Sykes.
            On
January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for final approval of class action settlement and provisional certification
of class. No opposition was received.
 
Legal
Standard
            Approval of class
actions settlements occurs in two steps: First, the court preliminarily
approves the settlement and the class members are notified as directed by the
court. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 3.769(c)-(g); Cellphone Termination Fee Cases (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.)
Second, the court conducts a final approval hearing to inquire into the
fairness of the proposed settlement. (Id.)
            “If the court has certified the
action as a class action, notice of the final approval hearing must be given to
the class members in the manner specified by the court. The notice must contain
an explanation of the proposed settlement and procedures for class members to
follow in filing written objections to it and in arranging to appear at the
settlement hearing and state any objections to the proposed settlement.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.769(f).)
            “ ‘The trial court has broad
discretion to determine whether the settlement is fair.’ ” (Cellphone Termination Fee Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at 1117.) “ ‘[A]
presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the settlement is reached through
arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small. [Citation.]’ ”
(Id. at 1118, quoting Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.)
Once the
presumption of fairness has been established, the court still “bears the
responsibility to ensure that the recovery represents a reasonable compromise,
given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released, discounted
by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those
claims by pursuing the litigation. ‘The court has a fiduciary responsibility as
guardians of the rights of the absentee class members when deciding whether to approve
a settlement agreement.’ [Citation.]” (Kullar
v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 129.)
“Due regard should be given to what is
otherwise a private consensual agreement between the parties. The inquiry ‘must
be limited to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the
agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between,
the negotiating parties, and that the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair,
reasonable and adequate to all concerned.’ [Citation.] ‘Ultimately, the [trial]
court's determination is nothing more than “an amalgam of delicate balancing,
gross approximations and rough justice.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Dunk v. Ford
Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1801.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs Aldibert
Esteban, Maisha Sykes, Deborah Berens, and Linda Hinkley move for final approval of class action settlement and provisional
certification of class.
 
1.     Notice to Class
Members of Final Approval Hearing
Plaintiffs establish that they have provided notice to class members of the final
approval hearing in the manner specified by the court, in accordance with Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.769(f). (See Olivares
Decl., attached as Exh. 3 to Granberry Decl.)
 
2.     Notice to LWDA
The court notes that Plaintiffs establish that they have notified the
California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) of this motion on January
14, 2024. (Granberry Decl., ¶3, Exh. 2.) 
 
3.     Presumption of
Fairness
The Court preliminarily found in its Order on October 27, 2023, that the
presumption of fairness should be applied. No facts have come to the Court’s
attention that would alter that preliminary conclusion. Accordingly, the
settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness as set forth in the
preliminary approval order.
 
4.     Is the
Settlement Fair, Adequate, and Reasonable?
The settlement was preliminarily found to be fair, adequate and
reasonable.  Notice has now been given to
the Class and the LWDA.  
  Reaction of the class members
to the proposed settlement. 
Number of class members: 4,842 (Olivares Decl., ¶5.)         
Number of notice packets mailed: 4,842 (Id. at ¶7.)
Number of undeliverable notices: 38 (Olivares Supp.
Decl., ¶4.) 
Number of opt-outs: 3 (Id. at ¶6.)                   
Number of objections: 2 (Id. at ¶8.)
Number of participating class members: 4,839 (Id. at ¶9.)
Average individual payment: $2,935.01 (Id. at ¶10.)
Highest estimated payment: $5,659.94 (Ibid.)
As noted above, there were two objectors to the settlement. (Granberry
Decl., ¶42, Exhs. 14-15.) However, they were not submitted properly and also
did not contain all required information. (Ibid.) Thus, the objections
are procedurally invalid. Further, both objectors argue that individual settlement
payments should be based on hours worked rather than workweeks. (Ibid.)
As counsel points out, workweeks is widely considered the standard in wage and
hour litigation valuation. Counsel argues that it is equitable because workweeks
accurately captures how many possible violations a Defendant could have
committed and how many violations an individual class member may have suffered
during the time period covered by the settlement based on the number of weeks
an individual actually worked without considering periods an individual did not
work, for example, during vacations, leaves of absence, etc., and therefore
could not have suffered wage and hour violations. (Id. at ¶44.) Further,
counsel argues that in this particular case hours worked has minimal to no
bearing on factual theories underlying the alleged claims. (Id. at ¶45.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court overrules the objections.
There were also two late objection submissions by Marcelle Fowers and Stacy
Bankhead. (Oliveras Second Supp. Decl., Exhs. A-B.) Both appear to be
plaintiffs in the Alameda county case and are now proceeding in pro per and
there has been no class certification or appointment of class representation. (Supp.
Brief at pp. 7-8.) Both state that they did not receive their “letter” which
seemingly means they did not receive notice. However, Counsel provides evidence
of proper notice to both. (Id. at p. 7.) As to the merits of the
objections, Fowers does not object on any actual basis, and Bankhead’s only
objection is as to SB41. Counsel points out that SB41 was considered in the
evaluation of the case and in reaching the settlement, which was described in
their Kullar analysis in Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval filed with
the Court on August 21, 2023. (Id. at p. 8.) Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds the objections procedurally improper and substantively without merit.
Thus, they are overruled.
The Court finds that the notice was given as directed and conforms to due
process requirements.  Given the
reactions of the Class Members and the LWDA to the proposed settlement and for
the reasons set for in the Preliminary Approval order, the settlement is found
to be fair, adequate, and reasonable.
 
5.     Attorneys’ Fees
and Costs
Class Counsel requests $8,400,000 (35%) in attorney fees and $60,000 in litigation costs. (See Notice of Motion at
p. 3.) The Settlement provides for attorney's fees up to $8,400,000 and costs up
to $60,000. The class was provided notice of the requested awards, and none
objected on this basis. 
“Courts recognize two methods for calculating attorney fees in civil
class actions: the lodestar/multiplier method and the percentage of recovery
method.”  (Wershba at 254.)  Here, class counsel requests attorney fees using
the percentage method with lodestar crosscheck. (Motion ISO Final Approval at pp.
16-23.) In common fund cases, the Court may employ a percentage of the benefit
method, as cross-checked against the lodestar. (Laffitte v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) 
            Counsel provides the
following lodestar information:

$1,382,373



(Motion ISO
Final Approval at p. 20.) 
Counsel’s lodestar is approximately $1,382,373 which would require a
multiplier of 6.07 to yield the requested fee amount. As counsel requests attorney’s
fees in the amount of 35% of the settlement, the Court finds that the lodestar
cross-check does not support this request in light of the higher percentage
requested. (See In re Consumer Privacy
Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn. 13 [“Empirical studies show
that, regardless whether the percentage method or the lodestar method is used,
fee awards in class actions average around one-third of the recovery.”].)  The Court will award attorney fees in the
amount of $8,000,000
which is one-third of the total
settlement. 
Further, Class Counsel is requesting $60,000 in costs and represents that
they incurred more than this amount but are only requesting the amount that was
noticed to the Class. (Motion ISO Final Approval at p. 23, fn. 7.)  The costs in this case include, but are not
limited to, mediation fees ($16,166.67), notice to class members ($5,496), filing
fees ($2,579.80), expert fees ($5,000), travel ($5,837.46), and court reporter
fees ($5,000). (Id. at p. 23; Bainer Decl., ¶2, attached as Exhibit 3 to
Granberry Supp. Decl.) The costs seem reasonable and necessary to litigation. 
 
6.     Incentive
Award/Enhancement Fee to Named Plaintiffs
The Settlement Agreement provides for up to $105,000
($30,000 for Plaintiffs Esteban, Berens, and Hinkley, and $15,000 for Plaintiff
Sykes) for an incentive award to the class representative.  
The Court finds these amounts grossly high even in light
of the efforts and time expended by named Plaintiffs and the amount of the
settlement, especially considering the amount each class member will receive from
the settlement. Plaintiffs’ supplemental declarations do not show that these
representatives contributions went beyond what the average representative in most
class actions contribute. Accordingly, the Court awards $7,500
to Plaintiffs Esteban, Berens, and Hinkley, and $5,000 to Sykes. 
 
7.     Costs of Claims
Administration
The claims administrator requests $32,500 for the costs of administering the settlement. (Olivares Supp.
Decl., ¶13.) This is equal to the maximum amount estimated of which was disclosed
in the notice to class members, to which there were no objections. Based on all
the work performed by the Claims Administrator, the recommendation is to award
costs in the requested amount. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion
for final approval of class action settlement. Counsel is awarded $8,000,000 in
fees and $60,000 in costs. The administrator is awarded $32,500 for
administration costs. Plaintiffs Esteban, Berens, and Hinkley are awarded
$7,500, and Sykes is awarded $5,000, as incentive awards.
 
It is so
ordered.
