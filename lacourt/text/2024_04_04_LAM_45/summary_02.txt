And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Rolf Treu issued a tentative ruling on April 4, 2024, granting the motions of Counsel Timothy J. Kodani and William E. Gilg to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Richard G. Rubio. The court found that the irreconcilable differences between the attorney and client, as well as the client's failure to communicate with the attorney, were sufficient grounds for withdrawal. The court also noted that the trial is still several months away, and therefore, Counsel's withdrawal will not prejudice the Plaintiff.
