And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendants on September 4, 2012, in the amount of $25,145.57, with interest of $313.29 and costs of $435. The plaintiff applied for renewal of the judgment on September 6, 2022, and the renewed judgment was entered on that date. The plaintiff's counsel made a clerical error in including the same amount of interest from 10 years ago, which is correctable under CCP §473(d). The correct amount of interest is $28,469.44, and the motion to amend judgment is granted. The interest amount of $313.29 is struck from the judgment, and the corrected amount shall be interlined. A new notice of renewal will issue with the corrected application for renewal of judgment attached.
