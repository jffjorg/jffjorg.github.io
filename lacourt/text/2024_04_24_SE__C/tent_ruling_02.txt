Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of April 19, 2024. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Defendants
Nissan North America, Inc., and Wish Automotive III, Inc. dba Nissan of
Alhambra (“Nissan of Alhambra”) move to set aside default entered against Nissan
of Alhambra on April 26, 2023.  The
motion is made pursuant to CCP § 473(b) on the grounds of attorney
fault, neglect, mistake, and inadvertence. 

 
Discussion
 
The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken. (CCP § 473, subd. (b).)  
 
The
purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose
their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the
motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such
situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
Here, default was entered against Nissan of
Alhambra on April 26, 2023.  The motion
was filed on October 19, 2023.  The
motion is timely.  
 
Counsel for
moving party states that he was unaware that he had not filed a responsive
pleading. (Decl. Abramova, ¶ 3.) 
 
Based upon
this, the Court is inclined to set aside default.  However, Nissan of Alhambra has not attached
a responsive pleading to the motion.  “Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.”
(CCP § 473, subd. (b).)  Therefore, the motion
to set aside default is CONTINUED to May 8, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept.
SE-C.  Defendant is ORDERED to file a
responsive pleading on or before May 3, 2024.
