And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals' motion to compel arbitration in this slip-and-fall case. The plaintiff, Richard Gallegos, allegedly slipped and fell inside Kaiser Permanente Downey Medical Center on May 31, 2023, while enrolled in the Senior Advantage Medicare Medi-Cal Plan South. The defendant moves to compel arbitration based on the plan's agreement, which covers the controversy or controversies in the dispute. The court finds that the defendant met its burden of proving the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate. The motion is unopposed, so the court grants the motion to compel arbitration. The action is stayed pending the arbitration.
