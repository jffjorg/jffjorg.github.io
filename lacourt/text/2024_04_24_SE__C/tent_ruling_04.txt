TENTATIVE RULING
 
Claimant Mindi
Davidson’s request for disbursement of surplus funds is CONTINUED.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of April 19, 2024. 
 
Claimant Mindi Davidson claims one-half of the
surplus funds of $128,377.17 after the trustee’s sale of the real property
known as 11957 Cyclops Street, Norwalk, California 90650 that occurred on June
21, 2022. 
Discussion 
Civ.
Code § 2924k, subdivision (a)(4) permits funds to be disbursed to a successor
in interest, and Claimant states that she is the successor in interest to Richard
Davidson and Earlyne Davidson, joint tenants to the deed of trust containing
the real property known as 11957 Cyclops Street, Norwalk, California 90650. 
 
However,
just stating that one is a successor in interest to a decedent is insufficient.
 Code of Civil Procedure § 377.32 governs
the right of a “person . . . to continue a pending action or proceeding as [a]
decedent’s successor in interest.”  Under
this section, a successor in interest must file a declaration stating all of
the following:  
 
(1) The decedent's
name. 
 
(2) The date and place
of the decedent's death. 
 
(3) “No proceeding is
now pending in California for administration of the decedent's estate.” 
 
(4) If the decedent's
estate was administered, a copy of the final order showing the distribution of
the decedent's cause of action to the successor in interest. 
 
(5) Either of the
following, as appropriate, with facts in support thereof: 
 
(A) “The affiant or
declarant is the decedent's successor in interest (as defined in Section 377.11
of the California Code of Civil Procedure) and succeeds to the decedent's
interest in the action or proceeding.” 
 
(B) “The affiant or
declarant is authorized to act on behalf of the decedent's successor in
interest (as defined in Section 377.11 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure) with respect to the decedent's interest in the action or
proceeding.” 
 
(6) “No other person
has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted
for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding.” 
 
(7) “The affiant or
declarant affirms or declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.”  
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.32(a).) Simultaneously with the foregoing, a claimant must
also file a declaration pursuant to Prob. Code § 13101 which includes all of
the following:  
 
(1) The decedent's
name. 
 
(2) The date and place
of the decedent's death. 
 
(3) “At least 40 days
have elapsed since the death of the decedent, as shown in a certified copy of
the decedent's death certificate attached to this affidavit or declaration.” 
 
(4) Either of the
following, as appropriate: 
 
(A) “No proceeding is
now being or has been conducted in California for administration of the
decedent's estate.” 
 
(B) “The decedent's personal
representative has consented in writing to the payment, transfer, or delivery
to the affiant or declarant of the property described in the affidavit or
declaration.” 
 
(5) “The current gross
fair market value of the decedent's real and personal property in California,
excluding the property described in Section 13050 of the California Probate
Code, does not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).” 
 
(6) A description of
the property of the decedent that is to be paid, transferred, or delivered to
the affiant or declarant. 
 
(7) The name of the
successor of the decedent (as defined in Section 13006 of the California
Probate Code) to the described property. 
 
(8) Either of the
following, as appropriate: 
 
(A) “The affiant or
declarant is the successor of the decedent (as defined in Section 13006 of the
California Probate Code) to the decedent's interest in the described property.” 
 
(B) “The affiant or
declarant is authorized under Section 13051 of the California Probate Code to
act on behalf of the successor of the decedent (as defined in Section 13006 of
the California Probate Code) with respect to the decedent's interest in the described
property.” 
 
(9) “No other person
has a superior right to the interest of the decedent in the described
property.” 
 
(10) “The affiant or
declarant requests that the described property be paid, delivered, or
transferred to the affiant or declarant.” 
 
(11) “The affiant or
declarant affirms or declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.” 
 
(See
Prob. Code § 13101, subd. (a); see also Prob. Code § 13107.5 [requiring the
foregoing whenever a party seeks to be substituted into a suit pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.30].)  
 
Here,
claimant omits the following: (1) “The current gross
fair market value of the decedent's real and personal property in California,
excluding the property described in Section 13050 of the California Probate
Code, does not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000);” (2) A description of the
property of the decedent that is to be paid, transferred, or delivered to the
affiant or declarant. In addition, Claimant does not
declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California. 
 
Based on the above, the Court CONTINUES the motion to May
8, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. Claimant is to supply the missing
information on or before May 3, 2024.
