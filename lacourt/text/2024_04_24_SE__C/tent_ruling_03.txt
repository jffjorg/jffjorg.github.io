TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff
Scott Seidman’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) are GRANTED. Monetary
sanctions are DENIED. Defendant J and C House of Love, Inc. is
ordered to serve responses without objections within 20 days. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motions are unopposed as of April 19, 2024. 
 
 
This is a wrongful death and elder abuse
action. Plaintiff Scott Seidman (“Plaintiff”) moves to
compel responses from Defendant J and C House of Love, Inc. (“Defendant”) to
form interrogatories (set one) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290
and requests for production of documents (set one) pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300. 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b) allows the propounding party to
file a motion to compel responses to document demands if a response has not
been received.  If responses are untimely, the responding party waives
objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff served discovery on May 1, 2023. (Decl.
Cherepinskiy, ¶ 4.)  Defendant failed to serve any responses to
form interrogatories or requests for production of documents. (Decl. Cherepinskiy, ¶ 10.)  
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.  Defendant J and C House of Love is ordered to
serve responses without objections within 20 days.  
 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories and requests for production of
documents are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c);
Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are denied because
the motions are unopposed.
