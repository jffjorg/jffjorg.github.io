TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants Sang Pan and Julie Pan’s Motion
for Sanctions is DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Background
On September 13, 2022,
Plaintiff Kaizou Group, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendants Sang Pan
and Julie Pan (“Defendants”) alleging Breach of Contract and Common Counts
related to unpaid invoices for goods in the amount of $703,484.00.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to
make payments from November 24, 2021, to June 2, 2022.  Plaintiff attached the invoices to its
Complaint.
 
Defendants move to
strike Plaintiff’s complaint and for monetary sanctions of $2,668.91 under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Sanctions under Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.5 
 
A court may order a
party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, “incurred by another
party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous
or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5,
subd. (a).) Frivolous means “totally and completely without merit or for the
sole purpose of harassing an opposing party." (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5,
subd. (b)(2).) An objectively reasonable attorney standard applies to this
determination. (San Diegans for Open Government v. City of San Diego
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1319.)
 
Sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7
 
Under section 128.7, a
court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper
purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or factually. (Bucur
v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189–190.) A claim is factually
frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and is legally frivolous if it
is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law.” (Ibid.) In either case, to
obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting
the claim was objectively unreasonable. (Ibid.) A claim is objectively
unreasonable if “any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and
completely without merit.” (Ibid.) However, “section 128.7 sanctions should be
‘made with restraint’ [Citation] and are not mandatory even
if a claim is frivolous.” (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
428. at 448.) 
 
Safe Harbor Provisions
 
If the alleged sanctionable
conduct is the filing and service of a complaint, Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5 has a safe harbor provision, which requires that the moving party
serve the motion on the sanctionable party at least 21 days before it is filed
with the Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(B).) This affords the
party an opportunity to cure the improper pleading. (Ibid.) 
 
Similarly, Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7 has a safe harbor provision, which requires that
the moving party serve the motion on the sanctionable party at least 21 days
before it is filed with the Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1).)
The papers to be served on the opposing party must
be the same papers which are to be filed with the court. (Hart v. Avetoom (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 410, 414.)
 
The 21-day “safe
harbor” provision is strictly enforced. “Substantial compliance” is
insufficient. (See Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th Supp.10,
15 [“Correspondence to opposing counsel which threatens sanctions of an unknown
nature at an unspecified time against unidentified persons, and which lacks
citation to controlling authority, does not fulfill these statutory
purposes.”].)
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Defendants’
three evidentiary objections to the declaration of Rick Ma are overruled. 
Discussion

After Plaintiff filed the Complaint on
September 13, 2022, Defendants served notice of this motion on September 19,
2023, and filed the motion itself on October 12, 2023. (Park Decl., ¶ 3.)  By doing so, Defendants complied with the
21-day safe harbor provision.  
 
On the merits, Defendants argue that Plaintiff
and its attorney knew that Defendants overpaid or knew that defendants did not
owe $703,484 but Plaintiff still filed the complaint. Defendants further argue
that assuming Plaintiff’s record is correct, defendants owed $349,254. In
addition, Defendants argue that they requested dismissal of the complaint, but
Plaintiff refused, creating unnecessary litigation expenses. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants’
claim of overpayment is based on an unverified handwritten note that Defendants
produced as part of their own discovery responses. Plaintiff also argues that
assuming Defendants’ claims are true, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs sued
to harass the Defendants or caused an unnecessary cost of litigation. At most,
there is a discrepancy in the remaining balance. Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant for Defendant bringing this motion. 
 
The Court finds that Defendants’ arguments are
about issues of fact that likely will be adjudicated in this action. A dispute
about an issue of fact is not the subject of a sanctions motion under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 128.5 or 128.7. Based on this, the Court denies the
motion. In its discretion, the Court also denies Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision
(h).
