And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by the defendants, James B. Rowland III and Jessica R. Rowland, to release the $10,000.00 in cash deposited with the court by the plaintiffs, Anthony Fuschillo and Alicia Fuschillo, on November 9, 2018. The motion was filed on April 4, 2024, and the plaintiffs have not opposed or responded to it.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 996.440, which provides for the release of a bond given in an action or proceeding. The section requires that the motion be made after the entry of the final judgment in the action or proceeding and the expiration of the time for appeal.

The judge finds that the Rowlands are entitled to the $10,000.00 in cash deposited with the court because they have established that they are entitled to it through the unrefuted facts set forth in the motion and supporting declaration. The Rowlands had filed a cross-complaint against the Fuschillos, and the Fuschillos had filed a notice of posting the undertaking ordered by the court. The court had granted the Fuschillos' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered them to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00.
