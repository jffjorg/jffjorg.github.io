And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC. The motion was filed on April 2, 2024, and seeks an order quashing service of summons due to alleged defects in the service. The judge finds that Chatsworth Gardens has failed to establish that the court has jurisdiction over it based on the purported service of the summons and complaint. The judge notes that the proofs of service filed with the court indicate that the summons and complaint were left with Cynthia Garcia and Jennifer Garcia, but Chatsworth Gardens claims neither of them was authorized to accept service on its behalf. The judge concludes that the motion is granted due to the failure of the plaintiffs to meet their burden of establishing jurisdiction over Chatsworth Gardens.
