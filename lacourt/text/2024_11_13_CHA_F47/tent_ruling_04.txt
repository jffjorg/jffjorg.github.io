SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arose out of a dispute between neighboring
landowners Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Anthony Fuschillo and Alicia Fuschillo
(the Fuschillos) and Defendants/Cross-Complainants James B. Rowland III and
Jessica R. Rowland (the Rowlands).  
 
On 9/20/18, the Fuschillos filed their complaint against
the Rowlands for: (1) adverse possession, (2) quiet title, (3) prescriptive
easement (in the alternative), (4) trespass, (5) trespass to chattels, and (6)
conversion.  
 
On 10/12/18, the Court granted the Fuschillos request for
a preliminary injunction and ordered them to post an undertaking in the amount
of $10,000.00.  (See 10/12/18
Minute Order; 11/1/18 Order on Preliminary Injunction).
 
On 10/22/18, the Rowlands filed their original
cross-complaint against the Fuschillos for: (1) trespass and (2) quiet
title.  On 12/27/18, the Rowlands filed
their amended cross-complaint alleging the same two causes of action.  On 11/9/18, the Fuschillos filed a notice of
posting the undertaking ordered by the Court. 

 
After several years of litigation, the matter was
scheduled for a jury trial on 3/11/24. 
On that day, pursuant to the oral request made by Plaintiff/the
Fuschillos, the Court ordered the Rowlands dismissed with prejudice from the
Fuschillos’ complaint.  (See
3/11/24 Minute Order).  Similarly, on
that date, pursuant to the request of Defendant/Cross-Complainant/the Rowlands,
the Court ordered the Fuschillos dismissed with prejudice from the Rowlands’
amended cross-complaint.  Id.
 
On 4/4/24, the Rowlands filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order releasing the $10,000.00 in cash deposited with the
court on 11/9/18 to Defendants per CCP 996.440. 
The Fuschillos have not opposed or otherwise responded to the
motion.    
 
ANALYSIS 
 
CCP
996.440 provides: 
 
(a) If a bond is given in an action or
proceeding, the liability on the bond may be enforced on motion made in the
court without the necessity of an independent action.
(b) The motion shall not be made until
after entry of the final judgment in the action or proceeding in which the bond
is given and the time for appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, until
the appeal is finally determined. The motion shall not be made or notice of
motion served more than one year after the later of the preceding dates.
(c) Notice of motion shall be served
on the principal and sureties at least 30 days before the time set for hearing
of the motion. The notice shall state the amount of the claim and shall be
supported by affidavits setting forth the facts on which the claim is based.
The notice and affidavits shall be served in accordance with any procedure
authorized by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section
1010).
(d) Judgment shall be entered against
the principal and sureties in accordance with the motion unless the principal
or sureties serve and file affidavits in opposition to the motion showing such
facts as may be deemed by the judge hearing the motion sufficient to present a
triable issue of fact. If such a showing is made, the issues to be tried shall
be specified by the court. Trial shall be by the court and shall be set for the
earliest date convenient to the court, allowing sufficient time for such discovery
proceedings as may be requested.
(e) The principal and sureties shall
not obtain a stay of the proceedings pending determination of any conflicting
claims among beneficiaries.
 
Based
on the unrefuted facts set forth in the motion and supporting declaration, the
Rowlands have established that they are entitled to the $10,000.00 in cash
deposited with the court by the Fuschillos on 11/9/18.  (See Anaya Decl.)
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
motion is granted.
