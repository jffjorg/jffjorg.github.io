Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Attorney's Fees on Appeal in part. The Judge has awarded attorney's fees and costs in the total amount of $3,817.50 in favor of the Defendant and against the Plaintiff. The Judge has determined that the Defendant is entitled to its attorney's fees on appeal and that the amount of fees requested is reasonable. However, the Judge has reduced the number of hours claimed by the Defendant's Counsel, finding it unreasonable to claim that 21.20 hours were spent on the matter. The Judge has awarded attorney's fees and costs for 5 hours of work at $750.00 per hour, plus a filing fee of $67.50.
