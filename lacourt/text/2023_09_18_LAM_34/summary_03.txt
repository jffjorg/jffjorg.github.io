And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part the defendant's motion for attorney's fees on appeal, awarding $3,817.50 in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant is entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs, but reduced the amount requested due to the similarity of the filings and the unreasonable number of hours claimed. The court granted judicial notice of the Court of Appeal docket and remittitur in Appeal No. B325676. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 1032 and 1033.5, which govern the recovery of attorney's fees and costs. The court has previously awarded attorney's fees and costs in favor of the defendant and intervenor in this case, and this decision is consistent with those previous rulings.

**Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion by Defendant, United Escrow Co., for attorney's fees related to Appeal No. B325676. The Judge grants the motion in part, awarding United Escrow Co. $3,817.50 in attorney's fees and costs, significantly less than the $15,967.50 requested. The Judge finds the hourly rate of $750 reasonable and the motion timely, but deems the claimed 21.20 hours of work excessive, given the repetitive nature of filings in this case. The Judge believes only 5 hours of work were reasonably incurred. The Court takes judicial notice of the Court of Appeal Docket and the Remittitur in Appeal No. B325676.

**Summary in English Text:**

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the motion by Defendant Bow Tie Realty & Investment, Inc. for attorney's fees related to Appeal No. B325676.  While the judge found the motion timely and agreed that the defendant was entitled to fees and that the hourly rate was reasonable, the judge significantly reduced the number of hours claimed.  The judge noted that many of the filings in this case, including the recent appeal, were nearly identical to previous ones, making the claimed 21.20 hours unreasonable.  Therefore, the judge awarded attorney's fees and costs totaling $3,817.50, reflecting five hours of work at $750/hour plus a $67.50 filing fee, instead of the requested $15,967.50. The ruling also notes a long history of appeals and motions in the case, with prior awards of attorney fees and sanctions against the plaintiff, Caroline S. Lee. The Court of Appeal had previously sanctioned both the plaintiff and her counsel and referred the matter to the State Bar of California.
