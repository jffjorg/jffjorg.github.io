And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part the defendant's motion for attorney's fees on appeal, awarding $3,817.50 in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant is entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs, but reduced the amount requested due to the similarity of the filings and the unreasonable number of hours claimed. The court granted judicial notice of the Court of Appeal docket and remittitur in Appeal No. B325676. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 1032 and 1033.5, which govern the recovery of attorney's fees and costs. The court has previously awarded attorney's fees and costs in favor of the defendant and intervenor in this case, and this decision is consistent with those previous rulings.
