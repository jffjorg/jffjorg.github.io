## English Summary

The Judge issued a tentative ruling to dismiss the case without prejudice due to the Plaintiff's repeated failure to serve the Defendant.

The Court warned the Plaintiff at a previous hearing that if service was not achieved by July 17, 2023, the case would be dismissed.

Dismissal without prejudice means the Plaintiff can refile the case in the future.
