## English Summary

The Judge issued a tentative ruling to dismiss the case without prejudice due to the Plaintiff's repeated failure to serve the Defendant. 

The case was filed in October 2022. Despite multiple attempts, the Plaintiff has been unable to serve the Defendant.  The Court warned the Plaintiff at a previous hearing that if service was not achieved by July 17, 2023, the case would be dismissed.  As no service has been made and no attempts have been made in the last three months, the Judge is dismissing the case.


Dismissal without prejudice means the Plaintiff can refile the case in the future.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge dismissed the case (number 22STCV33955) without prejudice. This means the Plaintiff can refile the case later. The dismissal was due to the Plaintiff's failure to serve the Defendant with the lawsuit. The Plaintiff had reported multiple unsuccessful attempts to serve the Defendant at previous Case Management Conferences (CMCs). At the CMC on July 17, 2023, the Court warned that the case would be dismissed if the Defendant was not served by the next hearing. As of the September 18, 2023 hearing, the Defendant had still not been served, and no attempts at service had been made in almost three months. Therefore, the Judge dismissed the case.
