English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Pella Window and Door Showroom of South Pasadena. The motion seeks to compel arbitration of a dispute arising from the purchase of windows by Norma Sarkin, the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion and stayed the matter pending the conclusion of arbitration. The court has also set a post-arbitration status conference for November 25, 2024. The court's decision is based on the language of the arbitration provision in the contract signed by Sarkin, which requires arbitration of disputes arising from the purchase of Pella products. The court has rejected Sarkin's arguments that the arbitration provision does not apply because she rejected the non-conforming goods and never took ownership of them.
