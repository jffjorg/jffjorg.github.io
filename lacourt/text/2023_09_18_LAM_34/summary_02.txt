English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Pella Window and Door Showroom of South Pasadena. The motion seeks to compel arbitration of a dispute arising from the purchase of windows by Norma Sarkin, the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion and stayed the matter pending the conclusion of arbitration. The court has also set a post-arbitration status conference for November 25, 2024. The court's decision is based on the language of the arbitration provision in the contract signed by Sarkin, which requires arbitration of disputes arising from the purchase of Pella products. The court has rejected Sarkin's arguments that the arbitration provision does not apply because she rejected the non-conforming goods and never took ownership of them.

The Court grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute between Plaintiff Norma Sarkin and Defendant Pella Window and Door Showroom of South Pasadena. The Court finds that the arbitration provision in the contract signed by Plaintiff on June 13, 2022 applies to the dispute, and that Plaintiff did not opt out of the provision within the 90-day timeframe. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's allegations of intentional and/or negligent misrepresentation do not go specifically to the making of the agreement to arbitrate, and therefore do not provide a basis for rescinding the arbitration provision. The matter is stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration, and the Court sets a post-arbitration status conference for November 25, 2024.
