English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Pella Window and Door Showroom of South Pasadena. The motion seeks to compel arbitration of a dispute arising from the purchase of windows by Norma Sarkin, the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion and stayed the matter pending the conclusion of arbitration. The court has also set a post-arbitration status conference for November 25, 2024. The court's decision is based on the language of the arbitration provision in the contract signed by Sarkin, which requires arbitration of disputes arising from the purchase of Pella products. The court has rejected Sarkin's arguments that the arbitration provision does not apply because she rejected the non-conforming goods and never took ownership of them.

**Summary in English Text:**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's (Pella Window and Door Showroom of South Pasadena) motion to compel arbitration in the case brought by Plaintiff Norma Sarkin (Case Number 23STCV15703).  The Judge found that a valid arbitration agreement exists within the contract signed by Sarkin on June 13, 2022, for the purchase of windows.  Sarkin's arguments against arbitration, including claims of non-conforming goods and fraud, were rejected.  The Judge determined there was no evidence of fraud specifically related to the arbitration clause itself, and therefore, the general fraud claims do not invalidate the agreement to arbitrate.  Furthermore, Sarkin failed to opt out of the arbitration agreement within the 90-day period allowed from the date of purchase.  As a result, the court proceedings are stayed pending the completion of arbitration, and a status conference is scheduled for November 25, 2024.

**Arguments:**

* **Pella:**  Argued the arbitration clause in the contract signed by Sarkin applies to the dispute and that Sarkin did not opt out of arbitration within the 90-day window.
* **Sarkin:**  Argued the arbitration clause doesn't apply because she rejected the non-conforming goods and never took ownership. She also claimed grounds for rescission of the contract due to fraud, but didn't provide evidence of fraud related to the arbitration clause itself.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Court GRANTED Pella's motion to compel arbitration.

**Reasons for Ruling:**

* The Court found that the arbitration clause is enforceable.
* The Court determined that Sarkin's claim did not meet the legal requirement for rescission of the contract because she failed to present evidence of fraud specifically related to the arbitration clause.
* The Court noted that Sarkin did not opt out of arbitration within the 90-day window.

**Next Steps:**

* The case is STAYED pending the outcome of arbitration.
* A post-arbitration Status Conference is scheduled for November 25, 2024.


**Key Legal Points:**

* Arbitration agreements are generally enforceable unless there are grounds for rescission.
* Fraud related to the arbitration clause itself is a valid reason to avoid enforcing the agreement.
* Parties must comply with the opt-out procedures specified in the arbitration agreement.
