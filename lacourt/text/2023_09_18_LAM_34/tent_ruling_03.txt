ANALYSIS:
 
 
 
I.         
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Bow Tie requests that the Court take judicial notice of: 
 
(1)      
The
Court of Appeal Docket in Appeal No. B325676; and
(2)      
The
Remittitur in Appeal No. B325676.
 
The Court GRANTS judicial notice of these items. 
 
II.      
Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
 
“‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
Defendant United Escrow Co.
(“Defendant”) moves the Court to award $15,967.50 in attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for Appeal No. B325676. (Motion, pp. 5:25–26.) 
 
Defendant argues: (1) that the
Motion is timely; (2) that Defendant is entitled to its attorney’s fees on
appeal; (3) that the amount of fees requested is appropriate; (4) that the
hourly rate is reasonable; and (5) that the number of hours is reasonable.
(Motion, pp. 2:17, 2:25, 3:21, 5:10, 5:16.)
 
Plaintiff does not oppose the
Motion. 
 
The Court agrees with Defendant that
the Motion is timely, that Defendant is entitled to its attorney’s fees on
appeal, that the costs claimed ($67.50) are reasonable, and that the hourly
rate of $750.00 is reasonable. 
 
However, given that many of the filings
in this matter are identical — whether they be motions for attorney’s fees,
filings on appeal, and so on — it is unreasonable for Defendant’s Counsel to
claim that 21.20 hours were spent on this matter. For example, as noted by the
Court of Appeal, the sixth appeal is nearly identical to the fifth appeal.
Moreover, this Motion is essentially identical to the motion filed on May 18,
2023. It strains credulity to claim that any more than five hours of work were
reasonably incurred on this appeal and this Motion. 
 
The Court will award attorney’s fees
and costs in the total amount of $3,817.50. This accounts for five hours of
work at $750.00 per hour, plus the filing fee of $67.50. 
 
 
IV.      Conclusion
 
        The Motion is GRANTED in
part. Attorney’s fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiff in the total amount of $3,817.50.
