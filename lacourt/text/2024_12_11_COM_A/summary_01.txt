And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint in this unlawful detainer action. The defendants have argued that the complaint makes contradictory claims about rent, specifically that the monthly rent is $11,898 whereas the 3-day notice demands rent for one month at $15,687.90. The Judge has ruled that the complaint states alleges all facts required to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer, and that the "precise sum of rent due rule" does not apply in commercial tenancies. The Judge has also held that the notice may claim an amount that is reasonably estimated, and that the burden shifts to the commercial tenant to prove the demand was unreasonable if the landlord's excessive demand does not exceed 20 percent. The Judge has therefore overruled the demurrer and denied the defendants' request to sustain it.
