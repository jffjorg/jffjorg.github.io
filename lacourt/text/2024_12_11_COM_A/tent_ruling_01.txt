  Case Number:  24CMUD01461    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  A GARDENA 157DL LLC vs SHIRI DANGOR, et al.Hearing on Demurrer to ComplaintThis is an unlawful detainer action arising out of the alleged failure by defendants to pay rent due under a commercial lease.  Defendants contend the demurrer should be sustained because the complaint makes contradictory claims.  Specifically, Defendants contend that the allegations in the complaint are factually inconsistent, because the complaint alleges that the monthly rent is currently $11,898 whereas the 3-day notice demands rent for one month at $15,687.90. (Demurrer, p. 4:5-6.)  The complaint alleges that though the lease provided for rent of $11,000, there have been several increases in rent since the move in date, and the "most current rent" is $11,898.00."  (Complaint, para. 6.)  It further alleges that at the time the 3-day notice was served, the amount of rent due was $15,687.90.  (Id., para. 12.)  The prayer for relief does not allege that the $15,687.90 in past due rent sought to be recovered constituted one month of rent.  (Id., para. 19.)  However, the 3-day notice states that "the total sum of rental charges due within the preceding year under your lease ... is ... $15,687.90," and also states that it is "for the period 08/05/2024 to 09/04/2024."  (Complaint, Exhibit 2.)For the reasons set forth in the opposition to the demurrer, the complaint states alleges all facts required to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer.  Moreover, the "precise sum of rent due rule" does not apply in commercial tenancies.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161.1(a), the notice may claim an amount that is reasonably estimated.  Such a provision makes sense because monthly rent is not always easily fixed or readily ascertained by simply reading the terms of the lease, e.g. the rent is often affected by other charges that are passed on to the tenant.  (See, Levitz Furniture Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1040.)  There is a presumption that the amount of rent claimed is reasonably estimated if it is no more than 20 percent higher than the rent that is determined to be due.  (Code of Civ. Proc., section 1161.1(e).)  Under section 1161(e), when the landlord's excessive demand does not exceed 20 percent, the burden shifts to the commercial tenant to prove the demand was unreasonable.  (Cinnamon Square Shopping Ctr. v. Meadowlark Enters. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1837, 1843.)  Here, the $15,687.90 demand appears to exceed twenty percent over the monthly rent of $11,898.00.  However, though a demand exceeding the section 1161.1(e) margin is presumed unreasonable, that amount may nonetheless be deemed reasonable under section 1161(a) depending on the facts of the case.  WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 516, 531.)  As a result, the discrepancy between the monthly rent of $11,898 and the $15,687.90 in past due rent sought to be recovered is not fatal at the pleading stage.  Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is overruled. Defendants are to give notice.
