And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Lyft, Inc. in a negligence and negligent entrustment case. The case involves a motor vehicle accident between Plaintiff Esther Ku and Lyft driver Kyle Schroeder. Lyft argues that Schroeder was not acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, as he was driving home from his shift and not using the Lyft application. The judge agrees, finding that there are no triable issues of fact and that Lyft did not own the vehicle involved in the accident. The judge also finds that Schroeder's misconduct was not foreseeable by Lyft and that there are no facts that his drive home conferred any benefit to Lyft. The judge grants summary judgment in favor of Lyft, Inc. and orders the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
