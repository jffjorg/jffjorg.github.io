And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The motion was brought by Plaintiff James Ellis against Defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The dispute concerns the contact information of a witness, Victor Quinonez, who worked as a security guard at the Madison Hotel where the events of the case took place.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that the privacy interest of the witness outweighs the discovery of his contact information. The judge noted that Quinonez has a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding his home address, and that the threatened intrusion is serious since he will be graduating from the Los Angeles Police Academy and will become an officer.

The judge has also granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $1,000. The sanctions are mandatory against the unsuccessful party that makes a motion to compel further discovery. The judge has ordered Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such within 30 days of the date of the order.
