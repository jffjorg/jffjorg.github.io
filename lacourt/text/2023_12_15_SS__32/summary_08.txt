And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose filed by the plaintiff, Jennifer Gomez. The motion was filed on September 21, 2023, after discovery closed, and seeks to reopen discovery to present new medical information related to the plaintiff's ongoing medical treatment. The defendants, Parking Company of America Management, LLC and Maria Olortegui, opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff only seeks to reopen discovery to present new information to the jury and that they will be prejudiced by the delay.

The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff attempted to resolve the matter in good faith and that the limited discovery will not cause significant delay or prejudice to the defendants. The judge has also declined to impose sanctions on the defendants, finding that imposition of sanctions would be unjust.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer promptly to ensure that all discovery can be completed by the current trial date, which is set for March 27, 2024.
