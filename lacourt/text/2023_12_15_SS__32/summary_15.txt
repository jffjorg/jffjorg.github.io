And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by the specially appearing defendants, Driven Brands Holdings, Inc., IMO US Georgia, LLC, and IMO US South, LLC. The defendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction over them because they are entities organized in Delaware with their principal place of business in North Carolina, and they conduct no business in California. The Judge finds that the proofs of service filed for each of the three defendants show that service was mailed to addresses in Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama, and therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show the jurisdictional criteria are met. The Court concludes that the defendants' motion to quash service of summons is granted, and the defendants shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
