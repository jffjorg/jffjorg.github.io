HEARING DATE:


December
  15, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV27360




MOTIONS:  


Requests
  for Admission, Set One Deemed Admitted  




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioner Samuel Moore 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff Samuel Moore (Petitioner) filed a
petition against Respondent North Light Specialty Insurance Company
(Respondent) to enforce discovery under Insurance Code section 11580.2(f)(1).  
 
Petitioner moves to have Request for Admissions, Set One Deemed
Admitted by Respondent. Petitioner asserts that he served the Request for
Admissions on July 5, 2023. (Vardanyan Decl. ¶ 2.) No extension was requested
or offered. On August 31, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel contacted Respondent to
inquire about the discovery. (Id. ¶ 3.) No response was received. Since then, Petitioner
has not received any responses to the Request for Admissions. (Id. ¶ 4.) Petitioner
also seeks monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“[T]he uninsured
motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive jurisdiction to hear
discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist arbitrations.” (Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 926.) In uninsured
motorist arbitrations, discovery may be commenced both before and after the
commencement of arbitration. (Id. at 923.) 
 
Insurance Code
section 11580.2 does not provide any manner for the service of a petition. However,
“Section 1290.4, subdivision (b) of the Code of Civil Procedure does set forth
service requirements for a “petition” under the contractual arbitration law.”
(Id. at 928.) Under section 1290.4, a copy of the petition and a written notice
of the time and place of the hearing and any other papers upon which the
petition is based must be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for the service of such petition and notice.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1290.4(a).)  If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
for service, then section 1290.4 requires that service be made in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in an action.  (Id., §
1290.4(b).) 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to
respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
Discovery Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of
service of a proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section
2033.220. The courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual
compliance with all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not
to be given the stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in
substantial compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636.) Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.) 
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿ However,
objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Petitioner filed this petition under Insurance Code section
11580.2, which does not provide any manner for service. Petitioner has not
included a copy of the arbitration agreement to determine if a manner of
service was specified there. To this extent, Petitioner was required by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1290.4(b) to serve the petition on Respondent in the
manner provided for the service of summons by law. Here, the Petition to
Enforce Discovery does not have a proof of service attached. Therefore, the
Court does not have jurisdiction at this time to hear the discovery matter.    
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Petitioner’s Motion to have Request for Admissions, Set
One Deemed Admitted, is DENIED.
 
Petitioner
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
