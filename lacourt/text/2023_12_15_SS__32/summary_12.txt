The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Beachfront Bikes LLC. The plaintiff, Antanas Jasiukonis, is suing the defendant for negligence after he was allegedly injured while riding a bicycle on the beach bike path. The defendant argues that it cannot be held liable because the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to establish negligence or vicarious liability. The judge has granted the defendant's motion, finding that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant. The plaintiff is given 30 days to file and serve an amended complaint.
