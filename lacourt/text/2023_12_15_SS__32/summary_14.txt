And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's request to compel disclosure of Quinonez's home address is denied. The judge finds that Quinonez has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his address and telephone number, and that the request is not justified by the need to obtain discovery. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel has a history of violating protective orders, and that this is a significant factor in the court's decision. The judge admonishes the plaintiff to comply with the court's orders in the future and suggests that the plaintiff's motion to compel further response is not necessary.
