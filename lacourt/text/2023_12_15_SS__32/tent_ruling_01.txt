19STCV02804




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Advance Trial and Related Dates




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Xacil Vazquez




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendants
  Jose P. Arguelles and Rosa A. Arguelles



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 28, 2019, Plaintiff Xacil Vazquez (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Jose Martin Lopez Graciano, Gisela Graciano, Jose
P. Arguelles, Rosa A. Arguelles, and Does 1 to 25 for negligence regarding a
dog bite. 
 
On January 26, 2022, Plaintiff was granted default judgment against
Defendants Jose Martin Lopez Graciano, Gisela Graciano, Jose P. Arguelles, and
Rosa A. Arguelles. 
 
On January 18, 2023, Defendants Jose P. Arguelles and Rosa A.
Arguelles’ (hereafter “Defendants”) motion to vacate judgment was granted on
the basis that they were not served the summons and complaint at their correct
address and lacked actual notice. (Min. Order, 1/18/23.) 
 
On January 19, 2023, Defendants filed an answer. 
 
At the March 15, 2023 Status Conference, the Court set the trial for
March 26, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff now moves to advance the trial date in order to conform with
the five-year limit under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310. Defendants
oppose. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 583.310 provides that an action shall be brought to
trial within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.
This requirement is mandatory and not subject to extension, excuse, or
exception except as expressly provided by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., section
583.360, subd. (b).)
An action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on
motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the action is not
brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article. (Code Civ. Proc. §
583.360.) 
 
 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1335 states as
follows:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(a)
Noticed motion or application required¿¿ 
A party
seeking to advance, specially set, or reset a case for trial must make this
request by noticed motion or ex parte
application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division.¿¿ 
(b)
Grounds for motion or application¿¿ 
The
request may be granted only upon an affirmative showing by the moving party of
good cause based on a declaration served and filed with the motion or
application.¿¿ 
¿ 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1335(a)-(b).)¿¿ 
 
“[A] trial court does not have a mandatory duty to set a
preferential trial date, even when the five-year deadline approaches. Its
discretion is not wholly unfettered: it must consider the “total picture,” as
Wilson prescribes, including the condition of the court calendar, dilatory
conduct by plaintiff, prejudice to defendant of an accelerated trial date, and
the likelihood of eventual mandatory dismissal if the early trial date is
denied.” (Salas v. Sears, Roebuck &
Co. (1986) 42 Cal.3d
342, 349.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Plaintiff filed her complaint on January 28, 2019, meaning the
deadline under section 583.310 to bring this case to trial is January 28, 2024.
Trial is currently set for March 26, 2024.
 
Judicial
Council Emergency Rule 10 provides that for all civil actions filed on or
before April 6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is
extended by six months for a total time of five years and six months.  
 
As an
initial matter, Plaintiff does not believe Rule 10 is applicable due to “recent
legal authorities” that question its applicability. (Motion, 5.) Plaintiff does
not discuss these authorities. If the Court applied Rule 10, the 5-year limit
would take place on July 28, 2024. However, the Court will address Plaintiff’s
arguments assuming this rule does not apply because both parties appear to take
the position that it does not apply. 
 
Here, the
declaration of Terrance Allen states that between March 26, 2019 to April 22,
2019, Plaintiff had a good faith belief she had served Defendants the complaint
and summons. (Allen Decl. ¶ 3.) Allen states that “after multiple attempts for
entry”, the court approved default judgments on January 26, 2022. (Id. ¶ 4.)
Between April 22, 2019 and January 26, 2022, no meaningful discovery took
place. (Id.) After Defendants’ judgment was vacated on January 18, 2023,
Defendants served discovery. Plaintiff responded and served requests on
February 17, 2023. (Id. ¶ 6–7.) Defendants responded on March 20, 2023. (Id. ¶
7.) On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Jose Graciano,
which has not yet occurred. (Id. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s deposition took place on
September 25, 2023. (Id. ¶ 9.)  At the
time of the declaration, Defendants’ deposition was scheduled and confirmed for
October 9, 2023. (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff seeks to depose Celia Valle, who was
disclosed during Plaintiff’s deposition, but does not believe it will affect an
advanced trial date. (Id. ¶ 13.)
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was in possession of Defendant’s
correct address from the Animal Control Report of the subject incident.[1]
(Opp., 2; Exh. 1.) This report is dated August 5, 2017. Therefore, Plaintiff
had the information to properly serve Defendant sooner. Defendant also argues
that Plaintiff was not diligent in deposing Celia Valle because that witness
was identified on March 20, 2023 through discovery responses. They argue that
Plaintiff waited until Defendants sought to set aside the default to start
depositions. (Opp., 3–4.)  Defendant
argues these facts show that Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause.
However, Defendant does not explain why Plaintiff was expected to start
deposing witnesses if she had already secured a default judgment against
Defendants. 
 
Based on
the above, the Court finds the declaration of Terrance Allen supports good
cause to advance the trial date. From the time Defendants entered the
litigation, it appears the parties have diligently engaged in discovery, by
serving requests and responses, and scheduling the parties’ depositions. Though
Defendants argue they will be prejudiced because Plaintiff is having trouble
deposing a percipient witness, it is Plaintiff who will have the burden of
proof at trial. Therefore, the fact that a witness cannot be deposed will also
hinder Plaintiff. Additionally, it appears Defendants would file a motion to
dismiss if the trial was not advanced. Therefore, in light of the
circumstances, the motion to advance the trial date is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to advance the trial date is GRANTED. 
 
The Final Status Conference is advanced to January 8, 2024
at 10:00 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
Trial is advanced to January 22, 2024
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
