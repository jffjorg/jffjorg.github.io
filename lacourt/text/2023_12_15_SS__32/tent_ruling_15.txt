BACKGROUND
 
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Jaime Omar Guzman and Grevil Guzman
Castellanos (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Defendants Driven Brands
Holdings, Inc., IMO US Georgia, LLC, IMO US South, LLC, Tony Randall Higgins,
and Does 1 to 10 for negligence surrounding a motor vehicle accident. The
complaint states the accident occurred in Cobb County, Georgia. 
 
Specially Appearing Defendants Driven Brands Holdings, Inc., IMO US
Georgia, LLC, and IMO US South, LLC (Defendants) now move to quash service of
the summons under Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, arguing the Court
lacks jurisdiction. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“A defendant . .
. may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes:¿ (1) To quash service
of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.
. . .”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).)¿“[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]”¿(Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)¿“[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that
the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.”¿(Id. at 1441-1442.)¿When a
defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff
has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that
is the facts requisite to an effective service.”¿(Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)¿ 
 
California’s long-arm statute
authorizes California courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not
inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
California.¿(Code Civ. Proc., section 410.10.) Accordingly,
a California court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident
defendant who has not been served with process within the State comports with
the requirements of the due process clause of the federal Constitution if the
defendant has such minimum contacts with the State that the assertion of
jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal. 4th 434, 444-45; International
Shoe Co. v. Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.) 
 
California recognizes two ways in which the constitutional
“minimum contacts” requirement may be satisfied. General jurisdiction exists when a defendant’s contacts with
the forum state are so systematic and so continuous as to make it consistent
with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to subject the
defendant to the jurisdiction of the forum, even if the cause of action is
unrelated to the contacts.¿(Vons, supra, 14 Cal. 4th at 445 – 446; International
Shoe Co. v. Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310; Worldwide Volkswagen Corp.
v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 291.)  
 
The relevant period for determining the existence of
minimum contacts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction is that which existed
when the cause of action arose. (Boaz v. Byle & Co. (1995) 40 CA4th 700,
717.) “For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general
jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile.” (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S.117, 137.) A domicile is the place where one resides with the intent to
remain indefinitely. (DeYoung v. DeYoung (1946) 27 C3d 521, 524.) Due to
the intent requirement, a person may only have one domicile at a time. (Marriage
of Tucker (1991) 226 CA2d 1249, 1258.) 
 
A nonresident
may be subject to specific jurisdiction if: (1) the nonresident has
purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of the state’s
laws; (2) the controversy arises out of the nonresident’s contacts with the
state; and (3) it would be fair and just to assert jurisdiction. (Burger
King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 472; Pavlovich v. Superior
Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 268.) 
 
A court may consider factors including: 
 
1.      The extent to which the lawsuit relates to defendant’s
activities or contacts with California 
2.      The availability of evidence and the location of witnesses 
3.      The availability of an alternative forum in which the claim
could be litigated  
4.      The relative costs and burdens to the litigants of bringing
or defending the action 
5.      State policy in providing a forum for this particular
litigation 
 
Where personal jurisdiction is challenged, “the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that
all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met. (Thomas J. Palmer, Inc. v. Turkiye Is
Bankasi A.S., supra, 105 Cal.App.3d at p. 148.) The burden is established
by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary evidence.” (Ziller
Electronics Lab Gmbh v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 1222,
1232-1233; Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1439–1440.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants argue they are entities organized in the state of Delaware,
with their principal place of business in North Carolina. (Motion, 1.)
Defendants argue they conduct no business in California and that the subject
incident took place in Georgia. 
 
The proofs of service filed for each of the three Defendants show that
service was mailed to addresses in Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama. Because
Defendants challenge personal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs have the burden to show
the jurisdictional criteria are met. Plaintiffs do not oppose this motion and
therefore have failed to meet their burden. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to quash service of the summons is
GRANTED. 
 
Specially appearing Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file a proof of service of such.
