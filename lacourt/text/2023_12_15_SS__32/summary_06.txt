And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, New Vision Contractors, to compel additional time to take the deposition of the plaintiff, Susie Leivas. The defendant argues that the deposition was delayed by improper argumentation and objections by the plaintiff's counsel, and that the relevant information spans 64 years and concerns 16 different injuries and treatment from 43 medical facilities. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the deposition was not delayed and that the defendant did not use the deposition time efficiently.

The judge has reviewed the deposition transcript and disagrees with the defendant's assertion that the plaintiff's counsel engaged in prejudicial misconduct. However, the judge agrees that there are some topics that need to be explored further in the deposition. The judge grants an additional 3 hours of deposition time, but admonishes the defendant to use that time efficiently and to limit the questioning to the topics listed in the joint brief.

The defendant also seeks $9,435 in monetary sanctions, but the judge finds substantial justification and declines to award sanctions. The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for 3 hours of deposition within 20 days of notice of the order, unless the defendant stipulates otherwise.
