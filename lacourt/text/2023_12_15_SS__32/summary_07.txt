And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney Martin E. Jacobs, who represents Plaintiff Colleen Howe. The judge finds that Counsel's reasons for withdrawal, including his health issues and need to care for his wife, are valid. However, the judge orders Counsel to file a proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing and serve it within 10 days, providing notice of all future hearings and proceedings. The judge conditionsally grants the motion pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
