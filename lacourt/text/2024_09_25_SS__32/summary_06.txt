And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside/dismissal filed by Plaintiff Arely Santana. The motion was filed on August 15, 2024, and is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows the Court to relieve a party from a dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at trial on January 24, 2024, and the case was dismissed without prejudice. The Plaintiff then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on March 18, 2024. The Plaintiff now seeks to set aside the dismissal, claiming that the counsel's failure to appear was due to excusable neglect.

The Court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the Plaintiff's motion is without merit. The Plaintiff's counsel did not demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would justify the Court's relief. Additionally, the Plaintiff's motion is based on a faulty understanding of the law, as the Court's discretion to relieve a party from a dismissal is limited to specific circumstances.

Therefore, the Court DENIES the Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal.
