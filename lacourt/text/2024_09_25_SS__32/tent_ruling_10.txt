reply, Defendant cites to Shiver v. Laramee (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 395.
However, in that case, a car suddenly stopped in front of moving cars whereas
here, the evidence affords the possible inference that Defendant had enough
time to slow down before Cassillas merged into Defendant’s lane, given the merging
into the number three lane, the presence of the hazard lights to signify a
hazard, and the possible distance between Defendant and Cassillas. (Shiver,
supra, 24 Cal.App.5th at 401.) Moreover, whether Plaintiff testified
that he saw Cassillas cut off Defendant, and whether Plaintiff contends that
Cassillas made an unsafe lane change in violation of Vehicle Code section
21658(a), are not dispositive regarding Defendant’s actions given the
uncertainty in the amount of time Defendant had to react. The issue regarding
the hazard lights is not whether she appropriately used her hazard lights (see
Reply at p. 7), but whether the use of those lights gave Defendant enough time
and information to slow down before Cassillas merged, rather than veer into the
lane from which Cassillas came.
