Nursing, supra,
59 Cal.App.5th at 1045 [“The production of data with unique identifiers may
also require consumer notice, depending on the nature of the data and the
ability of the vendor or defendants to re-identify the patients. Parties to
litigation cannot avoid the consumer notice provisions by using unique
identifiers that can be decoded by the receiving party, as if the data were
never deidentified in the first place.”].)
