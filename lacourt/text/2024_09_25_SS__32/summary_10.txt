And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's response to the plaintiff's claims in a car collision case. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's testimony about the collision is not decisive because it is unclear how much time the defendant had to react to the plaintiff's actions. The judge notes that the defendant had enough time to slow down before the plaintiff merged into their lane, given the hazard lights used by the plaintiff and the distance between the two vehicles. The judge is focusing on whether the hazard lights gave the defendant enough time and information to slow down, rather than whether the defendant used the hazard lights correctly. The judge will consider the defendant's argument in relation to the law regarding safe lane changes and the Vehicle Code.
