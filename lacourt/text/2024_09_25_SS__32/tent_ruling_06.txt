  to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal

OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Jonathan Perez 



 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 24, 2024, this
case was called for trial. There were no appearances. As a result, the Court
dismissed Plaintiff Arely Santana’s (“Plaintiff”) complaint without prejudice pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). The minute order states that
Plaintiff’s counsel appeared in the courtroom at about 9:02 a.m. and was
informed of the ruling. 
 
On March 18, 2024, the Court
denied Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1008 and 473(b). In particular, the Court noted that Plaintiff invoked
section 473(b) in her notice of motion and memorandum, and found that “Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration does not indicate that the tardiness was due to mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Min. Order, 3/18/24.) 
 
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b) and 128,
seeking to set aside the Court’s March 18, 2024 order denying relief. Defendant
Jonathan Perez (“Defendant”) opposes and Plaintiff replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Relief under Section 473(b)
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may
relieve a party from a dismissal taken against him through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  This application must be
filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  
 
A mistake is a basis for relief under section 473 when by
reason of the mistake a party failed to make a timely response.¿ Surprise
occurs when a party is unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without
any negligence of his own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the
party has shown some reasonable excuse for the default.¿ (Credit Managers
Association of California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984)
162 Cal.App.3d 1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892,
905.)¿ Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the
burden of demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake,
justifying a court’s vacating a judgment.¿ (Basinger v. Roger & Wells
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)¿¿¿ 
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise,
it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only available
when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are procedurally
equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America,
Inc.¿(2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision does not apply to
dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals for
failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted], dismissals
based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted], and
voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].” (Id.)            
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, since this
motion was not filed within six months after the case was dismissed, section
473(b) cannot be used to set aside the January 24, 2024 dismissal. Instead, and
ostensibly for this reason, Plaintiff now moves to set aside the Court’s March 18, 2024 order denying relief from the
dismissal. First, Plaintiff does not set forth authority showing this motion is
proper given that it is essentially seeking the same relief a second time.[1]

 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1008 limits a party’s ability to file repetitive motions. (Le Francois v.
Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1104.) “This section specifies the court's
jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and
renewals of previous motions, and applies to all applications to reconsider any
order of a judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous motion, whether the
order deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final. No
application to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may
be considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(e).) The burden under Section 1008 for a motion to
renew “is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the
trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
206, 212-13; Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that Section 1008
imposes the special requirement of having to not only show new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, but also to “show diligence with a satisfactory
explanation for not presenting the new or different information earlier…”].)
 
Second, Plaintiff mischaracterizes
the Court’s March 18, 2024 order that
it “ ‘invited’ Plaintiff to re-file with additional facts supporting relief
under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473.” (Motion, 3; Hakkak Decl.
¶ 3.)
 
Nevertheless, Plaintiff offers the
declaration of its counsel, Z. Dean Hakkak, who declares he timely arrived at
the court for trial on January 24, 2024. (Hakkak Decl. ¶ 2.) He further
declares: “[u]pon arrival, I used the restroom which, unfortunately, caused me
to enter the department a little late (at approximately 9:00 a.m.).  I promptly ‘checked-in’ with the courtroom
clerk, who advised me that he had ‘already called his matter’ (presumably
before I entered the department) and, because I was not yet present, dismissed
Plaintiff’s case.”[2] (Id.
¶ 3.)  
 
Even if the Court could rule
according to section 473(b), Plaintiff cites to no authority that a dismissal
under section 581 is subject to the mandatory provision, and fails to again set
forth a sufficient basis for relief under the discretionary provision. Furthermore,
there is also no showing of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect in regards to the March 18, 2024 order. For
these reasons, the motion to set aside is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Dismissal. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
