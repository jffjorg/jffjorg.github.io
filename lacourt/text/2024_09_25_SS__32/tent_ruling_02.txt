MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Strike, or in the alternative, Tax Costs




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Edward Lopez




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  The People of the State of California



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On October 13, 2020, Plaintiff Edward Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants State of California, California Highway Patrol,
the California Department of Transportation, and Does 1 to 100 for negligence
and dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835. 
 
            On June 17, 2024, the Court granted
summary judgment for Defendant the People of the State of California, acting by
and through the Department of Transportation (erroneously sued as “State of
California” and “The California Department of Transportation”) (“Defendant”).
 
            On June 28, 2024, the Court entered
judgment for Defendant.
 
            On July 29, 2024, Defendant mailed
notice of the entry of judgment to Plaintiff. 
 
On July 29, 2024, Defendant served its Memorandum of Costs (forms
MC-010 and MC-011), claiming $8,027.70 in costs. The Memorandum was filed with
the Court on July 30, 2024. 
 
On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to strike or
tax Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs. Defendant opposes. No reply has been
filed. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”¿Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount.”¿“Items not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) There is no requirement that copies of bills,
invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs
must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) 
 
On a motion to tax costs, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The court’s first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and
whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.) The objecting
party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were not necessary or
reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs are not
recoverable. (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As an initial matter, Plaintiff
first argues that Defendant failed to timely file and serve its Cost
Memorandum. “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a
memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.”
(Cal. R. Ct. 3.1700(a)(1).) The record does not indicate that the clerk served
notice of the judgment under section 664.5. Here, Defendant mailed notice of
the entry of judgment to Plaintiff on July 29, 2024. Since the Memorandum was
served on July 29, 2024, and filed on July 30, 2024, it was within the 15-day
period, and timely. 
 
The Court will now address the merits of the motion. 
 
First,
as Plaintiff did not “recover any relief against” Defendant, Defendant is the
prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
Defendant is therefore entitled to recover its costs. 
 
According
to Defendant’s Cost Memorandum, it seeks $1,343.60 in filing and motion fees, $5,859.10
in deposition costs, and $825 in “other”, which appears to be Court Reporter
fees at the summary judgment hearings on May 23, 2024 and June 17, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff seeks to tax costs for all
three categories.  
 
Filing and Motion Fees 
 
Plaintiff seeks to tax all $1,343.60 in filing and motion fees.
(Motion, 7.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5(a)(1) expressly allows for filing, motion, and jury fees. Plaintiff
argues that since Defendant is a governmental agency, it is exempt from paying
any filing or motion fees pursuant to Government Code section 6103. It appears
the filing fees that are claimed come from the use of an outside service to
“e-file” its pleadings and to send courtesy copies. Plaintiff argues these fees
are excessive and inflated. However, Plaintiff cites no authority showing that a
governmental agency cannot use an outside service to e-file its pleadings. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(14) [allowing costs for “[f]ees for the
electronic filing or service of documents through an electronic filing service
provider if a court requires or orders electronic filing or service of
documents”].) 
Additionally, Plaintiff argues that costs for courtesy
copies are not recoverable. Pursuant
to the Court’s Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures, courtesy copies are
required for Ex Parte Applications, Motions for Summary Judgment, Oppositions
to Ex Parte Applications and Motions for, Oppositions to, and Replies to
Oppositions to Motions for Summary Judgment, and must be submitted directly to
the Court.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County 8th Amended Standing Order Re: PI
Court Procedures ¶ 9C.)   
The courtesy
copies that Plaintiff contests were for a summary judgment motion and ex parte
applications. Thus, the costs are permitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (c)(4) [“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.”].)  
 
The values appear reasonable on the face of the memorandum
and Plaintiff fails to meet his burden that they are not reasonable or
necessary. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion as to these costs. 
 
Deposition Costs 
 
Out of the $5,859.10 in deposition costs, Plaintiff seeks to tax $2,320.60
in costs. (Motion, 7.) Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(3)(A) expressly authorizes costs for the “[t]aking, video recording,
and transcribing” necessary depositions. 
Plaintiff argues
only Plaintiff’s deposition cost should be recovered since that is the only
deposition that Defendant noticed. Plaintiff argues that the depositions of Steve
Scott and Luis Monterrubio were noticed by Plaintiff and Defendant only
incurred the expense of purchasing an additional copy of the transcript. Plaintiff
contends that he gave Defendant a copy of the original transcript. Plaintiff
points to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.510(c) which states “[n]otwithstanding
subdivision (b) of Section 2025.320, any other party or the deponent, at the
expense of that party or deponent, may obtain a copy of the transcript.” Plaintiff
also argues that because Defendant already received an original copy of the
transcripts, the additional purchase was unnecessary. 
In opposition,
Defendant contends that the depositions of Scott and Monterrubio took place less
than one week before Plaintiff’s opposition to the summary judgment motion was
due. (Opp., 5.) Defendant also contends that Plaintiff relied on testimony from
these depositions in his opposition, and as a result, Defendant needed to
review them to properly prepare its reply. (Opp., 5-6.) Therefore, Defendant
meets its burden to show that the additional cost of the transcripts was
reasonably necessary. Plaintiff fails to discuss binding authority
demonstrating that section 2025.320 precludes awarding costs for the deposition
transcripts. 
Additionally,
the costs for receiving medical records under deposition subpoenas appears to
be recoverable. (See Naser v. Lakeridge Athletic Club (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 571, 578 [obtaining business
records through a deposition subpoena is a “deposition” within the plain
meaning of the Civil Discovery Act and recoverable as costs in section
1033.5(a)(3)].)
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the motion as to these costs. 
 
Other
 
Lastly, Plaintiff seeks to
tax all $825 in “other” fees which are for court reporter fees at the summary judgment hearings (May 23, 2024 and
June 17, 2024). Plaintiff argues this amount is excluded,
presumably by section 1033.5(b)(5), which prohibits costs of “[t]ranscripts of
court proceedings not ordered by the court.” However, section 1033.5(a)(11)
permits recovery of “Court reporter fees as established by statute.”[1]
Court reporter fee “charges are not for transcripts. They are for court
reporter fees, an entirely different expense. The parties have to pay the court
reporter regardless of whether anyone orders transcripts.”  (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 49, 58.)   
 
Based on the invoices provided in the Memorandum of Costs, it appears $300
was for the Court Reporter’s appearance on May 23, 2024, and $525 was for
transcripts from the June 17, 2024 hearing. (Memorandum Costs, at 31-32.)
Therefore, the burden shifts to Defendant to show which of the $525 amount was
for transcripts, and thus, unrecoverable. 
 
In opposition, Defendant does not address the argument that the
transcripts were not ordered by the Court, but instead argues they were
necessary to further the litigation. Since Defendant has not established that the
$525 invoice to transcribe the June 17, 2024 hearing was not for transcripts,
it fails to meet its burden that they are recoverable. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to tax $525 in costs is granted. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike, or in the alternative, Tax
Costs is granted in part. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
