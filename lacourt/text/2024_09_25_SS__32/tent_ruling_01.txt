MOTIONS:  


Petition
  for Minors Compromise 




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioner Nora Meza




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
The Court
has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, filed August 30, 2024 by
Petitioner Nora Meza (Petitioner) on behalf of Claimant David Meza, age 13. The
Court does not approve and DENIES the petition based on the following reasons:
 
The Court observes that this petition
contains the same defects as the previous petition. (See Min. Order, 3/6/24.) 
 
Again, as stated in the previous
minute order, item 10 is filled out improperly. Item 10a must contain the gross
settlement offered to Claimant. According to 10c, this value is $8,000 and must
be written in 10a (not $18,500, which is the total amount of settlement to all
plaintiffs). Accordingly, 10b should only include “Violet Mary Campos $8,000.” 
 
Again, item 11b(1) should not include
the amount offered to Claimant, but to all other plaintiffs or claimants.
Similarly, item 11b(5) should not include Claimant’s name or amount. Therefore,
the amount in 11b(1) should be $10,500. Also, Petitioner did not include
attachment 11b(6) to explain the reasons for the apportionment of the
settlement between Claimant and each plaintiff. (Min. Order, 11/2/23, 3/6/24.) 
 
Petitioner checked item 14a, and therefore should not
fill out any values under 14b. 
 
Since counsel is representing the other plaintiffs in
this action, the response in 17e must be changed and attachment 17e must be
provided. 
 
Item
17f must include fees the attorney expects to receive in connection with this
claim. Therefore, Petitioner must indicate fees expected from the petition for Starr Olazaba. 
 
Since Claimant is a minor, item 21 should not be filled
out. 
 
Petitioner and counsel must sign and date item 23 as each
revised petition is filed. 
 
Also, in the Order (MC-351), Petitioner should not mark
8a(4). This item refers to other disbursements from Claimant’s settlement, and
not disbursements from other settlements in this case. Also, the information in
item 8b(2) should be in item 9a instead. 
 
In MC-355, item 1 should contain Petitioner’s name, not
the Claimant’s name. 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.

The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, filed August 30, 2024 by Petitioner Nora Meza
(Petitioner) on behalf of Claimant Starr Olazaba, age 16. The Court does not
approve and DENIES the petition based on the following reasons:
 
Petitioner
filed a declaration on February 22, 2022, declaring under penalty of perjury
that she has personal firsthand knowledge that Claimant is fully recovered from
her injuries. The Court finds this is sufficient evidence of Claimant’s current
condition.
 
The
remaining defects were identified in the minute order for the previous
petition. (See Min. Order, 1/16/24.) 
 
Item
10b should only include amounts offered to Claimant. The $8,000 amounts do not
apply to Claimant. 
 
The
amount in 11b(1) should not include Claimant’s settlement, but all persons
other than the claimant. Accordingly, Claimant’s name/amount should not be
included in 11b(5). (Min. Order, 1/16/24.) 
 
Petitioner
must include attachment 11b(3) describing the effect on Petitioner’s claim to
the proposed compromise. 
 
Petitioner
must include attachment 11b(6) describing the reasons for the apportionment. 
 
 
Since counsel is representing the other plaintiffs in
this action, the response in 17e must be changed and attachment 17e must be
provided. 
 
Item
17f must include fees the attorney expects to receive in connection with this
claim. Therefore, Petitioner must indicate fees expected from the petition for
David Meza. 
 
Petitioner checked item 14a, and therefore should not
fill out any values under 14b. 
 
Since Claimant is a minor, item 21 should not be filled

Petitioner and counsel must sign and date item 23 as each

Also, in the Order (MC-351), the information in item

In MC-355, item 1 should contain Petitioner’s name, not
the Claimant’s name. 
 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
