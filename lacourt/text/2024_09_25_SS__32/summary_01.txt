Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed two petitions to approve compromises of pending actions of minors, filed by Petitioner Nora Meza on behalf of Claimants David Meza and Starr Olazaba. The Court does not approve and denies both petitions due to various defects and omissions. The defects include improper filling out of forms, lack of required attachments, and incorrect information. The Court orders Petitioner to correct these defects and refile the petitions. The Court also requires Petitioner to include certain information and attachments, such as explanations for the apportionment of the settlement and fees expected to be received. The Court sets a hearing date for September 25, 2024, and encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issues. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution, they must submit on this tentative ruling or appear in person or remotely at the hearing.
