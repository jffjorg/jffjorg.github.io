Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records from BHAPS (Beverly Hills Advanced Pain & Spine) by Uber Technologies, Inc. The motion was filed after BHAPS objected to the subpoena, which sought 10 years of lien agreements or contracts.

The Court finds that the scope of the subpoena is too broad and seeks irrelevant information. The Court also finds that the information sought may violate the privacy rights of non-party patients. However, the Court grants the motion in part, allowing BHAPS to produce redacted lien information for the two years prior to the Plaintiff's referral.

The Court denies BHAPS' request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, finding that the 21-day procedural requirement was not met. The Court also declines to award sanctions, finding that Defendant acted with substantial justification.

The Court orders that BHAPS shall produce the redacted lien information and that Defendant shall give notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such. The hearing on the motion is scheduled for September 25, 2024.
