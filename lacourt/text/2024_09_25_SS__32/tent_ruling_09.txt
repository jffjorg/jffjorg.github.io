BACKGROUND
 
On July 15, 2022, Plaintiffs
Kanwardeep Singh and Rochelle Yullin Arias (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Alexandra T. Cassillas, Epifanio Amillar Solis Tello,
William N Solis Tello, WNS Trucking, Juan Ramon Prado, Francisca Gonzalez
Alcala, and Does 1 to 50 for negligence related to a motor vehicle accident. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that on
November 30, 2021, they were driving on the 110 freeway when they were involved
in a motor vehicle accident with Alexandra T. Cassillas, Epifanio Amillar Solis
Tello, Juan Ramon Prado, and Francisca Gonzalez Alcala. Defendants William N
Solis Tello and WNS Trucking are alleged to have owned, and entrusted the
vehicle, and employed Epifanio Amillar Solis Tello. As a result, Plaintiff
asserts a negligent hiring, supervision, and retention cause of action against
William N Solis Tello and WNS Trucking; Plaintiffs allege Epifanio Amillar
Solis Tello was unfit to operate the freightliner semi-truck, and was doing so
without a commercial driver’s license. (Complaint, at 7.) 
 
Defendant Epifanio
Amilcar Solis Tello (“Defendant”) now moves for summary judgment, or summary
adjudication, arguing that (1) there is no triable issue regarding breach or
causation, and (2) the Sudden Emergency Doctrine applies and precludes
liability. 
 
Plaintiffs oppose and Defendant replies. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law[.] There is a triable issue of material fact if,
and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the
underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with
the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)  “[T]he party moving for summary judgment
bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the
nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of
production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie
showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.” (Ibid.;
Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474
[summary judgment standards held by Aguilar apply to summary
adjudication motions].)  Further, in line
with Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., “[o]n a motion for summary
adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as
to the challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable
issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise
Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the
court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a
factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the evidence
in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to
identify issues rather than to determine issues.  Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict,
the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [cleaned up].) 
Further, “the trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a
factfinder to determine whose version is more likely true.  Nor may the trial court grant summary
judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Id. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)                    
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
The Court rules as follows on Defendant’s objections to Plaintiffs’
evidence:
 
1.     Sustained.

2.     Sustained.

3.     Sustained.
 
The Court declines to rule on the remainder of Defendant’s objections
as they have no effect on the ruling herein. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Negligence 
 
The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a duty on the part of
defendant toward plaintiff; (2) defendant’s breach of that duty; and (3) harm
to the plaintiff caused by that breach. (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016)
1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.) 
 
“ ‘Breach of duty is usually a fact issue
for the jury; if the circumstances permit a reasonable doubt whether the
defendant's conduct violates the standard of due care, the doubt must be
resolved by the jury as an issue of fact rather than of law by the court.
[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Constance B. v. State of California (1986)
178 Cal.App.3d 200, 207.)
 
“ ‘[T]he decision whether that breach caused
the damage (that is, causation in fact) is again within the jury’s domain; but
where reasonable men will not dispute the absence of causality, the court may
take the decision from the jury and treat the question as one of law.
[Citations.]’ [Citations.]” (Constance, supra, 178 Cal.App.3d at
207 [italics in original].)¿Causation is established by showing that a
defendant’s breach of duty was a substantial factor in bringing about
plaintiff’s injury, and there is no legal rule relieving defendant from liability.
(Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.) Defendant’s
negligence is the actual cause, or cause in fact, of plaintiff’s injury if it
is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. (Mitchell v. Gonzales
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1052.) “In other words, [the] plaintiff must show some
substantial link or nexus between omission and injury.” (Saelzler v.
Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 778.)¿¿¿ 
 
The
doctrine of proximate cause relieves defendants from liability for injuries
they, in fact, caused, based on considerations of policy and justice. (Ortega,
supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) But proximate cause only becomes relevant
after it has first been determined that defendant’s conduct was the cause in
fact of plaintiff’s injury. (See Rest.2d Torts, § 431, subd. (a).) 
 
Sudden
Emergency Doctrine
 
“Under
the ‘sudden emergency’ or ‘imminent peril’ doctrine, ‘a person who, without
negligence on his part, is suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with peril,
arising from either the actual presence, or the appearance, of imminent danger
to himself or to others, is not expected nor required to use the same judgment
and prudence that is required of him in the exercise of ordinary care in calmer
and more deliberate moments.’ [Citation.] ‘A party will be denied the benefit
of the doctrine ... where that party's negligence causes or contributes to the
creation of the perilous situation.’ [Citation.]” (Abdulkadhim v. Wu
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 298, 301-02.) In order to apply the doctrine, the relevant
facts are the ones that the allegedly negligent actor faced. (See id. at
p. 302 [“It is irrelevant for purposes of the sudden emergency doctrine whether
Wu's lane change created a dangerous situation for Al-Kuraishi or anyone else;
the only relevant emergency is the one Wu faced.”].) 
 
“The
doctrine of imminent peril is properly applied only in cases where an
unexpected physical danger is presented so suddenly as to deprive the driver of
his power of using reasonable judgment.” (Pittman v. Boiven (1967) 249
Cal.App.2d 207, 216.)
 
“Whether
the conditions for application of the imminent peril doctrine exist is itself a
question of fact to be submitted to the jury.” (Damele v. Mack Trucks, Inc.
(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 29, 37.)
 
Analysis
 
Here, the parties agree that
Plaintiffs are alleging that at the time of the incident, Defendant swerved his
semi-truck left and crashed into the side of Plaintiffs’ vehicle. (UMF 2.) The
speed limit on the 110 freeway was 65 miles per hour. (UMF 3.) As to Defendant
Epifanio’s speed, Mr. Singh testified that the traffic in Defendant’s lane was
moving 5-10 miles per hour faster than everyone else. (UMF 4.) Defendant
Epifanio testified that he was driving at 45-50 miles per hour when the
accident happened. (UMF 5.) Defendant Epifanio testified the impact with the
BMW caused him to lose control which then caused him to enter Plaintiff Singh’s
lane. (UMF 6.) Plaintiff Singh admits that Defendant Alexandria Casillas moved
across in front of him and into the No. 4 lane occupied by Defendant Epifanio.
(UMF 7.) Plaintiff Singh contends that Defendant Alexandria Casillas made an
unsafe lane change in violation of Vehicle Code Section 21658 (a). (UMF 8.) 
 
            Defendant argues
that he was hit by Alexandria Casillas’ (“Casillas”) vehicle, which caused
Defendant to lose control and move into the left lane, thereby hitting
Plaintiffs’ vehicle. Defendant asserts this caused a chain reaction which
caused Plaintiffs to hit another vehicle. As a result, Defendant asserts he was
not negligent, and therefore did not cause Plaintiffs’ injury. He also argue
Casillas’ sudden merge into his lane shows that the sudden emergency doctrine
applies.  
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether
Defendant had enough time to avoid colliding with Casillas. Plaintiffs set
forth the following facts:
 
-       
Defendant Epifanio testified that he was driving around
50 miles per hour at the time of the Subject Collision. (PAMF 1.)
-       
Defendant Epifanio testified that traffic conditions
were slowing around him, including in the No. 3 lane to his left just before
the Subject Collision. (PAMF 2.)
-       
Defendant Epifanio testified that he had no training as
to how to avoid collisions while driving. (PAMF 3.) 
-       
Defendant Epifanio testified that he was never trained
on what to do if he loses control of his truck. (PAMF 5.) 
-       
Plaintiff Singh testified that he estimated Defendant
Epifanio’s truck was three car lengths behind him in the No. 4 lane during the
time Defendant Casillas was moving into the No. 4 lane. (PAMF 6.) 
-       
Defendant Casilla’s hazard signals were activated
before she began moving from lane 2 into lane 3. (PAMF 14.)
-       
Defendant Casilla’s hazard signals were activated at
the time she moved from lane 3 into lane 4. (PAMF 15.) 
-       
Plaintiff Singh testified that there were mild traffic
conditions present on the I-110 at the time of the Subject Collision, and
Plaintiff Singh was traveling at a speed consistent with the flow of traffic.
(PAMF 16.) 
-       
Defendant Epifanio testified that traffic conditions
were a little slow on the 110. (PAMF 17.) 
 
Even if Defendant met his initial
burden, Plaintiffs have established a triable issue of fact regarding whether
Defendant had enough time to respond to Cassillas’ vehicle by slowing down
rather than veering into the lane from which Cassillas came. Here, the evidence
set forth by the parties indicate that Plaintiffs were in the number three lane
and Defendant was in the number four lane. (Motion, 2; Pl. Exh. 3, Singh Depo. 120:5-15.)
At some point, Cassillas merged to the right and crossed in front of Plaintiffs
with her hazard lights on and then continued merging into the number four lane.
(Singh Depo. 120:22-121:18.) At this time, Singh testified that Defendant’s
truck was three car lengths behind him in the next lane. (Id. 127:4-10.)
Therefore, viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in favor of
Plaintiffs, given that Cassillas had her hazard lights on before she entered
Defendant’s lane and the possible distance between Defendant’s truck and Cassillas’s
car when she entered, a triable issue of fact exists regarding whether Defendant
had enough notice to anticipate the hazard and act accordingly.[1] 
 
As for Defendant’s argument that there
are no triable issues of breach and causation, the Court notes these are
generally issues of fact, and since the evidence shows a triable issue of fact
regarding the collision between Defendant and Cassillas, the motion for summary
adjudication as to these elements, is denied.  
 
Therefore, viewing the evidence and
all inferences in the light most favorable for Plaintiffs, the motion for
summary judgment/adjudication is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Epifanio Amilcar Solis Tello’s Motion for Summary
Judgment/adjudication is DENIED.
 
            Defendant
shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.

Analysis
 
Here, the parties agree that Defendant
is the brother and employer of Defendant Epifanio (UMF 1.) The speed limit on
the I-110 where the accident occurred was 65 miles per hour. Plaintiff Singh testified
he was driving at approximately 40-45 miles per hour before the accident. (UMF
4.) As to Defendant Epifanio’s speed, Mr. Singh testified that the traffic in
Defendant’s lane was moving 5-10 miles per hour faster than everyone else. (UMF
5.) Defendant Epifanio testified that he was driving at 45-50 miles per hour

As for Defendant’s argument that
there are no triable issues of breach and causation, the Court notes these are
generally issues of fact, and since the evidence shows a triable issue of fact
regarding the collision between Epifanio and Casillas, the motion for summary judgment
as to these elements, is denied.  
 
Therefore, viewing the evidence and
all inferences in the light most favorable for Plaintiffs, the motion for
summary judgment is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant William N. Solis Tello dba WNS Trucking’s Motion
for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Defendant
shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
