And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that he was hit by another vehicle and lost control, causing the collision, and that the sudden emergency doctrine applies. However, the court finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether the defendant had enough time to respond to the other vehicle by slowing down rather than veering into the lane. The court views the evidence and reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff and finds that the defendant had enough notice to anticipate the hazard and act accordingly. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
