[1] Although
Plaintiff’s original motion was titled “Motion for Reconsideration,” the notice
of motion sought relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections “1008,
473(b), and 128,” and therefore the Court addressed the grounds in the initial
motion. The body of the motion also cited to section 473(b). (Motion at p. 4.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is incorrect that the Court has not already on the
matter. (Reply at p. 2.)


[2] The
declaration attached to the original “Motion for Reconsideration” declared
under penalty of perjury that counsel “timely arrived at Court that morning,”
then “[a]fter using the restroom, [counsel] entered Department 32 (at
approximately 8:45 a.m.) and ‘checked in’ with the courtroom clerk.” (Hakkak
Decl. ¶ 3.) The minute order reflected that counsel appeared in the courtroom
at about 9:02 a.m. Now, counsel declares under penalty of perjury that “[u]pon
arrival, [counsel] used the restroom which, unfortunately, caused [him] to
enter the department a little late (at approximately 9:00 a.m.),” at which time
he “promptly [check-in] with the courtroom clerk.” (Hakkak Decl. ¶ 3.) Setting
aside the discrepancy in time (which undermines counsel’s position), neither
declaration explains why counsel did not check in at 8:30 a.m. or advise
opposing counsel, prior to using the restroom.
