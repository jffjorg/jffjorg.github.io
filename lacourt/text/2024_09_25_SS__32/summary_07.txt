And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the parties' motions and declarations related to a court hearing. The plaintiff's original motion for reconsideration was actually seeking relief under various California Code of Civil Procedure sections, and the court addressed the grounds in the initial motion. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel's declarations contain discrepancies in timing, including the time at which counsel used the restroom before checking in with the courtroom clerk. The judge concludes that neither declaration explains why counsel did not check in earlier or advise opposing counsel of their late arrival, and therefore the motion will be denied.
