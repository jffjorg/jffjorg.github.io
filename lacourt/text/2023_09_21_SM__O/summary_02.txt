And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal the filed copy of the arbitration award or, in the alternative, to seal the entire case. The plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rules 2.550 and 2.551 by not obtaining a court order to seal the documents and not filing redacted documents with the court. Additionally, the plaintiff publicly filed an unredacted copy of the arbitration award three weeks before filing the motion to seal. The judge noted that California law recognizes a constitutional right of access to court proceedings and documents, and that a party seeking to seal documents must come forward with a specific list of facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them. The plaintiff failed to meet this burden, and the judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate an overriding interest that would justify sealing the documents.
