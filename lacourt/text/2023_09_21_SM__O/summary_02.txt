And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal the filed copy of the arbitration award or, in the alternative, to seal the entire case. The plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rules 2.550 and 2.551 by not obtaining a court order to seal the documents and not filing redacted documents with the court. Additionally, the plaintiff publicly filed an unredacted copy of the arbitration award three weeks before filing the motion to seal. The judge noted that California law recognizes a constitutional right of access to court proceedings and documents, and that a party seeking to seal documents must come forward with a specific list of facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them. The plaintiff failed to meet this burden, and the judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate an overriding interest that would justify sealing the documents.

## English Summary

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion to seal the arbitration award and/or the entire case. 

The judge found that Plaintiffs failed to follow the proper procedures for sealing documents as outlined in California Rules of Court. They did not file any redacted documents and did not obtain a court order.  

Furthermore, the judge emphasized the public's constitutional right to access court documents, which is presumed unless there is a compelling reason to seal them. Plaintiffs failed to provide specific facts or reasons why the arbitration award should be kept confidential.


Essentially, the judge determined that Plaintiffs did not meet the legal requirements and provide sufficient justification for sealing the case documents.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal the filed copy of the arbitration award or the entire case. The plaintiff, Tensor Law P.C. and Aaron G. Filler, failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rules 2.550 and 2.551, which require a court order to file a record under seal. The plaintiff also failed to file redacted documents with the court and did not provide a specific list of facts to be withheld or reasons for concealing them. The judge noted that California law recognizes a constitutional right of access to court proceedings and documents, and that the plaintiff has not met the burden of showing an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record. The motion to seal is therefore denied.
