TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiffs
Tensor Law P.C. & Aaron G. Filler’s Motion to Seal the Filed Copy of the
Arbitration Award  or in the Alternative
to Seal the Entire Case is DENIED.  
 
            Plaintiff
has failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rules 2.550 and 2.551. (“A record must not be filed under seal
without a court order (Rule 255.1(a).)  Neither
the complaint, nor any other document has been lodged with the court “conditionally
under seal.”  (Rule 2.550(b)(3),
2.251(b)(4).)   Likewise, Plaintiff did
not file any redacted documents with the court (Id. subd. (b)(5), (b)(6).  Oddly, Plaintiff attached an unredacted copy
of the complete arbitration award to Plaintiff’s declaration that he publicly
filed on June 13, 2023, three weeks before Plaintiff filed his motion to seal
that award.  Plaintiff’s apparent belief
that simply checking a box identifying the case as a “Sealed Case” on the
e-filing index page would cause the clerk to seal the the document he filed is
wholly unfounded.  Indeed, CRC Rule 2.551
clearly states “A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.” 
“
 
            Moreover,
California law recognizes a constitutional right of access, grounded in the
First Amendment, to court proceedings and court documents. (In re Marriage
of Tamir (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 1068, 1078.)   Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to
the public. (CRC 2.550(c).)  At a
minimum, a party seeking to seal documents must come forward with a specific
list of facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them.
(H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.)  Plaintiff fails to point to the specific facts
in the arbitration award or these proceedings to be sealed, and the specific
reasons for concealing that information from the public.
            
            Most
important, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden under NBC Subsidiary, Inc. v. Supr. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178 and CRC Rule 250(d) to show: “(1) There
exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
record; (2)  The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3)
 A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4)  The proposed sealing is
narrowly tailored; and (5)  No less restrictive means exist to achieve the
overriding interest.”
