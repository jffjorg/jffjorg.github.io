And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts of the existence of a contract for the sale of real property, and the pleadings were uncertain or ambiguous. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails to state whether the alleged land sale contract was written, oral, or implied, and the Plaintiff did not attach a copy of the written instrument to the complaint. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage claim fail to plead facts that state the Defendant committed intentional or negligent acts. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to amend the complaint within 20 days.
