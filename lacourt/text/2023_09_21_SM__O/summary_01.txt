And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant New Holland LLC and grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not specify whether the contract was written, oral, or implied, and does not attach a copy of the written instrument to the complaint. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC committed intentionally wrongful acts designed to disrupt the relationship between the plaintiff and Defendant Grimm. Finally, the Judge finds that the plaintiff's negligent interference with prospective economic advantage claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not plead facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC had knowledge that the relationship would be disrupted if it failed to act with reasonable care, and failed to plead facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC failed to act with reasonable care.
