And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant New Holland LLC and grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not specify whether the contract was written, oral, or implied, and does not attach a copy of the written instrument to the complaint. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC committed intentionally wrongful acts designed to disrupt the relationship between the plaintiff and Defendant Grimm. Finally, the Judge finds that the plaintiff's negligent interference with prospective economic advantage claim fails to state a cause of action because it does not plead facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC had knowledge that the relationship would be disrupted if it failed to act with reasonable care, and failed to plead facts showing that Defendant New Holland LLC failed to act with reasonable care.

## Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22SMCV01113
**Plaintiff's Name:** Todd Graham
**Defendant's Name:** New Holland LLC (Defendant only involved in 1st, 2nd, & 3rd causes of action)
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Department:** O
**Complaint Filed:** July 13, 2022
**Trial Date:** July 8, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Demurrer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint 

**TENTATIVE RULING:** Defendant New Holland LLC's Demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.  

**Reasons for Sustaining Demurrer:**

* **1st Cause of Action (Breach of Contract):**

     * The complaint fails to state whether the alleged land sale contract was written, oral, or implied. It states all three, which is contradictory.
     *  Contracts for the sale of land in California must be in writing under the statute of frauds (Civ. Code, § 1624).
     * The complaint doesn't specify the material terms of the contract, Plaintiff's obligations, or Plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance.
     * A copy of the written contract is not attached.

* **2nd Cause of Action (Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage):**

     * The complaint lacks factual allegations demonstrating Defendant New Holland LLC committed intentionally wrongful acts to disrupt the relationship between Plaintiff and a third party (likely Grimm Investments, LLC). 
     * The complaint is unclear which Defendant is the third party and which committed the interference.

* **3rd Cause of Action (Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage):**

     *  Similar to the 2nd cause of action, the complaint lacks facts showing Defendant New Holland LLC knew disrupting the relationship would occur if they acted carelessly and failed to act with reasonable care.
     * The complaint is unclear which Defendant is the third party involved.



**Next Steps:**

Plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies outlined by the Judge. 


## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain (reject) the defendant New Holland LLC's demurrer to the plaintiff's (Todd Graham) first amended complaint. This means the plaintiff's initial legal claims are not sufficient and need to be improved.

The judge found problems with all three causes of action: breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. 

Specifically, the plaintiff needs to clarify the nature of the alleged contract, provide more details about the contract's terms and the parties involved, and offer stronger factual support for their claims of intentional or negligent interference. 

The plaintiff has 20 days to amend their complaint and address these issues.
