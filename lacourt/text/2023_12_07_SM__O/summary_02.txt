And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action for breach of written amended guaranty agreement. The defendants, Student Debt Services, LLC, Jeffrey DaPra, and Nicole Pierce, argued that the amended guaranty agreement was extinguished when they paid off the underlying loan in August 2022. However, the judge found that the defendants did not fully perform on their obligations under the guaranty and amended guaranty agreements, and therefore, the plaintiffs, Hillgreen Capital, LLC, et al., have successfully pled their first cause of action.
