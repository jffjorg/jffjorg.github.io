And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge intends to adopt the recommendations of the referee regarding the plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions against the defendant. The referee found that the defendant failed to produce text messages responsive to the plaintiff's request for production, and that the deletion of these messages from the defendant's cell phone exacerbated the problem. The referee recommended that the court award monetary sanctions against the defendant, including attorney fees incurred by the plaintiff in addressing the issue. The court also intends to hold the defendant responsible for referee fees associated with the hearing and preparation of the referee directive. The plaintiff is required to provide a supplemental brief identifying the portion of the attorney's fees incurred in connection with the initial sanctions motion that are attributable to the defendant's delay in responding to the request for production. The court continued the hearing on the parties' respective objections to the referee's report and recommendations.
