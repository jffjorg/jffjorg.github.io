And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions: (1) Defendant Paramount Pictures Corporation's motion to compel Plaintiff Dan Sackheim's further responses to special interrogatories, (2) Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from Skydance Television, LLC, and (3) Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from Platinum Dunes Productions.

The court denies Paramount's motion because its separate statement is defective. The court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Skydance's and Platinum Dunes' further responses to form interrogatories because their answers are evasive and incomplete.

The court also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Paramount, Skydance, and Platinum Dunes, finding that the circumstances do not justify the imposition of sanctions. The court orders the defendants to serve further, full, and complete answers to Plaintiff's form interrogatories within 20 days of the date of this order.
