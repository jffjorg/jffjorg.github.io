MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES FROM PLAINTIFF DAN SACKHEIM
Defendant Paramount Pictures Corporation, Inc. (“Paramount”) moves the
court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Dan Sackheim (“Plaintiff”) to
provide verified responses to Paramount’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 93,
94, 96, 97, 99, 100, 102, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, 117,
118, 120, 121, 123, 124, 126, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 137 138, 142, 144, 150,
152, 154, 155, 157, and 158, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Paramount
and against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,385.
First, the court denies Paramount’s motion to the extent that it
requests that the court compel Plaintiff’s further responses because Paramount’s
separate statement is defective.  (Mills
v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 893 [court has the discretion to
deny a motion to compel further responses for failure to comply with separate
statement requirements].) 
A “separate statement must be full and complete so that no person is
required to review any other document in order to determine the full request
and the full response . . . .  The
separate statement must include—for each discovery request . . . —the
following: [¶¶] (2) The text of each response, answer, or objection, and any
further responses or answers[.]”  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345, subd. (c)(2) [emphasis added].)  Here, Paramount’s separate statement does not
include Plaintiff’s full responses to the Special Interrogatories and therefore
is defective.  (Ibid.; See, e.g.,
Paramount Separate Statement, p. 2:17-23 [summarizing Plaintiff’s response to
Special Interrogatory no. 93] and Skalsky Decl., Ex. C, pp. 2:11-3:3
[Plaintiff’s full response to Special Interrogatory no. 93].) 
Second, the court denies Paramount’s motion to the extent that it
requests that the court compel Plaintiff’s initial responses to its Special
Interrogatories as moot because Plaintiff has presented evidence, in
opposition, showing that he has since served supplemental, verified responses
to the discovery at issue.  (Smith Decl.,
Ex. G.) 
Third, the court finds that the circumstances presented make the
imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Paramount’s request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM DEFENDANT SKYDANCE TELEVISION, LLC
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant
Skydance Television, LLC (“Skydance”) to provide further responses to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9,
and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Skydance in the
amount of $5,469.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Skydance’s further
responses to Form Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, because
Skydance’s answers to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition
of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Skydance.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM DEFENDANT PLATINUM DUNES PRODUCTIONS
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant
Platinum Dunes Productions (“Platinum Dunes”) to provide further responses to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Ones, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9,
and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Platinum Dunes in
the amount of $5,469.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Platinum Dunes’ further
responses to Form Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9, because
Platinum Dunes’ answers to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented make the imposition
of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Platinum Dunes.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
