And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Zvi Sperling's motion to compel Naomi Sperling to produce documents that Naomi had withheld as privileged. The judge was persuaded by Naomi's arguments that the mediation and/or attorney-client privilege applies to the documents. Zvi's reply brief did not alter the judge's decision.

The judge has also granted Zvi's ex parte application to specially set for hearing four discovery motions that Zvi had filed. This may lead to the trial being moved, as the motions will likely need to be heard two weeks or more from now, which is close to the final status conference and trial date.
