And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the complaint filed by defendants Amy Leibowitz and Ira Leibowitz against plaintiff Levi Strauss & Co. The judge has found that the demurrer to the first cause of action for declaratory judgment is unpersuasive and has been overruled. The judge has also found that the demurrer to the second cause of action for modification of judgment to add judgment creditors is persuasive and has been sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled the elements of alter ego liability, but has not sufficiently pled control over the underlying litigation. The judge has given the defendants 20 days to amend their pleading to add alter egos as judgment debtors.
