And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendants, Manuwal & Manuwal and Robert Manuwal, have moved to compel arbitration with the plaintiffs, Abir Cohen Treyzon Sal LLP (ACTS) and Neil Itzik Adrabi, and to stay the action. The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration as to ACTS, finding that the Attorney-Client Contingent Fee Contract (Contract) does not show that ACTS was a client/contracting party and that the defendants did not sufficiently show the existence of an Arbitration Agreement with ACTS.

As to Adrabi, the judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice but denied their motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The judge found that the defendants had shown the existence of an Arbitration Agreement with Adrabi, but the third-party litigation exception applies. The judge has denied arbitration, exercising its discretion to refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement due to the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact.
