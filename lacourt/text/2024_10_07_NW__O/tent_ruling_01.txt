III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.       Request for Production of Documents 
In responding to a request for
production of documents, a party must provide one of the following: (1) a
legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210(a).) If any objections are made, they
must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made”; and (2) “[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground
for, the objection.”¿(Id. at § 2031.240(b).) A statement that
the responding party is unable to comply with a particular demand (1) “shall
affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an
effort to comply with that demand”; “shall also specify whether the inability
to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has
been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is
no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party”;  and “shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” (Id. at § 2031.230.) 
A party who
believes that a responding party has served (1) an incomplete statement of
compliance, (2) an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive statement of compliance,
or (3) an unmeritorious objection can move for an order compelling further
responses but must “set forth specific acts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (See id. at §§
2031.310(a)-(b)(1).) 
B.            
Interrogatories 
A propounding party may move for an order
compelling further responses to interrogatories if the responding party produced
an evasive or incomplete answer or a meritless or overly general objection in
response to an interrogatory. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(a).) A
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories lies where the party to
whom the interrogatories were directed gave responses deemed improper by the
propounding party; e.g., objections, or evasive or incomplete answers. (See
id. at § 2030.300.)¿The
moving party must also include reasons why further answers should be ordered:
legal or factual arguments why the answers given were incomplete or
nonresponsive, or the objections invalid.¿(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) 
However, where a timely motion to has been
filed, “the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
answer the interrogatories.”¿(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil
Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2017) ¶ 8:1179.)¿“The ruling usually is based on consideration
of the following factors: [¶] the relationship of the information sought to the
issues framed in the pleadings; [¶] the likelihood that disclosure will be of
practical benefit to the party seeking discovery; [¶] the burden or expense
likely to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information
sought.”¿(Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior
Court (Rolfe) (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19.)
IV.         
NOTICE
A.            
Compel Further Discovery Responses 
Notice of a
motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service of
verified responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.230(c),
2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).) If such notice is not given, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response. (See id.)¿¿ ¿¿
Here, notice
was timely. Plaintiff served its supplemental responses via e-mail on July 26,
2024. (See Declaration of David Larsen filed September 9, 2024 (“Larsen
Decl.”), ¶ 5, Ex. D.) Kingston filed the instant Motion on September 9, 2024,
within the 45-day window. (See Motion.) 
V.            
MEET AND CONFER
A.            
Compel Further Discovery Responses 
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented
by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery motion
should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Kingston did not meet and confer with Plaintiff after Plaintiff
filed his supplemental responses on July 26, 2024. (See Larsen Decl., ¶¶
5-6; see also Opposition, pp. 2-3.) Kingston’s lack of meet and confer
does not demonstrate a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of the issues presented in the Motion. As such, Kingston’s Motion is
DENIED.   
VI.         
ANALYSIS
Because the
Court is denying Kingston’s Motion for failure to properly meet and confer, the
Court will not analyze the substance of Kingston’s Motion. However, the Court
notes Kingston filed one motion for two separate discovery requests—its
RFPs and its SROGS. A motion must be brought separately against each party and
discovery method at issue. The instant Motion should have been filed as two separate
motions and two filing fees paid. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory
and jurisdictional.” (Hu v. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70
Cal.App.4th 1261, 1269.) Additionally, as motions under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2030.300 and § 2031.310 each require separate statements under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, the effect is to require that each request for
further response for RFPs, special interrogatories, or form interrogatories be
filed with a separate motion as a matter of course, as the party is requesting
relief as to a specific and distinct discovery request.
Accordingly,
Kingston’s Motion is also DENIED for failure to file two separate motions for
each of its discovery requests. 
VII.      
SANCTIONS
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel¿. . .” responses to
interrogatories, requests for production, or request for admission, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(c).) Similarly,¿“[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery
process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order
to provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d),
(g).) 
The Court will not award sanctions against Kingston
as it did not prevail on its Motion. 
Plaintiff seeks $2,750.00 in discovery sanctions,
which accounts for 3.0 hours to draft the Opposition and 2.0 hours to review
any reply and appear at the hearing, at a billing rate of $550.00/hr.
The Court finds Kingston’s counsel’s failure to meet
and confer prior to filing the motion to be misuse of the discovery process as
contemplated by the code. The Court disagrees with Kingston’s argument in its
Reply that the totality of the circumstances rendered its approach was
satisfactory. To the contrary, a single email that merely listed 15 discovery
requests for which it wanted supplemental responses and only stated its reasons
for two of them falls woefully short of the standard.
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate of
$550.00 reasonable given the prevailing rates in the Greater Los Angeles for
attorneys with her level of experience. However, given the speed at which this
Court expects someone of Plaintiff’s counsel’s skillset and hourly rate to
work, the Court finds it appropriate to reduce the discovery sanctions award by
3 hours. In total, the Court finds it appropriate to award Plaintiff’s counsel
$1,100.00. 
Kingston’s counsel shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel discovery
sanctions in the amount of $1,100.00 on or before October 31, 2024.

VIII.   
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Kingston’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Document Production, Set One.
The Court
also orders Kingston’s counsel to pay Plaintiff’s counsel monetary sanctions in
the amount of $1,100.00 on or before October 31, 2024. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
