On the morning of 02/24/2022 at approximately 7:57am, a caregiver employed by defendants, who was supposed to have been providing the decedent with 24-hour home health care, found the decedent lying face down on the bathroom floor in a pool of her own blood. She was rushed to the hospital and spent eight excruciating days in the hospital on life support. On 03/04/2022, the decedent was pronounced dead from brain hemorrhage. The caregiver employed by the defendants admits in a 911 emergency call to having just woken-up five minutes ago, despite “Daily Caregiver Notes,” filled-out and submitted to State Farm for payment by defendants that indicates said employee was supposed to be providing 24-hour home health care to the decedent for the nighttime hours of 02/23/22, through the early morning hours of 02/24/22.On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence (wrongful death), (2) negligence (survivor action), (3) negligence per se, (4) negligent hiring, supervision, or retention, (5) fraud (intentional misrepresentation, (6) fraud (negligent misrepresentation), (7) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (8) violation of Unfair Competition Laws, and (9) violation of California’s False Advertising Laws.On October 20, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) as to both Defendants.On November 17, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories (set three) as to both Defendants.On November 28, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Caring Hearts, Caring Hands to provide responses to request for production (set three).On November 29, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Tolentino to provide responses to request for production (set three).On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating and monetary sanctions. On December 29, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition. On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.On January 19, 2024, this Court continued the matter to allow Defendants one final opportunity to comply with the Court order to respond to all of the discovery requests at issue. On January 19, 2024, Defendants filed a supplemental declaration.Legal StandardCCP section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that "[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery....""The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionPlaintiff moves for terminating and monetary sanctions against Defendants on the ground that Defendants failed to comply with the Court's orders compelling them to respond to discovery.On October 20, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) as to both Defendants.
