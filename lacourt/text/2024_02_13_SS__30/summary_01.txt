And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by State Farm Mutual Insurance Company to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $5,384.50 against Brandon Scott Cameron. The parties had stipulated for dismissal and settlement, and the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement and enter judgment in the event of default. Despite making some payments, Cameron has defaulted on the remaining payments, and State Farm is entitled to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered. The judgment amount is calculated as the principal amount of $10,000, minus the $5,000 payment made by Cameron's insurance carrier, and minus the $200 payments made by Cameron, with the addition of $584.50 in costs.
