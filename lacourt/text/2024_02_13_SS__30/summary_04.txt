Significant Statements:

(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390)

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendants. The motion is denied. The defendants failed to comply with the court's orders to respond to discovery requests, but have now served responses to the requests. The court finds that the defendants' failure to comply with the orders was not willful, and that the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions is not justified. The court notes that the defendants' failure to comply with the orders was likely due to their failure to retain counsel in a timely manner, and that the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions is not a proportionate response to the defendants' failure to comply with the court's orders.
