And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the petition to approve a settlement for a minor (LA, age 6) and has made a tentative ruling. The settlement is reasonable, but the Court has identified two defects that prevent the approval of the petition at this time. Firstly, the Court finds that the requested 40% attorney's fees is excessive and recommends a 25% fee. Secondly, the Court notes that the petition lacks a declaration of written assurance, as required by Probate Code 3401(c)(2). As a result, the Court has continued the hearing for 60 days to allow the parties to correct these defects. The Court has also ordered the distribution of the settlement proceeds: 25% for attorney's fees, $300 for costs, and the remainder to be delivered to the parent.
