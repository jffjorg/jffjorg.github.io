 Case Number:  21STCV19405    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  30 ELIZABETH VIVIANA ACOSTA, et al. vs SUNG CHIL YOON, et al.TENTATIVEThe Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor (LA, age 6). The Court finds the settlement is reasonable, however, the following defects preclude the granting of the petition at this time:(1) The Court has considered the declaration of counsel in support of 40% fee request. The Court finds that on the current record, and in consideration of the factors set forth in Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b), a fee of 25% of the gross settlement is reasonable. The Court must apply a reasonable fee standard in approving attorney’s fees in a minor’s compromise petition. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(a).) The Court finds that 25% in attorney’s fees for a minor’s compromise petition is more than reasonable, unless a higher award can be justified. Here, there are no atypical actions by Counsel to justify a higher award.Therefore, the Court approves the following distribution of the settlement proceeds:Attorney’s fees (25%) $750Medical Expenses n/aCosts $300Total fees and costs $1,050Total Settlement $3,000Less costs $1,050Net settlement to be delivered to parent $1,950(2) Petitioner has not filed a declaration of written assurance. (Probate Code 3401(c)(2).)Accordingly, the matter is CONTINUED for 60 days, to a date convenient to Court and parties, for an 1:30 p.m. hearing in Department SS-30. Counsel is ordered to correct the defects by filing a corrected proposed order with the above distribution, and file Petitioner’s declaration of written assurance. All submitted paperwork must be filed at least 5 days prior to the next hearing date.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
