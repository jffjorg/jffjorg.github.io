  Case Number:  18STCV04358    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  30 STATE FARM MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY vs BRANDON SCOTT CAMERONTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion to set aside dismissal and enter judgment is GRANTED.Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Brandon Scott Cameron in the amount of $5,384.50.BackgroundOn November 6, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company filed a complaint for subrogation against Defendant Brandon Scott Cameron.On February 3, 2022, the case was dismissed after the parties stipulated for dismissal due to settlement. The Court retained jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement, including judgment, pursuant to CCP section 664.6.On December 5, 2023, State Farm filed a motion to set aside dismissal and for entry of judgment. No opposition has been filed.Legal StandardCCP section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)DiscussionPlaintiff seeks a court order setting aside the dismissal and entering judgment against Defendant pursuant to CCP section 664.6.A. Retention of Jurisdiction“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917 [quoting In re Conservatorship of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 967) (alteration in original).) “‘If requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.’” (Id. (quoting CCP section 664.6) (emphasis in original).) “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)Here, the parties filed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (Reese Decl., ¶ 2-3, Ex. A.) The Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court along with an order for dismissal and court retaining jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section 664.6 prior to dismissal of this case. The Court entered the order for dismissal and court retaining jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section 664.6 on February 3, 2022. As the Stipulation complies with CCP section 664.6 requirements, the Court has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this action.B. Entry of JudgmentPursuant to the parties’ Stipulation, Defendant would pay Plaintiff a total of $10,000 as follows: $5,000 to be paid by Defendant’s insurance carrier, and the remainder to be paid by Defendant, by making monthly payments of $100 beginning December 1, 2021, until paid in full. (Id., Ex. A, ¶ 2.) The Stipulation provides that “If defendant fails to make a timely payment, said failure is a material breach. In such event, plaintiff will mail defendant a letter advising that a payment has not been received. If the payment is not made within14 days, then plaintiff will be entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered for the settlement amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs the court requires to enter judgment or costs associated with any procedure to have the judgment entered. (Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment in the amount of $5,000. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant made monthly payments pursuant to the stipulation totaling $200, however, Defendant has since defaulted on payments. (Id., ¶ 5.) Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, on or about October 4, 2023, Plaintiff mailed Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments. (Id., ¶ 6; Ex. C.) Pursuant to the terms set forth in the Agreement, since payment was not made within fourteen (14) days, Plaintiff is entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered, minus credit for payments received. (Id., ¶ 7.)Plaintiff seeks entry of judgment against Defendant in a total amount of $3,084.50 calculated as follows:The principal amount: $10,000Costs: $584.50 ($435 filing fee; $89.50 service of process fee; and 60.00 motion fee)Less payments made by or on behalf of Defendant to Plaintiff: $5,200Total: $5,384.50As Defendant has defaulted, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of such judgment under the Stipulation. As such, the Court grants the motion and enters judgment in the amount of $5,384.50 against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff.
