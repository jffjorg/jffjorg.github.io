Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to approve the minor's compromise (Noah Zelaya, age 10) and has found the settlement to be reasonable. However, the judge has identified a defect in the petition and proposed order, which relates to the incorrect calculation of the medical expenses. The judge orders the parties to file a corrected petition and proposed order, which must include the correct distribution of funds. The judge also orders the moving party to give notice of the corrected petition. The petition is continued for 90 days one final time.
