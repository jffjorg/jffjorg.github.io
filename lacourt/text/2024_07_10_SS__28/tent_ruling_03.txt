 Case Number:  20STCV40002    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  28           Having set an
order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement), the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 19, 2020, Plaintiffs Dalilah Villalobos, by and through her guardian ad
litem Laura Eggleston, and Catalina Villalobos, by and through her guardian ad
litem Maria Dominguez, filed this action against Defendants Final Touch
Construction & Design, Luis Anthony Echeverria, Luis M. Echeverria, Chantra
Sun, Lorraine Garcia, Gus Garcia, and Does 1-50 for wrongful death (motor
vehicle negligence). 
On
October 20, 2020, the Court appointed Laura Eggleston to serve as guardian ad
litem for Plaintiff Dalilah Villalobos. 
On October 29, 2020, the Court appointed Maria Dominguez to serve as
guardian ad litem for Catalina Villalobos. 
On
May 6, 2022, Defendants and Cross-Complainants Final Touch Construction &
Design, Luis Anthony Echeverria, and Luis M. Echeverria filed an answer and
a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Roes 1-25 for equitable/implied
indemnity, apportionment and contribution, and declaratory relief. 
On
May 31, 2022, Defendant Chantra Sun filed an answer.  In addition, Cross-Complainant Chantra Sun,
individually and as successor-in-interest to the Estate of Katrina Ariana
Wilkins-Sun, filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Final Touch Construction & Design, Luis Anthony
Echeverria, Luis M. Echeverria, and Roes 1-100 for negligence, wrongful death and survival action damages,
equitable/implied indemnity, comparative contribution, apportionment, and tort
of another. 
On
November 29, 2022 and January 4, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendants Lorraine
Garcia and Gus Garcia without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
June 14, 2023, Cross-Complainant Chantra Sun filed a notice of unconditional
settlement of the entire case on June 5, 2023. 
On
August 28, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel asked the Court for additional time to
submit petitions for approval of minors’ compromises.  In response, the Court set an order to show cause re: dismissal
(settlement) and a status conference re: filing of a petition to approve minor’s
compromise for November 28, 2023. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel asked the Court for a continuance to
finish negotiations on the Medi-Cal lien and to file petitions to approve minor’s
compromises.  The Court continued the order
to show cause re: dismissal (settlement) and the status conference re: filing
of a petition to approve minor's compromise to March 8, 2024. 
On
March 8, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel did not appear, contact the Court to explain
the non-appearance, file a petition to approve minor’s
compromise, or submit a declaration showing good cause. The Court continued the order to show cause re: dismissal
(settlement) and status conference re: filing of a petition to approve minor's compromise
to April 24, 2024 and ordered counsel to file a declaration at least two court
days before April 24, 2024 regarding the status of the petitions and counsel's
failure to appear. 
On
April 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating his failure to
appear at the March 8, 2024 hearing was due to mistake, inadvertence and/or
excusable neglect.  Counsel stated: (1)
the matter had settled, (2) he was filing petitions to approve minor’s
compromises, and (3) he had reserved hearings on the petitions for May 21, 2024.
 Counsel asked the Court to continue the
order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement) and status conference re: filing
of a petition to approve minor's compromise for 90 days. 
On
April 24, 2024, the Court continued the order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement)
and status conference re: filing of a petition to approve minor's compromise to
May 28, 2024.  The Court ordered that the
hearings on petitions to confirm minor’s compromise reserved for May 28, 2024
were to go forward and moving papers were to be filed timely. 
On
May 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating that he did not
file the petitions to approve minor’s compromise timely because "the guardian ad litems were still selecting the
annuity structure for the respective claimants" and counsel was still waiting
for fully executed annuity documents. 
On May 28, 2024, the Court continued the order to show cause
re: dismissal (settlement) and status conference re: filing of a petition to approve
minor's compromise to July 10, 2024. 
Plaintiffs
have not filed petitions to approve minors’ compromises and have not submitted
a new declaration showing good cause why the Court should not dismiss the action. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
583.410 provides: 
“(a) The court may in its discretion dismiss an action
for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own motion or on
motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court appropriate under the
circumstances of the case. 
“(b) Dismissal shall be pursuant to the procedure and
in accordance with the criteria prescribed by rules adopted by the Judicial
Council.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.410.) 
          “A discretionary dismissal under [Code of Civil Procedure
section 583.410] (or for other delay in prosecution) is ‘without prejudice’ to
renewed litigation.”  (L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
11:190.2, p. 11-83.) 
          California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, provides in part: 
“(b) Dismissal of case 
“Except as provided in (c) or (d), each plaintiff or
other party seeking affirmative relief must serve and file a request for
dismissal of the entire case within 45 days after the date of settlement of the
case. If the plaintiff or other party required to serve and file the request
for dismissal does not do so, the court must dismiss the entire case 45 days
after it receives notice of settlement unless good cause is shown why the case
should not be dismissed. 
* * *
 “(d) Compromise of claims of a minor or disabled
person 
“If the settlement of the case involves the compromise
of the claim of a minor or person with a disability, the court must not hold an
order to show cause hearing under (b) before the court has held a hearing to
approve the settlement, provided the parties have filed appropriate papers to
seek court approval of the settlement.” 
“(e) Request for additional time to complete
settlement 
“If a party who has served and filed a notice of
settlement under (a) determines that the case cannot be dismissed within the
prescribed 45 days, that party must serve and file a notice and a supporting
declaration advising the court of that party's inability to dismiss the case
within the prescribed time, showing good cause for its inability to do so, and
proposing an alternative date for dismissal. The notice and a supporting
declaration must be served and filed at least 5 court days before the time for
requesting dismissal has elapsed. If good cause is shown, the court must
continue the matter to allow additional time to complete the settlement. The
court may take such other actions as may be appropriate for the proper
management and disposition of the case.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, subds. (b), (d), (e).) 
DISCUSSION 
As
noted, on June 14, 2023, Cross-Complainant Chantra Sun filed a notice of unconditional
settlement of the entire case. 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel confirmed the settlement by
asking the Court for additional time to submit petitions to approve minor’s
compromises.  The Court granted the continuance request and granted counsel’s subsequent continuance requests on November 28, 2023, April
24, 2024, and May 28, 2024. 
It
is now more than one year after the parties settled the case.  Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385(b),
except as provided in subdivisions (c) or (d), the Court “must dismiss the
entire case 45 days after it receives notice of settlement unless good cause is
shown why the case should not be dismissed.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1385(b).)  
Subdivision
(c) of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, applies only to conditional
settlements.  The notice of settlement
here states the settlement was unconditional. 
Therefore, subdivision (c) does not apply here. 
Subdivision
(d) of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, states that “[i]f the settlement
of the case involves the compromise of the claim of a minor or person with a
disability, the court must not hold an order to show cause hearing under (b)
before the court has held a hearing to approve the settlement, provided the
parties have filed appropriate papers to seek court approval of the settlement.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1385(d), emphasis
added.)  Here, Plaintiffs have not filed
appropriate papers to seek Court approval of the settlement.  Therefore, subdivision (d) does not prevent the Court from holding an order to show cause hearing. 
The
Court set the July 10, 2024 order to show cause hearing on May 28, 2024.  Plaintiffs have submitted no papers since May
28, 2024 demonstrating good cause why the case should not be dismissed. 
The
Court dismisses the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 and California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1385(b). 
CONCLUSION 
          Having issued an order to show cause re: dismissal
(settlement) on May 28, 2024, and no good cause having been shown, the Court
dismisses the case without prejudice under
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 and California Rules of Court, rule
3.1385(b). 
          The Court will give notice of this ruling.
