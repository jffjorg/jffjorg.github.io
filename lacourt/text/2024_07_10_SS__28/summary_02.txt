And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Plaintiff Hongde Cui filed a complaint against Defendant Daniel Yanez and others on October 16, 2020. Defendant Yanez filed an answer on March 7, 2022. Plaintiff's counsel was relieved on July 17, 2023, and Plaintiff has not appeared at any hearings or filed any papers since then. The Court has considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(e), and the policies listed in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.130 and concludes that dismissal is appropriate based on Plaintiff's failure to prosecute the case. Therefore, the Court exercises its discretionary authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420, subdivision (a)(2), and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1340, and dismisses Plaintiff's case against Defendant Yanez. The Court also denies as moot Defendant Yanez's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition.
