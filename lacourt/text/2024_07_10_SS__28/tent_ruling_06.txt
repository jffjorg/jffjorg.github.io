 Case Number:  22STCV20019    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental papers, the Court
rules as follows. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
On
June 20, 2022, Plaintiff Amanda Montano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”)
and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to include Defendant Joseph Aquino (“Aquino”) as Doe 1. 
On
July 27, 2022, Metro filed an answer. 
On
December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Metro to produce its
employee Joseph Aquino to attend a deposition and testify.  The motion was set to be heard on March 20,
2024.  On March 6, 2024, Metro filed an
opposition.  On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a reply. 
On
March 20, 2024, the Court issued an order noting that while Metro was willing
to provide Aquino for a deposition, he was on a medical leave. The Court
continued the hearing to May 28, 2024 and ordered Metro to provide an update on
when Aquino would be available for deposition. 
On
April 25, 2024, the Court dismissed Aquino without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
May 24, 2024, Metro filed a supplemental response asserting that Aquino was
still on medical leave, was unable to endure a deposition, and was hopeful that
he will return to work in August 2024.  Metro
submitted its attorney’s declaration to support the supplemental response and
asked the Court to continue the hearing for 90 days. 
On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response arguing that the attorney declaration attached
to Metro’s May 24, 2024 supplemental response did not show the attorney could
competently testify about Aquino’s ability to testify.  Plaintiff also asserted that sub rosa surveillance
showed “a man identified as Joseph Aquino engaged in a variety of activities,
including carrying objects, driving an automobile, and other activities” who “displays
no sign that to a lay observer what would indicate weakness, illness, or
incapacity of any kind, i.e., any justification for ‘medical leave’.”  Plaintiff charged that Metro was claiming
Aquino was on medical leave as a ploy or pretext to avoid a deposition.  Plaintiff asked the Court to deny Metro’s
request for a continuance, to compel Metro to produce Aquino for a deposition,
and to impose sanctions. 
On
May 28, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and
continued the hearing to July 10, 2024. 
On
July 3, 2024, Metro filed its counsel’s declaration stating that on July 2, 2024,
Aquino told counsel (1) he is still on medical leave and expects to return to
work in or around January 2025, (2) due to health concerns, he could not attend
a deposition before he returns to work, and (3) he would be available for a
deposition in February 2025. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for November 20, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to compel Metro to produce Aquino for deposition and award
sanctions. 
Metro
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.280, subdivision (a), provides: 
“The service of a deposition notice under Section
2025.240 is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or
an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
* * *
  “(g) (1) If a
motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Background 
On
October 5, 2023, Plaintiff noticed Aquino’s deposition for October 27,
2023.  On October 17, 2023, Metro served
an objection. 
On
October 24, 2023, Plaintiff served a notice of continuance of Aquino’s
deposition to November 7, 2023. 
Counsel
later agreed to continue the deposition to December 8, 2023.  In the emails negotiating this continuance,
Plaintiff’s counsel stated: “Ok Let's continue it to 12/8. But, I don't want
the counsel to come back and argue it's beyond the 11/18 disc cut off date. I
will push the depo to 12/8, upon the condition that no beyond dic-cut off date
is used as an excuse.”  Defendant’s
counsel’s paralegal responded, “Agreed for 12/8.  Thank you for your cooperation.”  On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff noticed Aquino’s
deposition for December 8, 2023. 
On
December 5, 2023, Metro served an objection to the deposition notice.  The objection stated: 
“Testimony sought concerning training, supervision,
hiring, policies and procedures is not relevant nor designed to lead to
discovery of relevant documents as there is no cause of action for negligent
hiring, training, or supervision in this matter and a public entity cannot be
liable or general negligence, but only where a statutory basis exists for
imposing liability. See, de Villers v. City of San Diego (2007) 156 Cal. App.
4th 238, 252-53; Munoz v. City of Union City, 2004) 120 Cal. App.4th 1077, 1110-15.
This principle has also been applied to non-public entities. Once an employer
admits vicarious liability for any negligent driving of an employee in the
course of employment, that admission bars a plaintiff from pursuing a cause of
action against the employer for negligent entrustment, hiring, retention,
training, supervision, etc. Diaz v. Carcamo, (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 1148, 1158-61.
Accordingly, the California Supreme Court also held that evidence of the
employee's prior accidents, ‘bad’ driving record, employment history and
similar evidence was inadmissible, since it creates the highly prejudicial risk
that the trier of act will find that the employee drove negligently based not
upon evidence at the accident at issue, but upon an inference drawn from the
evidence of past accidents, etc. Diaz, supra, at 1161.
          "The deposition is past the
discovery cut-off pursuant to CCP § 2024.020. Additionally, there is a calendar
conflict for an expert deposition for the same date and time.”  (Bold in original.) 
Plaintiff
responded that Metro waived the objection based on the discovery cut-off date
when Metro’s counsel agreed to the December 8, 2023 deposition date. 
On
December 8, 2023, Aquino did not attend the deposition.  Plaintiff’s counsel took a certificate of
non-appearance and contacted Metro’s counsel to ask about the
non-appearance.  Metro’s counsel told
Plaintiff’s counsel that Aquino would not attend the deposition. 
B.   Parties’ arguments 
Based
on the facts described above, Plaintiff argues the Court should compel Metro to
produce Aquino for his deposition. 
In
opposition, Metro argues it served valid objections to Plaintiff’s deposition
notices.  Metro also argues that it
agreed to proceed with the December 8, 2023 deposition, even though it was
after the discovery cut-off.  Metro
asserts that it entered into this agreement because it was “under the
impression that Plaintiff [was] agreeable to a stipulation to reopen discovery
. . . .”  (Opposition p. 2.)   Metro asserts that Plaintiff subsequently
refused to stipulate to reopen discovery. 
Yet Metro has presented no evidence that it conditioned its agreement to
schedule the deposition on December 8, 2023 on Plaintiff stipulating to reopen
discovery. 
Finally,
Metro argues that it agreed to produce Aquino for a deposition on February 20,
2024, but then learned that Aquino was on medical leave.  Due to Aquino’s medical condition, Metro
argues, it cannot produce him for a deposition until February 2025. 
C.   Analysis 
1.    Metro’s
objections to Plaintiff's deposition notice 
Metro
has not shown that it asserted valid objections to Plaintiff's notice
scheduling the deposition for December 8, 2023. 
Metro electronically served the objections on December 5, 2023, three
days before the scheduled deposition. 
However, “if [objections are] made on the third day preceding the
deposition, personal service is required on the party noticing the
deposition.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:508, p.
8E-31, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a), (b).)  Therefore, Metro did not properly serve the
objections. 
In
addition, a valid objection is one that identifies errors and irregularities
that prevent a deposition notice from “comply[ing] with Article 2 (commencing
with [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 2025.210) . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a); see
P. Knighten, Cal. Judges Benchbook: Civil Proceedings, Discovery (Thomson
Reuters 2022) § 15.16, pp. 371-372 [listing valid ground for objecting to
deposition subpoena].)  Metro’s
objections do not meet this standard. 
Metro’s
objections based on relevance and lack of discoverability are not valid.  These objections do not identify errors or
irregularities that prevent Plaintiff’s deposition notice from complying with
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 to 2025.295.  Metro may make appropriate objections during
the deposition. 
Metro
waived its objection to scheduling the December 8, 2023 deposition after the
discovery cut-off date.  Plaintiff’s
counsel specifically asked that in return for Plaintiff setting the deposition
on December 8, 2023, Metro not argue the deposition was scheduled after the
discovery cut-off date.  Metro’s
counsel’s paralegal did not object to this request when she agreed to the
December 8, 2023 deposition date. 
Plaintiff’s counsel was justified in believing that Metro agreed to
proceed with the deposition on December 8, 2023 notwithstanding the discovery
cut-off.  Indeed, Metro concedes that it
entered into this agreement but argues it did so “under the impression that
Plaintiff [was] agreeable to a stipulation to reopen discovery . . . .”  (Opposition p. 2.)  As noted, Metro has not shown that it
conditioned its agreement to the December 8, 2023 deposition date on a
reopening of discovery. 
Metro’s
objection based on a calendar conflict with an expert witness deposition does
not identify an error or irregularity that prevented Plaintiff’s deposition
notice from complying with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 to
2025.295. 
The
Court concludes that Metro’s objections did not justify Plaintiff’s failure to
appear at the December 8, 2023 deposition. 
2.    Aquino’s
medical condition 
          In Metro’s March 6, 2024 opposition to Plaintiff’s motion,
Metro stated that some time before February 20, 2024, “Metro’s counsel was
informed that Operator Aquino has been on medical leave, without an estimated
return date.”  (March 6, 2024 Opposition
p. 2.)  Metro did not explain who gave
its counsel this information or how Metro verified its truth. 
On
May 24, 2024, Metro filed a supplemental response asserting that Aquino was
still on medical leave, was unable to endure a deposition, and was hopeful that
he will return to work in August 2024.  The attached attorney’s declaration did not state the source of this information or how
Metro verified its truth. 
On
July 3, 2024, Metro filed its counsel’s declaration stating that on July 2,
2024, Aquino told counsel (1) he is still on medical leave and expects to
return to work in or around January 2025, (2) due to health concerns, he could
not attend a deposition before he returns to work, and (3) he would be
available for a deposition in February 2025. 
Although counsel’s declaration identified Aquino as the source of this
information, Metro has provided no information verifying the truth of Aquino’s
statements or explaining why his medical condition prevents him from attending
a deposition until February 2025. 
Initially,
Metro argued that it could not force an employee who is on medical leave to
attend a deposition.  Metro’s current
position is that Aquino’s medical condition prevents him from attending a
deposition until February 2025.  But
Metro has not established that Aquino is unable to attend his deposition for
medical reasons.  In reaching this
conclusion, the Court has not considered Plaintiff’s “sub rosa” evidence.  Instead, the Court declines to accept Aquino’s
assertion (via counsel’s declaration) as true without evidentiary support.  In particular, Metro has not provided a letter from Aquino's medical provider supporting his assertions.  Metro could have provided a
letter from Aquino’s medical provider without violating Aquino’s privacy rights
because Aquino has waived those rights to the extent that he has allowed Metro’s
counsel to disclose his assertion that his medical condition prevents him from
attending a deposition.  Having failed to
present evidence from Aquino’s medical provider supporting Aquino’s assertion
of medical unavailability, Metro has not established that Aquino is unavailable
for deposition until February 2025. 
The
Court grants the motion. 
3.    Sanctions 
Sanctions
are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision
(g)(1), unless the Court finds that “the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2024.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
The
Court finds that Metro has not acted with substantial justification in failing
to produce Aquino for deposition. 
          Plaintiff
requests $2,832.25 in sanctions based on five hours of attorney’s time at a
rate of $250.00 per hour, a digital reporter’s bill of $909.50, a certified
videographer’s bill of $612.75, and a $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent three hours to draft the moving
papers and anticipated spending two hours to travel to and attend the
hearing.  The Court awards $2,332.25
based on three hours of attorney time, the filing fee, and the bills from the
digital reporter and certified videographer. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Amanda Montano’s motion to compel Defendant Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s motion to compel the deposition
of employee Joseph Aquino.  The Court
orders Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
make employee Joseph Aquino available for deposition within 30 days from the
date of the Court’s ruling at a mutually agreeable date and time. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Amanda Montano’s request for sanctions and orders
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its
counsel to pay Plaintiff Amanda Montano $2,332.25 within 30 days of the Court’s
ruling. 
Moving
party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. 
Moving
party is to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
