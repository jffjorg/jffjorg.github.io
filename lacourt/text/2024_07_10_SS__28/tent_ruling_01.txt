  Case Number:  20STCV17676    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
          On May 8, 2020, Plaintiff Henry
Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Jill Renner
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
January 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
January 10, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, to be heard on
February 22, 2024.  On January 11, 2024,
Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to demand
for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions, to be heard on February
23, 2024 and (2) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to special
interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, to be heard on February 22, 2024. 
On
February 22, 2024, the Court placed the motions off calendar because the
parties had not participated in an informal discovery conference. 
On
February 28, 2024, Defendant scheduled an informal discovery conference for
March 22, 2024 and filed an informal discovery conference form. 
On
March 8, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to appear in person or remotely via
LACourtConnect, or appear through counsel other than Randall Awad (who is not
eligible to practice law), on March 13, 2024, and inform the Court whether
Plaintiff intends to seek another attorney to represent him or whether
Plaintiff will proceed without counsel. 
On
March 13, 2024, Plaintiff appeared and asked for additional time to find new
counsel.  The Court continued certain
hearing dates. 
On
March 22, 2024, the Court continued the informal discovery conference to April
17, 2024. 
On
April 17, 2024, Plaintiff appeared and stated that he intended to find new
counsel. The Court continued the informal discovery conference to May 17, 2024. 
On
May 17, 2024, the Court conducted an informal discovery conference with
Plaintiff and Defendant’s counsel.  Defendant’s
counsel agreed to re-send the discovery requests and motions to compel further
responses and to give Plaintiff 20 days to respond without objections if
Plaintiff would allow Defendant to file the motions after the 20 days.  The Court suggested the parties discuss filing
deadlines to see if the parties could stipulate to deadlines. 
On June
14, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel further responses to demand for production
of documents, set one, and for sanctions, to be heard on July 10, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 16, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS
          Defendant asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to provide
further responses to demand for production of documents, set one, and to impose
sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply: 
“(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. 
“(2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
“(3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
each of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this
motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand. 
* * *
 “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
DISCUSSION 
          On August 1, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to demand for production of documents, set one,
and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by August 31, 2023. 
          On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff served verified responses
to the demand for production of documents. 
Considering the responses inadequate, Defendant filed a motion to compel
further responses on January 11, 2024. 
The Court took the motion off calendar because Defendant had not
scheduled or participated in an informal discovery conference.  (In addition, the motion appears to have been
untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c).) 
          After participating in an informal discovery conference on
May 17, 2024, Defendant filed another motion to compel further responses on
June 14, 2024.  The motion is untimely
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c), which
provides: “Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service
of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff served verified responses on
September 25, 2023.  Defendant has not
shown that Plaintiff served supplemental responses or that the parties agreed
in writing to allow Defendant to file a motion to compel further responses more
than 45 days after service of the verified responses.  Therefore, Defendant was required to file a
motion to compel further responses within 45 days of September 25, 2023 – that is,
by November 9, 2023. 
On May 20, 2024, Defendant filed a notice stating that, at the May 17, 2024 informal discovery conference, the parties agreed that, if Plaintiff did not provide full and complete
objection-free answers and documents within 20 days, “Defendant will file
Motions to Compel against Plaintiff . . . .” 
Defendant’s notice does not constitute an “agreement in writing” for purposes
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c).  At most, it memorializes Defendant’s
understanding of Plaintiff’s purported oral agreement. 
Defendant
has waived her right to compel further responses.  The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION    
          The Court DENIES Defendant Jill Renner’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Henry Martinez’s further responses
to demand for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling within five days.
