Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has set an order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement) and has ruled that the case will be dismissed without prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385(b). The case was settled on June 5, 2023, but the plaintiffs have failed to file petitions to approve the minor's compromises and have not submitted a declaration showing good cause why the case should not be dismissed. The judge has allowed multiple continuances for the plaintiffs to file the necessary documents, but the case has not been resolved. Therefore, the judge has decided to dismiss the case without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to re-file the case if necessary.
