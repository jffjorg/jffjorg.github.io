And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), to produce one of its employees, Joseph Aquino, for a deposition. The plaintiff originally filed the motion to compel in December 2023, but Metro claimed that Aquino was unavailable for deposition due to medical leave. Metro produced various declarations and documents in support of its position, but the plaintiff argued that these were insufficient and that Aquino was able to attend a deposition, citing "sub rosa" surveillance footage.

The judge found that Metro's objections to the deposition notice were invalid and that Metro had not acted with substantial justification in failing to produce Aquino for deposition. The judge also found that Metro had not provided sufficient evidence to support Aquino's claims of medical unavailability and noted that Aquino's medical provider had not been contacted or presented as evidence.

As a result, the judge is ordering Metro to make Aquino available for deposition within 30 days from the date of the ruling at a mutually agreeable date and time. The judge is also awarding sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $2,332.25, which includes the costs of the deposition and attorney's fees.
