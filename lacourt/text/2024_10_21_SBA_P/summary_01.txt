And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiffs, Lauren Hogan and Armando Hogan. The defendants are seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the complaint does not state a cause of action and that the plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to support their claims.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained, meaning that the complaint does not state a cause of action. The court has found that the plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to support their claims, particularly with regard to the defendants' knowledge of the dangerous propensities of the dogs involved.

The judge has also ruled that the motion to strike is sustained, meaning that the plaintiffs' allegations are stricken from the complaint. The court has found that the plaintiffs' allegations are conclusory and do not provide sufficient facts to support their claims.

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to amend their complaint, finding that there is no possibility of successful amendment. The court has determined that the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient facts to support their claims and that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action.

The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling to the plaintiffs.
