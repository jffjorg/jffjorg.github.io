And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a continuation of the hearing on demurrer filed by Bank of America, N.A. ("BANA") against the complaint filed by Dianires Majano and Rudy Majano (collectively, "Plaintiffs"). The complaint alleges wrongful foreclosure, violation of the Homeowner Bill of Rights, conversion, and monies had and received. The ruling notes that the Plaintiffs filed their opposition on September 19, 2024, two days before the scheduled hearing, leaving insufficient time for BANA to file a reply. Therefore, the Court continues the hearing on demurrer and orders BANA to file a reply brief no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date. The ruling also encourages parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and provides instructions for submitting or appearing at the hearing.
