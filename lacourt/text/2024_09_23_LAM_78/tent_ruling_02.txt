(“BANA”), Clear Recon Corp., and Does 1 through 50 pertaining to the sale of real property commonly described as 1245 W. 39th Street Los Angeles CA 90037 (“the Property”). The complaint sets forth four causes of action against all defendants for (1) Wrongful Foreclosure, (2) Violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights (“HBOR”), (3) Conversion, and (4) Monies Had and Received. On June 27, 2024, defendant BANA filed the instant demurrer against Plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiff’s opposition was due no later than September 10, 2024. Here, Plaintiffs filed and served an opposition on September 19, 2024, just two court days before the hearing. The untimely opposition leaves insufficient time for BANA to file a reply. Therefore, the Court CONTINUES the Hearing on Demurrer to _________________. BANA’s reply brief must be filed no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date; no other briefing is allowed.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: September 20, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
