The Court also finds that Visconti's arguments of lack of service and lack of presence at the hearing are insufficient. The motions are denied for lack of proper service and mootness. The Court also denies Visconti's motion for reconsideration of the March 5, 2024 order, finding that Visconti's arguments are insufficient.
