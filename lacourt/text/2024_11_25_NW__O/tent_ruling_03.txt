I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of Plaintiff Ehsan Safavi’s (“Plaintiff” or “Cross-Defendant”)
previous employment with Defendant Lux Garage and Closet, Inc., dba Inspired
Closets (“Lux”). Plaintiff alleges he and Lux entered into a severance
agreement whereby Lux would pay Plaintiff a bi-monthly severance payment, but
that Lux only made one of the ten promised payments. Plaintiff also alleges Lux
failed to reimburse him for necessary business expenses. 
Plaintiff
amended his Complaint to add Marye Delany Silvers (“Silvers”) as a Defendant. 
Silvers now
demurrers to all three of Plaintiff’s causes of action.

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007
(citation omitted); see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed
to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Silvers’s
counsel filed a declaration attesting to his telephonic meet and confer
efforts. (See Declaration of Jose-Manuel A. de Castro filed October 17,
2024, ¶¶ 3-4.) Silvers has fulfilled her meet and confer obligations.    
V.       ANALYSIS  

A.            
Plaintiff Fails to State a Cause of Action
Against Silvers
“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178 (cleaned up).)
“Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements
of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession
of the property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015)
61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)
“An employer shall indemnify his or her
employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in
direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her
obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the
employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful.”
(Lab. Code § 2802(a).) 
Silvers argues the Complaint does not
contain any allegations against Silvers or “any facts about what role, if any
the fictitiously-identified ‘Doe’ defendants played in Plaintiff’s former
employment by” Lux. (Demurrer, pg. 5.) The first cause of action for breach of
contract alleges breach of a contract between Lux and dismissed Defendant Jim
Delany. (See id.) The second and third causes of action for conversion
and failure to reimburse are nominally alleged against DOES but only describe Lux’s
alleged role in converting Plaintiff’s property and failing to reimburse them
for business expenses. (See id.) “The Complaint does not allege any
factual basis to find that Defendant Silvers ever employed Plaintiff, or owed
him any obligation to reimburse him for business expenses incurred in
connection with any employment.” (See id.) 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues he has “sufficiently
alleged facts to support the claims against Defendants, including Doe Defendant
Marye Silvers, who was recently identified as a key decision-maker in her
capacity as President of” Lux and “[i]n light of mediation, Plaintiff has
identified Defendant Silvers’ direct involvement.” (Opposition, pg. 2.) 
The Court finds Plaintiff has failed to
state a cause of action for breach of contract, conversion, or failure to
reimburse against Silvers. Plaintiff’s Complaint, as currently pled, contains
allegations against Lux and dismissed Defendant Jim Delany. As Silvers argues,
Plaintiff’s Complaint does not contain any factual allegations against the DOES
(i.e., Silvers and other unknown defendants) other than the legal conclusion
that defendants and DOES were the “agents, servants, representatives” etc. of
each other. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff’s attempts in opposition to introduce information
about Silvers’s alleged role as President of Lux are outside the four corners
of his Complaint and are thus inappropriate at this stage. 
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND Silvers’s Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s first through third causes
of action. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS
WITH LEAVE TO AMEND Silvers’s Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s first through third
causes of action. 
Plaintiff
shall file an amended complaint on or before December 20, 2024.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: November 25, 2024
