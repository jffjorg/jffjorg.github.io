ORDER
  GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
 
 



I.             
INTRODUCTION
This unlawful
detainer action based on a theory of non-payment of rent is brought by
Plaintiff Prime Variel, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“Plaintiff”)
against Defendants Richard Berglund, Jody Berglund (collectively, “Defendants”),
and Kelsey Berglund. Plaintiff later dismissed Defendant Kelsey Berglund from
the action.
The action arises out of a lease
agreement that pre-dated Plaintiff’s assumption of ownership/management of
Defendants’ residence located at 6203 Variel Avenue, #410, Woodland Hills, CA
91367. Plaintiff alleged one cause of action for unlawful detainer pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc. § 1161(2)[1]
based on Defendants’ alleged failure to pay monthly rent of $4,772.00 for the
months of May through October 2023.
On October
15, 2024, after conducting a non-jury trial, the Court ordered judgment be
entered in favor of Defendants.  Defendants
now seek their attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party.

LEGAL
STANDARD
“A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.)  
 “With respect to attorney fees
incurred to litigate a contract claim, the recovery of such fees are governed
by¿Section 1717.”
(Intelligent Investments Corp. v. Gonzales (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1,
4.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
provides in, pertinent part, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that¿attorney's¿fees¿and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the¿prevailing¿party, then the party who is determined
to be the¿party¿prevailing¿on the contract, whether he or she is
the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable¿attorney's¿fees¿in addition to other costs.”
“California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’
as used within¿section
1717. As long as the action involves a contract it is ‘on
the contract’
within the meaning of¿Section
1717.”
(Dell Merk Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455, (internal
citations omitted).) 
“The court…shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment…the party prevailing on the contract shall
be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The
court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for
purposes of this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b)
provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled … to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717 are
allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 as they are attorneys’
fees authorized by contract. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B); Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Attorneys’ fees are therefore recoverable as an
element of costs.
IV.        
ANALYSIS 
A.      Request for Judicial
Notice
As a preliminary matter,
Defendants request this Court take judicial notice of the Complaint, Answer,
Statement of the Case, Exhibit List, and Witness List filed in Plaintiff’s
previous unlawful detainer action against Defendants, case number 22VEUD02551
(“prior action”). (See Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Nos. 1-5.)
The Court notes Defendants mistakenly list the prior action’s case number as 24VEUD01554, but that is the current
action’s case number. Nonetheless, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN Nos. 1-5. 
B.      Defendants are Entitled to an Award
of Reasonable Attorney’s Fees and Costs Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
for the Current Action
Defendants seek a total
of $36,450.00 in fees pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 1717(a). (See Motion, pp. 1-2.) Defendants argue they
are entitled to fees as the prevailing party in the current action and as
authorized by the lease agreement. (See id. at 2-3.) Defendants also
argue they are entitled to fees for some of their work in the prior action, which
Plaintiff dismissed after “pretrial motions, discovery, jury trial joint trial
notebooks and exhibit binders, settlement briefs were[sic] and a Mandatory
Settlement Conference was held.” (Id. at 1.) Defendants argue they are
entitled to fees for their work in the prior action because “the parties
already had the discovery from the prior action, neither party conducted
discovery. Likewise, the parties re-used their trial documents and even kept
the numbering of the exhibits the exact same as the prior case.” (Id.)
Defendants rely on Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 647 (“Stokus”),
Children's Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
740 (“Children’s Hospital”), and Wallace v. Consumers Cooperative of
Berkeley, Inc. (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 836 (“Wallace”) in support of
their argument that they are entitled to fees for the prior action. (See id.
at 6-8.) 
In opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute Defendants
are the prevailing party and that they are thus entitled to fees in the current
action. Plaintiff instead argues Defendants cannot claim fees for the prior
action because Defendants are not the prevailing party for purposes of that
action, and, even if considered the prevailing party, Defendants’ Motion is
untimely pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1). (See Opposition,
pg. 2-4.) Plaintiff also argues Defendants’ requested fees are often
duplicative, as both of Defendants’ attorneys, Kevin Hermansen (“Mr.
Hermansen”) and Ben Gharagozli (“Mr. Gharagozli”), request fees for “the exact
same work performed on the case.” (Id. at 5.) 
In reply, Defendants first argue “Defendants are not
requesting fees for prevailing in UD #1. They are requesting some of their fees
for the time incurred in that case that was directly utilized in this case.
That was exactly what occurred in the Stokus case.” (Reply, pg. 2.) Defendants
also argue California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1) does not bar their
request for fees from the prior action as “the issue is not about claiming
costs as the prevailing party in that action, but claiming the time incurred
prior to this action, which happened to be incurred during the time of the
first UD.” (Id. at 3.) Finally, Defendants note “having two counsel for
a trial has become customary; two heads are better than one, and often will
lead to a more efficient presentation at trial, as here. It is also not the
case that all duplicative work should be cut – only unnecessary duplicate work.”
(Id. at 4.) 
The Court finds
Defendants are only entitled to recover their fees incurred in connection with
the current action and will address the duplicative nature of Defendants’
requested fees in the following section. As an initial matter, several of the
cases Defendants rely on to support their requested fees for the prior action, Children’s
Hospital and Wallace, were decided in the context of Code of Civil
Procedure § 1021.5, which authorizes attorney’s fees under the “private
attorney general” doctrine and statutory scheme, not under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1717, which governs Defendants’ present fee request and the other case
Defendants rely on, Stokus.
In Stokus, the
plaintiff dismissed an unlawful detainer action “to avoid unnecessary
litigation as to whether notice of eviction was technically defective.” (Stokus,
217 Cal.App.3d at 656.) Two days later, the plaintiff filed an additional
unlawful detainer action based on the same eviction notice at issue in the
previously dismissed action; the trial court found in favor of plaintiff at
the conclusion of a three-week jury trial. (See Stokus, 217 Cal.App.3d
at 651 (emphasis added).) In finding the plaintiff could claim its attorney’s
fees from the previously dismissed action, the Court of Appeal was persuaded by
the view that “pre-complaint investigation and evaluation of the potential
claim is part of the process and expense of litigation.” (Stokus, 217
Cal.App.3d at 656 (citation omitted).) The Court found “refiling fees are
particularly warranted here because the dismissal and refiling were designed
to avoid unnecessary litigation as to whether notice of eviction was
technically defective. Substantial trial preparation had occurred at that
point. Discovery conducted in the dismissed case was fully utilized in the
refiled action. Precluding fees for this work would not only foreclose
compensation for necessary legal services but might discourage a party from
voluntarily dismissing an earlier complaint, though it would otherwise be
economical to do so.” (Id. (emphasis added).) 
Here, unlike in Stokus,
there is no evidence before the Court that Plaintiff dismissed the prior action
to avoid unnecessary litigation, only to refile the same action a short time
later based on the same three-day notice to pay or quit and rental
period. The three-day notice to pay rent or quit in the prior action concerned
an entirely different period of unpaid rent, December 2021 through March
2021, and was served in November 2022. (See Complaint in prior action,
Ex. 2.) The three-day notice to pay or quit in the current action, however, was
for unpaid rent from May 2023 to October 2023, and was served in April of 2024.
(See Complaint, Ex. 2.) The Complaint in the current action was also filed
in May of 2024, almost eight months after Plaintiff dismissed the prior action.
(See Complaint; see also Request for Dismissal in prior action, entered
on October 20, 2023.) And the reason Defendants are the prevailing party
in this case is not because Defendants merely recycled their arguments
in the prior action and were successful on those arguments once the case was
tried. Defendants prevailed in the current action because of deficiencies with
the service of the three-day notice to pay or quit in April of 2024, an
issue which the Court, not Defendants’ counsel identified. (See
Statement of Decision.) 
While the Court
appreciates the fact the parties reused many of the prior action’s trial
documents and did not conduct additional discovery, the Court doesn’t find these
facts alone sufficient to transform the prior action into “pre-complaint
investigation and evaluation of the potential claim” in the current action, as the
Court of Appeal found in Stokus. (See Stokus, Cal.App.3d at 656
(citation omitted).) The Court instead finds Defendants are attempting to request fees incurred in
connection with a separate, factually distinct prior action. (See Reply,
pg. 2.) As such, there was a 60-day jurisdictional deadline for Defendants to
file a motion for attorney’s fees for their work in the prior action, which
Defendants did not meet. (See California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702; see
also Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422, 429.) 
Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection with the current
action only pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a).
1.       Mr. Hermansen’s and Mr. Gharagozli’s Rates
are Reasonable 
Mr. Hermansen provides a declaration detailing his 15
years of experience in the eviction defense field and his $500.00/hr billing
rate. (See Declaration of Kevin Hermansen filed October 28, 2024, ¶¶ 3-7.)
Mr. Gharagozli also provides a declaration detailing his 14 years of experience
and his $500.00/hr billing rate. (See Declaration of Ben Gharagozli
filed October 28, 2024, ¶¶ 3-4.) 
The Court finds Mr. Hermansen’s and Mr. Gharagozli’s
billing rates of $500.00/hour reasonable given the prevailing rates in the
Greater Los Angeles Area for attorneys with their same level of experience, as
well as the level of complexity of the case and skill demanded by it.
2.       Not
All of Mr. Hermansen’s and Mr.
Gharagozli’s Hours
Are Reasonable
As discussed above, the Court will not award Mr.
Hermansen and Mr. Gharagozli attorney’s fees for their legal work in the prior
action. 
In the current action, Mr. Hermansen requests $13,150.00
in fees, which accounts for 26.3 hours of legal work. Mr. Gharagozli requests $12,000
in fees, which accounts for 24 hours of legal work. The Court finds some of Mr.
Hermansen’s and Mr. Gharagozli’s requested hours to be excessive given their
collective experience. The Court also finds some of their requested hours
duplicative and unnecessary, to quote Defendants’ Reply. Many of Mr.
Hermansen’s and Mr. Gharagozli’s hours are for the same task that could have
been done by either Mr. Hermansen or Mr. Gharagozli, not both. 
Mr. Hermansen’s and Mr. Gharagozli’s reduced hours
are detailed below.
