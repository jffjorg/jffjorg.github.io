And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice a motion by the plaintiff, Nancy Bates, to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC). The motion sought to add additional allegations and two new causes of action for respondeat superior/vicarious liability and negligent supervision, hiring, or retention. The defendants argued that the motion failed to comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1324 and that the proposed amendments were not newly discovered facts. The court denied the motion because the supporting declaration failed to specify the necessary information for the court's evaluation. The court encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
