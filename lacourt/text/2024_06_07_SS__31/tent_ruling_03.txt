 Case Number:  21STCV39817    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  6/7/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  21STCV39817 GAGIK AROUTIONIAN vs ARTHUR MURADYAN, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  ARTHUR MURADYAN RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $73,345.53 Costs: $543.33 TOTAL: $73,888.86   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Gagik Aroutionian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Arthur Muradyan (“Muradyan”), 310 Towing Inc. (“310 Towing”), and Does 1-20 for injuries arising from a motor vehicle incident on August 30, 2021. Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint naming Verzhine Koroglyan (“Koroglyan”) as Doe 1.   Plaintiff alleges that Muradyan was operating a motor vehicle within the course and scope of his employment with 310 Towing when he attempted to make a U-turn, and collided with Plaintiff’s vehicle. As a result of the impact, Plaintiff’s vehicle was pushed into a light pole.   Plaintiff has dismissed Koroglyan (Doe 1), Does 2-20, and 310 Towing. Plaintiff has cured the defects previously identified in the prior denial for default judgment. Plaintiff now seeks default judgment against the only remaining defendant, Muradyan, in the amount of $43,345.53 in special damages, and $500,000 in general damages. Further, Plaintiff seeks costs in the amount of $543.33.  SPECIAL DAMAGES  Plaintiff declares he has incurred $43,345.53 in past medical specials. Plaintiff substantiates this request for medical specials, and it is therefore granted. The Court will not consider the unspecified statement in Plaintiff’s declaration regarding future medical expenses due to the lack of support, and that this was not requested on CIV-100.   GENERAL DAMAGES  Plaintiff declares that the motor vehicle collision caused him to strike his head against the windshield, and caused dislodgment of his dentures. Plaintiff avers he has chronic headaches, back pain, and discomfort arising from the incident. Although Plaintiff provides evidence for an award of general damages, it is not to the extent of the requested half a million. The award is reduced to $30,000 based upon the records provided.   COSTS  Plaintiff seeks $462.66 in clerk’s filing fees, $62.67 in process server’s fees, and $18 for “Police Department”, which the Court surmises was the service fee to obtain the Traffic Collision Report. The request for costs is granted.    CONCLUSION  Therefore, the application for default judgment filed on May 13, 2024 is GRANTED in the principal amount of $73,345.53, and $543.33 in costs, against defendant Arthur Muradyan.   Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
