And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules that the unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Maria is granted. The court finds that Plaintiff Maria has failed to appear for her duly noticed deposition, despite multiple attempts to schedule the deposition. The court orders Plaintiff Maria to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by LACMTA, but LACMTA must give at least ten days' notice of the deposition. The court also awards sanctions to LACMTA in the amount of $700, which is the reasonable cost of preparing and filing the motion. The court orders Plaintiff Maria and her counsel to pay the sanctions within 20 days.
