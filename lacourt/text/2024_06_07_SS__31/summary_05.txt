And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to set aside a dismissal of a complaint filed by plaintiff Jose Lara Caceres against defendants Maria Esperanza Soriano, Gladys Flores De Soriano, and Does 1 through 20. The complaint was dismissed for lack of appearance, despite a scheduled hearing on March 25, 2024. Counsel for the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, citing a technological issue that prevented him from accessing the hearing. The court grants the motion, reinstating the action. However, the court notes that there has been no proof of service of the summons and complaint on any of the named defendants to date. The court sets an order to show cause regarding the failure to file proofs of service, and requires the plaintiff's counsel to appear at the hearing to provide evidence of service or explain why service has not occurred.
