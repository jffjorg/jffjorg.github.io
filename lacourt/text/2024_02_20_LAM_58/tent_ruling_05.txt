[1]            On the same day the
opposition was filed, Plaintiff also filed a motion for leave to amend to file
a Third Amended Complaint. The Court previously took Defendants’ demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint off calendar in response to Plaintiff’ motion for
leave to amend to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Court declines to  take the demurrer off calendar again in the
face of this pending motion.


[2]            On the demurrer to the
Complaint, the Court previously found that misappropriation of trade secrets
claim were inadequate; the allegations here are not sufficiently improved.
