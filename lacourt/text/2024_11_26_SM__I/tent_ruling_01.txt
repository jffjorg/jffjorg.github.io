  Case Number:  23SMCV00516    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for sanctions is DENIED.  Plaintiff filed a breach of contract action
against defendant Shah Solati, Inc. 
Before the court is a motion for sanctions.  It is not opposed.  However, although the motion’s caption is for
sanctions, it is really a motion to compel further responses to a request for
production of documents.  Given that, the
court cannot grant the motion because the separate statement does not comply with
Rule 3.1345(c) in that it does not contain the whole RFP. 
 
That said, though, the responses are troubling.  Defendant knows that plaintiff is seeking
evidence to support the alter ego allegation. 
Due to defendant’s past failure to engage in discovery in good faith,
plaintiff is now using more extreme requests. 
Had the motion been proper such that the court had the power to rule on
it, the court might well have granted the motion; the court is unpersuaded by
the objections or positions.  Defendants’
demeanor in this case has been more of a litigation tactic and appears to be
one designed to take advantage of plaintiff’s status as a self-represented
litigant.  Fortunately for the defense,
even a self-represented litigant must follow the rules.  However, the court can foresee a time where
plaintiff will have done this properly. 
When that occurs, the court will have little sympathy for an argument by
the defense that the discovery is too intrusive, including a request for
financial records.  Defendant states that
it served supplemental responses last week. 
That is well and good, but a bit late. 
The court will see if plaintiff brings a motion to compel further.
