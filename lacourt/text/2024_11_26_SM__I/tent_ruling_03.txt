 Case Number:  24SMCV00214    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  I This is an ex parte application by developer Scenic
View to file a complaint in intervention alleging that the City of Malibu is
violating a stipulated judgment entered by the court on May 13, 2024.  That judgment allows the State to apply, ex
parte, to remedy a violation.  Scenic
View’s theory is that the judgment requires Malibu to build affordable housing
in compliance with state law, and it has not done so.  Malibu has, it is alleged, submitted a number
of applications to the State, but all have been rejected.  Scenic View’s proposal, it argues, would
cause Malibu to be in compliance, but Malibu will not approve the proposal for
reasons that Scenic View contends are silly. 
Malibu, in opposition, denies that Scenic View has established a right
to intervene or that the issue is even ripe, and, of course, it denies
violating the judgment.
 
The initial problem is that the court sees no exigency
here.  While the State can come in ex
parte to allege a violation of the judgment between it and Malibu, the
court does not understand why Scenic View can do so.  Without some special something, the court
does not hear ex parte matters except where there are exigent
circumstances.  Scenic View makes no
effort to describe any exigency.
 
Therefore, the application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to
the filing of a noticed motion, which Malibu may, of course, oppose (as may the
Statet).  The court does not anticipate
hearing argument on this matter today, at least unless the State wants to be
heard.
