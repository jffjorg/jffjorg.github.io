```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for sanctions, which is actually a request to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The court cannot grant the motion because the separate statement does not comply with Rule 3.1345(c), which requires the submission of the whole request for production. However, the court is troubled by the defendant's responses, which do not show good faith in engaging in discovery. The court notes that the defendant has a history of not complying with discovery requests and is now trying to take advantage of the plaintiff's status as a self-represented litigant. The judge warns that if the plaintiff continues to comply with discovery requests, the court will have little sympathy for the defendant's arguments that discovery is too intrusive.
