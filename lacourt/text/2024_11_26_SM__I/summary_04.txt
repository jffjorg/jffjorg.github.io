And here is the summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge grants an unopposed motion to set aside a default judgment due to concerns that the defendant was never properly served with the complaint. The judge believes that the defendant was in Italy on the date of supposed personal service, which would render the service invalid. As a result, the judge views the complaint as not having been served. The judge is concerned enough that it will likely issue an Order to Show Cause (OSC) directing the plaintiff to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for what appears to be a fraudulent lawsuit or filing regarding service. The judge also orders both the plaintiff and the process server to appear in court personally on the hearing date.
