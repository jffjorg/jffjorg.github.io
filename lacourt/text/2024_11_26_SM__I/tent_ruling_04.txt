 Case Number:  24SMCV02772    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to set aside the default, which is
unopposed, is GRANTED.  It appears to the
court’s satisfaction that defendant was never properly served inasmuch as
defendant appears to have been in Italy on the date of supposed personal
service.  Accordingly, the court views
the complaint as not having been served.
 
The court is concerned enough that it will likely issue an
OSC directed to plaintiff re: sanctions under 128.5 and 128.7 for what appears
to be a fraudulent lawsuit, or at least a fraudulent filing regarding
service.  The court will also order both
plaintiff and the process server to be in court personally on that date.
