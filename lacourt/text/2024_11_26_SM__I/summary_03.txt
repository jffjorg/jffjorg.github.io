And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Scenic View's ex parte application to file a complaint in intervention alleging that the City of Malibu is violating a stipulated judgment entered by the court on May 13, 2024. Scenic View claims that the City is not building affordable housing in compliance with state law, and that its proposal would cause the City to be in compliance, but the City has rejected the proposal. The court finds that there is no exigency to justify the granting of the application, and that Scenic View has not established a right to intervene. The application is denied without prejudice to the filing of a noticed motion, which the City and the State may oppose.
