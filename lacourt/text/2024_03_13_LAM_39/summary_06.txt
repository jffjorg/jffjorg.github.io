And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the ex parte application filed by the Plaintiffs, Robert Lindholm and Carolyn Lindholm. The Plaintiffs are seeking an order that prohibits their law firm from responding to a notice of wage garnishment issued by the Defendant, Crystal Bergstrom, until a motion to enforce the settlement can be heard. The Judge has determined that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated any statutory or common law authority that permits the Court to issue the order they seek, and that they have not shown any likelihood of success on the merits based on admissible evidence. Additionally, the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated any exigency that would support a grant of extraordinary relief. As a result, the Judge has denied the ex parte application and notified the Plaintiffs' counsel, Ms. Lindholm, of the decision.
