 Case Number:  23STCV10370    Hearing Date:   March 13, 2024    Dept:  39 Scott Guerrero v.
Loyola Marymount University
Case No. 23STCV10370
Motion to Strike
 
            Plaintiff Scott
Guerrero (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment discrimination case against
Defendant Loyola Marymount University (“Defendant”).  The Court previously granted Plaintiff’s
motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations.  Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint,
and Defendant again moves to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related
allegations.  
 
            As an
initial matter, Plaintiff argues that the motion is untimely under Code of
Civil Procedure section 436(b).  The
motion was two days late.  By addressing
the motion on the merits, however, Plaintiff has waived the right to challenge
the timeliness of the motion.  (See In
re Marriage of Falcone (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 826.)  Nor does Plaintiff establish any
prejudice.  Therefore, the Court shall
reach the merits of the motion.    
 
In ruling on a motion to strike
punitive damages, “judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.”  (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)  The motion is granted in part and denied in
part.    
 
To state a prima facie claim for
punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege the elements set forth in the
punitive damages statute, Civil Code section 3294.  (Coll.
Hosp., Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721.)  Per Civil Code section 3294, a plaintiff must
allege that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)  “Malice is defined in the statute as conduct
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
(Coll. Hosp., Inc. v. Superior
Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) 
“The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages. 
Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but
facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.”  (Grieves
v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, internal citations and
footnotes omitted.)
 
“[T]he imposition of punitive
damages upon a corporation is based upon its own fault.  It is not imposed vicariously by virtue of
the fault of others.”  (City Products Corp. v. Globe Indemnity Co.
(1979) 88 Cal. App. 3d 31, 36.) 
“Corporations are legal entities which do not have minds capable of
recklessness, wickedness, or intent to injure or deceive.  An award of punitive damages against a
corporation therefore must rest on the malice of the corporation’s
employees.  But the law does not impute
every employee’s malice to the corporation. 
Instead, the punitive damages statute requires proof of malice among
corporate leaders: the officers, directors, or managing agents.”  (Cruz
v. Home Base (2000) 83 Cal. App. 4th 160, 167, internal quotations and
citation omitted.)  
 
            Plaintiff
alleges that Craig Pintens, LMU’s Athletic Director, terminated him based upon
his age, and that Pintens engaged in a pattern and practice of replacing older
staff members with younger ones.  Plaintiff
argues that “the violation of fundamental civil rights is inherently malicious
conduct” that would support a claim for punitive damages.  Plaintiff is incorrect.  A plaintiff must allege more than violations
of the Fair Employment and Housing Act and other claims in order to support a
prayer for punitive damages.  (See Scott
v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715-716.)  Plaintiff also alleges that Pintens terminated
him because he wanted “to go in a different direction.”  
 
            At the prior
hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel cited Cloud v. Casey (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th
895, in support of his claim for punitive damages.  In that case, the Court held that the
employer may be liable for punitive damages “because it denied the plaintiff a
promotion based on gender, then attempted to hide the illegal reason for
denying the promotion with a false explanation . . . .”  (See Scott, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at
p. 717, discussing Cloud, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th 895.)  In Cloud, the false explanation
related to an objective criterion for the position: “[T]he jury also heard
evidence that the operational experience criterion was developed after [a man]
was selected for the position.  From this
the jury could conclude that operational experience was not a real requirement
for the position, but a pretext utilized by the corporations to explain away
its gender-based decision.”  (Cloud,
supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at p. 912.)  In
this first amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges more than a termination based
upon wanting “to go in a different direction.”  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant falsely
justified the termination based upon “statistical evidence” suggesting “that
the team was underperforming.”  (First
Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 40, 51.)  This is
sufficient for pleading purposes.    
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Defendant’s motion to strike the prayer
of punitive damages is denied.
 
            2.         Defendant shall file an answer within
thirty (30) days.
 
            3.         Defendant shall provide notice and file
proof of such with the Court.
