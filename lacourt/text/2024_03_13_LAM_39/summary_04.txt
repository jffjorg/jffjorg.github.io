And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages filed by Loyola Marymount University (Defendant) against Scott Guerrero (Plaintiff). The Defendant filed a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, which the Plaintiff argues is untimely. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff has waived the right to challenge the timeliness of the motion by addressing it on the merits. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not established any prejudice.

The judge notes that to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege the elements set forth in the punitive damages statute, Civil Code section 3294. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they do not allege more than violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act and other claims.

However, the judge also notes that the Plaintiff's allegations of a pattern and practice of replacing older staff members with younger ones, and the Defendant's alleged false justification for the termination, are sufficient to plead a prima facie claim for punitive damages.

Therefore, the judge orders that the Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is denied, and that the Defendant shall file an answer within thirty days.
