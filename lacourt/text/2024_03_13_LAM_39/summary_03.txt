And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and has found that the lease ends on July 31, 2028, not July 31, 2029. The plaintiff, Demesne Corporation, had argued that the lease should end on July 31, 2029, but the court has found that the plaintiff's witness, James Green, waived the right to challenge the expiration date of the final option. The court has also found that the plaintiff failed to advance sufficient evidence to give rise to a triable issue. Therefore, the court has ordered that the lease ends on July 31, 2028, and has advanced and vacated all dates.
