Corporation v. Walgreen Company
Case No.
23STCV04659
Motion for Summary
Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
Demesne Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for declaratory relief
against Defendant Walgreen Company (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff alleges as follows:
 
            On or about
April 14, 2017, Defendant entered into a ground lease to rent the property at
issue for a term of 30 years, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2027.  (Complaint, ¶ 6.)  On or about May 4, 2004, Defendant entered
into a sublease with Plaintiff whereby Plaintiff leased the property.  (Id., ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff alleges that the term of the lease was 10 years, from August
1, 2004, through July 31, 2014.  (Id., ¶
7.)  The sublease provided three options
for Plaintiff to extend the lease.  (Id.,
¶ 9.)  Each option was for a five-year
extension, meaning that the total lease term could be 25 years.  (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff alleges that there was an error in the lease, because it
erroneously states that the term would end on July 31, 2013, which is nine
years after execution.  (Ibid.)
 
            Plaintiff
attached the lease to the complaint. 
(See Complaint, Exh. A.)  The
lease has rent listed in 12 month increments for ten periods, suggesting that
the lease was intended to be 10 years. 
(See id., Exh. A, ¶ 2(a)(ix).) 
However, the provision for the final year’s rent is written to state
that the term ends on July 31, 2013, not July 31, 2014.  (See id., Exh. A, ¶ 2(a)(x).) 
 
Defendant moves for summary
judgment.  “[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
 (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)
 “[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden
of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.”  (Ibid.)  
 
            The Court
grants Defendant’s motion, finding waiver by Plaintiff.  Generally,
waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.  (See Zamora v. Lehman (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 1, 12.)  Defendant advances
the deposition testimony of James Green (“Green”), who testified that Plaintiff
identified the alleged error in the sublease in May 2021.  However, when Plaintiff exercised its third
option to extend the sublease term, Plaintiff indicated that the sublease term
would expire on July 31, 2028.  (Declaration
of Shanon J. McGinnis, Exhibit A, pp. 58, 99-100, 103.)  Although Plaintiff believed the date was
inaccurate, it did not object to the inaccuracy and agreed that the end of the
lease would be July 31, 2028. 
(Ibid.)  This evidence satisfies
Defendant’s burden, shifting the burden to Plaintiff to advance sufficient
evidence to give rise to a triable issue.
 
            Plaintiff fails to do so.  Plaintiff relies on the declaration of James
Green.  Green states that he “understood
that the sublease was off by one year” when he exercised the option on behalf
of Plaintiff.  (Declaration of James
Green, ¶ 21.)  Green states that “when
[he] wrote letters exercising options [he] used the years set forth in the
sublease, including the final option to 2028.” 
(Ibid.)  Green never objected or
made any correction, even though he had identified the issue.  (Ibid.) 
This does not give rise to a triable issue because he waived the right
to challenge the expiration date of the final option.  
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         The
Court grants Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and finds that the lease
ends on July 31, 2028, not July 31, 2029.
 
            2.         The Court advances and vacates all
dates, having granted summary judgment to Defendant.
 
            3.         Defendant may lodge a proposed judgment
if necessary.
 
            4.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
