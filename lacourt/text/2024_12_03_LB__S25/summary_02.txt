And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) claim. The plaintiff had previously filed a second amended complaint (SAC) that added new allegations regarding the defendant's conduct after the collision. The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the IIED claim, finding that the new allegations do not rise to the level of "outrageous conduct" required for a claim of IIED.

The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations related to punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient allegations to warrant a claim for punitive damages. The judge has distinguished this case from other cases that have allowed punitive damages in similar circumstances.

The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 15 days of the date of the ruling.
