And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the motion of defendants Mark Lolo and Yulia Lolo to continue the trial from August 12, 2024 to January 20, 2025, and to reopen discovery with cut-off dates commensurate with the new trial date. The judge finds that the defendants' sudden unavailability on the trial date due to family trip and caregiving responsibilities constitutes good cause to continue the trial. However, the judge does not find that the defendants have shown good cause to reopen discovery, as they did not demonstrate diligent efforts to schedule and take the depositions of witnesses Shaobo Ma and Tevin Tasher. The judge sets a Trial Readiness Conference for August 28, 2024, and orders the parties to file a joint trial readiness report by August 21, 2024.
