And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion filed by Plaintiffs Zhibin Qiu, Bin Xiao, and Cheng Li to substitute Patsy King as the successor-in-interest to deceased Defendant Daniel Chu. The motion was opposed by Defendant Chu. The Judge finds that the statements made by Plaintiffs' counsel, Ming Ji, lack probative value and that Plaintiffs have not provided proof of compliance with Part 4 of Division 7 of the Probate Code, which requires filing a creditor claim. As a result, the Judge cannot grant the motion, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.41.
