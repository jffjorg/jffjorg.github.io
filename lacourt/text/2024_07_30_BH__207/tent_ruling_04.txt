MOTION
 
Julius W. Gernes, Esq. (“Counsel”) has filed a motion to appear as
counsel pro hac vice for Defendants ADT LLC and Sharnee L’Jonique Crout-Prudie
(“Defendants”).  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            California Rules of Court rule 9.40
provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may apply to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a verified
application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00
fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of California, and
is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other
activities in the State of California. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40.)
 
The application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence and office
addresses; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member of good standing
in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the
preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was
granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member
of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local action.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).)
 
            Counsel has provided a declaration
that includes most of the above information. 
However, while Counsel indicates three cases in which Counsel has filed
an application to appear pro hac vice in California in the past two
years, Counsel does not indicate the date of each application or whether each
application was granted.   
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Therefore, the Court denies Counsel’s Application without prejudice.  Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
