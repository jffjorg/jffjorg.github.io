And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff Kimberly Tucker's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action, including claims for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as a new defendant, City National Corporation (CNC). The Court finds that the Plaintiff has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Rule 3.1324.

The Court acknowledges that it previously struck several causes of action, a new defendant, and the requests for punitive damages and attorneys' fees without leave to amend, but grants Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add those allegations. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's new claims are not substantially identical to the previously dismissed claims.

The Court orders Plaintiff to file and serve the proposed second amended complaint on or before August 20, 2024. The Court further orders Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
