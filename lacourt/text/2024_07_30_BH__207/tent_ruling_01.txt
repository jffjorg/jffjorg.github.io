  Deceased Defendant

Plaintiffs Zhibin Qiu, Bin Xiao, and Cheng Li




OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant Daniel Chu



 
MOTION
 
            Plaintiffs Zhibin Qiu, Bin Xiao, and
Cheng Li move to substitute Patsy King as successor-in-interest to Defendant Daniel
Chu, who is deceased, in this action. 
Defendant Chu opposes the motion.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A pending action or proceeding does not abate by the death of a party
if the cause of action survives.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.21.)   “Subject to Part 4 (commencing with Section
9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims, a cause of
action against a decedent that survives may be asserted against the decedent's
personal representative or, to the extent provided by statute, against the
decedent's successor in interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.40.)
 
On motion, the court shall allow a pending action
or proceeding against the decedent that does not abate to be continued against
the decedent’s personal representative or, to the extent provided by statute,
against the decedent’s successor in interest, except that the court may not
permit an action or proceeding to be continued against the personal
representative unless proof of compliance with Part 4 (commencing with Section
9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims is first made.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.41.)  Unless the
decedent's personal representative is made a party, a judgment should not be
rendered for or against a decedent, nor for or against the representative. (See
Sacks v. FSR Brokerage, Inc. (1992) 7 CA4th 950, 957; Sellery v.
Cressey (1996) 48 CA4th 538, 541, fn. 2.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs advance the
Declaration of Ming Ji (“Ji”), counsel for Plaintiffs, in support of the
motion.  In part, Ji avers that Defendant
Chu died on February 21, 2022.  (See Ji
Decl. ¶ 3,  Ex. 1.)  Further, Ji states as follows:
 
5. Upon information and belief, Defendant Chu
established The Chu Family Trust on November 26, 1996. On or about December 30,
1997, a real property commonly known as 3812 Winford Drive, Tarzana, CA 91356
was transferred into the family trust. Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of
the transfer deed. 
 
6. I inquired with Defendant Chu’s counsel in the
instant case if a probate was opened for Defendant Chu. The answer was
negative. I also conducted research on court’s website and found no probate of
Defendant Chu’s estate. Neither did I receive any notice regarding the
administration of Defendant Chu’s estate. 
 
7. Upon information and belief, Defendant Chu’s
estate, including the Windford property, was distributed through The Chu Family
Trust without probate. Ms. Patsy King is the surviving spouse and the successor
in interest.
 
Foremost,
the Court finds that Ji’s statements, as set forth in paragraphs 5 and 7, have
no probative value.  (See, e.g., Long
Beach Unified School Dist. v. Margaret Williams, LLC (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th
87, 105, fn. 9 [affidavits on information and belief lack probative value and
are permitted only when the facts to be established are incapable of positive
averment].)  
 
            Notwithstanding, Chu opposes the
motion on the grounds that Probate Code sections 9100 and 9340 require filing a
credit claim, which Plaintiff did not do, and cannot do, since Code of Civil
Procedure section 366.2 provides a one-year statute of limitations to bring an
action “after the date of death[.]”  
 
            Finding Plaintiff has not provided
proof of compliance with Part 4 (commencing with Section 9000) of Division 7 of
the Probate Code, the Court cannot grant Plaintiff’s motion, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 377.41.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion.  The clerk of the court shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling.
