And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the Expedited Petitions to Approve Minor's Compromise filed by LETAL EZERZER and others, represented by counsel, against SILVIA CARTER and others. The Court declines to approve the petitions as requested and instead schedules a hearing to permit counsel to correct certain defects. The Court orders counsel to file new, standard minor's compromise petitions (if unable to show defendants are judgment proof), and attach the missing attachments. The Court also orders counsel to file the proposed orders and orders the moving party to give notice. The hearing is scheduled for 60 days from the date of the ruling.
