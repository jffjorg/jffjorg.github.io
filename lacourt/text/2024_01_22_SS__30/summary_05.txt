Summary:
This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion to quash a subpoena for discovery requests related to a settlement agreement and insurance records. The defendant, Thomas Jeffrey Paul, argues that the requests are protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, but the court finds that these claims are not supported by evidence and that the information sought is relevant to the case. The court also finds that the defendant's privacy interests are protected by allowing redaction of certain financial information and medical records. The motion to quash is denied, and the request for sanctions is also denied since the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed.
