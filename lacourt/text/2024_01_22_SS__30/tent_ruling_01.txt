  Case Number:  20STCV28568    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  30 LETAL EZERZER, et al. vs SILVIA CARTER, et al.TENTATIVEThe Court has reviewed the Expedited Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromise (LH, age 5; and GE, age 11). The Court declines to approve the Petitions as requested. Pursuant to Cal Rules of Court 7.950.5(c)(3), the Court elects to schedule a hearing date to permit counsel to correct the following defects:(1) Attachment 3 is missing, which would show that all of the defendants are judgment proof outside of insurance for purposes of filing an expedited petition when the settlement amount is more than $50,000. It seems questionable that Uber would be judgment proof, so it appears a standard petition for minor’s compromise must be used, instead of expedited petitions.(2) Attachment 19b(4) is not correctly filled out. It is missing Parent’s address.(3) Attachment 12 needs to list the specific reasons for apportionment in detail; it should not simply state it is commensurate with injuries, damages and bills.(4) There are no proposed orders granting the petition filed.Accordingly, the Court schedules a hearing on this petition in 60 days, at 8:30 a.m. in Department SS-30. Counsel is ordered to file new, standard minor’s compromise petitions (if unable to show defendants are judgment proof), and attach the missing attachments described herein, and to file the proposed orders.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
