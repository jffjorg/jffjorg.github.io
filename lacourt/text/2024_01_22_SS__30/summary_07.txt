Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant destroyed surveillance video of the incident, but the judge finds that the defendant has not destroyed or failed to preserve evidence. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not established that any evidence was destroyed, and that the defendant has provided some video footage of the incident. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not file a separate statement, as required, and that the motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions is denied on that ground. Additionally, the judge denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions because there is no evidence that any video was actually destroyed. The defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied.
