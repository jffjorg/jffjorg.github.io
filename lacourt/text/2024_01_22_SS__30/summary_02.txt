```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Signage Solutions Corporation's motion for a good faith settlement determination under California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The court found that Signage submitted a sufficient declaration setting forth a brief background of the case, which is sufficient to meet its initial burden. The court also found that Madison, one of the defendants, failed to meet its burden to establish that Signage's settlement with the plaintiff was not made in good faith. The court noted that Madison bears the burden of proof on the issue of lack of good faith, and failed to provide substantial evidence demonstrating that the proposed settlement does not accurately reflect Signage's proportionate share of fault. The court also found that the settlement amount of $50,000 is reasonable, considering Signage's potential liability and the fact that the plaintiff's medical damages amount to $80,000.
