And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reclassify the action as a limited jurisdiction case, as the plaintiff's damages may exceed the jurisdictional amount of $25,000. The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set one, and ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, as the motion was not opposed and the plaintiff has not misused discovery.
