This tentative ruling is related to a petition to change the name of the Petitioner. The Court has decided to grant the petition, but with certain conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
