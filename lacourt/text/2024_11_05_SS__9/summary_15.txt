And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a revised proposed decree. The petition has been granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
