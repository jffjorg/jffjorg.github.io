If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
