And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a petition for name change case. The petitioner has two outstanding misdemeanor warrants and must clear them before the court will rule on the petition. The OSC and hearing on the petition are continued to February 3, 2025, and the petitioner must provide written proof that the warrants have been resolved at least two weeks before the hearing. If the petitioner fails to provide this proof, the OSC and hearing will be taken off calendar, but can be reinstated once the warrants are cleared. The court clerk will run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the warrants have been resolved. All parties will be notified of the continued hearing and requirements.
