And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and provides instructions for the Petitioner. The Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct and legible, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge also notes that the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing and that the decree cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
