The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to change name. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge has granted the petition, and a signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
