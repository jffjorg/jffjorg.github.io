The judge has granted the petition and will sign the decree. However, the petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is correct and legible. If the name is satisfactory, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. If the name is not correct or legible, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
