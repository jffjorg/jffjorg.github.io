And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change the name is granted. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
