And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for a name change. The petition is granted, but the petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the decree, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
