The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is required at the hearing. However, if the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge grants the petition and notes that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
