And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change case. The judge is granting the petition, but with some conditions. The petitioner must review the proposed decree with their new name and make sure it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is acceptable, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or spelled correctly, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once it is signed, it cannot be changed without a new petition.
