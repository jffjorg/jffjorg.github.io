And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns a petition to change a name. The judge is granting the petition, but with a condition. The petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct and legible, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
