**English Text Summary:**

A tentative ruling has been issued by the Judge regarding a petition for a name change. The Judge has decided to grant the petition, but has given instructions for the Petitioner to follow. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing on November 5, 2024. However, if the new name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the hearing, a signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office. Note that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
