The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Further Responses. The motion is granted in part and denied in part.

The judge also denies the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against the Defendant, finding that the Defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the Plaintiffs' overbroad requests. The Defendant is ordered to serve its responses within 30 days of the ruling.
