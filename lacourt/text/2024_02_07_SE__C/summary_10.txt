And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's Demurrer in part and denies it in part without leave to amend, and grants Defendant's Motion to Strike in part and denies it in part with leave to amend. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims in their individual capacity for Negligence and Premises Liability, but finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a cause of action for Premises Liability as successors in interest. The Judge also strikes certain damages from Plaintiffs' SAC, including damages for medical, ambulance, and incidental expenses, economic loss, property damage, and pre-trial interest, as these damages are recoverable only by Decedent as her successors in interest and not by Plaintiffs in their individual capacity. The Judge orders that Defendant's Demurrer be sustained without leave to amend on Plaintiffs' First and Second Causes of Action as Individuals, and sustained without leave to amend on Plaintiffs' Third Cause of Action as Successors in Interest.
