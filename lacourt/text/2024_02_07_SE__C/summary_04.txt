And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions for disbursement of surplus funds filed by Movant Asset Recovery, Inc. and Movant Jennifer Rivera. The surplus funds in question were generated from the foreclosure sale of a property in South Gate, California. The property was previously owned by Anthony Ayala Sr., who passed away without a will, and his estate would pass equally to his five children.

Jennifer Rivera is claiming 60 percent of the surplus funds, consisting of 20 percent on her behalf, 20 percent on behalf of Erika Curp, and 20 percent on behalf of Victor Ayala. Erika Curp and Victor Ayala assigned their right to collect from the surplus to Rivera. Asset Recovery, Inc. is claiming Anthony Ayala Jr.'s interest in the surplus funds, which was assigned to them by Anthony Ayala Jr.

The judge has determined that each heir is to take equally, and therefore, Asset Recovery is entitled to a 20 percent share of the surplus funds. The surplus funds were calculated to be $165,947.40, and after accounting for costs, $99,568.44 is available for distribution to Jennifer Rivera and $33,189.48 is available for distribution to Asset Recovery. The judge has granted the motions for disbursement of surplus funds in the amounts of $99,568.44 and $33,189.48, respectively.
