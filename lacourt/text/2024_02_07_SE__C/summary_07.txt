And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to transfer venue to the Central District, Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The defendants, Samtex Fabrics, Inc., Shimshon Kachan, and Mogjan Rahimian, filed a motion to transfer venue from the Southeast District, Norwalk Courthouse, where the plaintiff, National Commercial Recovery, Inc., originally filed the complaint. The defendants argue that the performance was to occur in China and that they reside in the Central District. The plaintiff has not opposed this motion, and therefore, the court has granted the defendants' motion. The case will now be transferred to the Central District, Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
