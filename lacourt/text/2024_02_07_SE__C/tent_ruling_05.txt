Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiffs Taryn Higham and Sarah Higham
(collectively Plaintiffs) move to compel further responses to their Special
Interrogatories (set one) and seek sanctions.
Background
On
February 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against FCA US, LLC (Defendant)
for violations of the Song-Beverly Act and against Oremor of Victorville, LLC
for Negligent Repair. 
Legal
Standard
On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of
the following apply: 
(1)
An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
(2)
An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.
(3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(CCP
§ 2030.300(a).)
Meet
and Confer
The
parties have adequately met and conferred.
Discussion

Interrogatories Nos. 45-48 seek information
related to rate of repair and defect information related to 2019 RAM 1500
vehicles generally. The Interrogatories are within the scope of
discovery as discovery is broad and includes information that is admissible or
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224.) The
Interrogatories could provide some evidence or lead to evidence regarding civil
penalties. However, the Interrogatories are overbroad
because they seek information related to vehicles worldwide. Therefore, they
are limited repair rates of 2021 Dodge Durango vehicles sold in California. Defendant
is ordered to provide further responses as to 2021 Dodge Durango vehicles sold
in California.
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h),
2033.290(d).) 
Defendant acted with substantial justification
in opposing Plaintiff’s overbroad requests. Thus, Plaintiffs’ request for
sanctions is denied.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED
with the limitations set forth above. Defendant is ordered to serve its
responses within 30 days of this Order. Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is
DENIED.
