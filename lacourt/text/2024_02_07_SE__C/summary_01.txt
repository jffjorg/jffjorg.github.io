And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the requests for production. The court finds that some of the defendant's objections to the requests are without merit and orders the defendant to provide further responses to certain requests. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses in part, with limitations, and denies it in part. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant. The defendant is ordered to serve its responses within 30 days of the order.
