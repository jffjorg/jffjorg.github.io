And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendant's answer. The demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part without leave to amend in part. The plaintiff's demurrer is sustained as to the eighth affirmative defense, which is deemed not viable because the plaintiff has filed a claim for damages. The demurrer is overruled as to the first through seventh, ninth, and tenth affirmative defenses, which are deemed sufficient when considered in the context of the allegations in the complaint. The court finds that the defendant's affirmative defenses are sufficient and that any residual uncertainty in the pleading can be resolved through discovery.
