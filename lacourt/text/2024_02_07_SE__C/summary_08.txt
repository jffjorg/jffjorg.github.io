And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has sustained Defendant State Farm Insurance's demurrer to Plaintiff Eva Myers' Complaint for Breach of Contract. The Plaintiff's Complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim because it does not attach the Insurance Contract or plead its material terms. Additionally, the Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts to support her claim. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff 30 days leave to amend her Complaint.
