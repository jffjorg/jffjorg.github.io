The Defendant opposed the Plaintiffs' overbroad requests, which sought information related to vehicles worldwide. The Judge found that the requests were overbroad and limited them to repair rates of 2021 Dodge Durango vehicles sold in California. The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the Plaintiffs' requests.
