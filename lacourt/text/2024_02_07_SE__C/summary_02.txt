And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrers filed by defendants Joy Gordon and Josephine Decora are overruled. The defendants had argued that the fourth and fifth causes of action for negligence and negligent hiring, respectively, were barred by the primary assumption of risk doctrine. However, the judge found that the complaint does not clearly state that the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies. The judge also found that the plaintiff has adequately pled a cause of action for negligent hiring, as the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants knew or should have known that their employee, Jane Doe, was unfit for employment. Therefore, the judge has overruled the defendants' demurrers and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
