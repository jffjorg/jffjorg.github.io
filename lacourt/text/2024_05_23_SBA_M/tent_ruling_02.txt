1.      USRE Trust, et al.’s Demurrer to Complaint     
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            USRE Trust, et al.’s Demurrer to
Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on February
17, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff is the former owner
of real property located at 10225 South 7th Avenue, Inglewood, California 90303.
The property was transferred away from Plaintiff through forgery. Plaintiff
alleges the following causes of action: 1. Slander of Title; 2. Quiet Title; 3.
Declaratory Relief; 4. Cancellation of Written Instrument; 5. Violation of Cal.
Bus. & Prof. Code Sections 17200 et seq.
 
             Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl. Kristi M. Wells.) 
 
            Demurrer

            A demurrer tests the sufficiency of
a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7
Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a
complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient
to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
            Sufficient facts are the essential
facts of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.”  (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
            Defendant demurs to the Complaint
and each cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff fails to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action. CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
            The demurrer to the Complaint and
each cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Upon the face of
the matters set forth in the Complaint, namely the attached Exhibit B,
Plaintiff appears to lack standing to state these causes of action. Exhibit B
appears to show that the subject property was transferred to the following
entity prior to the acts complained of by Plaintiff: “LeAmber Rose Howell,
Trustee of The Murchison Legacy Trust, dated March 10, 2019.”
 
            Thus, for the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
