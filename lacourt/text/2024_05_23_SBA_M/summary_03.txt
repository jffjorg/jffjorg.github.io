And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Ventura V. Ramos, Jr., filed a partition action on October 5, 2023, to divide a real property located at 27840 Palos Verdes Drive East, Rancho Palos Verdes, California, 90275. The plaintiff moved for interlocutory judgment and appointment of referee to sell the property and determine the ownership interests of the parties. However, the court denied the motion because the ownership interests of the parties have not yet been resolved. The court cited California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 872.610 and 872.710, which require that the court determine the ownership interests of the parties before making a judgment. The court also cited Summers v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 138, which held that a court cannot make an order for partition of the sale of the property until the parties' respective ownership interests are resolved.
