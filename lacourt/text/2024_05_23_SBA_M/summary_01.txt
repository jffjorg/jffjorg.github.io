And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents. The motion is moot, in part, and denied, in part. The defendant has already served further responses on May 7, 2024. The plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions and the defendant's counter-request for monetary sanctions are denied. The court expects counsel to resolve discovery disputes through a meet and confer process, rather than relying on expensive and cumbersome discovery motions.
