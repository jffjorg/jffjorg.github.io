And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling ahead of a court hearing on December 13, 2023. The ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to bifurcate their case against the broker defendants from their case against Williams. This means that the two cases will be tried separately, with the case against the broker defendants going to trial first. The judge also overrules the plaintiffs' demurrer to Williams' cross-complaint, finding that the allegations of fraud against the plaintiffs are sufficient to support Williams' claims. Finally, the judge denies the plaintiffs' motion to strike the cross-complaint, finding that it was not necessary for Williams to seek leave to file the cross-complaint at the time she moved to vacate the default judgment and file an answer to the plaintiffs' complaint.
