And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrers of both defendants, Legends Hospitality, LLC and Toast of LA, LLC, to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff, 3927 Van Buren LLC. The complaint alleges breach of contract, negligence, and negligent interference with economic advantage.

The judge finds that the economic loss rule bars the negligence and negligent interference with economic advantage claims, as the plaintiff is seeking to recover purely economic losses. The judge also finds that the special relationship test does not apply, as the parties are in contractual privity.

The judge also sustains the demurrer to the breach of contract claim, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of oral modifications to the contract are barred by the parol evidence rule and the integration clause in the contract.

The judge leaves it up to the plaintiff to make an offer of proof at the hearing as to how it could potentially amend its complaint to state a viable cause of action, and will consider granting leave to amend if the plaintiff can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of success.
