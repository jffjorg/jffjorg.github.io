Introduction 
Petitioner CarePatrol Franchise
Systems LLC (Petitioner) moved for attorneys’ fees on the appeal and on the
instant motion, as the prevailing party in the appeal filed by Respondent TSI
Investment Group, Inc. (Respondent). 
Respondent appealed this Court’s ruling to grant v’s amended petition to
confirm the arbitration award.  The Court
of Appeal affirmed this Court’s granting of the petition to confirm.  Petitioner requests a total of $76,075.50,
which includes $68,870.50 in fees for the appeal and $7,200.00 for the instant
motion.
Discussion 
When the appellate opinion is
silent as to attorney fees, as is the case here, the issue of fees is
determined on remand by motion made in the trial court pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1702.  (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.278(d)(2); Butler-Rupp. v. Lourdeaux (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th
918, 924.)  
There is no dispute that
Petitioner is the prevailing party on the appeal and is entitled to fees
pursuant to the attorneys’ fees provision in the contract at issue, the Master
Franchise Representative Agreement (MFRA).  
The issue presented in the briefs is a dispute over the amount of fees
being requested by Petitioner. 
Respondent argued that the fees incurred on the appeal and the instant
motion are unreasonable and unnecessary. 

Petitioner submitted the
declarations of Elan Stone (25.3 hours at $400/hr. and 30.2 hours at $450/hr.),
Frank Reino (5.1 hours at $500/hr.; 77.36 hours at $515/hr.; and 2.2 hours at
$520/hr.) and Christopher Alexander (2.9 hours at $475/hr.)  (Elan Stone Decl. par. 5; Frank Reino Decl.
par. 6; Christopher Alexander Decl. par. 3.) 
Mr. Stone attested to being a 16 year attorney.  (Stone Decl. par. 8.)  Mr. Reino attested to being a licensed
attorney beginning in 2003.  (Reino Decl.
par. 8.)  Mr. Alexander attested to being
a licensed attorney beginning in 2021. 
(Alexander Decl. par. 6.)  The
Court finds that the experience of Mr. Stone and Mr. Reino make their hourly
rates reasonable based upon the rates listed in the 2014 National Law Journal
Billing Survey.  (Stone Decl. par. 15,
Exh. 2.0  Mr. Stone charged a total of
55.5 hours and Mr. Reino charged a total of 84.66 hours.  As argued by Respondent, the invoices
attached to Mr. Stone and Mr. Reino’s declarations are redacted to the point
where it is impossible to determine the general characteristics of the work
performed.  At the least, the entries
include dates of when the work was performed thus showing that work performed
has some chronological connection to the appeal and the petition for writ of
review with the California Supreme Court. 
The appeal being filed on September 15, 2022 and remittitur being issued
on August 1, 2024.  The Court of Appeals’
opinion showed that the legal and factual issues presented were not novel or
difficult.  However, Petitioner provided
facts to show that the factual arguments made by Respondent were extensive,
especially for the fact that the entire record involved approximately 1,071
pages.  (Stone Decl. par. 12; Reino Decl.
par. 12.)  However, it is unclear why
Petitioner was required to retain separate law firms to defend against the
appeal.  Without some facts as to the
work performed by each attorney, the reasonableness of the hours expended by
all attorneys is difficult to determine. 
To balance between the lack of information in the entries of the
invoices and that the appeal involved extensive factual arguments, the Court
determines that the hours expended is excessive and are to be reduced.  The Court reduces Mr. Stone’s hours to a
total of 38.85 and Mr. Reino’s hours to a total of 59.25 hours.  Mr. Stone is awarded a total of $16,217.50
and Mr. Reino is awarded $30,437.25.
Mr. Alexander only being a three
year attorney yet charging similar rates to 16 year and 21 year attorneys is
unreasonable.  The Court reduces Mr.
Alexander’s hourly rate to a reasonable $350/hour.  Mr. Alexander’s fees are reduced by $362.50,
bringing Mr. Alexander’s fees  to a total
of $1,015.00.
The contention that the Court of
Appeal did not rely heavily on Petitioner’s opposing briefs is of no
consequence in the Court’s ruling. 
Respondent filed an appeal and Petitioner was required to respond to the
appeal.  The fact that Respondent’s
appeal lacked merit and/or Petitioner’s opposition was not as significant to
the opinion is irrelevant.  The
contention is unpersuasive.
The contention that Respondent’s
fees were significantly less than Petitioner’s fees is irrelevant to the review
because the unsupported contention fails to show how Petitioner’s fees were
unreasonable or unnecessary.  An attempt
to compare opposing counsel’s fees without any context is unpersuasive.  Respondent’s argument as to the fees they
paid is unpersuasive.
Petitioner’s total fees on the
appeal are reduced to $47,669.75.
As for the fees on the instant
motion, the Court finds that Mr. Stone’s hourly rate of $450/hour is reasonable
but the nine hours expended on the instant motion to be excessive.  The Court reduces the time to 6 hours.  The fees for the instant motion are reduced
to a reasonable rate of $2,700.00.
Petitioner’s motion for fees is
GRANTED in Part and the fees awarded are reduced to $50,369.75.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
