And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant, Landmark Escrow, Inc., has successfully demurred to the Plaintiff, Wisam Salem's, Complaint. The Plaintiff had alleged that the Defendant was negligent and breached its fiduciary duty in connection with the handling of escrow funds. The Defendant argued that there were insufficient facts to show that a duty of care was owed, that the duty was breached, or that the breach caused the Plaintiff's damages. The Judge agreed with the Defendant, finding that the Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support the element of duty under both causes of action. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff failed to allege any express obligation or instruction in the escrow instruction at issue that would require the Defendant to protect the parties to the escrow from third-party fraud or crime. As a result, the Judge sustained the Defendant's demurrer without leave to amend.
