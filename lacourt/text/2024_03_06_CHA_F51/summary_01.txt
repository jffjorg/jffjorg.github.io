And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for a jury trial in this case. The defendants, Gary G. Topolewski and Topolewski America, Inc., had requested a jury trial in their Case Management Statement and had posted jury fees on January 30, 2024. The court had previously scheduled a non-jury trial for March 17, 2025. The judge found that the defendants had not waived their right to a jury trial because their untimely payment of jury fees did not cause prejudice to the plaintiff or the court. The judge noted that the opposition did not demonstrate any prejudice that would result from allowing a jury trial. The court granted relief from waiver of jury trial and set a jury trial for March 17, 2025 at 8:30 AM.
