Topolewski and  Topolewski America, Inc.  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff  Bank of the West  NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: Defendants  move for a jury trial rather than a non-jury trial.    TENTATIVE RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.    BACKGROUND    Plaintiff Bank  of the West (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Gary G.  Topolewski (“Topolewski”) and Topolewski America Inc. (“TAI””) (collectively  “Defendants”), as well as DOES 1 through 250, inclusive, arising from  Defendants defaulting on various loans issued by Plaintiff. On July 6, 2022,  Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants.    On January  18, 2023, Defendants filed and served a Case Management Statement in which  Defendants requested a jury trial. (01/18/23 Case Management Statement, ¶ 5.)    On February  2, 2023, the Court, pursuant to oral stipulation, continued the Case Management  Conference set for February 2, 2023 to March 15, 2023.    On March 3,  2023, Defendants filed and served a Case Management Statement in which  Defendants requested a jury trial. (03/03/23 Case Management Statement, ¶ 5.)    On March  17, 2023, the Court continued the Case Management Conference to June 8, 2023.    On March  29, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against  Defendants alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of  Security Agreement; (3) Breach of Contract; (4) Breach of Security Agreement;  (5) Breach of Contract; (6) Breach of Security Agreement; (7) Recovery of  Personal Property (Claim and Delivery); (8) Temporary Restraining Order and  Preliminary Injunction; (9) Conversion; and (10) Fraud and Deceit.                           On April 28, 2023, Defendants filed a cross-complaint  against Plaintiff alleging causes of action for: (1) Malicious Prosecution and (2)  Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.    On June 8,  2023, the Court held the Case Management Conference and continued the Case  Management Conference to July 13, 2023.    On July 13,  2023, the Court continued the Case Management Conference to August 22, 2023.    On August  22, 2023, the Court continued the Case Management Conference to October 25,  2023.    On October  25, 2023, the Court continued the Case Management Conference to January 30,  2024.    On January  17, 2024, Defendants filed a Case Management Statement in which Defendants  requested a jury trial. (01/17/24 Case Management Statement, ¶ 5.)    On January  30, 2024, Defendants filed and served a Demand for Jury Trial. Also, on January  30, 2024, Defendants filed and served a Notice of Posting Jury Fees pursuant to  Code Civ. Proc. § 631. Defendants posted jury fees in the amount of $150.00.    On January  30, 2024, the Court held a Case Management Conference and ordered Plaintiff to  be dismissed without prejudice from the cross-complaint due to Defendants not  filing an amended cross-complaint within 30 days of the Court sustaining the  demurrer thereto on October 25, 2023. (01/30/24 Minute Order.) The Court also  scheduled non-jury trial for March 17, 2025. (01/30/24 Minute Order.)                On February 8, 2024, Defendants filed and served the  instant Motion for Jury Trial on the grounds that Defendants requested jury  trial in their Case Management Statement and have posted jury fees, yet the  minutes from the Case Management Conference indicate that a non-jury trial was  set. Defendants “request that the Court either set a jury trial either on the  same date or move the date if necessary to accommodate a jury.” (Motion, p. 1:5-6.)     Plaintiff  filed an opposition to the motion on February 22, 2024, to which Defendants  replied on February 28, 2024.    ANALYSIS   “The right to a trial by jury as declared by Section 16 of  Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to the parties  inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision  (f).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (a).) “At least one party demanding a jury  on each side of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty  dollars ($150), unless the fee has been paid by another party on the same side  of the case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (b).) Jury fees are “due on or  before the date scheduled for the initial case management conference in the  action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (c).) A party waives jury trial “[b]y  failing to timely pay the fee described in subdivision (b), unless another  party on the same side of the case has paid that fee.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631,  subd. (f)(5).) “The court, may in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial  by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 631, subd. (g).)  “It is settled  that in the case of doubt, the issue should be resolved in favor of preserving  a litigant’s constitutional right to a trial by jury.” (Oakes v. McCarthy  Co. (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 231, 265 [citations omitted].) “[T]he denial of a  jury trial after waiver where no prejudice is shown to the other party or to  the court is prejudicial.” (Bryam v. Superior Court (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d  648, 654.)     A.    Appropriateness  of Allowing a Jury Trial    In support of the motion, Defendants’ counsel, Elliot S.  Blut (“Blut”), declares that Defendants’ Case Management Statement requested a  jury trial. (Blut Decl., ¶ 2.) Blut states that jury fees have been posted and  Defendants did not consent to waive jury, and five court days have not passed  since the hearing where the minute order was prepared reflecting non-jury  trial. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4; Exhibit 1.)    In opposition to the motion, Plaintiff asserts that  Defendants have waived their right to a jury trial. The Court notes that  Defendants did not timely pay jury fees prior to the February 2, 2023 Case  Management Conference. Defendants did not post jury fees until January 30,  2024. Thus, Defendants waived their right to a jury trial due to their untimely  payment of jury fees.   However, the Court finds that relief from waiver is  appropriate as no prejudice has been shown by Plaintiff. In fact, the  opposition does not state any prejudice that will result from allowing a jury  trial. Moreover, the Court does not find any prejudice to the Court as trial is  scheduled for March of 2025.    As such, the Court will grant Defendants relief from waiver  of jury trial pursuant to Bryam v. Superior Court, supra, 74  Cal.App.3d 648, 654.       CONCLUSION    Defendants’  Motion for Jury Trial is GRANTED. The Court sets jury trial for March 17, 2025  at 8:30 AM in this department, which is the same date and time that non-jury  trial was initially set in this action. The Court merely changes trial from a  non-jury trial to a jury trial.
