Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the insurer's motion for leave to intervene in the auto accident case. The insurer, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, seeks to intervene because the defendant, Christian Mauricio Torresarias, is unwilling to participate in the litigation. The court finds that the insurer has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and that intervention is necessary to protect the insurer's own interests. The court notes that the insurer has a right to intervene where the insured is barred from defending itself, as in this case. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and the court grants the motion. The court will hold a hearing on May 20, 2024, for oral argument.
