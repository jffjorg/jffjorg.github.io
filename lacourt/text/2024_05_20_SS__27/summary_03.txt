Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motions to compel second IME and mental examination on the Plaintiffs, Angela T. Elam and Jennifer P. Richards. The Defendant's approach to filing separate motions for each examination is denied. The Defendant needs to provide sufficient showing of good cause for each examination, including the specific diagnostic tests to be performed, how each test is related to the conditions in controversy, and how it differs from previous examinations. The Court is inclined to grant a mental examination and a neurological IME if the Defendant makes a sufficient showing of good cause.

Additionally, the Court has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial to a new date to be determined. The parties are to meet and confer on the IMEs and mental examinations with the Court's inclinations as guidance in seeking informal resolution.
