The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. Defendant Zachary Borson moved the Court to file a cross-complaint for indemnity and declaratory relief against Co-Defendant Naomi Sengal. The Court granted the motion because the cross-complaint is mandatory and no opposition was filed. The Court noted that leave to file a cross-complaint must be granted absent bad faith, and that the proposed cross-complaint must be attached to the motion. The Court also warned that if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off the calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
