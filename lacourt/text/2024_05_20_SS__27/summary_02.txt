And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel a second neurological IME and mental examination. The defendant failed to specify the diagnostic tests to be conducted and did not provide an explanation for the necessity and scope of the examination. The judge noted that the parties are at an impasse because the plaintiff consents to only one examination and requires the raw data from the mental examination to be provided to the plaintiff's counsel. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has put several conditions at issue that seem neurological in nature, but without more detail, the judge cannot determine if the second IME will be duplicative of the neurological examination done by the first IME doctor. The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the mental examination and second IME. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
