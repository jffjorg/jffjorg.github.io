And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to deem the contents of the Requests for Admission admitted and grants the request for sanctions. The plaintiff failed to provide timely responses to the defendant's Requests for Admission, Set One, and the responses served were unverified. The defendant made attempts to meet and confer with the plaintiff but received no response. The court finds that the plaintiff's responses were "tantamount to no responses at all" and grants the defendant's motion. The defendant is awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $1,010.00, and the plaintiff and her counsel are ordered to pay sanctions in the same amount.
