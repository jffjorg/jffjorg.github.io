Legal Standard
 
A cross-complaint against any of
the parties who filed the initial complaint or cross-complaint against the
cross-complainant must be filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
initial complaint or cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days
of service of the complaint or cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 412.20(a)(3), 428.50(a), 432.10.)¿Any other cross-complaint may be
filed at any time before the court has set a trial date.¿(CCP §428.50(b).)
 
If a party fails to file a
cross-complaint within the time limits described above, he or she must obtain
permission from the court to file the cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).) The proposed
cross-complaint is mandatory when it arises out of the same transaction as
plaintiff’s claim. The court must grant leave to file the mandatory
cross-complaint absent bad faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50, Silver Organizations,
Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.) Leave to file a permissive
cross-complaint need only be granted in the interest of justice. (CCP
§428.50(c).) Judicial policy generally supports the resolution of all disputed
matters between parties, leave to amend or leave to cross-complain is typically
granted liberally. (See Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 412.)
The Court may, however, deny such leave if there is demonstrated prejudice to
the opposing party, such as trial delays, loss of critical evidence, or
increased preparation costs. (Id.)¿ “Cross complaints for comparative
equitable indemnity would appear virtually always transactionally related to
the main action.” (Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All American
Develop. Co. (1991) 230 CA3d 30, 38.)
 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324 requires a copy of the proposed cross complaint to be attached to the
motion. 
 
Discussion
On May 22, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the present motor accident case against Defendants Zachary
Borson and Naomi Sengal. On July 28, 2023, Defendant Borson filed his answer.
Defendant Naomi Sengal has yet to be served. Defendant Borson now moves the
Court to file a cross-complaint for indemnity and declaratory relief against
Co-Defendant Sengal. No opposition was filed. Borson’s cross-complaint for
indemnity is mandatory (Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All
American Develop. Co. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 30, 38), and no opposition or
any other document alleging bad faith has been filed. Defendant also attached a
proposed cross-complaint to the moving papers. Thus, the present motion is
GRANTED.
