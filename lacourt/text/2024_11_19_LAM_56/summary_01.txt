Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant's Person(s) Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and denies the Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production from Defendant. The judge finds that Defendant has not refused to appear for or proceed with the deposition of its corporate witness and that there is no basis for the Plaintiffs' Deposition Motion at this time, considering that Plaintiffs have already agreed to a March 27, 2025 deposition date.

The judge also finds that the Defendant has served its responses to the RFPs, and therefore, the RFPs Motion is MOOT. The judge denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs for the cost of opposing the Deposition Motion.

The judge notes that there are unclear statements of the facts underlying the RFP Motion, and the parties' versions differ regarding the service of documents and the granting of an extension. The judge is puzzled by the Defendant's request to relieve it from waiver of objections under Code Civ. Proc. ยง 2031.300 and finds that the parties' differing and unclear statements of the facts underlying the RFP Motion make it difficult to determine whether the Defendant's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
