And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over the complaint and that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over the internal affairs of the trust. The judge has considered the moving papers and has assumed the truth of the allegations in the complaint. The judge finds that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over the internal affairs of the trust, including the construction of the trust instrument, determination of beneficiaries, and accounting of the trustee. As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the court will stay the entry of an order for dismissal for 60 days to allow the plaintiffs to file the appropriate petition in the probate court.
