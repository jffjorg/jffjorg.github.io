Tentative Ruling:  GrantI.          INTRODUCTION
On October 7,
2020, Plaintiff Martine Jimenez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint for personal
injuries against Defendant Thomas Elmer Seiler (Defendant) and DOES 1-20,
inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and (2) failure to
yield. The complaint asserts that on or about October 23, 2028, Plaintiff was
legally crossing the street in the designated crosswalk when Defendant struck
Plaintiff with his vehicle.  
On October 10,
2022, the Court entered an Order dismissing the complaint. The dismissal was
vacated on October 2, 2023 based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration that
Plaintiff’s failure to appear for the hearing on October 10, 2022 was due to
counsel’s mistake and neglect. 
On March 21, 2024,
Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant also requests sanctions. As of May
10, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
Standard for Compelling Interrogatories – Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290 provides that a
party may bring a motion to compel responses to interrogatories, where the
responding party failed to serve a timely response. Unless otherwise agreed,
the responding party is required to serve response within 30 days after service
of the interrogatories. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.260.) “The party
propounding interrogatories and the responding party may agree to extend the
time for service of a response to a set of interrogatories, or to particular
interrogatories in a set, to a date beyond that provided in Section 2030.260.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270(a).) While this agreement may be informal, it
must be confirmed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.270(b).)  If the responding party fails to serve a timely
response, the party “any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories . . .” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(a).)  
Standard for Compelling Responses¿to
Requests for¿Production¿(“RFP”)¿–¿Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 provides that a party may
bring a motion to compel responses to a request for production of documents,
where the responding party failed to serve a timely response. Unless otherwise
agreed, the responding party is required to serve response within 30 days after
service of the discovery demand for production documents. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.260(a).) If the responding party fails to serve a timely response, the
party “waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or
on the protection for work product . . .” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)
The requesting party need not demonstrate “good cause to compel responses, nor
that it satisfied the “meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko¿Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants¿(2007) 143
Cal.App.4th¿390, 404.) 
 III.      DISCUSSIONDefendant
served Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FROGs”), Special Interrogatories, Set
One (“SROGs”) (collectively, the “ROGs”) and Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One (“RFPs”) on Plaintiff on October 31, 2023, 2023. (Barresi Decl., ¶ 2,
Ex. A.)  Plaintiff requested two extensions of the deadline to respond.
(Id., ¶¶ 4-6, Ex. C, D, and E.) Defendant never received Plaintiff’s responses.
(Id., ¶ 7.e)  Defendant
requests sanctions in the total amount of $1,980 against Plaintiff and his
attorney. The Court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process
under CCP § 2023.030. Plaintiff’s conduct constitutes misuse of the discovery
process under CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d) (“failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery”). Defendant requests $660 per motion, which
corresponds to two hours to prepare the motion and one hour to prepare a reply
at $200/hour, plus a $60 filing fee. Here, no opposition was filed, and
Defendant did not need to file any reply. Therefore, the requested amount is
excessive. The Court grants Defendant’s request in the reduced amount of $460
per motion, for a total of $1,380.  In light of the declaration recently filed by Plaintiff's counsel that his client has gone missing, the Court finds good cause to issue sanctions against Martin Jimenez only.
 IV.       CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s
motions are GRANTED. Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount
of $1,380 against Martin Jimenez only. 
Moving party to give notice.
