Roles:

  - Defendant: CLG Construction
  - Counsel for Plaintiff: Ryan Davidson
  - Counsel for Defendant: Cheyenne J. Page
  - Investigator for Defendant: retained cyber investigator
Significant Statements:
  - Plaintiff's counsel, Ryan Davidson, declares that the parties had a telephonic meet and confer but were unable to resolve the issues presented in the motion.
  - Defendant CLG's counsel, Cheyenne J. Page, declares that she instructed the investigator to obtain footage and specified the time of day, types of activities filmed, frequency and length of the surveillance, location of the filming, and subject of the surveillance.
  - The Court finds that Plaintiff's reliance on Suezaki v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 166 is inapposite as such case relies on an interpretation of a repealed section of the Code of Civil Procedure.
  - The Court also finds that Defendant CLG's reliance on Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480 is inapposite as such case involved the discovery of witness statements.
  - The Court finds that Plaintiff has not supported her motion by a proper affidavit and that the declarations of Plaintiff's counsel do not make a showing of good cause.
  - The Court finds that even if Plaintiff had shown good cause, Defendant CLG would have made a showing that the sub rosa films obtained by its retained investigator are attorney work-product.
  - The Court finds it unfair for Plaintiff to take advantage of the efforts of counsel for Defendant CLG.
