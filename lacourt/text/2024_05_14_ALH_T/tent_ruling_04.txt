Further Responses and Documents 
 
Moving Party:                         Plaintiff Nicole
Cunningham    
Responding Party:                   Defendant CLG Construction 
 
Tentative Ruling:                    Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses and Documents is DENIED. 
 BACKGROUND
            On July 20, 2021, Plaintiff Nicole
Cunningham (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants CLG Construction,
Inc. (“CLG”), Hy-Max Building Corp. (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1
through 100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Premises Liability;
and (2) Negligence. 
            Plaintiff alleges that on January 12,
2020, she suffered serious and life-altering injuries when she was involved in
a trip-and-fall while at a building that was under construction being performed
by Defendants. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges that she was showing a
prospective tenant a unit on the fourth floor when, while crossing a hallway,
Plaintiff tripped and fell over a large, loose piece of ram board that had been
negligently placed and had not been properly secured. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) Due to
the unsafe condition, Plaintiff fell and suffered serious injuries to her body
and health. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)  
            On October 14, 2021, Defendants
filed a joint Answer to the Complaint. 
            On March 19, 2024, an Informal
Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held. (03/19/24 Minute Order.) After
discussion, the Court deemed that the parties’ discovery issues remained
unresolves. (03/19/24 Minute Order.) 
            On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses and Documents.
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant CLG to provide further responses to request
for production of documents numbers 50, 78, 79, 80, and 81 which concern “sub
rosa media and social media postings” and to produce responsive documents.
(Motion at p. 2:1-3.) Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,200.00
against Defendant CLG and its counsel of record, Horton, Oberrecht &
Kirkpatrick.
            On April 26, 2024, this case was
reassigned to the Honorable Ian C. Fusselman sitting in Department T at
Alhambra Courthouse effective May 13, 2024. 
            On April 30, 2024, Defendant CLG
filed and served an opposition to the motion. On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served a reply brief. Although filed and served late, the Court exercises
its discretion and will consider the reply brief. (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1300,
subd. (d).)          DISCUSSION
Applicable Law 
            In California,
discovery statutes “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless
the request is clearly improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 541.) “Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable
if it is unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the
action or reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” (John B. v.
Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186.) “Discovery may relate to the
claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the
action.” (Ibid.)
            In responding to
a request for production of documents, a party must directly respond by any of
the following: (1) a statement that the party will comply with the particular
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling; (2) a representation that
the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item; or (3) an
objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a)(1)-(3).) 
            On receipt of a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) a statement
of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection to the
response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(a)(1)-(3).) A motion brought pursuant to CCP § 2031.310 “shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(1).) 

            “To establish
good cause, a discovery proponent must identify a
disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and explain how the
discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to
other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” (Digital Music
News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) “In law and
motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of
declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) 
            Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.  Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a
misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A
court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)  

Analysis 
A.    The Meet and Confer
Requirement 
“The Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of a
motion to compel, the moving party declare that he or she has made a serious
attempt to obtain an informal resolution of each issue.” (Stewart v.
Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) “A meet
and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
            Initially, the Court will address the contention of
Defendant CLG that Plaintiff has failed to make a good faith attempt to resolve
the issues presented in the motion. The Court rejects such contention as
Plaintiff’s counsel, Josh Dowell (“Dowell”), provides a declaration stating
that the parties had a telephonic meet and confer but were unable to resolve
the issues regarding the requests for production. (Dowell Decl., ¶ 2.) Thus,
the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
B.     The Discovery at Issue 

            Plaintiff’s counsel, Ryan Davidson (“Davidson”), declares
the following: on September 8, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Production Nos. 50, 78, 79, 80, and 81. (Davidson Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 1.) Request
Nos. 50 and 80 concern sub rosa videos in Defendant CLG’s possession. (Id.)
Request Nos. 78, 79, and 81 concern Plaintiff’s social media postings. (Id.)
On November 7, 2023, Defendant CLG responded to the requests with string
objections and provided no responses at all. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. 2.) Specifically,
an identical response to all requests of “Objection. This responding party
objects to this request on the grounds that it is vague, ambiguous, and overly
broad; it seeks information in violation of the attorney work product privilege
and attorney/client privilege; it assumes facts; and it lacks foundation.” (Id.)
On April 3, 2024, Defendant CLG served further responses to Request Nos. 50,
78, 79, and 81. (Id., ¶ 6; Exh. 4.) In further responses to RFP No. 50,
Defendant CLG stated that “Sub Rosa was conducted in April 2022, December 2022,
and January 2023, and April 2023.” (Id.) In further responses to RFP
Nos. 78, 79, and 81, Defendant CLG stated that “[a] social media search was
conducted in September 2023 by this responding party’s retained cyber
investigator. This responding party did not designate its cyber investigator as
an expert and any work and/or reports completed by the cyber investigator is
attorney work-product and remains privileged. Please see attached privilege
log.” (Id.) The privilege log reveals that Defendant CLG is withholding
four videos of “Plaintiff’s residence,” and “downloads” from Plaintiff’s social
media accounts including Facebook, Backstage, and LinkedIn. (Id., ¶ 7;
Exh. 5.) 
            Counsel for Defendant CLG, Cheyenne J. Page (“Page”), relevantly
declares that she instructed the investigator to obtain footage, and specified
the time of day, the types of activities filmed, the frequency and length of
the surveillance, the location of the filming, and the subject of the
surveillance. (Page Decl., ¶ 16.) 
C.    Appropriateness of Compelling
Further Responses 

RFP No. 50 requests “All Sub Rosa films of
Plaintiff taken as a result of the INCIDENT.”
RFP No. 78 requests a
complete download of any social media postings made by Plaintiff that were
downloaded by Defendant CLG as a result of the incident from the date of the
incident through the present. RFP No. 79 requests a complete download of any
social media postings by Plaintiff that were downloaded by Defendant CLG as a
result of the incident from the date of the incident through the present. RFP
No. 80 requests a color copy of all photographs taken of Plaintiff by Defendant
CLG as a result of the incident from the date of the incident through the
present. RFP No. 81 requests a copy of all screen shots of Plaintiff taken from
any social media postings taken by Defendant CLG as a result of the incident. 
            “[T]he work product doctrine protects the mental
processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can
analyze and prepare his client’s case.” (Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1281, internal quotations omitted.) “[U]n
written opinion work is protected only by a qualified privilege.” (Ibid.)
“A writing that reflects an attorney’s impressions, conclusions, or legal
research or theories is not discoverable under any circumstances.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2018.030, subd. (a).) “The work product of an attorney, other than a
writing described in subdivision (a), is not discoverable unless the court
determines that the denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party
seeking discovery in preparing that party’s claim or defense or will result in
an injustice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030, subd. (b).) It is the policy of
this state to: (1) preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial
with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases
thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable
aspects of those cases; and (2) prevent attorneys from taking undue advantage
of their adversary’s industry and efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.020, subs.
(a)-(b).) Photos or films reflecting counsel’s strategies and tactics in
preparation for trial should be treated as qualified work product. (California
Practice Guide, Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter Group June 2023), Chapter
8C-4, Attorney Work Product Protection at § 8:243.) The work product of an
investigator for an attorney is treated as attorney work product. (Rodriguez
v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 626, 647-48.) 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff’s reliance on Suezaki
v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 166 is inapposite as such case relies on
an interpretation of a repealed section of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
Court also finds that Defendant CLG’s reliance on Coito v. Superior Court (2012)
54 Cal.4th 480 is inapposite as such case involved the discovery of witness
statements. Here, witness statements are not at issue in the instant motion. 
Unlike the petitioners in Suezaki, Plaintiff has not
supported her motion by a proper affidavit. The declarations of Plaintiff’s
counsel in support of the motion do not make a showing of good cause. Neither
the declaration of Dowell nor Davidson explains “how the discovery sought will
tend in reason to prove or disprove [a] fact or lead to other evidence that
will tend to prove or disprove [a] fact” or identifies a disputed fact that is
of consequence in the action. (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) Plaintiff has not met her
burden in showing good cause to compel further responses. (Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
223-24.)
            Additionally, the Court finds that even if Plaintiff had
shown good cause, Defendant CLG would have made a showing that the sub rosa
films—which were obtained by its retained investigator—are attorney
work-product. Also, the social media postings (RFP Nos. 78-79) and screen shots
of Plaintiff taken from any social media postings (RFP No. 81) were taken by Defendant
CLG’s retained cyber investigator. RFP No. 80 seeks a color copy of all
photographs taken of Plaintiff by Defendant CLG as a result of the incident. The
Court finds it unfair for Plaintiff to take advantage of the efforts of counsel
for Defendant CLG. (CCP § 2018.020(b).) 
            The Court therefore DENIES Plaintiff’s request to compel
further responses to RFP Nos. 50, 78, 79, 80, and 81 WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
D.    Monetary Sanctions
Given that Plaintiff has not met her burden in showing good cause,
the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant
CLG and its counsel of record.Defendant CLG requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. Defendant
CLG requests sanctions in the amount of $1,420.00 against Plaintiff for
Plaintiff’s failure to make a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally
resolve the issues raised in the motion. (Opp’n at p. 11:21-27.) The Court does
not find that Plaintiff failed to informally meet and confer. As such, the
Court DENIES Defendant CLG’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses and Documents is DENIED.
Plaintiff
to give notice.
