Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Voge, Inc., moved to strike portions of the complaint filed by plaintiffs Sheila and Ross Vance, alleging conversion and unjust enrichment. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs' punitive damages prayer is inadequately supported because the allegations are conclusory and do not show malice, oppression, or fraud. The court disagreed, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations, accepted as true, could show that the defendant engaged in "despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." The court denied the defendant's motion to strike, holding that the plaintiffs have operative claims for both conversion and unjust enrichment.
