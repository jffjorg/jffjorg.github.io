And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's request for a three-month trial continuance. The defendant, Beach City Properties, Inc., argued that good cause exists to continue the trial from April 22, 2024, to July 22, 2024, citing late discovery and prejudice caused by the plaintiff's changing theory of the case. However, the Judge disagreed, citing the following facts: the trial date has been set for nearly a year, the supplemental production was provided over a year ago, and the plaintiff's evolving claims do not constitute good cause for a continuance. Additionally, the Judge noted that the court's calendar is overwhelmed by the current trial caseload, and a three-month continuance is not feasible.
