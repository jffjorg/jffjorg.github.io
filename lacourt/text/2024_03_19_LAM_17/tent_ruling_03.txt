Petitioner’s
petition to approve the transfer of structured settlement payments is GRANTED. 
A petition for
transfer of structured settlement payment rights must comply with insurance
Code §§10136, 10137, 10138, 10139, 10139.3, and 10139.5. 
Legal Standard 
This
Petition is governed by Insurance Code sections 10134–10139.5. (See
also 321 Henderson Receivables Origination LLC v. Sioteco (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1066.)  Under Insurance Code section 10137,
a transfer of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court
reviews and approves the transfer and finds the following conditions are met: 
             
a.                 
The transfer of the structured settlement
payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee,
taking into account the welfare and support of his or her dependents. 
b.                 
The transfer complies with the requirements
of this article and will not contravene other applicable law, and the
court has reviewed and approved the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. 
 
Pursuant
to Insurance Code section 10139.5(a), the Court must make the following express
findings as to a transfer of structured settlement payment rights: 
 
1.                 
The transfer is in the best interest of the
payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependents. 
2.                 
The payee has been advised in writing by the
transferee to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and
has either received that advice or knowingly waived receipt of that
advice in writing. 
3.                 
The transferee has provided the payee with a
disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. 
4.                 
The transfer does not contravene any
applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority. 
5.                 
The payee reasonably understands the terms of
the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure
statement required by Section 10136. 
6.                 
The payee understands and does not wish to
exercise the payee's right to cancel the transfer agreement. 
 
The
transfer agreement is effective only upon approval in a final court order.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)   
Discussion 
In exchange for $81,000, Payee has agreed to transfer and
assign the right for 1 payment of $110,00.00 due on October 14, 2025. 
            In order to approve a transfer of
structured settlement payments, the Court must determine that the transfer of
the structured settlement payments is fair and reasonable. (Henderson, supra,
173 Cal.App.4th at p. 1066.)
            Petitioner
Perez’ declaration provides the following information: Perez is 38 years old. (Perez Decl. ¶ 8.) She is married, and has a
two-year-old child. (Id.) Her spouse is employed earning $4160
per month, and receives payments of $8,808.00 per month from my annuity. (Id.) Perez has previously
transferred structured payments on three occasions. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Perez is currently experiencing
financial hardship and states that if approved, “I will use the money
received from the proposed settlement to pay off $35,000 - $40,000 in credit
card debt. They rest of the money from the transaction will be used for daily
living expenses and emergencies. (Id. ¶ 11.)
This Petition complies with all of the statutory obligations required by
Insurance Code sections 10134 - 10139.5, including the following: 
 
1.     
J.G
Wentworth has provided Perez with a disclosure form that complies with
section 10136, subdivision (b); 
2.     
The
written transfer agreement complies with section 10136, subdivision (c) and
section 10138 (Pet.); 
3.     
Perez
has been advised in writing to seek independent professional advice regarding
the transfer and has waived his opportunity to obtain this advice; 
4.     
JG
Wentworth has complied with the requisite notification requirements set forth
by section 10139, subdivision (a) and section 10139.5, subdivision (f); 
5.     
The
transfer agreement does not include any provisions prohibited by section 10138; 
6.     
Perez
reasonably understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms
set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136; and 
7.     
Perez
understands and does not wish to exercise his right to cancel the transfer
agreement. 
 
The transfer appears to be fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of Perez. The transfer complies with the
requirements of Insurance Code sections 10134 - 10139.5, and it will not
contravene other applicable law. Moreover, the court has reviewed and approved
the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Petitioner’s petition to approve the transfer of structured
settlement payments is granted. 
It
is so ordered.
