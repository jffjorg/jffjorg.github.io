 Case No.: 
  20STCV46143
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date: March 19, 2024



 
Defendants’
request for a three-month trial continuance is DENIED.
 
On 12/3/2020,
Plaintiffs Juan Antonio Alvizurez, Arely I. Perez, Keily D. Perez, a minor by
and through her guardian ad litem Arely I. Perez, Darwin E. Perez, a minor by
and through her guardian ad litem Arely I. Perez, Justin N. Perez, a minor by
and through her guardian ad litem Arely I. Perez, Flor De Maria Marroquin, Angela
V. Garcia minor by and through her guardian ad litem Flor De Maria Marroquin,
and Yanelin R. Perez filed suit against Beach City Properties, alleging: (1)
breach of implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of statutory warranty of
habitability; (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) negligence; (5)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4; and (6) private nuisance. 
 
On 4/24/2023,
the Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend to file a first amended complaint
(FAC). In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges: (1) breach of implied warranty of
habitability; (2) breach of statutory warranty of habitability; (3) breach of
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) negligence; (5) violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4; (6) private nuisance; (7) alter-ego liability; and (8) section
1940.5. 
 
           Now,
Defendants move to continue trial. 
 
           The
motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion 
 
           Defendant
argue that good cause exists to continue trial from April 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
to July 22, 2024, or such later date as is convenient to the Court, and the
Final Status Conference (FSC) set for April 11, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. to July 11,
2024, and to continue all trial related deadlines as if the new trial date were
the "date initially set for trial of the action" within the meaning
of that phrase as used in CCP section 2024.030.
 
           After
review, the Court disagrees based on the following facts.
 
           First,
trial in this matter is set for April of 2024 and parties have had notice of
the date for nearly a year. As such, a motion to continue new trial heard is
not appropriately brought in March 2024, given that Defendants’ motion does not
set forth any new discovery or surprise which has warranted a trial continuance.

 
           Second,
while Defendants argue that they will be prejudiced by the trial date given
late discovery from Plaintiff, the supplemental production in question was
provided on February 13, 2023. As such, this was over a year ago, and
Defendants’ failure to since determine whether or not re-depose Plaintiffs, or
to engage in further discovery based on this production, constitutes
unreasonable delay. 
 
           Third,
while Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have changed the theory of the case
several times, leave to amend was granted to Plaintiffs in March of 2023.
Again, given that a year has passed, the Court finds insufficient evidence of
prejudice based on Plaintiff’s evolving claims throughout this litigation. 
 
           Fourth,
put simply, the Court’s calendar is overwhelmed by the current trial caseload,
and a three-month trial continuance is not feasible in light of the lack of the
lack of good cause shown. The Court is now setting new cases for jury trial in
October, 2025.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ request for a three-month trial continuance is denied.
(CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) 
 
 
It is so ordered.
