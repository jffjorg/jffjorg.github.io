English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion by Dignity Community Care dba California Hospital Medical Center (Dignity) for a determination of good faith settlement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6(a). Dignity settled with plaintiff George Smith for $29,999, and the opposing party, Bryan D. Hubbard, M.D., opposes the motion. The judge finds that Dignity presented substantial evidence that its settlement was in good faith, based on the Tech-Bilt factors, which include a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The judge concludes that Dignity's settlement of $29,999, which is 19.4% of its potential liability, falls within the ballpark of good faith settlements. The opposing party, Dr. Hubbard, does not meet his burden of showing that the settlement was not made in good faith. Therefore, the court grants Dignity's motion for determination of good faith settlement and finds that the settlement was entered into in good faith.
