  Case Number:  21STCV04357    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
Dignity Community Care’s Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
Defendant
Dignity Community Care dba California Hospital Medical Center (Dignity) moves for
an order determining good faith settlement under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6(a).  Defendant Bryan D.
Hubbard, M.D., opposes the motion.
When
only some of multiple defendants alleged to be jointly liable settle a case,
the settling parties may apply to the court for a determination of good faith
settlement.  (CCP § 877.6(a).)  A determination of good faith settlement “shall
bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against
the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution,
or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or
comparative fault.”  (CCP § 877.6(c).)
In
Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488
(Tech-Bilt), the California Supreme Court set forth a non-exclusive list
of factors to consider in making this determination.  “The intent and policies underlying section
877.6 require that a number of factors be taken into account including a rough
approximation of plaintiffs’ total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate
liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds
among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in
settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.  Other relevant considerations include the
financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as
well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure
the interests of nonsettling defendants. 
[Citation.]  Finally, practical
considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of
information available at the time of settlement.”  (Id. at p. 499.)
The
opposing party bears the burden “to show the settlement amount was ‘so far “out
of the ballpark” in relation to’ the Tech–Bilt factors that the
settlement was inconsistent with the equitable objectives of section
877.6.”  (Cahill v. San Diego Gas
& Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 967 (Cahill); accord
CCP § 877.6(d) [“The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the
burden of proof on that issue”].) 
Because the opposing party bears the burden of proof, the moving party
is “not compelled to make a showing as to their proportionate liability” when
bringing its motion.  (Mattco Forge,
Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1350, fn. 6 (Mattco).)  But after an opposing party “attack[s] the
settlement as lacking in good faith,” the moving party must “file
counter-affidavits (§ 877.6, subd. (b)) to make an evidentiary showing that the
settlement was ‘in the ballpark.’ ”  (Ibid.)  
To
prevail over an opposing party, “[s]ection 877.6 and Tech–Bilt require
an evidentiary showing, through expert declarations or other means, that the
proposed settlement is within the reasonable range permitted by the criterion
of good faith.”  (Mattco, supra,
at p. 1351.)  A determination of good
faith requires “substantial evidence,” which “is not synonymous with ‘any’
evidence; rather, it means the evidence must be of ponderable legal
significance, reasonable, credible, and of solid value.”  (Cahill, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p.
958.)  Finally, “the determination
whether the settlement was in good faith must be based on competent, admissible
evidence.”  (Brehm Communities v.
Superior Court (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 730, 736.)
Dignity
presents substantial evidence that its settlement for $29,999 was in good
faith.  Dignity shows that, when it
entered the settlement in August 2022, plaintiff’s potential recovery was $308,840.84.  Plaintiff could recover no more than $250,000
in “noneconomic losses to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience,
physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage.”  (Former Civ. Code, § 3333.2(b).)  Dignity also shows a potential for $58,840.84
in economic damages: $50,000 for lost earnings and $8,840.84 in medical
expenses.  In plaintiff’s interrogatory
responses, he stated, “At this point in time, plaintiff is not asserting a loss
of earnings claim.”  (Supp. Guzé Decl.,
Ex. E, response to No. 8.1.)  At
deposition, plaintiff testified he lost approximately $21,000 to $50,000 in
earnings.  (Id., Ex. D, Smith
Depo., 15:25-17:15.)  For medical
expenses, Dignity presents evidence plaintiff’s insurer (Medi-Cal) paid his
medical providers $8,840.84: $2,571.09 to Providence Little Company of Mary
Hospital and $6,269.75 to La Vida Multispecialty Medical Center.  (2nd Supp. Guzé Decl., Exs. G, H.)
Dignity
makes a substantial showing that its proportionate share of liability is no
more than 50%.  This case arises from a
foreign object left in plaintiff’s body during surgery.  Dr. Hubbard was the surgeon.  His proportion of liability should be no less
than (and potentially significantly greater than) Dignity’s.  “Cases in which a foreign object has been
left in the patient’s body during an operation fall within [the] common
knowledge application of the res ipsa doctrine.”  (Gannon v. Elliot (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 1, 6.)  Under the “captain of
ship doctrine,” a surgeon has “the nondelegable duty to remove all sponges from
the patient’s body, and this duty is unaffected by any hospital protocols
requiring sponge counts to be made by nurses.” 
(Baumgardner v. Yusuf (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1399.)  The hospital, however, can also be liable for
its own negligence.  (Truhitte v.
French Hospital (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 332, 348-349.) 
Dignity
thus shows its potential liability was $154,420.42: half of $308,840.84.  Its settlement of $29,999 is 19.4% of that
potential liability.  Considering the
nature of settlement as a compromise, paying 19.4% of its potential liability falls
well within the ballpark of good faith settlements based on the Tech-Bilt
factors.  
Dr.
Hubbard does not meet his burden of showing the settlement was not made in good
faith.  He presents no evidence of
collusion or fraud.  He does not dispute
Dignity’s estimate of its proportion of liability.  Nor does he dispute that plaintiff could
recover no more than $250,000 in noneconomic damages.  Dr. Hubbard only disputes the potential
damages of $50,000 in lost earnings and $8,840.84 in medical expenses.  He argues plaintiff never clearly articulated
his lost earnings claims and the “$50,000 figure is illusory.”  (Hubbard’s Supp. Brief, p. 2.)  That plaintiff never clearly articulated his
lost earnings is not sufficient to show Dignity did not reach its settlement in
good faith.  At this stage, Dr. Hubbard
bears the burden of showing plaintiff’s potential recovery for lost earnings is
greater than $50,000.  That figure is not
illusory.  Dignity calculated it based on
plaintiff’s deposition testimony that he lost seven to ten months of earnings
amounting to $3,000 to $5,000 monthly.  (Supp.
Guzé Decl., Ex. D, Smith Depo., 15:25-17:15.) 
And Dignity reached that $50,000 figure using the higher end of
plaintiff’s ranges of both the number of months and his monthly earnings.
Dr.
Hubbard argues Dignity fails to account for other “special damages.”  He relies on plaintiff’s interrogatory
responses that he had incurred other expenses and would incur future expenses
that he could not quantify when he responded in July 2021.  But Dr. Hubbard presents no evidence of the
amount of any such expenses.  Plaintiff
testified at deposition in March 2022, about eight months after serving his
interrogatory responses.  Dr. Hubbard
does not show that plaintiff testified about incurring those expenses or the
amount of those expenses.  Plaintiff’s unsubstantiated
claims of unknown amounts of other damages does not undermine the conclusion
that, based on what Dignity knew at the time, the settlement of $29,999 was
made in good faith.
