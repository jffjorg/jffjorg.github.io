And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling lifts the stay of the action against Defendants Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat, Rachel, and Aaron Eilat. The Defendants had moved to stay the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, arguing that Israel is a more suitable place for trial. The court granted the stay in November 2023, but the Judge now rules that the doctrine of forum non conveniens does not apply because the moving defendants have not shown that all other defendants are subject to jurisdiction in Israel or are of no real importance to the outcome of the case. The Judge cites case law from David v. Medtronic, Inc. (2015) to support this decision.
