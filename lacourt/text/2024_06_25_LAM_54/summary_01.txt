And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Edward M. Lyman III against Defendants Walzer Melcher LLP, Christopher C. Melcher, and Peter M. Walzer. The Defendants argue that certain allegations in the FAC are irrelevant and violate the attorney-client privilege, and that answering the FAC as drafted would require them to disclose confidential attorney-client communications. The Court declines to strike the allegations, citing the attorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence that should be addressed through evidentiary motions or trial, rather than at the pleading stage. Therefore, the Court denies the Defendants' motion to strike.
