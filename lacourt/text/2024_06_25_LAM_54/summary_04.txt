Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Specially Appearing Cross-Defendant Shragay Flags & Symbols Ltd. Shragay, a company incorporated in and operating out of Israel, argues that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. The Court agrees and grants Shragay's motion to quash. The Court finds that Shragay has not purposefully availed itself of the benefits of California and that there are no allegations of personal jurisdiction over Shragay in the cross-complaint. The Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over Shragay in the absence of such allegations.
