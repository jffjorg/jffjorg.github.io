Global Enterprise, Inc. v. Everytable, PBC, Case No. 24NWCV00798
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action regarding commercial property. Plaintiff is the
tenant, and Defendant is Plaintiff’s subtenant. Plaintiff moves ex parte to
advance the hearing on Defendant’s demurrer, currently set for January 14,
2025, to the ex parte date or another advanced date.  
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff
argues judicial economy as a reason to advance the hearing date. Defendant is
not opposed to advancing it to June 19, 2024 at the earliest. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants the ex parte motion in part. It advances the
motion to May 31, 2024 and continues it to Tuesday, August 20, 2024 at 10:30
A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
