  Case Number:  22NWCV00320    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  C Pacific
Southwest District of Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. Jensen, et al., Case
No. 22NWCV00320
 
This
is a quiet title action over land occupied by a church’s former congregation.
Plaintiff moves ex parte to advance the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for leave
to file first amended complaint. Plaintiff also moves ex parte to advance the
hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for leave to serve the first amended complaint by
publication. Both are currently set for February 25, 2025. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists because trial is currently set for July 25, 2024,
and both motions are set for February 25, 2025. Plaintiff supports its argument
with declaration by its counsel, Jackson Leverone. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants both ex parte motions. The Court advances both
motions from Tuesday, February 25, 2025 to Tuesday, June 11, 2024 at 10:30 A.M.
in Dept. SE-C.
