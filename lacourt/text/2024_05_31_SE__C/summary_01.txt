"The Court grants the plaintiff's ex parte motions to advance the hearing on their motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and their motion for leave to serve the first amended complaint by publication. The plaintiff's counsel, Jackson Leverone, argues that good cause exists to advance the hearing due to the proximity of the trial date, currently set for July 25, 2024. The Court finds that the plaintiff has made an affirmative factual showing of good cause and grants the ex parte motions, advancing the hearing to June 11, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C."
