 Case Number:  24SMCV02182    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to serve defendant Revolt Enterprises
through the Secretary of State.  Plaintiff
contends that Revolt has not maintained an agent for service of process here
and that plaintiff has attempted to serve defendant in other fashions.  There had been a registered agent for
service, but that agent resigned as of January 9, 2024, and no new agent has
been named.  There was a similar federal
court action.  According to plaintiff,
plaintiff attempted to serve the federal summons at Revolt’s address but
service was refused there.  Also, CT
Corporation, a well known entity that acts as an agent for service of process,
used to be the registered agent, but resigned on January 9, 2024.  This case involves allegations of fraud and
the potential dissipation of assets. 
While the court is not 100% convinced that ex parte relief is
required, at the same time defendant has not yet been served and thus the
filing of a noticed motion will not advance the ball.
 
Service on the Secretary of State is proper where there is
no registered agent.  Although not
required by the statute, plaintiff asserts that there was a diligent attempt to
serve Revolt. 
 
The court believes the required showing has been made and
the motion is GRANTED.
