And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Hudson Insurance Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court has sustained the motion with 20 days' leave to amend.

The court found that the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract and common count/money had and received. The court noted that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the formation of the oral contract were too uncertain to be sufficient.

The court granted Hudson's motion for judgment on the pleadings with 20 days' leave to amend. The court required the plaintiff to amend her complaint to clarify the allegations regarding the contract and to include factual allegations regarding Hudson's involvement.

The court also noted that the plaintiff's causes of action for breach of contract and common count/money had and received are based on the same operative facts, and that the plaintiff cannot simply use the collective term "defendants" to state a cause of action against Hudson without alleging any factual basis for Hudson's inclusion as a party.
