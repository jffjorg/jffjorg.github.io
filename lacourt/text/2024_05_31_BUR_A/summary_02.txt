The tentative ruling relates to a motion brought by NHP/PMB Burbank Medical Plaza II, LLC (Plaintiff) to compel Salem Neurological Associates (Defendant) to respond to interrogatories. The motion was filed on April 11, 2024, and the Court has considered the merits of the untimely opposition filed by the Defendant. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to pay rent pursuant to a commercial lease agreement, and seeks damages in the amount of $168,913.64.

The Court finds that the Defendant's subsequent production of responses has rendered the motion moot. However, the Court does award sanctions in the amount of $1,560 to the Plaintiff, which reflects the attorney's fees incurred by the Plaintiff in bringing this motion. The sanctions are awarded jointly and severally against the Defendant and the Defendant's counsel.
