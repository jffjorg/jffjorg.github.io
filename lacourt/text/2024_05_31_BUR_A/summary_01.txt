Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, but has imposed evidentiary sanctions. The plaintiff is prohibited from introducing any evidence that would have been responsive to the discovery requests. The plaintiff must provide objection-free responses to the discovery requests by June 14, 2024. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order requiring an undertaking. The judge has issued a tentative ruling, which will become the final ruling unless a party submits on the tentative ruling or requests a signed order.
