And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling is as follows:

1. The motions to compel responses to plaintiff's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production are moot.
2. The motion to deem RFA matters admitted is denied.
3. The Court declines to impose sanctions at this time.

The Court's ruling is based on the parties' submissions and the applicable laws and statutes. The Court finds that the motions to compel responses are moot because defendant has served written responses to plaintiff's discovery requests. The motion to deem RFA matters admitted is denied because defendant has served responses in substantial compliance with the applicable statutes.

The Court notes that the parties may submit on this tentative ruling, and if no opposition is filed, the ruling will become the final order of the Court.
