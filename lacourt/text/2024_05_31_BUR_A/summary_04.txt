Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer hearing in a case between Zachary Purnell (Plaintiff) and Nathan Young, 55 Silver, LLC, Kiloby Center for Recovery, Inc., and 9 Silver, LLC (Defendants). The Plaintiff alleges that he was attacked by a third-party while residing at a sober living home owned and operated by the Defendants. The Defendants demurred to both causes of action (negligence and premises liability) alleging that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action. The Court finds that the Complaint is insufficient with respect to foreseeability of third-party violence by the Demurring Defendants. Consequently, the demurrer to both causes of action is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend.
