And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Gloria Del Toro's motion for trial preference. The judge found that Plaintiff's declarations, including those from herself and her attorney, were insufficient to show the necessity of trial preference. The judge noted that Plaintiff's health issues, including diabetes and congestive heart failure, are serious but not severe enough to warrant trial preference. The judge also pointed out that Plaintiff's medical records, which included records from Kaiser Permanente, did not indicate any conditions that would impair her ability to testify or participate in trial. The judge ruled that the motion for trial preference was denied.
