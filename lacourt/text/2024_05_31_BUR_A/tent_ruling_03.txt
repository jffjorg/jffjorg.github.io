MP:  


The City of Los Angeles (Defendant) 




RP:  


None



 
NOTICE:
 

The Court is not
requesting oral argument on this matter.  The Court is guided by
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) whereby notice of intent to appear
is requested.  Unless the Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling,
no argument is requested and any party seeking argument should notify all other
parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the
party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will become
the ruling of the court if no argument is received.   
 
Notice may be given
either by email at BurDeptA@LACourt.org or by telephone at (818) 260-8412.
 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Darius Colbourn
(Plaintiff) brings this action against the City of Los Angeles (the City).
Plaintiff alleges that he was struck by a stop sign when the pole holding it
became dislodged from the sidewalk at the corner of McCormick St. and Blakeslee
Ave. Plaintiff alleges the City was aware of the deteriorating condition of the
pole such that their failure to replace it constitutes negligence resulting in
his injury. 
 
The City now
brings two motions to compel initial discovery responses. The City seeks
responses to their Form and Special Interrogatories and Request for the
Production of Documents (RFPD). Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to this
motion. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response and for a monetary
sanction.  (C.C.P. § 2030.290(b).)  The statute contains no time
limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All
that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories
was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has
expired, and that no response of any kind has been served.  (See Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a demand to produce documents, the
demanding party may seek an order compelling a response.  (C.C.P. §
2031.300(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.  (C.C.P. § 2031.300 (a).)  Thus, unless
the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she
cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a
motion to compel responses.  Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
On January
16, 2024, the City propounded its discovery requests on Plaintiff via email to
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) On February 20, 2024, counsel
for the City granted Plaintiff’s counsel an extension of time in which to
respond with a deadline of March 5, 2024. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) On
March 12, 2024, counsel for the City reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel as they
had still not received responses. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s
counsel informed that responses would be forthcoming within a week. (Id.)
Counsel for the City followed up once more on April 4, 2024, but received no
reply. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
The Court notes
that Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to this motion. A failure to oppose a
motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (California Rules
of Court, Rule 8.54(c).) The City has clearly demonstrated service of its Form
and Special Interrogatories and RFPD. The City has also demonstrated that
Defendant has served no responses. As such, the City’s unopposed motions to
compel are GRANTED.  
 
Sanctions

 
As concerns motions to compel, the law only requires
sanctions if a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.300(d) & 2031.300(c)) As such, any other monetary
sanctions granted are within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P.
§ 2030.290. As per C.C.P. § 2023.010(d), failure to respond constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. Further, it is customary to grant sanctions
where a party has filed a motion to compel, and the other party fails to file an
opposition. (C.R.C., Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
Here, counsel
for the City has drafted and filed two motions to compel while Defendant has
rendered no opposition. As such, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $800.
This amount reflects 2 hours of attorney work at a rate of $200 per hour ($400
for each motion). (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 7.) Given the Court’s experience with
motions of this type, this amount of sanctions appears appropriate to
compensate the City in compelling responses. Sanctions are against Plaintiff
and his counsel jointly and severally.
