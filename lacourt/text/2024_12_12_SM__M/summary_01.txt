Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiff and deems matters admitted in Requests for Admission. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests and sanctions are mandatory. The sanctions are imposed in the amount of $1,860.00, payable within 30 days. The Court also grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The withdrawal of counsel may create a risk of prejudice to the Plaintiff, but the Court finds that counsel has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client.
