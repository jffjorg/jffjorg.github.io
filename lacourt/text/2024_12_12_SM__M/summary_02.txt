Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to strike the Ninth, Tenth, Twelfth, and Thirteenth causes of action against Ziyi Yang, alleging fraudulent transfer of properties and failure to register a non-profit corporation. The Judge finds that the claims do not arise from any statements made before or in connection with Yang's statements to the IRS, and that Yang's conduct is not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. The Judge concludes that the motion to strike has failed to meet the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis.
