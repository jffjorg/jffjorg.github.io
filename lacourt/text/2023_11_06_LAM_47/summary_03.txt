And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment, finding that the complaint states a cause of action. The judge has granted the motion to strike the allegation "[o]ther stone products to be identified during the course of discovery," finding that it is vague and speculative. However, the judge has denied the motion to strike the other allegations and has left the door open for the plaintiff to amend the complaint if discovery reveals that additional products caused the injury.
