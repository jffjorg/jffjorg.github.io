The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, finding that the plaintiff's responses are evasive and incomplete. The judge rejects the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, finding that the defendant failed to demonstrate good cause for the discovery requests. The ruling is conditioned on the defendant's payment of $60 in filing fees within five days of the order.
