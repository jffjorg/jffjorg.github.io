CASE:                         Kyung Yoon Pak v. Ock J. Kim, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV08524            
 
DEMURRER
TO COMPLAINT AND MOTION TO STRIKE (x2)

 
MOVING PARTY:               (1) Defendant Ock J. Kim; (2) Defendant Sunhee Yi.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): (1)(2) Plaintiff
Kyung Yoon Pak
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability action filed on April 18, 2023. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants refused to repair persistent defects at the property in which
Plaintiff was a tenant, including termite infestations and plumbing issues. 
 
Defendants demur to the Complaint
and move to strike portions of the Complaint. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants demur to the Complaint
and move to strike portions of the Complaint. 
 
            Defendants’
moving papers describe a purported request for judicial notice as to a deed of
trust regarding the subject property. Although Plaintiff has filed an objection
to that request, it appears that the original request for judicial notice was
never filed with the Court. As this document forms the basis for the bulk of
Defendants’ arguments on this motion, the Court will exercise its discretionary
authority to continue the hearing on this matter to permit Defendants to file a
copy of the request with the Court. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrers to the
Complaint and Motions to Strike portions of the Complaint are CONTINUED to
Thursday, November 30, 2023 at 9:00 AM. 
 
Defendants are directed to file a
copy of their request for judicial notice with the Court within 10 days of this
order with a proof of service demonstrating that the request was served on
Plaintiff. 
The Case Management Conference is
also continued to November 30, 2023 at 9:00 AM.
 
Moving Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
