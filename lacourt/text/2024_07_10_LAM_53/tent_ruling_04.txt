MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Norma Gomez and Juan

RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendants Kia America, Inc., and Kia of
Carson     
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Norma Gomez and Juan Gomez (“Plaintiffs”) move the court
for an order awarding attorney’s fees and costs in their favor, and against
defendant Kia America, Inc. (“Defendant”)[1]
in the total amount of $38,417.09, consisting of $36,738.50 in attorney’s fees
and $1,678.59 in costs.
First, the court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover
attorney’s fees pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act. 
Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿¿ 
Plaintiffs
have presented evidence, and Defendant does not dispute, that (1) on November
27, 2023, Defendant sent a second Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer to
Plaintiffs for the repurchase amount of $75,000; (2) Plaintiffs accepted Defendant’s
offer on December 29, 2023; and (3) Defendant’s offer “also provided [that
Defendant was] to pay reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees based on
actual time expended determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by Plaintiffs.”  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 17-19;
Proudfoot Decl., ¶¶ [Defendant served, and Plaintiffs accepted, its “CCP 998 offer
for $75,000 plus attorney’s fees”].)  Thus,
the court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney’s fees and
costs from Defendant pursuant to Civil Code section 1794 and the terms of the
parties’ settlement agreement. 
Second, the
court finds that Plaintiffs have established, as to the attorney’s fees
incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of this action and
the preparation of the pending fee motion, a lodestar amount of $31,647.50 ((32.1
hours x $600 hourly rate for attorney Saeedian) + (1.3 hours x $600 hourly rate
for attorney Ostoia) + (8.3 hours x $525 hourly rate for attorney Urner) + (29
hours x $250 hourly rate for law clerk Acosta)).  (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A; Saeedian Decl., ¶ 23.)
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community
for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted); Reck v. FCA US
LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691 [“To determine a reasonable attorney fee
award, the trial court applies the lodestar method”].)  “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
396.)¿¿¿ 
Plaintiffs
have submitted the declaration of Michael Saeedian (“Saeedian”), in which
Saeedian attests to the qualifications, skill and experience of the legal staff
that performed work on this action. 
(Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.)  The
court finds that a reasonably hourly rate for attorneys Saeedian and Adina
Ostoia is $600.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶
2-4.)  The court finds that the hourly
rates charged by attorney Christopher Urner ($525) and law clerk Jorge Acosta
($250) are reasonable in light of their qualifications, skill, and experience.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.)
The court
has reviewed each work and time entry on the billing statement attached as
Exhibit A to Saeedian’s declaration, which establishes that the legal staff
working on this action expended a total of 74.1 hours to prosecute this
action.  (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, p. 9.)  The court notes that Defendant has argued, in
its opposition, that Plaintiffs seek unreasonable attorney’s fees for the time
expended (1) by law clerk Jorge Acosta, and (2) to prepare form pleadings and
discovery.  Defendant did not cite particular
entries in support of its contention that the hours expended were unreasonable.[2]  (Pont
v. Pont (2018) 31 Cal.App.5th 428, 447 [“‘The party opposing the fee award
can be expected to identify the particular charges it considers
objectionable’”] [internal citation omitted].) 
However, as set forth above, the court has reviewed each work and time
entry on the billing statement submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ motion.  
Upon the
court’s review of the billing statement and Defendant’s opposition, the court
finds that (1) of the 4.2 hours billed to draft plaintiff Norma Gomez’s special
interrogatories, requests for admission, form interrogatories, and requests for
production of documents, 0.3 of those hours billed by Saeedian and 1 of those
hours billed by Jorge Acosta were not reasonably expended, (2) of the 2.3 hours
billed to draft a meet and confer letter regarding Defendant’s discovery
responses, 1.3 of those hours billed by Saeedian were not reasonably expended,
and (3) of the 1.6 hours billed to draft a meet and confer letter regarding
defendant Kia of Carson’s discovery responses, 0.8 of those hours billed by
Saeedian were not reasonably expended. 
(Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, pp. 3-4, 8.)
The court
therefore finds that Plaintiffs have shown that their attorneys and their
attorneys’ legal staff reasonably expended a total of 70.7 hours in connection
with the commencement and prosecution of this action and the preparation of the
pending fee motion at the hourly rates of $600 (Saeedian and Adina Ostoia),
$525 (Christopher Urner), and $250 (Jorge Acosta).  (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 23; Saeedian Decl., Ex. A;
Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) 
Third, the
court finds that Plaintiffs (1) are entitled to recover the costs and expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of this
action, and (2) are entitled to an award of $1,678.59 in costs because (i)
Plaintiffs have supported their request for costs in this amount by filing a
verified memorandum of costs with the court on February 9, 2024, and (ii)
Defendant did not file a motion to strike or tax costs within the time required
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700. 
(Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486 [“A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the
items listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary”]; Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1700, subds. (b)(1), (b)(4); Memorandum of Costs, p. 7 [proof of
electronic service of memorandum of costs on February 9, 2024].) 
            The court therefore finds that Plaintiffs
have shown that they are entitled to recover $31,647.50 in attorney’s fees and $1,678.59
in costs from Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Norma
Gomez and Juan Gomez’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs as follows. 
            The court orders that plaintiffs
Norma Gomez and Juan Gomez shall recover a total of $33,326.09, consisting of $31,647.50 in attorney’s
fees and $1,678.59 in costs, from defendant Kia America, Inc.
pursuant to Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d).
 
            The court orders plaintiffs Norma
Gomez and Juan Gomez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
