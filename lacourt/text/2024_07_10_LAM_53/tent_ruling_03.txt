  Order RE:
 
plaintiffs’ motion to continue trial
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Karen Bang and Linda
Agajanian Otey      
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendants Dill Veterinary Hospital, Inc.,
and Amber Oliver  
Motion to Continue Trial
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Karen Bang and Linda Agajanian Otey (“Plaintiffs”) move the
court for an order continuing trial in this action, currently scheduled to
begin on August 14, 2024, and all related deadlines.  Defendants Dill Veterinary Hospital, Inc., and
Amber Oliver (“Defendants”) have filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion,
stating that, while they do not oppose a brief trial continuance of 30-60 days,
they oppose Plaintiffs’ request to continue all discovery and trial-related
deadlines. 
The court finds that Plaintiffs have shown good cause to continue the
trial and all related deadlines based on (1) the unavailability of Plaintiffs’
lead counsel on August 14, 2024, (2) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s representation that
the parties are in the process of scheduling various depositions, and (3) the
court’s consideration of the factors set forth in California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, subdivision (d), including that (i) there have not been any prior
continuances of trial, (ii) Defendants will not be unduly prejudiced by the
continuance of trial and related deadlines, (iii) Plaintiffs’ lead counsel will
be engaged in another multi-week trial, and (iv) the interests of justice favor
the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1332, subds. (c)(3), (c)(6), (d)(2), (d)(5), (d)(8), (d)(10); Lipps
Decl., ¶¶ 1, 2-3.)
The court therefore grants Plaintiffs’ motion and makes the orders set
forth below.
ORDER
The court grants plaintiffs Karen Bang and Linda Agajanian Otey’s
motion to continue trial.  The court
orders:
1.    
The trial in this action is continued from
August 14, 2024, to March 12, 2025, at 11:00 a.m., in Department 53.
2.    
The Final Status Conference is continued from
August 2, 2024, to February 27, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
3.     All
discovery cut-off and discovery
motion cut-off dates, and deadlines for the exchange of information concerning
expert trial witnesses shall be based on the new trial date.¿
4.    
The parties and their counsel shall hold a
meeting, conference call, or videoconference to discuss and try to settle all
issues in the case no later than January 17, 2025.
The court orders plaintiffs Karen Bang and Linda Agajanian Otey to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  July 10, 2024
