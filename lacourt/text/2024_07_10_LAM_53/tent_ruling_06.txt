EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court sustains plaintiff
Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC’s evidentiary objections, filed on June
26, 2024, because defendants Laura E. Vaca and Agencia Privada de
Inmigracion, Inc. did not authenticate the exhibits to which the objections are
directed.           
MOTION TO SET ASIDE COURT ORDER OF MARCH
22, 2024 DEEMING REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED
Defendants Laura E. Vaca (“Vaca”) and Agencia Privada de Inmigracion,
Inc. (“API”) (collectively, “Defendants”) request that the court set aside its
March 22, 2024 order granting the motion to deem requests for admissions
admitted, filed by plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC
(“Plaintiff”), or, alternatively, striking Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.
First, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that the court
should set aside its March 22, 2024 order granting Plaintiff’s motion and
deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission directed to defendant API. 
Defendants contend that API responded to Plaintiff’s discovery at the
same time that Vaca served her responses. 
In support of that contention, Defendants have filed “Defendants Laura
E. Vaca and Agencia Privada De Inmigracion, Inc.’s Responses to Plaintiff
Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC’s Requests for Admission, Set One,” served
on Plaintiff on November 10, 2023.  (Mot.,
Exhibit A, pp. 1, 8.)  Defendants have
also submitted the November 27, 2023 email from Plaintiff’s counsel, in which
counsel stated that “[b]ecause [Defendants] responded jointly, [counsel would]
treat the responses together.”  (Mot.,
Ex. C, p. 1.)  Defendants have not,
however, presented evidence or argument establishing that these responses were
served in connection with the Requests for Admission that were the subject of
the court’s March 22, 2024 order.  
Specifically, the court ruled on Plaintiff’s motion as to the Requests
for Admission that were served on defendant API on December 28, 2023.  (March 22, 2024 Order, p. 2:3-4; Pl. Mot. to
Deem Admissions Admitted, filed Feb. 9, 2024, p. 1:22-26 [moving for an order
deeming admitted the admissions in the requests served on API “on December 28,
2023”], and Medvei Decl., Ex. 1 [Requests for Admission, Set One, served on API
on December 28, 2023].)  Defendants did
not present evidence or argument establishing that (1) API served responses to
the Requests for Admission that Plaintiff propounded on it on December 28,
2023, or (2) API’s responses to the Requests for Admission directed to
defendant Vaca may constitute responses to the Requests for Admission directed
to API, particularly in light of the facts that (i) Plaintiff served the
subject discovery on API on December 28, 2023, but (ii) the responses that API
argues satisfied its obligation to respond to that discovery were served on
Plaintiff before that date, on November 10, 2023.  Further, Defendants did not argue, or present
evidence establishing, that API should be relieved of its admissions pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300.
The court therefore finds that Defendants have not shown that the
court should set aside its March 22, 2024 order granting Plaintiff’s motion to
deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission
directed to defendant API. 
Second, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that the court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action by failing to present
adequate argument establishing lack of jurisdiction.  Thus, the court finds that Defendants have
not shown that the court should strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint and
dismiss this action on that ground.
Third, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff
does not have standing.  Thus, the court
finds that Defendants have not shown that the court should strike Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint and dismiss this action on that ground.
Here, Plaintiff has prayed for, inter alia, injunctive relief
and attorney’s fees.  (FAC, p. 10,
Prayer, ¶¶ 1-2.)  Pursuant to Business
and Professions Code section 22446.5, “[a]ny other party who, upon information
and belief, claims a violation of this chapter has been committed by an
immigration consultant may bring a civil action for injunctive relief on behalf
of the general public and, upon prevailing, shall recover reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs.”  (Bus. & Prof. Code,
§ 22446.5, subd. (b); Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC v. Hudson Ins.
Co. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 305, 308 [pursuant to this statute, “any person
who believes an [Immigration Consultant Act] violation has been committed may
bring a civil action ‘on behalf of the general public’ seeking solely
injunctive relief”].)  Defendants have
not shown that Plaintiff, as a party who claims that Defendants have violated
the Immigration Consultant Act, may not bring this action for injunctive relief
against them.  (FAC ¶¶ 14-15, 19-20.)  Moreover, while the court notes that
Defendants have cited Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC, supra,
84 Cal.App.5th 305 in support of their argument, in that case, the court held
that Plaintiff did “not fall within the class of persons who may recover
against an ICA bond,” and did not hold that Plaintiff may not bring an
action under section 22446.5, subdivision (b). 
(Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC, supra, 84
Cal.App.5th at p. 261 [emphasis added].)  Instead, the court recognized that this
statute “sets forth three classes of plaintiff who may pursue actions against
immigrant consultants who violate the” Immigration Consultant Act, including any
party who believes a violation has been committed by an immigration consultant
pursuant to section 22446.5, subdivision (b). 
(Id. at pp. 309-310.) 
Fourth, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff’s
cause of action for violation of the Immigration Consultant Act is preempted by
federal law.  (People v. Salcido (2019)
42 Cal.App.5th 529, 534 [holding “that federal law does not preempt the
application of the [Immigrant Consultant Act] to” the defendant].)  Thus, the court finds that Defendants have
not shown that the court should strike the First Amended Complaint or dismiss
this action on that ground.  
For the reasons set forth above, the court denies Defendants’ motion. 
Finally, the court is concerned about the tone and content of a number of remarks
made by Defendants and their counsel in the papers filed in connection with
this motion, which include personal attacks, disparaging remarks, taunts, and
insults against Plaintiff’s counsel. 
(Mot. to Set Aside, pp. 5:17-19, 14:27, 15:13-14, and Vaca Decl., p.
18:5, 18:24-25.)  The court finds that
such remarks are distracting from the merits of the issues and arguments
presented, are not persuasive advocacy, and have no place in written or oral
submissions, presentations, or communications made to the court or to other
parties or counsel in this litigation.  As the court states in section 1
of its “Courtroom Information for Department 53” posted on the court’s website,
“[t]he court places a very high value on civility, courtesy, and
professionalism in the practice of law and the judicial process.¿ The court
expects all attorneys and parties to treat each other, witnesses, jurors, court
personnel, the court, and others with the highest level of civility, courtesy,
and professionalism, both inside and outside the courtroom.”  The court
expects all parties, attorneys, and other participants in this litigation to
govern their conduct accordingly.
 
MOTION
FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST PLAINTIFF’S ATTORNEY
Defendants move the court for an order awarding monetary sanctions in
their favor and against counsel for Plaintiff, Sebastian Medvei (“Medvei”), in
the total amount of $145,756.30.  It
appears that Defendants move for this relief on the ground that Medvei engaged
in misuses of the discovery process by (1) violating the meet and confer
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2031.310, and
2033.290, and (2) filing discovery motions beyond the 45-day deadline that
applies to motions to compel further discovery responses.  (Mot., pp. 2:9-3:19 5:19-21, 5:30-6:15, 7:5-6
[“The express admission to engage in the meet and confer requirement, when
mandatory, makes the award of attorney fees obligatory”].)
First, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff’s
counsel, Medvei, engaged in a misuse of the discovery process in electing not
to meet and confer before filing three discovery motions on behalf of
Plaintiff. 
As noted by Defendants, Plaintiff filed the following three motions on
February 9, 2024: (1) motion to deem admitted the Requests for Admission served
on defendant API, which the court granted on March 22, 2024, (2) motion to
compel defendant API to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, which is set for hearing on October 28, 2024, and (3) motion
to compel defendant API to respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set
One, which is set for hearing on October 29, 2024. 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that it has not yet ruled on
Plaintiff’s motions to compel defendant API’s responses to its document demands
and interrogatories.  Thus, any
determination on the merits of those motions is premature.  The court does not issue any rulings as to
whether Plaintiff has shown that it is entitled to the relief requested in
those motions. 
However, the court notes that Plaintiff filed those motions pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280, 2031.300, and 2030.290,
respectively.  (Pl. Feb. 9, 2024 Mot. to
Deem Admissions Admitted, p. 2:1-3; Pl. Feb. 9, 2024 Mot. to Compel Responses
to Doc. Demands, pp. 2:1-3, 4:1-20; Pl. Feb. 9, 2024 Mot. to Compel Responses
to Interrogatories, pp. 2:1-3, 4:1-17.)  Those statutes do not set forth a meet and
confer requirement.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2033.280, 2031.300, 2030.290.)  Plaintiff
did not file its motions pursuant to sections 2030.300, 2031.310, and 2033.290,
and therefore Defendants have not shown that the meet and confer requirements
of those statutes apply to Plaintiff’s motions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290, subd. (b)(1)
[meet and confer declaration required for motion to compel further responses to
requests for admission], 2030.300, subd. (b)(1) [meet and confer declaration
required for motion to compel further responses to interrogatories], 2031.310,
subd. (b)(2) [meet and confer declaration required for motion to compel further
responses to document demands].) 
To the extent that Defendants contend that Plaintiff brought its
motions under the incorrect statutes (i.e., based on Defendants’ assertion that
defendant API did serve responses to the subject discovery), the remedy would
be to file opposition papers requesting that the court deny those motions.[1]  The court finds, however, that Defendants,
have not shown, for purposes of this motion only, that Medvei violated the meet
and confer requirements of statutes inapplicable to the motions that Plaintiff filed
on February 9, 2024.  
Second, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that
Plaintiff’s counsel, Medvei, engaged in a misuse of the discovery process by
filing the three discovery motions on behalf of Plaintiff on February 9,
2024.  Defendants contend that Plaintiff
waived the right to compel further responses to discovery by failing to file
the three motions described above within 45 days of the date of November 10,
2023.  However, as set forth above,
Plaintiff filed its motions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2031.300, and 2030.290, which are not subject to the 45-day deadline
set forth in sections 2033.290, 2031.310, and 2030.300.  To the extent that Defendants contend that
Plaintiff should have filed its motions pursuant to those statutes and failed
to satisfy their requirements, Defendants may file opposition papers requesting
that the court deny those motions.[2]
For the reasons set forth above, the court finds that Defendants have
not shown that Medvei has engaged in a misuse of the discovery process and
therefore denies their motion for sanctions. 
The court denies Medvei’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendants.
