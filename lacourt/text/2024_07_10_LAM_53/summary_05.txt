And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a dispute between the plaintiff and defendant Kia America, Inc. regarding attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff has requested payment from Kia America, Inc. only, despite naming Kia of Carson as a defendant as well. The court notes that the defendant's assertion about the hours expended to draft the complaint does not accurately reflect the billing statement, which shows that the plaintiff's attorneys only billed 1.3 hours to draft the complaint and 0.1 hours to review case management documents. The court will continue to review this matter before making a final ruling.
