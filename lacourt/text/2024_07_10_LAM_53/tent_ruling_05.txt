The court notes that Plaintiffs named two defendants in this action: (1) Kia
America, Inc., and (2) Kia of Carson. 
However, it appears that Plaintiffs have only requested that defendant
Kia America, Inc. pay their attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the
settlement agreement executed by the parties. 
(Notice of Mot., p. i:24-26.)

The court notes that Defendant’s assertion does not appear to accurately
reflect the billing statement as to the hours expended to draft the Complaint.  Although Defendant states that Plaintiffs
“billed 2.3 hours on the form complaint,” Plaintiffs’ attorneys billed only 1.3
hours to draft the Complaint and 0.1 hours to review the conformed summons,
complaint, and other case management documents. 
(Opp., p. 7:9-10; Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, pp. 1 [4/14/2023 entry to
“Review file and draft Complaint” for 1.3 hours], 2 [4/17/2023 entry to review
conformed summons, Complaint, and other documents for 0.1 hours].)
