And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the court order deeming requests for admission admitted, as they have not shown that the court should set aside the order. The court has also denied the defendants' motion for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff's attorney, as they have not shown that the attorney engaged in a misuse of the discovery process. The court has found that the plaintiff's attorney, Sebastian Medvei, did not engage in a misuse of the discovery process by filing discovery motions on behalf of the plaintiff, and that the defendants have not shown that Medvei violated the meet and confer requirements of statutes inapplicable to the motions. The court has also found that the plaintiff has standing to bring the action and that the cause of action for violation of the Immigration Consultant Act is not preempted by federal law. Finally, the court has expressed its concern about the tone and content of some of the remarks made by the defendants and their counsel in the papers filed in connection with this motion, and has reminded all parties, attorneys, and other participants in the litigation to treat each other, witnesses, jurors, court personnel, the court, and others with the highest level of civility, courtesy, and professionalism.
