And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion for a protective order against notices of depositions of apex corporate employees. The judge grants the motion as to the depositions of Andrew Coelho, Anja Wells, and Denise Falco, finding that they do not have personal knowledge of the case and that their depositions are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. However, the judge denies the motion as to the depositions of Patty Essman and Wendy Sekel, finding that they have personal knowledge of the case and that their depositions are relevant to the issue of ratification for an elder abuse cause of action. The judge orders that the defendants provide notice of the ruling within five calendar days and that Patty Essman and Wendy Sekel make themselves available for deposition within 10 days.
