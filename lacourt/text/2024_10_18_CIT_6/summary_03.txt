And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Cadet Partners LP, is granted a default judgment against the defendant, Kan Hu, in the reduced amount of $168,131.14. The judgment includes $132,464.25 in past-due rent, $31,349.76 in holdover damages, and $3,528.14 in reduced attorney fees. The court reduced the total amount of the judgment because the plaintiff's calculation of holdover damages was incorrect and because the plaintiff did not provide a declaration or itemized statement to support the amount of attorney fees requested. The court will modify and sign the proposed judgment or the plaintiff can submit a new proposed judgment prior to the hearing on October 18, 2024.
