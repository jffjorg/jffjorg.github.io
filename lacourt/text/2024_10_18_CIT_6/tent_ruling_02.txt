 Case Number:  23PSCV03748    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Yijin Zhang’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants: Zhong Fang, 9920 Valley Blvd LLC, a California limited
liability company, f.k.a., 9920 Valley Blvd LP, California Investment Regional
Center, LLC, and Does 1 through 50 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On December 4, 2023, plaintiff Yijin Zhang
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Zhong Fang, 9920 Valley Blvd
LLC, a California Limited liability company, f.k.a., 9920 Valley Blvd LP,
California Investment Regional Center, LLC (collectively, Defendants), and Does
1 through 50, alleging causes of action for fraud – intentional
misrepresentation, breach of contract, money had and received, and unfair and
unlawful business practices. On July 18, 2024, default was entered against the
Defendants. On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment
package. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452, subd.
(d).) But, the Court takes judicial notice only as to
the existence, content, and authenticity of such documents; it does not take
judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $777,988.42,
including $538,800.00 in damages, $237,123.29 in interest, and $2,065.13 in
costs. The Court finds some issues with Plaintiff’s default judgment package,
mainly as it pertains to the damages calculation. First, the only documentary
evidence of payment from Plaintiff to any of the Defendants is a $5,000.00
deposit on March 10, 2017, and a wire transfer for $500,500.00 on April 3,
2017. (Zhang Decl., Exs. D, E.) Second, Plaintiff is requesting $538,800.00 in
principal damages, but the refund agreement only shows an agreement to refund
$520,000.00, plus a $10,000 late payment interest, so it is unclear where the
additional $8,800.00 came from. (Zhang Decl., Ex. F.) Third, Plaintiff’s
declaration indicates Fang has refunded “$30,000 of the $530,000.” (Zhang
Decl., ¶ 15.) It is thus unclear to the Court what Plaintiff’s principal
damages are. 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
