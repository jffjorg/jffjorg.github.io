And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had sought default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $777,988.42, including $538,800.00 in damages, $237,123.29 in interest, and $2,065.13 in costs. However, the judge found issues with the plaintiff's default judgment package, specifically with the calculation of damages. The judge noted that the only documentary evidence of payment from the plaintiff to the defendants was a $5,000.00 deposit and a wire transfer for $500,500.00, and that the refund agreement only showed an agreement to refund $520,000.00, plus a $10,000 late payment interest. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's declaration indicated that one of the defendants had refunded $30,000 of the $530,000, but it was unclear what the plaintiff's principal damages were. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile or amend the request if necessary.
