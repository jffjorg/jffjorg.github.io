 Case Number:  24PSCV00853    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Cadet Partners LP’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Kan Hu  TENTATIVE RULING            Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $168,131.14. The Court  will modify and sign the proposed judgment or Plaintiff can submit a new proposed  judgment prior to the hearing on October 18, 2024.            BACKGROUND                        This  is an unlawful detainer action. On March 18, 2024, plaintiff Cadet Partners LP,  a CA. Limited Partnership (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Kan  Hu (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging the sole cause of action for  unlawful detainer. On April 25, 2024, default was entered. On April 30, 2024,  judgment for possession was awarded by the clerk. On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff  submitted a default judgment package.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $175,041.07,  including $132,464.25 in past-due rent, $31,839.60 in holdover damages, $9,948.23  in attorney fees, and $788.09 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default  judgment package is largely in order, but notes that the holdover damages is  slightly excessive. The number of days between April 1, 2024, and June 4, 2024,  is 64 days, not 65 as Plaintiff has calculated. (Raguindin Decl., ¶ 12, subd.  (c).) The correct amount in holdover damages is therefore $31,349.76. The Court  also notes that Plaintiff did not submit a declaration or itemized statement to  substantiate the amount of attorney fees requested. (Local Rule, 3.214, subd. (d).)  As such, the Court will reduce the attorney fee award to $3,528.14, i.e., $638.14  plus $2,890.00. The $638.14 is derived from 1% of $63,814.01, which is  comprised of $132,464.25 in past-due rent plus $31,349.76 in holdover damages,  less $100,000.00. (Local Rule, 3.214.) The Court will therefore GRANT  Plaintiff’s request in the reduced amount of $168,131.14, i.e., $132,464.25 +  $31,349.76 + $3,528.14 + $788.99.  CONCLUSION                          Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $168,131.14.  The Court will modify and sign the proposed judgment or Plaintiff can submit a  new proposed judgment prior to the hearing on October 18, 2024.
