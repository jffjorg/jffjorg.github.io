COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  DECISION RE:       
Leave
  to Amend and File FAC; Continuance of Trial



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE
DECISION:]
 
I. BACKGROUND
On November 11, 2022, plaintiff
Kasower Properties, LLC (“Plaintiff”) entered into a commercial lease agreement
(the “Lease”) with non-party The Testing Company, LLC (“Lessee”), whereby
Lessee agreed to lease a certain commercial real property from Plaintiff.
(Complaint p. 2.) Simultaneously, defendant Boris Dobrin (“Defendant” and,
together with Plaintiff, “Parties”) executed a guaranty (the “Guaranty”),
whereby Defendant guaranteed Lessee’s obligations under the Lease. (Ibid.)
In May 2023, Lessee defaulted by failing to make its rent payment. (Kasower
Decl. ¶ 6.) On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff served a three-day notice to pay
rent on Lessee and Defendant. (Complaint p. 3.)
 
On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff
initiated the instant lawsuit by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging
a single cause of action for breach of contract.
 
On September 18, 2023, this court
granted Plaintiff’s application for right to attach order and order for
issuance of writ of attachment in the amount of $113,737.00 on a certain real
property (the “Property”) and on all deposit and investment accounts held by
Defendant in California. On April 18, 2024, this court granted another
application by Plaintiff for right to attach order and order for issuance of
writ of attachment in the amount of $484,348.88 on the Property and on all
deposit and investment accounts held by Defendant in California.
 
On April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion (the “Motion”) for leave to amend and file a first amended
complaint and continuance of trial date. On April 30, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition (the “Opposition”) to the Motion, and on May 3, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a reply (the “Reply”) to the Opposition.
 
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“The
court may…, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon
any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding….” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §¿473, subd. (a)(1).) “A trial court has wide discretion to
allow the amendment of¿pleadings, and generally courts will liberally allow
amendments at any stage of the proceeding.” (Falcon v. Long Beach Genetics,
Inc. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1280.) “The policy favoring amendment is
so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) “Time and knowledge are important factors to be considered when granting
or denying a¿motion¿to¿amend.” (Stockton v. Ortiz (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d
183, 194.) “If the¿motion¿to¿amend¿is timely made and the granting of
the¿motion¿will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission
to¿amend¿and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the
right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is
not only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court of
Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) A court
may grant leave to amend a pleading to add new parties. (See People By and
Through Dept. of Public Works v. Clausen (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 770, 785.) A
court may grant leave to amend to add new causes of action, except an amendment
may not be permitted where “an attempt is made to state facts which give rise
to a wholly distinct and different legal obligation against the defendant” and
“a change is made in the liability sought to be enforced against the
defendant.” (Klopstock v. Superior Court in and for the City and County of
San Francisco (1941) 17 Cal.2d 13, 20.)
 
Facts
that occurred after the filing of a complaint in a lawsuit should be filed in a
supplemental pleading under California Code of Civil Procedure section 464,
subdivision (a), not an amended pleading. (Earp v. Nobmann (1981) 122
Cal.App.3d 270, 286–87, disapproved on other grounds in Silberg v.
Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212–213; Thierfeldt v. Marin Hosp.
Dist. (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 186, 204 [“[A]n amended complaint generally
cannot create a cause of action by reference to facts which have occurred after
the filing of the original complaint”]; Radar v. Rogers (1957) 49 Cal.2d
243, 247.) However, “a judgment will not be reversed for technical defects in
the pleadings” and “courts regard substance and not labels in determining the
sufficiency of a pleading.” (Starkweather v. Eddy (1927) 87 Cal.App. 92,
96; Hutnick v. U.S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 456,
464, fn. 6.) Thus, this court may treat that which is labelled as an amended
complaint as a supplemental complaint. (Thierfeldt v. Marin Hosp. Dist.,
supra, at 204.) Like with amended pleadings, “[i]t is the general policy
that courts should exercise liberality in permitting the filing of supplemental
pleadings when the alleged ‘occurring-after’ facts are pertinent to the case.”
(Flood v. Simpson (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 644, 647; see also Louie
Queriolo Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern County (1967) 252
Cal.App.2d 194, 297.) If the facts which Plaintiff seeks to add relate to
existing causes of action, this court has broad discretion both to liberally
grant leave to amend the Complaint for those facts which occurred before the
filing of the Complaint, and to liberally grant leave to file a supplemental
pleading to the Complaint for those facts which occurred after the filing of
the Complaint. 
 
A
supplemental complaint “must be in furtherance of, and consistent with, the
original action.” (Erickson v. Boothe (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 644, 647.) California
Code of Civil Procedure section 464, subdivision (a) reads, “The plaintiff and
defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental
complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the
former complaint or answer.” Thus, a supplemental complaint should only add
facts that are “consistent with the original complaint” and that do not state
“a new or independent cause of action.” (ITT Gilfillan, Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 581, 586; Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc.
v. Travelers Indemnity Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 905, 916.) Leave to supplement
is properly denied when the supplemental facts of subsequent events indicate
new and different causes of action against new parties. (Hebert v. Los
Angeles Raiders, Ltd. (1991) 23 Cal.App.4th 414, 426.) Leave to supplement
is properly denied “on the basis that the supplement to the complaint
[seeks] to introduce new causes of action.” (Flood v. Simpson, supra,
45 Cal.App.3d 644 at 647; see Brown v. Valley View Min. Co. (1900) 127
Cal. 630, 634 [“[I]t is not allowable to substitute a new and independent cause
of action by way of supplemental complaint…. the
supplemental complaint setting forth a distinct cause of action was improperly
filed, and cannot be considered.”].) But, “[w]hile it is the rule generally
that a new cause of action may not be set up by supplemental complaint, that
rule is not of inevitable application.” (Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining
Co. (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 720, 773.) Indeed, as Plaintiff notes in the Reply,
cases exist in which supplemental pleadings are permitted to add new causes of
action. (See, e.g., Honig v. Financial Corp. of America (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 960, 967; McCarthy v. Fletcher (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 130, 136.)
This follows from the broad discretion of the court in granting leave to
supplement a pleading and because it is “not apparent… how [the defendant]
could have suffered any prejudice” where “instead of filing an amended and
supplemental complaint, the [plaintiff] could have proceeded to file a new and
original complaint setting up the same facts as those contained in the amended
and supplemental complaint, and could have recovered [the same results].” (Commercial
Centre Realty Co. v. Superior Court in and for City and County of San Francisco
(1936) 7 Cal.2d 121, 130.) Additionally, “[i]t is no objection to a supplemental complaint that
different or additional relief is asked for.” (Melvin v. E.B. & A.L.
Stone Co. (1908) 7 Cal.App. 324, 326; accord Jaffa v. Guttman (1959)
175 Cal.App.2d 790, 798.) For example, where the plaintiff has brought an
action for an injunction, and a claim for incidental damages accrues while the
action is pending, a supplemental complaint is proper. (Melvin
v. E.B. & A.L. Stone Co., supra, at 326; Taylor v. Marine Cooks
& Stewards Assn. (1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 556, 559–60.) In Jacob v.
Lorenz (1893) 98 Cal 332, 338, a supplemental complaint was proper where
“[t]he defendants, by their own act, made different or additional relief
necessary” and plaintiff’s same rights remained the subject of the action. Additionally,
a supplemental complaint may add new parties to the action. (See, e.g., Spaulding
v. Howard (1898) 121 Cal. 194, 196.)
 
“A
party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether contested or
uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request for a
continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the rules in
chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations. The party must make
the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity
for the continuance is discovered. [¶] Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits. The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b)
& (c).) “A showing of good cause requires a demonstration that counsel
and the defendant have prepared for trial with due diligence.” (People v.
Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1037.) “A party's excused inability to
obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts” may indicate “good cause” for a continuance. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Other factors the court must consider include
the proximity of the trial date, whether there were previous continuances, the
length of the continuance requested, the availability of alternative means to
address the reason for the continuance, potential prejudice to the parties or
witnesses, the court’s own calendar, and whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance or by imposing conditions on the continuance.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) “[W]hile delaying litigation is
generally disfavored in light of efficiency concerns (Gov. Code, § 68607),
those concerns are secondary to the primary function of the courts—to
adjudicate disputes on their merits.” (Mai v. HKT Cal, Inc. (2021) 66
Cal.App.5th 504, 526.) 
 
 
III.
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
seeks to add, inter alia, new facts that occurred prior to the filing of
the Complaint on July 10, 2023 related to the Lease. Facts that occurred prior
to the filing of the Complaint were properly pled in an amended complaint. As
these facts were largely already pled in the Complaint and do not change the
general nature of the action nor the obligations sought to be enforced against
Defendant, this is permissible. These facts do not give rise to a wholly
distinct and different legal obligation of Defendant. Additionally, although
Plaintiff certainly knew about Lessee’s liability to him under the Lease, we
remain two months from the trial date currently set and do not believe that it
is so late in the litigation as to prejudice Defendant because of any delay. Plaintiff
also seeks to add, inter alio, Lessee as an additional defendant and a
new cause of action for breach of contract against Lessee based on its alleged
breach of the Lease. Again, this is permissible. Defendant has already been
made aware of the general nature of the dispute regarding the Lease, and the
addition of Lessee as a party and of the new cause of action for breach of the
Lease against Lessee does not add to Defendant’s liability. We find that
Defendant will not be prejudiced by the addition of Lessee as a party or of the
new breach of contract cause of action.
 
Plaintiff
further seeks to add new facts about events that took place after the filing of
the Complaint. To the extent that the proposed amended complaint does so, it should
have been filed as and this court treats it as a supplemental complaint.
Therefore, these new, after-occurring facts properly supplement the Complaint
only if they are in furtherance of, consistent with, and material to the
Complaint. The new facts relate to a deed of trust that Plaintiff alleges
Defendant caused to be recorded on a real property that is the subject of a
writ of attachment previously issued by this court is this lawsuit. (Proposed
FAC ¶¶ 18–22.) Plaintiff alleges that the recording of the deed of trust
“appears to be a fraudulent transfer.” (Id. at ¶ 22.) These new
facts supplement and do not contradict or confuse any of the facts already pled
in the Complaint. Thus, they are consistent with the Complaint. Because they
relate to Plaintiff’s ability to recover on his breach of contract claim pled
in the Complaint and his ability to execute on his writ of attachment, they
also are in furtherance of the Complaint. We find that the new after-occurring
facts that Plaintiff seeks to add are material to the case.
 
Based
on the new after-occurring facts, Plaintiff seeks to add a new party, Bellnorth
Venture LLC, as a defendant and three new causes of action, all of which are
for avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers. It is permissible for
Plaintiff to add the new party as a defendant based on the new, after-occurring
facts that are material to the case. And, although it is generally not
permissible to add new causes of action based on new, after-occurring facts in
a supplemental complaint, here, we find that Defendant will not suffer any
prejudice and it is proper in this case. Plaintiff seeks, based on the new,
after-occurring facts, additional and different damages. Plaintiff adds to the
Complaint’s prayer for relief a request for “an order setting aside the
fraudulent transfer…” and for punitive damages. (Proposed FAC p. 11.) This is
permissible. Like the plaintiffs in Melvin v. E.B. & A.L. Stone Co.,
supra, 7 Cal.App. 324 at 326 and Taylor v. Marine Cooks & Stewards Assn.,
supra, 117 Cal.App.2d 556 at 559–60, who were entitled to damages based on after-occurring
facts alleged in a supplemental complaint although the complaint only sought
injunctive relief because the damages were incidental to the original remedy
sought, here, the injunctive relief and punitive damages sought are incidental
to the damages already sought by the Complaint and because these additional and
different types of relief accrued during the course of the lawsuit, it is
appropriate for Plaintiff to plead them in a supplemental complaint. This is
reinforced by the facts that, like in Jacob v. Lorenz, supra, 98 Cal 332
at 338, Plaintiff’s right to be made whole for the alleged breach of contract
of the Lease and the Guaranty remains the subject of the lawsuit, and per the
newly alleged after-occurring facts, it is the defendants who, by their own
acts, have made different and additional relief necessary.
 
Finally,
we are persuaded to exercise our discretion in favor of allowing the amendment
and supplement to be properly filed by California’s strong public policy in
favor of liberal allowance for leave to amend and leave to supplement.
 
Accordingly,
this court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend and to file a first
amended complaint.
 
In
light of the additional facts, parties, and causes of actions that are brought
by Plaintiff’s amended complaint and supplemental complaint, we agree that a
continuance of trial is appropriate. Neither Party could have prepared for
trial with these new and additional facts, parties, and causes of action until
leave to amend was granted, so we do not find a lack of good faith efforts on
the part of either Party. Additionally, trial has not yet been continued in
this case. The
interests of justice would be served by continuing the trial and discovery
cutoff dates because the Parties need more time to be able to adequately
present their case.
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial.
