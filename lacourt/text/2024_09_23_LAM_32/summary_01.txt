And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a breach of contract case involving Craig Sallin, et al. (Plaintiffs) and Joe Samuel Bailey, et al. (Defendants). The case stems from a settlement agreement reached in 2019, where Plaintiffs invested money to Defendants in 2014 and 2015, and the parties agreed to resolve disputes over the amount owed. However, Defendants failed to pay the amounts required by the agreement.

Plaintiffs filed motions to compel responses and deem matters admitted, as Defendants did not respond to discovery requests within the statutory deadline. The judge granted the motions, ordering Defendants to provide verified responses without objection (except as to privacy and privilege) within 20 days. The judge also deemed the matters raised in the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted unless Defendants serve substantially code-compliant responses before the hearing on September 9, 2024.

Furthermore, the judge sanctioned Defendants in the total amount of $4,800, to be paid within 30 days of the order, as a result of their failure to timely respond to discovery.
