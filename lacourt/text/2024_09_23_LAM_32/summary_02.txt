And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Deanna Edwards, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, P. Sterling Kerr and George E. Robinson, alleging legal malpractice. The defendants demurred, arguing that the plaintiff failed to participate in mediation as required by their retainer agreement. However, the court found that the demurrer was unaccompanied by any declaration showing meet and confer, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. Nevertheless, the court proceeded to consider the merits of the demurrer. The court found that the complaint adequately alleged the elements of legal malpractice and that there was no basis for the demurrer. As a result, the court overruled the demurrer and allowed the plaintiff's complaint to proceed.
