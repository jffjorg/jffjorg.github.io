  Case No.:  23STCV29847
  Hearing Date:  September 23, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ demurrer to complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff
Deanna Edwards filed this action for legal malpractice against Defendants P.
Sterling Kerr dba Kerr Simpson Attorneys at Law and George E. Robinson. 
            On January 29, 2024, the Court
granted the parties’ stipulation to stay the case pending mediation. 
            On August 27, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant demurrer on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to participate in
mediation. Plaintiff filed her opposition on September 6, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) 
The Court notes that Defendants have not
complied with the meet and confer requirement. The demurrer is unaccompanied by
any declaration, much less one demonstrating meet and confer. However,
inadequate meet and confer is not a reason for overruling a demurrer. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).) Therefore, the Court proceeds on the merits.    
DISCUSSION
            The retainer agreement attached to
the complaint provides that “[s]hould a dispute arise between Client and our
firm that cannot be resolved informally, the firm and client agree to mediate
the dispute.” (Compl., Ex. 3.) Defendants demur on the grounds that Plaintiff
has failed to participate in mediation.
            However, a demurrer may only be
sustained based on defects on the face of the complaint or from judicially
noticeable materials. (SKF Farms, supra, 153 Cal.App.3d at p. 905.)
Here, there is no indication from the face of the complaint or from judicially
noticeable materials that Plaintiff refused to mediate. Defendants otherwise
present no arguments regarding the sufficiency of the allegations in relation
to the elements of legal malpractice. Therefore, there is no basis for
demurrer. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED.
