And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by the defendants, WNDM Properties, LLC, QNDM Distribution, LLC, John Barrett, Jr., Mark A. Bruno, and Kelly Marie Dooley. The cross-complaint seeks to assert claims against the plaintiffs, Michael Schutz, Nicole Schutz, and ALI J LLC, for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraudulent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation of unfair competition law, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not make a showing of bad faith, as required by law, and therefore granted the motion. The judge noted that trial is scheduled to go forward on March 25, 2024, and wishes to hear from the parties about whether trial will go forward as scheduled.
