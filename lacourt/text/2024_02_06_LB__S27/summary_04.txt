And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the City and CH2M Hill Engineers, Inc. The City's demurrer to the first cause of action for general negligence in the First Amended Complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The City argues that the complaint does not identify the specific statute or employee responsible for the alleged negligence, and the Court agrees. Plaintiff must file a Second Amended Complaint clarifying its allegations against the City and their statutory basis within twenty days.

On the other hand, CH2M's demurrer is overruled. CH2M argues that the complaint lacks specific facts showing that it is liable for the alleged injuries, but the Court finds that the complaint is sufficient to meet the relaxed pleading standard in a negligence action. The parties can resolve issues relating to the specifics of the claims through discovery.

Finally, the Court reminds the parties that there is an OSC re: proof of service and Case Management Conference on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the demurrers, and asks counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC, CMC, and hearing on the demurrers.
