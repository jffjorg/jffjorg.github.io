And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees, which was filed by the plaintiff, Suzanne Yorgason, in a lawsuit against the defendant, Ken Lamphear. The lawsuit arises from a real estate transaction in which the plaintiff sold her home to the defendant for $250,000 plus a life estate in the property. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding her $1,659,456 in compensatory damages and $3,000,000 in punitive damages. The defendant's motion for a new trial was granted in part, reducing the punitive damages award to $939,669.

The plaintiff seeks an attorneys' fees award in the amount of $1,659,805, while the defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the fees billed by Justin Torres, a disbarred attorney, should be disallowed and that no lodestar multiplier should be awarded. The judge has determined that the fees billed by Torres should be disallowed, but has not yet decided whether to award a lodestar multiplier.

The judge has considered the factors set forth in Serrano v. Priest and Ketchum v. Moses, including the contingency of the fee, the skill of the attorneys, and the success achieved. The judge has determined that the fee was contingent and that the attorneys' skill is adequately represented by the high billing rate of $650/hour on the majority of the work performed. The judge is inclined to award a modest fee multiplier and has awarded a multiplier of 1.3, resulting in an awarded attorneys' fees total of $633,323.60.
