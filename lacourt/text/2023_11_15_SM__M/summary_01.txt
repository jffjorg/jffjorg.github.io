Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by AKA Brands, Inc. to the first amended complaint filed by Rodman Ventures, LLC. The demurrer challenges the seventh cause of action for trademark infringement and the tenth cause of action for unjust enrichment. The judge grants the demurrer with leave to amend as to the seventh cause of action, but sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the tenth cause of action. The judge is inclined to grant leave to allege a cause of action under the Lanham Act theory, which does not require registration of the trademarks. The Lanham Act allows for a claim against anyone who uses a mark that is likely to cause confusion, regardless of whether the mark is registered. The judge's ruling is subject to change after consideration of further briefing and argument.
