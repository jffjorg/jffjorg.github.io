CASE NO.:                22SMCV02186
MOTION:                  Demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint 
HEARING DATE:   11/15/2023
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and
upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant AKA Brands, Inc. demurs
to the seventh and tenth causes of action of the first amended complaint (FAC)
filed by Plaintiff Rodman Ventures, LLC.
 
Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests that the Court
notice certain documents that comprise web pages from the United States Patent
and Trademark Office website, which reflect the registration status of various
trademarks relevant to this action. The request is GRANTED. (Evid. Code §
452(c), (h).) 
 
Seventh Cause of Action for Trademark Infringement
 
            Defendant
demurs to the trademark infringement cause of action. Defendant argues that 15
U.S.C. section 1114 governs only registered trademarks, and the FAC does
not allege that Plaintiff owns the registered trademarks. Indeed, section 1114(a)
only governs registered trademarks and provides in pertinent part:
 
Any person who shall, without the
consent of the registrant—
 
(a) use in
commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a
registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution,
or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use
is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive; ... shall be
liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter
provided.
 
Defendant notes that the only
trademarks Plaintiff alleges in the FAC are not registered. (RJN Exs. A–G.) Critically,
Plaintiff concedes that the trademarks at issue were not registered, but they
have now sought registration. Plaintiff asserts that applications for the
trademarks at issue were filed with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (“USPTO”) on July 13, 2023. Given that the marks are not currently
registered, and it is uncertain whether they will ever be, Plaintiff cannot sue
for trademark infringement. 
 
Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to
add a new Lanham Act claim against Defendants pursuant to 15 U.S.C. section
1125(a). Under this section, a party may sue under the Lanham Act without
registered trademarks. (Brookfield Commc'ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Ent. Corp.
(1999) 174 F.3d 1036, 1047, fn. 8.) This section applies to both registered and
unregistered trademarks as follows:
 
Any person who,
on or in connection with any goods or services, ... uses in commerce any word,
term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false
designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or
misleading representation of fact, which—
(A) is likely to
cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the
origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person, ...shall be liable in a civil action by any
person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
 
(15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1).) As this statute does not require
registration, the Court is inclined to grant leave to allege a cause of action
under this theory. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to this cause of action only. The Court does
not permit any additional causes of action other than the Lanham Act claim. 
 
Tenth Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment
 
Defendant demurs to the unjust
enrichment cause of action because “there is no cause of action in California
for unjust enrichment”. (Melchior v. New Line Prods., Inc. (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 779, 793.) Defendant is correct. 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to this
cause of action.
