ANALYSIS:
 
On October 11,
2017, Plaintiff Mercury Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this subrogation
action against Defendant Johan Vasquez De La Rosa aka Johnan Delarosa Vasquez (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an
answer on November 22, 2017. On May 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal and retention of jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed the action pursuant
to the request on the same date. (Request for Dismissal, filed 05/11/18.) 
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement complies
with the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by both
parties. (Motion, Thai Decl., Exh. 1, p. 3.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Thai Decl., Exh. 1, ¶1; Request for
Dismissal, 05/11/18, ¶1(b)(6).) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $14,000.00 in monthly payments following their
execution of the agreement. (Motion, Thai Decl., Exh. 1, ¶1.) The settlement
agreement also provides that upon Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek
judgment in the demand of the Complaint ($17,873.22) plus costs of $370.00 for
filing and $99.50 for service, actual attorney’s fees and costs, minus any
monies paid. (Ibid.) Payments of $11,950.00 were made towards the
settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id. at ¶5 and Exh. 3.)
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff requests entry of judgment against Defendant in
the amount of $2,050.00 principal ($14,000.00 - $11,950.00), costs of $529.50.00,
and attorney’s fees of $875.00. (Id. at ¶9.)

JOHNAN DELAROSA VASQUEZ IN THE
AMOUNT OF $2,050.00 PRINCIPAL, COSTS OF $529.50.00, AND ATTORNEY’S FEES OF
