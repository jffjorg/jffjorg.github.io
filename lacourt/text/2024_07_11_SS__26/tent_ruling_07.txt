ANALYSIS: 
 

On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff JAG
Structural Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action against Defendant Roya Nasr (“Defendant”). Plaintiff
filed proof of substitute service on May 13, 2024. On June 13, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint.
Plaintiff did not file a complete opposition but a declaration from Plaintiff’s
counsel.
 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff did not serve
them in compliance with the statutory requirements. The Motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, which states: “A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time
to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow,
may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1), emphasis added.) 
 
Where service is challenged, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective
service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However,
a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
concedes that the Motion should be granted and that Defendant will be served at
a different address than the one listed in the proof of substitute service
filed on May 13, 2024. (Schachter Decl., p. 2:4-5, 13-16.) To date, no other
proof of service of the Summons and Complaint has been filed. Therefore, the
Motion to Quash Service is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Roya Nasr’s Motion to
Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is GRANTED. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
REGARDING FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR
SEPTEMBER 12, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
