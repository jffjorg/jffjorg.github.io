And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiff Eminence Metrology, LLC to prove up default damages against Defendant Alatus Aerosystems, Inc. and others. The Plaintiff filed the instant action for breach of contract on April 19, 2023, and default was entered on January 9, 2024, after the Defendant failed to file a responsive pleading. The Plaintiff then filed the Application to Prove-Up Default Damages on April 19, 2024. However, the Judge has denied the Application without prejudice because it was not submitted on the required Judicial Council Form CIV-100 and was made by regular application rather than an ex parte application. The Judge has ordered the court clerk to give notice of the denial.
