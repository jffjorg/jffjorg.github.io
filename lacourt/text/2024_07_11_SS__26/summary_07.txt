And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Roya Nasr, has moved to quash service of the summons and complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff did not serve them in compliance with the statutory requirements. The judge has granted the motion and set an order to show cause for September 12, 2024, regarding the failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient proof of service and that the defendant will be served at a different address than the one listed in the proof of substitute service filed by the plaintiff.
