ANALYSIS:
 
On January 9, 2024, Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club (“Defendant”) served Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, on Plaintiff Bin Yang (“Plaintiff”). (Motion,
Vallone Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the
deadline to serve verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not
served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and Exh. 2.) Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on June 7, 2024. No opposition
has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents and Request for Monetary Sanctions, is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a
motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)
Furthermore, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party
fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Therefore,
Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, without
objections.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $285.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour and costs of $60.00. (Motion, Vallone Decl., ¶10.)

 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
BIN YANG IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES
TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER. PLAINTIFF BIN YANG IS ALSO
ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $285.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE
OF THIS ORDER.
