Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the first through seventh causes of action with leave to amend. The defendant's motion to strike is also granted with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred under the California Tort Claims Act and that the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies for the seventh cause of action. The court also grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest.
