Background
 
On
May 22, 2023, Jeryl Smith (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against the Los
Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD” or “Defendant”) and Does 1 to 20. 
 
The
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges seven causes of action: (1)
violation of Ed. Code § 22458, (2) negligence, (3) conversion, (4) negligent
misrepresentation, (5) fraudulent misrepresentation, (6) elder abuse, and (7)
retaliation. 
 
On
July 26, 2023, Defendant LAUSD filed a demurrer with a motion to strike the
SAC. Opposing papers were filed on September 20, 2023. LAUSD filed a reply on
September 27, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695,
713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion
to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave
to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Defendant LAUSD demurs to the SAC on
the basis that: (1) it is time-barred, (2) the first through fifth causes of
action are barred to due Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the California Tort
Claims Act, (3) the sixth cause of action for retaliation is barred due to
Plaintiff’s failure to file a complaint with California Civil Rights Department
(“CCRD”) within three year from the date the wrongful conduct occurred, and (4)
Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action of Elder Abuse fails to state sufficient
facts to constitute a cause of action. 
 
            A.
       Summary of Allegations in SAC
 
The SAC alleges that
Plaintiff was an employee of LAUSD from 1981 until August 26, 2008, when
Plaintiff retired. (SAC ¶ 6.) Plaintiff notified LAUSD of her retirement by
filing the mandatory LAUSD Certificated Registration Form indicating her
retirement date as 08/26/2008. (SAC ¶ 6.) Following Plaintiff’s retirement, the
California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) administered her
retirement benefit payment. (SAC ¶ 7.) 
 
In October 2019, Plaintiff decided to
file for Social Security benefits and was required to provide a Verification of
Benefits letter from CalSTRS. (SAC ¶ 8.) “After reviewing the data that CalSTRS
provided, the plaintiff found discrepancies, showing overpayments interspersed
with underpayments, and unexplained and unusual activities in her account. At
this time, the COVID 19 pandemic had set in, and it was difficult for plaintiff
to reach either CalSTRS or the LAUSD for clarifications.” (SAC ¶ 9.) 
 
At the end of 2020, Plaintiff
established contact with CalSTRS via telephone and requested CalSTRS documents
showing the years of service and changes made to her account since retirement.
(SAC ¶ 10.) The information was not clear to Plaintiff and Plaintiff informed
CalSTRS that she could not understand the calculation and how the changes were
made. (SAC ¶ 11.) CalSTRS informed Plaintiff to expect a clarification by July
2021, but after not hearing a response, Plaintiff called CalSTRS again on
October 5, 2021.  CalSTRS then informed
Plaintiff she was being paid for $24.142 years of service credit instead of
24.430 credit reported in CalSTRS’ letter of February 2021. (SAC ¶ 13.) 
 
Plaintiff submits evidence that on
January 26, 2023, CalSTRS in response to her October 31, 2022, complaint
informed Plaintiff that it had been unsuccessful in getting LAUSD to respond to
its request for information. (SAC ¶ 23, Ex. C.) Plaintiff provides CalSTRS
correspondence showing that since October 27, 2021, CalSTRS tried to obtain
information from LAUSD, including sending an escalation letter on December 20,
2022, and a follow-up letter on January 25, 2023. (SAC Ex. D.) 
 
CalSTRS’ Ombuds, Mark Ginin, disclosed
that LAUSD indicated that Plaintiff’s retirement date was March 6, 2008, rather
than August 26, 2008, resulting in a decrease of about five months in
calculating Plaintiff’s year of service credit. (SAC ¶ 13, Ex. B.)
Consequently, Plaintiff had been consistently underpaid for more than 5 years,
and the underpayment affected her benefits and tax payments. (SAC ¶ 14.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts she never received a
copy of the Express Benefit Report showing Plaintiff’s incorrect retirement
date and that LAUSD never gave her a copy of the report. (SAC ¶ 13.) Plaintiff
alleges that LAUSD sent CalSTRS the report on September 3, 2008, after
Plaintiff’s retirement on August 26, 2008. (SAC ¶ 63.) 
 
            B.        Plaintiff’s
Claims May Not Be Time-Barred
 
LAUSD asserts that Plaintiff’s claims
are time-barred because Plaintiff should have discovered in 2008 that the
retirement date was wrong when Plaintiff started receiving benefits from
CalSTRS. 
 
To invoke the delayed discovery rule,
the Plaintiff must specifically allege “(1) the time and manner of discovery”
and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable
diligence.” (Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d
292, 297: see also E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Services (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 132.) Plaintiff sufficiently alleged, that she never received
the Express Benefit Report showing that Plaintiff’s retirement date was
wrongfully entered as March 6, 2008. (SAC ¶ 13, Ex. B.) Defendant fails to show
how receiving her CalSTRS benefits would have put her on notice that the
retirement date was off by about five months. Plaintiff states that she learned
of the error when CalSTRS’ Ombud, Mark Gini disclosed the erroneous information
in the Express Benefit Report but fails to state when Mr. Gini made said
disclosure. (SAC ¶ 13.) Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to state the precise
time and manner of discovery. 
 
“[A] plaintiff's claim accrues when the
plaintiff learns of the ‘actual injury,’ i.e., an adverse employment action,
and not when the plaintiff suspects a ‘legal wrong,’ i.e., that the employer
acted with a discriminatory intent.” (Coppinger-Martin v. Solis (9th
Cir. 2010) 627 F.3d 745, 749.)           Plaintiff
diligently made inquiries to CalSTRS when she began to suspect that there was
an error in the accounting of her benefits. Exhibits C and D, show that as of
January 25, 2023, and January 26, 2023, CalSTRS was still trying to obtain
information from LAUSD regarding Plaintiff’s request for information and had
yet to reach a resolution regarding her October 31, 2022, complaint to CalSTRS
about her benefits. (SAC Ex. C and D.) 
 
As the SAC fails to provide a date as
to when Plaintiff discovered that her retirement date in CalSTRS was wrongfully
entered, the court sustains the demurrer to the first through fifth causes of
action. 
            
C.        California Tort Claims Act
 
“The California Tort Claims Act (Act)
(Gov. Code, §§ 810 et seq.) governs actions against public entities and public
employees. The timeliness of such actions is governed by the specific statute
of limitations set forth in the Government Code, not the statute of limitations
applicable to private defendants.” (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.) Under the Act, no person may sue a public
entity or public employee for “money or damages” unless a timely written claim
has been presented to and denied by the public entity. (Gov. Code, § 945.4; Curtis
T. v. County of Los Angeles (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1405, 1415.) “Compliance
with the claims statute is mandatory, and failure to file a claim is fatal to
the cause of action.” (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. vs. County of Riverside
(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 183, 188.) Failure to present a claim for money or
damages to the Department bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against a
public entity or employee. (Gov. Code, § 945.4; State of California v.
Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239-140.)
 
Under Gov. Code § 911.4(b), the
discovery rule may extend the six-month window until a plaintiff “knows both
the existence and the cause of injury.” (Gov. Code §911.4(b).) “A plaintiff suing the state,
or a local public entity must allege facts demonstrating either compliance with
the claim presentation requirement or an excuse for noncompliance as an
essential element of the cause of action.” (Ovando v. County of Los Angeles
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 42, 65.) The SAC fails to state that Plaintiff
complied with the claim presentation requirement of the California Tort Claims
Act. 
 
Furthermore,
in Plaintiff’s opposition, Plaintiff argues they are excused from claim
presentation requirement pursuant to Blue v. Los Angeles Unified
School Dist. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th Supp. 12, 13.)
In Blue, the plaintiff was a widower of a school district employee and
was denied life insurance benefits following the death of employee’s death. (Id.
at p. 13.) The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and
promissory estoppel against the defendant school district. (Id.) The
defendant school district moved for summary judgment alleging that Plaintiff
had failed to comply with the claim presentation requirement of the Tort Claims
Act and argued that the plaintiff’s claim did not fall under the exception of
Gov. Code § 905(f) for “[a]pplications or claims or money or
benefits under any public retirement or pension system.” (Id. at
p. 14 citing Gov. Code 905(f).) 
 
The
court of appeal was unpersuaded by the defendant’s attempt to distinguish
plaintiff’s claim as being a breach of contract claim rather than a claim for
benefits denied: 
 
Defendant attempts to draw a distinction between
filing a request for life insurance benefits and filing a
breach of contract claim after those benefits are denied. We are unpersuaded.
 
Plaintiff submitted all forms and correspondence
requested by defendant in regard to the benefits exactly as defendant
instructed. Section 905, subdivision (f) exempts from the Act claims for
benefits such as those requested by plaintiff. The denial of
this request does not magically change the claim for benefits into a claim for
breach of contract which would require the filing of a formal claim under the
Act. The action is still based on plaintiff's claim for life insurance
benefits. Thus, no claim was required to be filed prior to the
initiation of the instant suit.
 
(Blue,
supra, 26 Cal. App.4th Supp. at p. 14.)
 
Like
the defendant school district in Blue, LAUSD distinguishes Plaintiff’s
SAC as a complaint that seeks damages rather than “money or benefits under any
public retirement or pension system” because Plaintiff seeks damages for
emotional and mental distress, embarrassment, mortification, humiliation, and
indignity. (SAC ¶¶ 29, 30, 44, 50, 67, 76, 83, 84 and p. 12:18 & 22.)
Defendant LAUSD relies on Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility
Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566, in which the plaintiffs filed
two claims for breach of fiduciary duty and denial of equal protection due to
the defendant’s implementing a retirement formula that allegedly benefitted
some retirees at the cost of others. (Id. at p. 1570.) In finding that
the plaintiffs were required to comply with the Tort Claims Act, the appellate
court found: 
 
The legislative history of section 905 indicates the
scope of the enumerated exceptions to filing claims was intended to be
extremely limited. . . Consequently, commentators have construed the section
905 exceptions as essentially nontortious claims ‘for which some other adequate
claims procedure has already been devised or for which the procedural
protection of the Tort Claims Act is believed to be unnecessary.’ [Citation.]
 
The instant action is not such a case. Plaintiffs are
basically alleging tortious wrongdoing by defendants. They do not seek money due to them under the terms of the
existing pension system; rather, they claim defendants treated them unfairly in
administrating the system and seek to change the 1989 administrative decisions.
Consequently, we conclude plaintiffs were required to file a claim pursuant to
section 905. Having failed to file their claim, plaintiffs' suit is barred by
section 911.2.
 
(Id. at p 1574.) 
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of action is for violation of Ed. Code § 22458, which states:
 
Each employer shall provide the system with
information regarding the compensation to be paid to employees subject to the Defined Benefit Program in that school
year. The information shall be submitted annually as determined by the board
and may include, but shall not be limited to, employment contracts, salary
schedules, and local board minutes.


The court finds that the first cause of
action relates to money or benefits due to Plaintiff under a public retirement
or pension system. (Gov. Code, § 905(f).) Consequently, Plaintiff would be
excused from having to file a government claim for the first cause of action.
Similarly, Plaintiff’s third cause of action for conversion pertains to money
or benefits LAUSD allegedly converted. 
 
However, Plaintiff’s second cause of
action for negligence, fourth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,
and fifth cause of action for intentional misrepresentation seeks other damages
not related to money or benefits due under a public retirement or pension
system. (Gov. Code, § 905(f).) 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the first
through fifth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            D.        Sixth
Cause of Action – Elder Abuse
 
Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.07
defines elder abuse as: 
 
(a)
Physical abuse, neglect,¿financial abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction,¿or
other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental suffering.  
             
(b)
The deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to
avoid physical harm or mental suffering. 
Under
section 15610.07, “for the conduct to qualify as elder abuse, it must cause
elder to suffer physical harm, pain or suffering.” (Carter v. Prime Healthcare
Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 409.) “A separate
provision, Section 15610.30(a), contains a different definition of ‘financial
abuse’ that does not require physical harm, pain, or mental suffering.”
(Davis v. RiverSource Life Insurance Company (N.D. Cal. 2017) 240
F.Supp.3d 1011, 1019.)  
 
Welf.
& Inst. Code § 15610.30 states:  
 
‘Financial abuse’ of an elder or dependent adult occurs when
a person or entity does any of the following: 
 
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real
or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with
intent to defraud, or both. 
(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining,
or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a
wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both. 
(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or
assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or
personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue influence [.]
 
(Welf. & Inst. Code,
§ 15610.30.)
 
“‘In
view of the fact that tort causes of action against public entities are now
based on statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action must be
pleaded with particularity is applicable. Every fact essential to the existence
of statutory liability must be pleaded.’” (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins.
Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App 4th 1056, 1061 citing Susman v.
City of Los Angeles (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809.) Here, the court cannot
ascertain if Plaintiff’s claim for elder abuse is pled under Welf. & Inst.
Code § 15610.30 or § 15610.07. 
 
Moreover,
under Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30, Plaintiff fails to plead facts that
show LAUSD took, secreted, appropriated, or retained Plaintiff’s property for
wrongful use. Consequently, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend.
 
E.        Seventh
Cause of Action – Retaliation
 
An employee must exhaust the
administrative remedies under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) before
filing a complaint and obtaining a right-to-sue letter to be entitled to bring
a civil action for damages under FEHA. (See Okoli v. Lockheed Technical
Operations Co. (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1613; Romano
v. Rockwell Internat., Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 492; Gov. Code, §§
12960, 12965(b).)
 
The court agrees that Plaintiff’s seventh
cause of action fails to allege that Plaintiff exhausted their administrative
remedies before filing a claim for retaliation in court. Accordingly, the
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike the following
from Plaintiff’s SAC: 
 
1)    
The prayer for reasonable attorney's
fees against the moving public entity defendant 2 LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL
DISTRICT. Specifically at page 12, line 19 of 3 the Complaint; and
2)    
The prayer for Prejudgment Interest
against the moving public entity defendant LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.
Specifically at page 12, lines 21 of the Complaint.
 
The court agrees that the SAC fails to
allege a basis for attorney’s fees and grants the Defendant’s motion to strike
the Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees. 
 
Civ.
Code § 3287 “provides a right to prejudgment interest when a person ‘is
entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by
calculation.’” (Glassman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America
(2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1281, 1294.) The SAC fails to allege that Plaintiff’s
damages are certain and capable of being made certain.
 
Therefore,
the request to strike prejudgment interest is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant LAUSD’s demurrer to the first
through seventh causes of action of the SAC is sustained with leave to amend.  LAUSD’s motion to strike is granted with
leave to amend.
