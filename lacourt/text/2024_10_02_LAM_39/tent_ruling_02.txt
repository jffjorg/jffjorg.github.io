(1)-(4) Plaintiff Marta Lopez

BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Marta Lopez is
a licensed clinical social worker. 
Plaintiff was employed by Defendants in her capacity as a social worker
from 2007 through March 2022, with a brief hiatus during that period.  Plaintiff alleges she was terminated and
discriminated against based on her age, race, national origin and ethnicity.  Plaintiff also claims her termination was in
retaliation for her complaints against her supervisors’ new policies.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants terminated
Plaintiff based on the pretext of falsified or fraudulent time records, when it
was obvious the time entries in question were the result of clerical error and
Defendants’ transitioning to a new time keeping system.  
            Plaintiff filed this
action on September 16, 2022.  The
operative complaint is the Second Amended Complaint filed on June 20, 2024 in
which Plaintiff alleges (1) wrongful termination in violation of public policy;
(2) age discrimination (FEHA); (3) race, national origin, ancestry
discrimination (FEHA); (4) failure to prevent discrimination (FEHA); (5)
retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5; and (6) retaliation in
violation of Health & Safety Code §1278.5.
            A trial setting
conference is set for the same date as the following Motions to Compel Further
Responses.  
MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Lopez filed four motions to compel further responses from Defendant California
Permanent Group: Requests for Production (RFP) (Set Two), Special
Interrogatories (Set Two), RFP (Set Three), and Special Interrogatories (Set
Three).
ANALYSIS
I.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Document Production (Set Two)
            A.  Legal Standard
            Where a party is seeking to compel further responses
to requests for document production, the burden is on the moving party to show
both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery.
(Code of Civ. Proc., §2031.310(b)(1.)[1]  Once good cause is established by the moving
party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure. 
            B.  Meet and Confer, Timeliness, and Separate
Statement
            Plaintiff
sufficiently met and conferred with Defendant from May 2, 2024 through June 3,
2024.  (Declaration of Esperanza
Cervantes Anderson, ¶¶ 9-15.)  The meet
and confer efforts yielded two sets of supplemental responses and, in
Defendant’s June 3, 2024 letter, Defendant indicated no further supplemental
responses would be provided.  (Id. at
¶ 15.)
            Notice of a motion to compel further responses must
be given within 45 days of service of the defective responses, plus five days
if the responses were served by mail, unless the deadline is extended in
writing.  (§ 2031.310(c).)  The last set of supplemental responses was
served on May 21, 2024.  (Anderson Decl.,
¶ 13.)  The 45-day deadline would have
expired on July 5, 2024.  The motion was
timely filed on June 3, 2024.
            Plaintiff was required to file a separate statement
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, and Plaintiff filed a
separate statement in conformity with rule 3.1345. 
            C.  Motion to Compel GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 60,
62-67, and 71-73 and DENIED as to Nos. 61, 68-70, 79, and 81.  
            Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to RFP
Nos. 60-77, 79 and 81 (Set Two).  Plaintiff
argues the responses to RFP Nos. 74-77 are deficient because they assert
meritless objections, and the responses to RFP Nos. 60-73, 79, and 81 are
deficient because they do not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure.
            Defendant
opposes the motion on grounds the objections asserted in response to RFP Nos.
74-77 are meritorious, and the responses to RFP Nos. 60-73, 79, and 81 are
sufficient and code-compliant.
            In
response to RFP Nos. 60 and 62-67, Defendant directs Plaintiff to documents
previously produced and “confirms that no responsive documents have been
withheld in connection with [those] request[s].”  In response to RFP No. 73, Defendant claims it
has produced existing responsive documents and “no documents have been withheld
in response to this request.”  However,
Defendant also incorporates all prior objections, including those based on
attorney-client privilege and work product. 

            Section
2031.220 provides a statement of compliance “shall state that the production … will
be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.”  Section provides “If only part of an item or
category of item in a demand for inspection … is objectionable, the responses
shall contain a statement of compliance, or a representation of inability to
comply with respect to the remainder of that item or category.”  (§ 2031.240, subd. (a).)  Any
objection must (1) identify with particularity any responsive document or item to
which an objection is being made; (2) set forth the extent of and specific
ground for objection; and (3) provide sufficient information for the
propounding party to evaluate any claim of attorney client privilege or work
product protection, including, if necessary, a privilege log.  (§2031.240, subd. (b).)  
            Defendant’s
response is ambiguous and fails to comply with CCP §§2031.220 and
2031.240.  Defendant incorporates all
prior objections and states “subject” to those objections, responsive documents
were previously produced, setting forth the Bates numbers of those documents,
and confirming “no responsive documents have been withheld in connection with
this request.”  Defendant’s response must
state whether production is being allowed “in whole or in part” and if any
documents are being withheld based on any of the asserted objections.  If, in fact, no documents have been withheld
based on any objection, Defendant’s assertion of objections is superfluous and
confusing.   
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 60,
62-67, and 73.   Defendant is ordered to serve further those responses
in compliance with this order within 20 days. 

            RFP
Nos. 61, 68-70—DENY.  In response
to RFP Nos. 61, 68, 69, and 70, Defendant incorporates all prior objections and
states, “following a diligent search and reasonable inquiry,” “no documents
responsive to [those] request[s] have been located, produced, or withheld in
response to this request, because no responsive documents ever existed or are
no longer in the possession, custody or control of” Defendant.  Defendant also confirms it is unaware of who
might have possession, custody or control of responsive documents to the extent
they exist.  
            Defendant’s
response substantially complies with section 2031.230:  “A representation of inability to comply with
the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall
affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an
effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether
the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” 
(§2031.230.)  Defendant’s
statement the documents either never existed “or” are no longer in its
possession or custody does not violate section 2031.230.  Plaintiff fails to cite any authority
requiring Defendant only select one of the options for being unable to comply,
nor would such a requirement make sense. 
The unavailability of specific responsive documents may vary depending
on the document.  
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is DENIED as to RFP Nos. 61, 68-70.
            RFP
Nos. 71 and 72--GRANT.  In
response to RFP Nos. 71 and 72, Defendant directs Plaintiff to responsive
documents previously served by Bates number. 
Defendant also states it is withholding documents based on privilege.  However, Defendant has not provided a privilege
log, nor does the response itself provide enough information for Plaintiff to
evaluate Defendant’s claim of privilege. 
(§ 2031.240, subd. (b)(2).)  
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to RFP Nos. 71 and 72 is GRANTED.  Defendant to serve further responses within
20 days.
            RFP
Nos. 79 and 81--DENY.  RFP Nos. 79 and 81
seek unredacted versions of documents previously produced, as identified by
Bates number.  Plaintiff fails to
establish good cause for further production. 
Plaintiff seeks unredacted versions of these documents because Defendant
produced versions with all phone numbers redacted, including those of
government agencies and public offices. 
Plaintiff fails to establish why redaction of the phone numbers of
public offices and government agencies is relevant to her claims. According to
Defendant, it already responded to Plaintiff’s initial concerns regarding
redactions of the entirety of phone numbers on the documents, as well as
medical record numbers.  (Opposition,
Carroll Decl., ¶14.)  Defendant produced
versions of the documents with the last four digits of all phone numbers
unredacted and the last three digits of medical record numbers unredacted.  (Id.) 
After doing so, Plaintiff argued the government offices’ or agencies’ phone
numbers should be fully disclosed without any redaction.  (Id.) 
Plaintiff fails to establish good cause to compel Defendant to provide
the unredacted phone numbers of government offices or agencies.  
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 79 and 81 is DENIED.  
            RFP
Nos. 74-77—GRANT as to 74, 76, and 77 and MOOT/DENY as to 75
            Through RFP Nos. 74-77 Plaintiff seeks production of
the “Regional MSW Indicators” for each month in 2017, 2018, 2021, and
2022.  The Regional MSW Indicators are monthly
statements noting the number of full-time employees allotted to the Baldwin
Park Medical Center Social Work Department for that month.  According to Plaintiff, an example of these
documents was attached as an exhibit to the RFP but the version of the RFPs
provided to the Court does not have the exhibit attached.  (Anderson Dec., Ex. E.)  
            Plaintiff
claims the Regional MSW indicators are relevant because they indicate the
number of Kaiser full-time employees assigned to the Baldwin Hills location, as
well as statistics on the average turnaround times by social workers on patient
referrals.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants
retaliated and discriminated against her by imposing unrealistic time limits on
her to perform her job, while allowing other employees more time.  (SAC, ¶ 38.) 
Plaintiff establishes good cause for further production.  
            Plaintiff
also claims Defendant has already produced the Regional MSW indicators for
November 2021, Bates Nos. SCPMG01141-SCPMG01142.  The document was authenticated by Defendant’s
director, Fran Izzo.  (Anderson Decl.,
Ex. B; Izzo Deposition testimony, p. 50:17-21.) 

            In
response, Defendant fails to justify the laundry list of objections asserted to
RFP Nos. 74-77.  The only objection
discussed by Defendant was that based on trade secret and business
confidentiality.  Defendant does not
provide any evidence the requirements of trade secret are satisfied.  Moreover, Defendant already produced the
November 2021 Regional MSW Indicator, undermining any claim of confidentiality
or trade secret protection.
            Plaintiff
agrees to limit production to July to December 2017 and December 2021 to April
2022.  RFP No. 75 seeks the MSW
Indicators for 2018.  
            As
such, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 74, 76, and 77
is GRANTED and to RFP No. 75 is moot.  Defendant
is ordered to serve further responses to RFP Nos. 74, 76, and 77 for those
limited time periods noted above within 20 days.    
            D.
Sanctions—DENY
            Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $3,085
(5.5 hours @ $550/hour, plus a $60 filing fee). 
Neither party entirely prevailed. 
Thus, sanctions are not warranted. 

II.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) 
            A. Legal Standard
            If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
answer the interrogatories. (Coy v. Superior Court  (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 (Coy);
Fairmont Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255 (Fairmont).)  
            B.  Meet and Confer, Timeliness and Separate
Statement
            Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts were sufficient.
Plaintiff met and conferred from April 22, 2024, through May 17, 2024.  (Anderson Decl., ¶¶5-21.)  These efforts yielded three sets of
supplemental responses.  (Id.)  The last set of responses was served on May
21, 2024.  (Id. at ¶13.)
            The
motion was timely filed on June 3, 2024, less than 45 days after the last set
of supplemental responses was served. 
The motion is also supported by a proper separate statement under CRC
Rule 3.1345.
            C.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 38-42 Is Granted
            Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 38-42.  As the
party objecting to these interrogatories, Defendant has the initial burden of
justifying its objections and refusal to fully respond to each of these
interrogatories.  (Coy, supra, 58
Cal.2d at pp. 220–221; Fairmont, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 255.)  
            In
Special Interrogatory Nos. 38-42, Plaintiff asks Defendant to provide salary
information for specific employees who were also employed as MSW III and MSW II
between January 1 and December 1, 2022. 
Defendant argues it has already fully responded to these interrogatories
by setting forth the Bates numbers of previously produced documents, namely the
Collective Bargaining Unit Agreement that sets forth the pay scale for such
employees.  Defendant also objects on
grounds of relevance and the privacy rights of those third parties whose salary
information would be produced.  
            Relevance.
The information requested is relevant to Plaintiff’s claims that she, as
well as other older, more senior employees, were targeted by Defendant for
termination because they were more expensive than younger, less senior
employees.  (SAC, ¶ 21.)  Plaintiff is entitled to discover what her co-workers’
salaries were to determine if there were pay disparity between employees based
on seniority.  Defendant has also made
representations regarding Plaintiff’s compensation and the termination of two
other employees of similar seniority in its evidence in support of summary
judgment.  (Anderson Decl., Ex. N.)  Defendant’s relevance objection is, therefore,
overruled.
            Privacy.  Defendant also argues the information
requested invades the privacy of third parties. 
“In Hill, we established a framework for evaluating potential
invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must establish a
legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is
serious.  The party seeking information
may raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing
interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify
feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that
would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing
considerations.”  (Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 (citing Hill v. National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35).)
            “Whether
a legally recognized privacy interest is present in a given case is a question
of law to be decided by the court. 
Whether plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
circumstances and whether defendant's conduct constitutes a serious invasion of
privacy are mixed questions of law and fact. If the undisputed material facts
show no reasonable expectation of privacy or an insubstantial impact on privacy
interests, the question of invasion may be adjudicated as a matter of
law.”  (Hill, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p.
40.)
            “In
general, the court should not proceed to balancing unless a satisfactory
threshold showing is made. A defendant is entitled to prevail if it negates any
of the three required elements. A defendant can also prevail at the balancing
stage. An otherwise actionable invasion of privacy may be legally justified if
it substantively furthers one or more legitimate competing interests. (Hill,
supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 40.) 
Conversely, the invasion may be unjustified if the claimant can point to
“feasible and effective alternatives” with “a lesser impact on privacy
interests.”  (County of Los Angeles v.
Los Angeles County Employee Relations Com. (2013) 56 Cal.4th 905, 926.)
            There
is clearly a legally protected interest at stake in the financial information
of MSW III and MSW II employees whose salaries are the subject of these request,
and Plaintiff does not dispute such a legally protected interest exists.  
            Defendant
does not address at all whether (1) there is a reasonable expectation of
privacy under these circumstances; and (2) whether the threatened intrusion is
serious.  Regarding the seriousness of
the invasion, there is an existing protective order in this case that would
adequately protect the privacy interests of third parties with a designation of
“Attorney’s Eyes Only” and/or by omitting the names or personal information, except
for age, from the document production.
            Defendant’s
general reference to a pay scale in the Collective Bargaining Agreement is also
insufficiently responsive to these interrogatories.  Plaintiff is seeking salary information as to
each specific employee based on tenure.  Plaintiff
is entitled at the discovery stage to be provided information that may assist her
in determining whether Defendant adhered to the pay schedule in the Agreement.  
            Defendant’s
privacy objection is overruled.
            Defendant
fails to justify its objections and incomplete responses to these
interrogatories.  Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) Nos. 38-42 is
GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to serve
further responses within 20 days.  In
doing so, Defendant may exclude all personal identifying information except for
age.  Defendant’s responses shall also
bear all appropriate designations under the protective order  
            D.  Sanctions—GRANT
            Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,985
(3.5 hours @ $550/hour plus $60 filing fee) be awarded against Defendant and its
counsel.  As the prevailing party,
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions pursuant to section 2030.300, subd. (d).  Plaintiff’s requested sanctions are
reasonable.  
III.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP
(Set Three)
            A.  Legal Standard
            See Section I.A. above.
            B.  Meet and Confer, Timeliness, and Separate
Statement 
            Plaintiff
propounded RFP (Set Three) on Defendant on March 26, 2024.  The parties met and conferred from May 2,
2024 through June 3, 2024.  (Anderson Decl.,
¶¶ 10-16.)  The meet and confer efforts
yielded two sets of supplemental responses. 
(Id., ¶¶ 11,14.)  The meet
and confer efforts were sufficient.
            The
motion was filed less than 45 days from the last set of supplemental responses,
which were served on May 21, 2024.  The
motion as filed on June 7, 2024, along with a separate statement pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.
            C.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP
Nos. 100, 105, 107, 109-112 Is GRANTED and DENIED as to 106, 108, 113, 114.
            Plaintiff argues Defendant’s responses to RFP Nos.
100 and 105-114 (Set Three) are not code-compliant in the same manner as
Defendant’s responses to RFP Nos. 60-77, 79, and 81 (Set Two); the responses
imply Defendant will begin a search and will produce documents if any
responsive documents are located; sections 2031.220 through 2031.240 require Defendant
to conduct a diligent search prior to responding and to respond in compliance
with the requirements under that section; the responses do not clearly indicate
whether Defendant is complying in full or in part; Defendant fails to select
one of the options for its inability to produce responsive documents under section
2031.230; and the responses are technically deficient and leave her wondering
if Defendant has fully complied or is going to comply.
            Defendant
maintains its responses are code-compliant; Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts
were not in good faith; and Plaintiff met and conferred with the intent to
create disputes rather than resolve them.
            RFP
No. 100--GRANT.  Defendant did not serve
a timely response to this interrogatory due to oversight.  Defendant technically waived any objections
as a result.  (§2031.300, subd. (a).)  In its second supplemental responses, therefore,
Defendant improperly asserted objections. 
On that ground alone, providing further responses without objections is
warranted.  Moreover, Defendant’s
statement it would produce requisition forms does not fully respond to the
RFP.  Finally, even if Defendant’s
objections were legitimately asserted, Defendant was required to (1) “identify
with particularity any document, tangible thing . . . or electronically stored
information falling within any category of item in the demand to which an
objection is being made” and (2) include in the response “sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of   [ ] claim [of privilege], including if
necessary, a privilege log.”  (§2031.240,
subds. (b)(1), (c)(1).)  
            RFP
No. 105--GRANT.  Plaintiff
establishes good cause exists to compel further production because this RFP
directly relates to her allegation Defendant was terminating older, and more
expensive social workers to replace them with younger and less expensive ones.  Defendant also cited the Bates number of a
list of employments posts previously produced, but it did not produce the
actual employment posts  that were posted
from February 20, 2021 to March 9, 2022. 
 
            In
addition, the objections asserted in response to RFP No. 105 are
meritless.  Defendant fails to establish these
objections are legitimate.  Several of
them are patently inapplicable, including HIPAA, privacy, attorney-client, work
product, confidential information and business proprietary information.  The request seeks posts that were posted so
that all persons working for Defendant could view them, as well as the public
for those posts not filled internally.  
            Finally,
the response ambiguously states they were “subject to the objections” and “no
documents were withheld.”  If no
documents are being withheld based on objections, then the objections asserted
are superfluous and render the RFP vague. 
If documents are being withheld based on objections, then Defendant must
comply with section 2031.240, subdivision (b), as discussed above.
            RFP
Nos. 106, 108, 113, 114--DENY. Defendant’s second supplemental responses
to these RFPs comply with section 2031.230 which governs statements of
inability to comply.  The fact Defendant
states it is unable to comply because “no responsive documents ever existed or
are no longer in the possession, custody or control” of Defendant is
sufficient.  
            RFP
No. 107--GRANT.  Defendant only
provided one supplemental response to RFP No. 107 asserting “there are no
documents responsive to this request and no responsive documents have been
withheld.”  Defendant’s first
supplemental response fails to (1) “affirm that a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand”; (2) “specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party”; or (3) “set forth the name and address of any natural person or
organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” 
(§2031.230.)
            RFP
Nos. 109-112--GRANT.  Defendant’s
response to RFP 109 suffers from the same defects as its response to RFPs 100
and 105.  Defendant asserts objections
but then states that no documents are being withheld.  Defendant should clarify if any documents are
being withheld based on the objections asserted or if all responsive documents
are being produced and none are being withheld based on the objections.  If any documents are being withheld based on
objections, Defendant must provide the information required under section 2031.240,
subdivision (b).
            D.  Sanctions—DENY
            Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $2,370
(4.2 hrs. @ $550/hour).  Plaintiff did
not fully prevail.  Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions is denied. 
IV.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Three) (CRS 3409)
            A.  Legal Standard
            See Sec. II.A.
            B.  Meet and Confer, Timeliness and Separate
Statement
            Plaintiff
served Special Interrogatories (Set Three) on Defendant on March 26, 2024.  (Anderson Decl., ¶ 7.)  Defendant served objections on April 29,
2024.  (Id., ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendant
from May 2, 2024 through June 3, 2024.  (Id.,
at ¶¶ 9-15.)  Plaintiff’s meet and confer
efforts yielded two sets of supplemental responses. (Id., at ¶¶ 10,
13.)  
            Plaintiff
timely filed the motion on June 7, 2024, less than 45 days after the second
supplemental responses were served on May 21, 2024.  (Id., at ¶13.)  Plaintiff also served a separate statement pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345. 

            C.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Three) is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory Nos. 48-51
and DENIED as to Special Interrogatory Nos. 53-55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67,
69-73.
            Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 48-51, 53-55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67,
69-73.  Plaintiff argues (1) as to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 48-51, Defendant refuses to provide the last three
digits of the medical records numbers of all patients seen by Plaintiff on
October 14 and 15, 2021 and the time spent by Plaintiff for each encounter; (2)
as to Special Interrogatories 53-55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69-73, Defendant
refuses to provide the Bates numbers of those documents it maintains were responsive
to Plaintiff’s RFPs; and (3) as to Special Interrogatory No. 56, a contention
interrogatory, Defendant has refused to identify the provisions of the National
Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics (“Code of Ethics”) that Plaintiff
purportedly violated.  
            Defendant
maintains it fully responded to Special Interrogatories 48-51, providing
records including the last three digits of all patient medical records for
those patient records accessed on the relevant dates.  Defendant maintains it cannot respond to Special
Interrogatories 53-55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69-73, because they are so
poorly worded.  Defendant maintains it
has responded to Special Interrogatory No. 56 with a statement that it has
never maintained that Plaintiff violated the Code of Ethics.
            Special
Interrogatory Nos. 48-51--GRANT.  Defendant
identifies by Bates numbers those documents that contain the last three digits
of the medical record numbers of patients treated or served by Plaintiff on
October 14 and 15, 2021 and the statistical time entered by Plaintiff for her
treatment or service of the patient on those dates.  Defendant argues it is exercising its right
under section 2030.230 to respond by specifying the writings from which the
answer could be derived or ascertained.
            Defendant’s
response is patently deficient and it fails to establish its right to respond
pursuant to section 2030.230, which provides, “[i]f the answer to an
interrogatory would necessitate the preparation or the making of a compilation,
abstract, audit or summary of or from the documents of the party to whom the
interrogatory is direct, and if the burden or expense of preparing or making
it would be substantially the same for the party propounding the interrogatory
as for the responding party, it is sufficient answer to that interrogatory
to refer to this section and to specify the writings from which the answer may
be derived or ascertain.”  (Emphasis
added.) 
            Defendant
has made no showing concerning the burden or expense of preparing or making the
purported compilation, abstract or summary from the responsive documents .  The burden is clearly less on Defendant based
on the information provided.  At the very
least, Defendant has already identified the documents from which such
information could be obtained.  
            Defendant
also fails to establish the merits of objections.  The interrogatories are not vague or
ambiguous.  The privacy interests raised
by Defendant are also insufficient to excuse Defendant’s response.  Plaintiff is only asking for the last three
digits of the patients’ MRN and the amount of time entered by Plaintiff for
treatment or service of each patient. 
Any privacy concerns are further addressed by the protective order.  If anything, Defendant could redact the MRN
and replace it with a different identifier. 

            Special
Interrogatories 53-55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69-73--DENY.  In response to these interrogatories, Defendant
is asked to identify the Bates numbers of those documents produced in response
to specific RFPs.  Such information is
not grounds for a special interrogatory. 
To the extent Plaintiff cannot determine what documents Defendant has
produced in response to specific RFPs, that would be grounds for a motion to
compel further responses to the RFPs pursuant to section 2031.310 after the
parties have engaged in a proper meet and confer.  Plaintiff should not rely on interrogatories
to sort out previously produced documents. 

            Plaintiff’s
interrogatories also fail to clearly identify what specific RFP they were
referring to by number and set.  Defendant
also establishes that at least one interrogatory (Special Interrogatory No. 56)
misleadingly characterized the nature of the RFP in question.  (Defendant’s Opposition, 11.)  
            Finally,
these interrogatories are not full and complete in and of themselves.  The interrogatories require Defendant to
refer to the prior RFPs and its prior production.  The interrogatories therefore violate CCP
§2030.260(d), which states “[e]ach interrogatory shall be full and complete in
and of itself.”
            Special
Interrogatory No. 56--DENY.  In Special
Interrogatory No. 56, Plaintiff asks that Defendant “list all provisions of
NASW Code of Ethics, if any, YOU contend Plaintiff’s violated during the
last year of employment with YOU.”  Defendant’s
response is sufficient, and no further response is warranted.  Defendant states it never made any formal
determination that Plaintiff’s conduct violated the Code of Ethics, and it is
“aware that the plaintiff’s misconduct may have violated other ethical rules”
but “because there was no official finding made on behalf of [Defendant] to
this effect, [Defendant] declines to speculate or opine as to which provisions”
of the Code of Ethics “may have been violated.” 
(Defendant’s Response to Separate Statement, Special Interrogatory No.
56, Second Supplemental Response.)

(4.8 hours @ $550/hour plus $60 in filing fees).  Plaintiff did not fully prevail.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied.
