And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the prior ruling that granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiffs argue that the Second District's ruling in In Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ochoa, et al.) (2023) represents a change in the law that allows for reconsideration. The defendant opposes the motion, citing untimeliness and lack of jurisdiction. The judge agrees with the Ochoa line of cases as being better reasoned than Felisilda, but denies the motion because it is not a new or different set of facts or circumstances, and because the arbitration should be nearly completed.
