  Case Number:  23PSCV02265    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Maersk Agency USA, Inc.’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Maersk Agency USA, Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment is CONTINUED to a date to be determined at the OSC set in
Department G (Pomona).
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. Within the last four years, Plaintiff Maersk Agency
USA, Inc. (Maersk) entered into a Uniform Interchange and Facilities Access
Agreement (UIFAA) with Defendant Marck Anthony Gomez. Maersk alleges Gomez now owes
an outstanding balance of $29,730 for the interchange of shipping containers
and has failed to may payment upon demand.
On July
26, 2023, Maersk filed a complaint against Gomez and Does 1-100, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account, (3)
account stated, and (4) unjust enrichment. On September 1, Maersk’s process server
served Gomez with substitute service in West Covina.
On April
2, 2024, default was entered against Gomez and Maersk submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for April 11, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Maersk
seeks default judgment against Gomez in the total amount of $34,299.14,
including $29,730 in damages, $2,736.79 in interest, $1,281.90 in attorney
fees, and $550.45 in costs. The court finds Maersk has submitted sufficient
evidence to establish grounds for the entry of default judgment, but notes
Maersk’s declaration of nonmilitary status in the CIV-100 application is
deficient. While Maersk’s counsel checked the box stating Gomez is not eligible
to serve in the U.S. military because Gomez is a “business entity,” the court
notes this option is inapplicable as Maersk has filed the present action
against Gomez individually.
Accordingly,
the court will CONTINUE the hearing on Maersk’s default judgment application
and Maersk is directed to file an updated CIV-100 form that corrects this
deficiency.
