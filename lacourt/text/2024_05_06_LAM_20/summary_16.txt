And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is in response to a motion filed by Plaintiffs Erendira Serrano Rocha and Rafael Prieto Vargas to compel Defendant General Motors LLC to provide further responses to their requests for production. The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering General Motors to produce documents with generalized, compiled, or aggregate information, but not individual information about specific vehicles other than the subject vehicle. The Judge denies the request for production of information about individual vehicles, finding it to be overly broad. The Judge also orders General Motors to provide further responses within 30 days and encourages counsel to submit a notice. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Judge encourages counsel to appear remotely through LACourtConnect rather than in person.
