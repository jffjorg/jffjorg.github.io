And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in an unlawful detainer matter. The case involves a default judgment entered against Defendant Samantha Clark for $33,162.81. Clark seeks to set aside the default judgment under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b)-(d) and 473.5. Clark argues that the service of the summons and complaint was improper, citing a lack of actual notice. The Court finds Clark's testimony that she did not reside at the subject premises to be not credible, as she has not presented evidence of her actual residence at the time of service. The Court denies the Motion, citing the failure to attach a proposed responsive pleading and the lack of credible evidence of Clark's residency. The Court orders that counsel appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
