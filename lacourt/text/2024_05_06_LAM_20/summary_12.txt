The tentative ruling by the judge grants in part the motion to compel further responses from the defendants, S.P. Das Enterprises, LLC, Das Films, LLC, and Sriram Das. The plaintiff, Freedman + Taitelman, LLP, alleges that the defendants failed to tender $286,969.62 in outstanding attorneys' fees and seeks to compel further responses to their requests for production. The court grants the motion as to requests 1-11, 14-34, and 36-40, which seek information about the defendants' corporate organization, financial statements, and subsidiaries. However, the court denies the motion as to requests 13, which seeks all of the defendants' QuickBooks, and 35, which seeks asset information for subsidiaries, citing overbreadth. The court orders the defendants to provide further responses and production within 30 days.
