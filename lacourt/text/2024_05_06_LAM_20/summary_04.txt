And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses from the defendant City of Pasadena. The plaintiff, Gena Persons, seeks to compel further responses to her requests for production, specifically seeking documents from the employment personnel file of Commander Kelly Evans. The plaintiff alleges that she had PTSD and that Evans, her supervisor, did not care about her well-being. The plaintiff filled out workers compensation forms, but Evans refused to submit them, resulting in the claim being denied. The judge found that good cause has not been shown for the discovery sought, and therefore, the motion is denied.
