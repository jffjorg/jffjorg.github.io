Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Select Staffing's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Maria Cristina Soto. The dispute arose from a proposed settlement agreement between the parties, which Select Staffing claims was reneged on by Plaintiff. The judge finds that Select Staffing's draft agreement was a counteroffer, rather than a final agreement, and that Plaintiff's offer to dismiss Select Staffing with prejudice was valid. The judge also finds that Select Staffing's cancellation of the deposition was its own decision, rather than a result of Plaintiff's actions. Therefore, the judge does not find that sanctions are warranted.
