Weidong Zang’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Weidong Zang (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
On February 19, 2020,
Plaintiff and Defendant Freevolt USA, Inc. (“Defendant”) entered into a
contract wherein Defendant agreed to install a 25.5 KW solar photovoltaic
system (85 solar panels system) at Plaintiff’s property located at 14736 Valley
Blvd., La Puente, CA 91746 (“Project”) in exchange for payment. Defendant
guaranteed to complete the Project within 3 months, or would compensate
Plaintiff's electricity bills for any delays up to $2,000 per month. Plaintiff
followed Defendant’s directions and completed a loan application for $100,000
to cover the expenses of the Project (“Loan”), and paid Defendant $2,000 as a deposit.
The loan was later approved, and Defendant received $90,000 from proceeds of
the loan (the remaining $10,000 of the loan proceeds was on hold for the reason
of incompletion of the Project). Plaintiff made payments for the Loan from
April of 2020-present. Defendant never started the Project after entering into
the contract.
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-25
for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
On January 30, 2023, Defendant’s
default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment is set for February 28, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
On August 10, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s default
prove-up package filed May 8, 2023 without prejudice; at that time, the
court provided Plaintiff with a listing of noted defects requiring correction.
On November 6, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s default prove-up package
filed October 26, 2023; in doing so, the court provided Plaintiff with a
listing of noted defects requiring correction and expressly advised that
“Plaintiff is instructed to provide a full and complete default prove-up
application. The court will not entertain any piecemeal submissions.”
(Emphasis added).
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Judicial Council Form
CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment and a proposed judgment only. This
constitutes a piecemeal submission. Plaintiff is instructed to provide a full
and complete default prove-up application. (See Cal. Rules Ct. Rule
3.1800).
