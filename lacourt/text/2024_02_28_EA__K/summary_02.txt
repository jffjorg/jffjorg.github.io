And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The ruling notes several defects in the application, including the lack of receipts to support the claimed damage repair costs of $86,592.14 and the failure to provide a clear accounting of how a "portion" of the security deposit was previously applied to the defendant's account. The judge requests that the plaintiff provide a statement of account and clarifies the damages and security deposit issues before considering the application for default judgment again.
