And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff R.C. Henderson Trust, LLC's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The judge notes several defects in the application, including the need for Plaintiff to explain its relationship with Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC and to attach any assignment. The judge also questions the proposed judgment, which appears to seek judgment against Defendant Adam Selayandia for principal and interest. The judge requests that Plaintiff provide an interest calculation and identify the amount in Paragraph 2(c) of Judicial Council Form CIV-100 instead of Paragraph 2(b)(1). The judge also invites Plaintiff to brief the issue of declaratory relief or other relief with respect to Purchase Agreement No. 2, which is not yet due.
