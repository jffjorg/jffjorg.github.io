Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Property manager Sarah Francis (“Francis”) attests that
Plaintiff was required to spend $86,592.14 to repair damages to the subject
property beyond normal wear and tear after Defendants were evicted on March 23,
2023 and that the $113,128.88 security deposit was applied to the damage repair
costs. (Francis Decl., ¶¶ 6 and 7). Francis has not provided the court with any
receipts evidencing damage repair costs.
2.                 
Francis also attests that a “portion” of the security
deposit was “previously applied” to Defendants’ account. Francis fails to
identify what amount was applied to Defendants’ account and when. Plaintiff is
requested to provide the court with a statement of account.
