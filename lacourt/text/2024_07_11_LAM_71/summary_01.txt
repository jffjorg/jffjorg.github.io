Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns the demurrer filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles to the 4th cause of action in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Marcelus Laidler. The 4th cause of action alleges that the County and other Defendants violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and other laws by using excessive and unnecessary restraints on Plaintiff, motivated by racial animus. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a causal link between the discriminatory intent and the adverse action, and that the allegations are not uncertain or unclear. Therefore, the Judge overrules the Defendant's demurrer to the 4th cause of action.
