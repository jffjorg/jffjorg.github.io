And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation's (Wabtec) unopposed motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against International Service Center, Inc. (ISC) and Edwin Torres. Wabtec's motion is granted because it arises out of the same general facts as the operative complaint and cross-complaints presently on file, and no prejudice will result to the defendants by the granting of this motion. Wabtec intends to file a cross-complaint to protect its interests and make indemnification and apportionment claims against ISC and Torres, which arise out of the same transactions and occurrences as the case.
