And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Zadia Y. Egan's motion to continue the jury trial and discovery cut-off dates. Plaintiff sought a continuance to April 28, 2025 to mediate and settle the case, and then conduct a second global mediation if settlement is not obtained. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to provide specific reasons for the continuance and did not provide sufficient information about outstanding discovery. The judge also noted that the parties had stipulated to continue trial, but the motion was denied due to lack of good cause.
