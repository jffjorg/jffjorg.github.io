  Debtor Kaelyn Marie Hairston 



 
BACKGROUND
 
Following a jury trial, on
December 9, 2022, the Court entered judgment on a special verdict against
Defendant Kaelyn Marie Hairston. 
 
On May 23, 2024, Judgment Creditors Charisa Ware and Anita Brewer
(“Judgment Creditors”) served an Application and Order for Appearance and
Examination containing a Request for Production of Documents on Judgment Debtor
Kaelyn Marie Hairston (“Hairston”). (Brahman Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 1 of Exh. B.)
 
On July 23, 2024, a debtor
examination took place; Hairston appeared and was examined by Judgment
Creditors. The parties stipulated to continue the examination on August 13,
2024. (Min. Order, 7/23/24.) 
 
On August 13, 2024, Hairston failed to appear. 
 
Judgment Creditors now move for an order to (1) compel Hairston to disclose
information and produce documents; (2) to continue the debtor examination to
the stipulated date of October 24, 2024; and (3) to hold Hairston in contempt for
failing to appear on August 13, 2024. Judgment Creditors also seek monetary
sanctions. Hairston opposes and Judgment Creditors reply. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A judgment creditor may conduct discovery directly
against the judgment debtor by means of a judgment debtor examination (§
708.110), written interrogatories (§ 708.020), and requests for production of
documents (§ 708.030). Section 708.030, subdivision (a) provides: ‘The judgment
creditor may demand that any judgment debtor produce and permit the party
making the demand, or someone acting on that party's behalf, to inspect and to
copy a document that is in the possession, custody, or control of the party on
whom the demand is made in the manner provided in [the Civil Discovery Act], if
the demand requests information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment.
The judgment debtor shall respond and comply with the demand in the manner and
within the time provided by [the Civil Discovery Act].’” (SCC Acquisitions,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 741, 751-52.)
 
“Section 708.030, subdivision (a) is unambiguous. In
plain terms, it places but two limitations on the scope of requests for
production of documents. First, the document requested must be ‘in the
possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.’ [Citation.]
Second, the document requested must have ‘information to aid in enforcement of
the money judgment.’ [Citation.] If the document requested is ‘in the
possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made’ and
has ‘information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment,’ then the
document is subject to discovery under section 708.030, regardless whether the
document relates to the judgment debtor or to third parties.” (SCC
Acquisitions, Inc., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at 752.)
 
Section 708.030 also provides: “[i]nspection demands
served pursuant to this section may be enforced to the extent practicable, in
the same manner as inspection demands in a civil action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
708.030, subd. (c).) Therefore, if the judgment debtor fails to timely respond
or responds insufficiently, the judgment creditor may bring a motion to compel
or compel further under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300 and 2031.310.

 
DISCUSSION
 
            Judgment
Creditor asks the Court to order Hairston to provide testimony and produce the documents
requested. 
 
A.   
Compel Information and Documents
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party
fails to serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ.
Pro § 2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand
for inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that
the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
or party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).)  
 
Courts shall impose a monetary sanction against any party
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for inspection unless the party acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300 (c).)
 
Here, Judgment Creditors assert that Hairston failed to
provide any responses or objections to Judgment Creditors’ document requests at
the July 23, 2024 examination. In opposition, while Hairston asserts she
provided all relevant documents in her possession, there is no further evidence
(such as exhibits) that she served responses to the Requests for Production at
issue. Additionally, the transcript from the examination on July 23, 2024
indicates that Hairston brought no documents. (Brahman Decl., Exh. B, 7:27-8:3.)
Therefore, the motion to compel is granted. 
 
Judgment Creditors seek $2,468.91 in monetary sanctions
against Hairston based on a $600 hourly rate for three hours preparing the
motion, one hour preparing the reply, and $68.91 for the filing fee. (Brahman
Decl. ¶ 13.) Hairston has failed to set forth facts showing she acted with
substantial justification. However, the amount appears excessive given the type
of motion and nature of the reply. Therefore, the Court awards monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,868.91 (3 hours of attorney time, plus the filing
fee). 
 
As for compelling information from Hairston that she did
not disclose at the debtor’s examination, the Court notes that a further
examination will be held. 
 
B.   
Contempt 
 
Next, Judgment Creditors ask the
Court to hold Hairston in contempt for failure to appear on August 13, 2024. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1209(a)(5) provides
that disobedience of any order is a contempt of the authority of the court. 
 
The procedures
for contempt are quasi-criminal and require personal service on the refusing
party, regardless of whether they are represented by counsel. (Cedars-Sinai
Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1283,
1286-87.)¿ If the OSC re: Contempt is issued, it is normally served as a
summons would be, and then the citee is arraigned.¿ (Id. at 1286.)
“Although a contempt may arise, as here, in the context of a civil action, a
contempt proceeding is punitive and separate from the cause out of which it
arises [citation omitted], and it is for this reason that every "i"
must be dotted and every "t" crossed.”¿ (Cedars-Sinai, supra,
83 Cal.App.4th at 1286.) To initiate a contempt proceeding, the moving party
must show a failure to comply with a court order was willful. (See Chapman
v. Superior Court (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 194, 200-201 [finding of contempt
reversed where no evidence of willful disobedience to subpoena]; Van v.
Language Line Services, Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 73, 82 [“Punishment for
contempt ‘can only rest upon [a] clear, intentional violation of a specific,
narrowly drawn order. Specificity is an essential prerequisite of a contempt
citation.].)¿ 
 
Here, Judgment Creditors’ request
to hold Hairston in contempt is not procedurally proper. Accordingly, the
request is denied.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS in part Judgment Creditors’ motion.
 
Judgment Debtor Kaelyn Marie
Hairston shall provide verified
responses, without objections, to the Request for Production within 15 days.
Monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,868.91
are awarded against Kaelyn Marie Hairston and shall be due to counsel
for Judgment Creditors within 30 days of this order. 
 
The Court continues the Hearing on Application for Order for Appearance
and Examination for October 28,
2024 at 1:30 p.m. at Department 32
of the Spring Street Courthouse. Kaelyn Marie Hairston is ordered to appear
personally.
 
Moving party to provide proper notice, and file a proof of service of
such.[1]
