And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Michael Price's Counsel, Hesam Yazdanpanah, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The motion is unopposed, and the Counsel has filed the necessary forms and documents. The Counsel claims that there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communication, as Plaintiff has failed to respond to their phone calls and communications. The Judge finds this to be a valid reason for withdrawal, as per California Rules of Court and Professional Conduct. The Judge grants the motion and orders Counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
