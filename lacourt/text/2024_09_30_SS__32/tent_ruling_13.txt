[1] Although
Plaintiff contends that the discovery responses indicate that Gomez and
Choomngen should be contacted through defense counsel, the proper remedy for
these former employees is to follow up regarding the discovery requests for
contact information. Plaintiff does not provide a statutory basis for the Court
to compel Defendant to produce former employees, even if Defendant responded to
other discovery that they should be contacted through defense counsel.
