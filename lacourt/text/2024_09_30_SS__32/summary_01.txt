And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Judgment Creditors Charisa Ware and Anita Brewer to compel Kaelyn Marie Hairston (Defendant/Judgment Debtor) to disclose information and produce documents. The motion also seeks to continue the debtor examination to the stipulated date and hold Hairston in contempt for failing to appear on August 13, 2024.

The Judge grants the motion to compel, ordering Hairston to provide verified responses, without objections, to the Request for Production within 15 days. The Judge also awards monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,868.91 against Hairston and orders her to pay this amount to counsel for Judgment Creditors within 30 days.

The Judge continues the Hearing on Application for Order for Appearance and Examination for October 28, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. at Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Hairston is ordered to appear personally.

The Judge notes that the procedures for contempt are quasi-criminal and require personal service on the refusing party, and that the request to hold Hairston in contempt is not procedurally proper. Therefore, the request is denied.
