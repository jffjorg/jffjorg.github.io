And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Plaintiff Charron Reynolds against Defendant APRO LLC. The court has granted the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's employee, Jennifer Short, as she is a current employee and no objections were served.

However, the court has denied the motion to compel the depositions of Charlie Choomngen and Dorena Gomez, as they are no longer employed by Defendant and the court has no authority to compel the deposition of non-party witnesses.

The court has also denied the request for monetary sanctions against Defendant's counsel, as the evidence does not show that they advised the conduct claimed, but rather that they failed to appear or respond due to a calendaring error from the transfer of the case file.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer to discuss Defendant's previous efforts to contact Charlie Choomngen and Dorena Gomez, and to discuss how the parties should move forward with the depositions. The court's ruling is subject to modification based on further communication between the parties.
