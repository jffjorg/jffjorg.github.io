TENTATIVE RULING 
The Court

for approval of compromise of claim or action or
disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with a disability
without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s

BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury case involving a minor
at a public school. On December 6, 2022, Adrian Diaz (Claimant) and Ernesto
Diaz (Petitioner) filed this action against defendant Baldwin Park Unified
School District (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10. On June 26, 2023, Claimant[1] filed the operative First Amended Complaint,
alleging the sole cause of action for premises liability. 
On July 30, 2024, Claimant filed a petition for
minor’s compromise. The petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) 
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise
of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds
of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
DISCUSSION
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021)
The petition has been verified by Petitioner and
presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350, using
the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rule of Court Rule 7.950.) The
Court notes, however, that Petitioner did not check the box for guardian ad
litem. (See Petition, ¶ 1.) 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle his claims with Defendant in exchange for $65,000.00, $41,433.32 of which will go to
Claimant. If approved, $16,250.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $524.00 will
be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s attorneys,
$6,792.68 will paid for medical expenses, leaving a balance of $41,433.32 for
Claimant, to be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial
institutions in this state, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the
Court. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor. (Probate Code, §§ 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The Court has reviewed the
proposed settlement and finds the Petition does not disclose all necessary
information bearing upon the reasonableness of the settlement amount to
Claimant. The Court finds the calculation of medical expenses do not compute. The
only documentation of medical expenses provided shows a Medi-Cal lien of
$1,892.68, reduced from $2,523.57. (Petition, p. 11 of pdf.) This conflicts
with the $4,927.90 stated in Paragraph 12, subdivisions (a)(2) and (b)(4), of
the Petition. (See Petition, ¶ 12, subds. (a)(2), (b)(4).) It is also unclear
where the $3,320.08 comes from, as there is no documentation to support it.
(See Petition, ¶ 12, subd. (b)(2).) Does Claimant have both a private insurance
carrier and Medi-Cal. (See Petition, ¶ 12, subds. (b)(2), (b)(4).) It is
further unclear to the Court how the $4,900.00 in total medical expenses to be
paid or reimbursed from the proceeds was calculated. (See Petition, ¶ 12, subd.
(a)(4).) The $6,792.68 in total negotiated, contractual, or statutory
reductions appears to not be any reductions, but rather the combination of the
aforementioned $1,892.68 and $4,900.00 in expenses to be paid from the
settlement proceeds. (See Petition, ¶ 12, subd. (a)(3).) Further, Petitioner
did not fully complete section 12 as there are boxes left unchecked and missing
information. (See e.g. Petition, ¶ 12, subd. (b)(1), (2), (b)(2)(f)(ii)(B), (b)(4)(a).) 
Attorney's Fees 
The retained attorney's
information has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition, ¶
17, subd. (b).) The Petition does not attach a copy of the legal services
agreement for the underlying claim. (Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (a)(2).) Petitioner
needs to provide a copy of the applicable legal services agreement. 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking
to recover $16,250.00 in attorney's fees. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd (a).) The
Petition does not contain Attachment 13a from the attorney explaining the basis
for the request, including a discussion of the applicable factors listed in
Rule 7.955, subdivision (b), of the California Rules of Court. (Petition, ¶ 13,
subd. (a); see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (c).) Petitioner’s
counsel must provide a declaration per Rule 7.955, subdivision (c), of the
California Rules of Court. 
The Court notes that Petitioner’s
counsel’s fee appears to be 25%, which is otherwise proper. However, the above
mentioned defects need to be corrected before the Court approves this
attorney’s fees request. 
Costs 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking
to recover $524.00 in court filing fees. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (b).) The Court
finds this amount reasonable. 
Amount to Be Paid to Claimant 
The Petition provides conflicting
amounts of the net proceeds for Claimant. Paragraph 15 shows $41,957.32, while
paragraph 16, subdivision (f), shows $41,433.32. (See Petition, ¶¶ 15, 16,
subd. (f).) Paragraph 15 appears to omit the $524.00 in costs from the
calculation. This conflict needs to be corrected. 
Disposition of Balance of Proceeds 
Petitioner requests that the net
proceeds, $41,957.32, be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial
institutions in this state, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the
Court. (Petition, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(2).) The Petition does not include attachment
18b(2) for specifying the name, branch, and address of each depository. (See
Petition, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(2).) 
Court Appearance 
California Rule of Court 7.952
requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good
cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court finds that the
appearance of the Claimant is not required due to the nature of his minor
status. However, Petitioner must appear at the hearing. 
Prognosis 
Claimant has fully recovered from
the effects of his injuries. (Petition, ¶ 8.) 
Proposed Order MC-351 
Petitioner has not filed a
Proposed Order Form MC-351 for the Claimant. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1384, subd. (b); Id., rule 7.953.) 
Timeliness 
The Court further notes that the
Petition was filed on July 30, 2024, but was noticed for hearing on July 19,
2024. This is not proper. (See Probate Code, § 3505.) The Court also notes that
the Petition was served on July 18, 2024, (Petition, pp. 15-16 of pdf), which
the Court finds insufficient time, even if the Petition is uncontested. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the petition
without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES Claimant Adrian Diaz’s petition
for approval of compromise of claim or action or
disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with a disability
without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
