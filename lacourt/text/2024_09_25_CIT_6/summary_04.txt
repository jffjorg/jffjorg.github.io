And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by Scott Stevens, a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by Infobeans, Inc. against Grays Peak Capital GP LLC and others. The Judge finds that the Santa Fe Springs address where the summons was served is not Scott Stevens' usual place of business, and therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction over him. The Judge also finds that Infobeans, Inc. has failed to demonstrate sufficient contacts with California to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Scott Stevens. As a result, the Court grants the motion to quash service of summons and orders Scott Stevens to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days.
