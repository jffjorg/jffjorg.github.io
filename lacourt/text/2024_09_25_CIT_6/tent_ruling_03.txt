 Case Number:  23PSCV00209    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Welding Certification Center’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendants: Carlos Ramirez and Felipe DeJesus Ramirez Garcia COURT RULING           Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $13,631.85. The Court  directs Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed judgment for the Court’s review  and signature.           BACKGROUND           This is  a breach of contract action. On January 24, 2023, plaintiff Welding  Certification Center (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Carlos  Ramirez (Ramirez), Felipe DeJesus Ramirez Garcia (Garcia) (collectively,  Defendants) and Does 1 to 50, alleging one cause of action for breach of  written contract. On June 20, 2023, default was entered against Ramirez. On  October 26, 2023, default was entered against Garcia. On March 11, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment, which the Court later  denied without prejudice. On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff resubmitted the default  judgment package. On September 4, 2024, the Court posted a tentative ruling denying  the request without prejudice. On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff resubmitted  another default judgment package.           LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $13,660.21,  including $10,000.00 in damages, $2,333.33 in interest, $636.88 in costs, and  $690.00 in attorney fees. The Court finds Plaintiff has remedied the defects of  the prior default judgment applications, but finds that the prejudgment  interest calculation does not fully compute. Plaintiff calculates the default  date from May 6, 2022, (Londo Decl., ¶ 7), but the first payment due date for  the second contract was August 15, 2022, (Londo Decl., Ex. B, ¶ 4, subd. (a)).  Thus, by the very terms of the second contract, Defendants could not have  breached the second contract on May 6, 2022. The Court will instead award  prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,304.97, calculated as follows:Contract  1 - $1814.13 at 10% for the principal amount of $7,655.00 from May 6, 2022 to  September 17, 2024, 865 days.Contract  2 - $490.84 at 10% for the principal amount of $2,345.00 from August 15, 2022  to September 17, 2024, 764 days. The  Court also notes that the proposed judgment appears to have accidentally  inverted the amounts for the costs and attorney fees. (See Proposed Judgment, ¶  6, subds. (3)-(4). CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $13,631.85. The Court directs Plaintiff to submit a  revised proposed judgment for the Court’s review and signature.
