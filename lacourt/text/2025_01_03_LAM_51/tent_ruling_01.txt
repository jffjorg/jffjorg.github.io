Summary Judgment
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, courts must
apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings;
(2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and
(3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a
triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) 
 
“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make
a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” 
(Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a
cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements
of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).)  A moving defendant need not conclusively negate an element of
plaintiff’s cause of action.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.) 
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of action cannot be
established, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but
also that “the plaintiff cannot
reasonably obtain needed evidence.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at p. 854.)  It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point
out the absence of evidence.  (Gaggero
v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)  The defendant “must also
produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to
support his or her claim.”  (Ibid.)¿
The supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations,
admissions, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which
judicial notice may be taken.  (Aguilar,
25 Cal.4th at p. 855.) 
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (p)(2).)  The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,
but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”  (Ibid.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.”  (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
The court must “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party,” including “all inferences reasonably drawn
therefrom.”  (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal
USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037; Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
844-45.)  “On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider
what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw
from the evidence.  While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court
must bear in mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than
to determine issues.  [Citation.]  Only when the inferences are
indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.  If the
evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)  “Put another way, have defendants conclusively
negated a necessary element of the [plaintiff’s] case or demonstrated that
under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process
of trial?”  (Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 853, 860
[cleaned up].)  Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  [Citation.]  Nor may the trial court
grant summary judgment based on the court’s evaluation of credibility. 
[Citation.]”  (Id. at p. 840;
see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding
motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence
but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and
draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends the court should grant summary judgment
in their favor because Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of
limitations. Plaintiff argues that there are triable issues of material facts
concerning the timeliness of the Complaint pursuant to CCP § 337(b) because
there is a spreadsheet produced by Defendant indicating some expenses within
the limitations period.
 
The court finds that the statute of limitations on the
common counts action depends on whether CCP § 337 or CCP § 339 apply. 
According to CCP § 337, the statute of limitations for an action for an open
book account is four years and “begins to run from the date of the last
item.”  Alternatively, according to CCP § 339, in the absence of an open
book account, the statute of limitation is two years for an oral
agreement. 
 
To establish a cause of action for open book account, the
following elements must be satisfied: (1) plaintiff and defendant had financial
transactions, (2) plaintiff kept an account of the debits and credits involved
in the transactions, (3) defendant owes plaintiff money on the account, and (4)
the amount of money that the defendant owes the plaintiff.¿ (State Comp. Ins. Fund v. ReadyLink
Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal. App. 5th 422, 449; CACI 372.)¿ A book
account is “open” if a balance remains due on this account.¿ (Interstate Group Administrators, Inc. v.
Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 700, 708.)  “The law
does not prescribe any standard of bookkeeping practice which all must follow,
regardless of the nature of the business of which the record is kept. We think
it makes no difference whether the account is kept in one book or several so
long as they are permanent records, and constitute a system of bookkeeping as
distinguished from mere private memoranda.”  (Egan v. Bishop (1935) 8 Cal.App.2d 119, 122.) 
 
Here, Defendant did not meet their initial burden that
Plaintiff’s claim is time barred. Notably, Defendant attests that she did not
promise in writing or orally to repay Plaintiff. (Linehan Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.) This does
not support Defendant’s argument that the claims are time barred for two
reasons.[2]
First, it does not address any of the elements for an open book account.
Second, it is not evidence showing when Plaintiff’s claim began to run. The
court can deny Defendant’s motion without further analysis. 
 
Nonetheless, the court will briefly address Plaintiff’s
opposition as it provides more reasons why denial is appropriate. Critically,
Plaintiff produced an excel spreadsheet produced by Defendant in discovery that
indicates continuing payments up until July 31, 2016. (Chanduwadia Decl. ¶ 4,
Exhibit 1.) [Placeholder for Reply.] Accordingly, until this issue of fact is
resolved, the court cannot determine whether a two-year or four-year statute of
limitations applies to the Complaint.
 
Therefore, the court DENIES Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Judgment.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
