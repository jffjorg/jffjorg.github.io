STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On February 6, 2023, Plaintiff James F. Barger (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendant Burke Eiteljorg (Defendant). 
Defendant demurrered to the Complaint, which the court sustained with leave to
amend as to the first cause of action for Breach of Guaranty and overruled as
to the second cause of action for Fraud on July 27, 2023.  
 
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) On August 9,
2023. The FAC has two causes of action for: (1) Breach of Guaranty, and (2)
Fraud. 
 
The FAC alleges that, at Defendant’s request, Plaintiff
loaned $250,000 (the Loan) to an entity named Spring Mill Coal, LLC (Spring
Mill) in connection with a potential investment opportunity to acquire
ownership interests in another company, Central Utility Coal Co., Inc. (Central
Utility), which entity owned real property that could be used for profitable
coal production. The FAC alleges that Defendant memorialized the Loan in a
convertible promissory note. Defendant allegedly agreed to personally guaranty
the Loan (the Guaranty). Plaintiff alleges that the acquisition of Central
Utility did not happen, Defendant has not repaid the Loan since September 2012,
and Defendant has failed to honor the Guaranty. 
 
On September 25, 2023, Defendant Burke Eiteljorg filed a
Demurrer to the FAC which was SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
On November 2, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On November 15, 2024, Defendant’s Counsel (Counsel) filed
the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
On December 13, 2024, Counsel moved ex parte to advance the hearing on their Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel which the court GRANTED. Counsel gave notice of the ruling on December
17, 2024.
 
On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum
concerning Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.¿¿
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284,¿subd. (b).)¿ An attorney is permitted to withdraw
where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to
continue the representation.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)¿
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court¿(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e)).¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(d).)¿ The court may delay effective date of the order relieving counsel
until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been
filed with the court.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e).)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Counsel requests an Order relieving them as counsel for
Defendant because there has been a breakdown in communication. Plaintiff does
not oppose the motion but requests the court limit how long Defendant can
obtain new counsel due to the upcoming trial date. Defendant has not filed an
opposition.
 
Counsel has provided all the required documents under
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362. Counsel has also served Defendant with
this motion and the Notice of Ruling advancing the hearing date via U.S. Mail
and email.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel.  
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED effective upon proof of service of the
order granting the motion;
2.      The
court sets an Order to Show Cause re: Status of New Counsel for Defendant for
February 14, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
