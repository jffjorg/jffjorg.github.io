The court declines to review the untimely amended declaration.

The court can also deny the motion for non-compliant Separate Statement. (Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc.
(2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 875-876.) Here, Defendant’s Separate Statement
refers to the Complaint and to the Declaration of Ms. Linehan. Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement in response is no better. It refers to “Declaration of
Plaintiff.” The court declined to exercise this discretion because the “facts”
and “evidence” submitted by both parties was short.
