Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which sought to have the plaintiff's claims dismissed as time-barred. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, but the judge found that the defendant did not meet its initial burden of showing that the claims were time-barred. The judge noted that the defendant did not provide evidence showing when the plaintiff's claim began to run, and that the plaintiff produced an excel spreadsheet indicating continuing payments up until July 31, 2016. The judge concluded that there were triable issues of material fact and that the matter should proceed to trial.
