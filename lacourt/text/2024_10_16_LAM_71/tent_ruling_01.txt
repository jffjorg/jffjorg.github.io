S. Powers’, individually and as attorney-in-fact for Phyllis A. Powers and
Jonathan S. Powers Roth IRA (“Powers”) and Henry Kreuter’s (“Kreuter”)

LLC (“Next Day”) and Brett A. Varon (“Varon”) (collectively, “Next Day
Defendants”) demur to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause of action for negligence on the
basis it fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action against Next

Summary of Allegations
Plaintiffs allege in March 2018, Jon and Phyllis were
presented with an investment opportunity and loan servicing arrangement by
their broker and agent Suddarth and EWL. 
(See 5AC ¶17.)  Plaintiffs
allege the real property in this dispute are two vacant lots located at 3420
Dorothy Road, City of Calabasas, County of Los Angeles, California (“Calabasas
Property”) with Assessor’s Parcel Numbers 2080-015-033 and 2080-015-034 and a
legal description of: Lots 61 and 62 of Tract. No. 7094, as per map recorded in
book 92, pages 64 and 65 of maps, in the office of the county recorder of Los
Angeles County.  (5AC ¶3.)  
Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith, and Hightech were the agents
for their principal, Hedger.  (5AC
¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege Hedger, by and
through his agents Greg, Edith and Hightech falsely misrepresented Hedger’s
status as a creditworthy borrower (with sufficient security in the form of real
property) to Plaintiffs, by and through its agents EWL and Suddarth.  (5AC ¶17.) 

Plaintiffs allege in March 2018, Suddarth, the President
and authorized agent of EWL, advised and represented to Jon that he had
personally viewed the property and that the appraisal valuation was reasonably
accurate.  (5AC ¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege that however, the appraisal
valuation was not accurate and Suddarth’s representation was false.  (5AC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth advised, assured, and represented to Jon that
the security provided sufficient protection, that the loan was over-secured,
and that if the security were foreclosed, there would be sufficient sale
proceeds to pay off the secured loan, interest, and all other fees and costs
related to the loan and foreclosure.  (5AC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth’s representation was false.  (5AC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth assured and falsely represented to Jon that
the secured real property would easily sell for more than the loan amount.  (5AC ¶18.)
Plaintiffs allege the investment opportunity presented by
Suddarth and EWL to Jon and Phyllis provided that Jon and Phyllis would provide
money for a secured loan to Hedger, and act as servicer of the loan secured by
the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶19.)   Plaintiffs allege in reliance on the
representations made by EWL, Suddarth, Greg, Edith, Hightech, and Hedger, Jon
and Phyllis invested $168,000 for the lending arrangement.  (5AC ¶19.) 
Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith, and Hightech, agents for Hedger, falsely
misrepresented Hedger’s income and value of the real property security to
Plaintiffs by and through their agents. 
(5AC ¶19.)  Plaintiffs allege they
reasonably relied on the false misrepresentations by EWL, Suddarth, Greg,
Edith, Hightech, and Hedger.  (5AC
¶19.)  
          Plaintiffs
allege on January 22, 2019, EWL, by and through its authorized agent Suzie
Peach, contacted Plaintiffs, its principals, seeking additional funding to
refinance Hedger’s secured loan, as requested by Hedger’s agents, Edith, Greg,
and Hightechlending.  (5AC ¶20.)  Plaintiffs allege Jon rejected the refinance
demand.  (5AC ¶20.)  
Plaintiffs allege on March 8, 2019, EWL, by and through its
authorized agents Suzie Peach and Debbi Suddarth (Senior Vice President of
EWL), again contacted Plaintiffs regarding Hedger and his agents’ refinance
demand.  (5AC ¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege EWL made false
representations regarding the appraised value of the secured real property,
that Hedger was seeking to develop the Calabasas Property, and that Hedger
possessed a construction timeline.  (5AC
¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege EWL and its
agents failed to advise Plaintiffs that Hedger was at risk for default due to
his missed payments on the initial loan and that the refinanced loan opportunity
presented a greater risk than the initial loan due to the increased amount of
the loan and the fact that Hedger had missed payments.  (5AC ¶21.) 
Plaintiffs allege EWL, by and through its agents, knew that Plaintiffs had
rejected the initial refinance demand, and that additional false
misrepresentations, deception, and omissions were necessary to convince
Plaintiffs to agree to the refinance demand.  (5AC ¶21.) 
Plaintiffs allege a prudent fiduciary agent would have advised their
principal not to invest in this particular cash-out refinance loan due to the
increased risk of default and exposure to Plaintiffs as the opportunity was not
in the best interests of Plaintiffs.  (5AC ¶21.) 
Plaintiffs allege they reasonably relied on the false representations,
deception, and omissions of EWL and its agents, including but not limited to
Suzie Peach and Debbi Suddarth.  (5AC
¶21.)  
Plaintiffs allege they proceeded to invest an additional
$274,000.00, as part of a refinance loan arrangement presented by its agent,
EWL.  (5AC ¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith, and Hightech,
agents for their principal Hedger, misrepresented the creditworthiness and
income of Hedger, including the value of the real property security and the
fact that Hedger missed payments for the existing secured loan.  (5AC ¶21.) 

          Plaintiffs
allege Suddarth, EWL, Greg, Edith, Hightech, and Hedger misrepresented the loan
investment to Plaintiffs as an over-secured investment based on their purported
careful and diligent review and research of the borrower and secured real
property.  (5AC ¶22.)  Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL, Greg, Edith,
Hightech, and Hedger misrepresented that the loan to value ratio was forty
percent of the appraised value of $420,000 for the Calabasas Property and that
Hedger’s gross salary was $8,500 per month. 
(5AC ¶22.)  Plaintiffs allege Greg,
Edith, and Hightech owed Plaintiffs a duty of care because they clearly knew or
should have known that Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ agents would rely on the
inaccurate and misrepresented borrower information Greg, Edith, and Hightech
negligently prepared in making and funding the loans.  (5AC ¶22.) 
Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith, and Hightech owed a legal duty of care to
Plaintiffs.  (5AC ¶22.)  
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL, Greg, Edith, Hightech, and
Hedger failed to disclose and advise Plaintiffs that the property was purchased
for $75,000 in 2015, development of the Calabasas Property was not permitted,
that the development of the vacant lot had not been initiated, that the
permitting of the Calabasas Property could take two years or more, that the
lots did not have a sewer system and relied on a septic system thereby
materially impacting the value of the Calabasas Property, that Hedger had missed
payments on the original loan, and that Hedger was not properly and thoroughly
vetted, investigated, and evaluated for financial trustworthiness, viability,
credibility, and suitability.  (5AC ¶23.)
Plaintiffs allege Edith, who was an employer of Hightech
and spouse of Greg, knew Hedger was dealing with financial hardship and likely
lacked an ability to repay the loan as she had a friendship with Hedger.  (5AC ¶23.) 
Plaintiffs allege Edith failed to disclose Hedger’s financial hardship
when presenting and arranging the second loan with Plaintiffs’ agents EWL and Suddarth.
 (5AC ¶23.)  Plaintiffs allege the failure of Hightech’s
employee, Edith, to disclose the material information concerning Hedger’s financial
hardship and likely inability to repay the loan constituted a material
concealment and misrepresentation exposing Plaintiffs to undisclosed risk known
by Hightech, Edith, and Greg which was a substantial factor and cause of the
foreseeable harm suffered by Plaintiffs. 
(5AC ¶23.)
Plaintiffs allege EWL, as agents for Plaintiffs, hired two
licensed California real estate appraisers, AAMC Defendants in 2017 and Next Day
Defendants in 2019, who failed to carefully and diligently view and investigate
the Calabasas Property and provide accurate reports indicating that Calabasas
Property would utilize an above ground septic system and was not connected to a
sewer system.  (5AC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege AAMC Defendants and Next Day
Defendants owed a duty of care to EWL and Plaintiffs.  (5AC ¶24.) 
Plaintiffs allege the false and erroneous valuation of the Calabasas
Property by AAMC Defendants and Next Day Defendants materially impacted the
appraised valuation of the Calabasas Property causing an erroneous valuation of
$420,000 by AAMC Defendants and then $450,000 by Next Day Defendants when in
fact the appraised value should have been $100,000 market value of the lots
that provided security for the money loaned by Plaintiffs.  (5AC ¶24.) 
Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that AAMC Defendants and
Next Day Defendants failed to view the property in person, were not familiar
with the specific location of the property and utilized pictures from a
different property.  (5AC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege but for the failure of
Suddarth, EWL, AAMC Defendants, Next Day Defendants, Greg, Edith, and Hightech
to utilize due care and diligence regarding the valuation of the Calabasas
Property, an accurate and non-deceptive investment opportunity would have been
presented to Plaintiffs.  (5AC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege but for Gramlich’s and
Varon’s failure to perform a careful and diligent investigation and appraisal
of the Calabasas Property, Plaintiffs would have been aware of the actual market
value of the Calabasas Property.  (5AC
¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL, AAMC
Defendants, and Next Day Defendants knew Plaintiffs would reasonably rely on
the false information provided by Suddarth, EWL, AAMC Defendants, and Next Day
Defendants regarding the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶25.) 

Plaintiffs allege in January 2019, Next Day Defendants
created an appraisal report for the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶26.) 
Plaintiffs allege the appraisal report indicates Varon signed the
initial appraisal report on January 16, 2019, which appears to have been
prepared for a different lender in January 2019.  (5AC ¶26.) 
Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that in March 2019, EWL
requested Next Day Defendants complete an appraisal for the Calabasas Property.
 (5AC ¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege rather than complete a new
appraisal, Next Day Defendants reused the initial appraisal report from January
2019 with the only change in the report being the date of Varon’s signature
which was March 21, 2019.  (5AC
¶26.)  This appraisal report was then
provided to EWL and Plaintiffs.  (5AC
¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day
Defendants erroneously failed to change the name of the lender to EWL although
they did change the signature date.  (5AC
¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day
Defendants, by and through their counsel of record, sought and was granted
judicial notice of the appraisal report with the signature date of March 21,
2019, but failed to notify the Court that another version of that report
existed with a signature date of January 16, 2019. (5AC ¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants failed
to acknowledge that the recycled report with a signature date of March 21, 2019,
was indeed provided to EWL and/or Suddarth, but that Next Day Defendants erroneously
failed change the name of the lender that the report was created for.  (5AC ¶26.) 

 
1.    
Hightech’s Demurrer
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant Hightech’s 8/14/24
request for judicial notice of this Court’s 6/17/24 minute order is denied on
the basis this Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings on the
instant docket.
Defendant Hightech’s 8/14/24
request for judicial notice of its attorney’s correspondence with Plaintiffs’
counsel is denied on the basis Evidence Code §§452 and 453 do not allow for
judicial notice of such correspondence.
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a), emphasis added.)
The demurring party shall file
and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the following: (A)
The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an
agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party
who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and
confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in
good faith.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Hightech’s counsel declares that
on June 10, 2024, he attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel via
email.  (Decl. of Inlow ¶¶2-3.)  Moving Defendants’ counsel’s declaration
fails to state whether he attempted to meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference, and is therefore insufficient under
C.C.P. §430.41(a).  However, failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas
v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson
v. Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502,
515.)  Therefore, the Court will consider
Hightech’s demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Summary of Demurrer
Hightech demurs to the 2nd cause
of action in the 5AC on the basis the causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Hightech due to the holding
in Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 1239, and the cause of action is uncertain.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e),
(f).)
 
Failure to State a Cause of
Action
Negligence (2nd COA)
A cause of action for negligence
requires the following elements: (1) defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty;
(2) breached the duty; and (3) the breach caused (4) damages.  (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.)  A complaint which lacks allegations of fact to
show that a legal duty of care was owed is fatally defective.  (See Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950.)  The existence of a legal duty of care is
properly challenged by demurrer and is a question of law for the court.  (Hegyes v. Unjian Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103,
1111.)
Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith,
and Hightech owed Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ agents, EWL and Suddarth, a legal
duty of care pursuant to California Financing Law, as well as other statutes
and common law, because they knew or should have known that Plaintiffs would
reasonably rely on the inaccurate, unverified, and misrepresented information
that Defendants Greg, Edith, and Hightech presented regarding their principal,
Defendant Hedger.  (5AC ¶40.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants Greg,
Edith, and Hightech knew with substantial certainty that Plaintiffs would rely
to their detriment on the inaccurate, unverified, and misrepresented financial
information and documentation that Defendants Greg, Edith, and Hightech
prepared and disseminated. (5AC ¶40.) 
Plaintiffs allege Defendants Greg, Edith, and Hightech owed a duty of
care to Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ agents, EWL and Suddarth, and is therefore
liable for breaching the duty of care because they knew the transaction would
affect Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ agents, and they knew that the harm to
Plaintiffs was foreseeably connected to the production of inaccurate,
unverified, and misrepresented financial information and documentation.  (5AC ¶40.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants
EWL, Suddarth, Greg, Edith, and Hightech failed to exercise due care and
diligence in the vetting and investigation of Hedger regarding his suitability
as a borrower and risk as a borrower for investment purposes.  (5AC ¶41.) 
Plaintiffs allege they reasonably relied on the information provided by
Defendants EWL and Suddarth regarding the lending and investment opportunities.  (5AC ¶41.)
Plaintiffs allege they were
harmed by the negligence of EWL, Suddarth, Next Day Defendants, AAMC
Defendants, Greg, Edith, and Hightech. 
(5AC ¶42.)  Plaintiffs allege the
negligence of EWL, Suddarth, Next Day Defendants, AAMC Defendants, Greg, Edith,
and Hightech was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ harm, including
but not limited to monetary damages and losses to be determined by a jury at
trial.  (5AC ¶43.)
Plaintiffs fail to allege
Hightech owed a cognizable duty to Plaintiffs. 
Plaintiffs merely allege Hightech owes a duty under California Financing
Law and common law duties.  Plaintiffs
fail to allege Hightech was in privity with Plaintiffs, had a special
relationship with Plaintiffs, or had a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs. 
Accordingly, Hightech’s demurrer
to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause of action is sustained without leave to amend as to Hightech.
 
Conclusion
Hightech’s demurrer to the 2nd
cause of action in Plaintiffs’ 5AC is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.

in the Official Records of the Recorder’s Office of Los Angeles County, California,
in which the Grantors were Plaintiffs and Grantee was Malong Li (A-RJN, Exh.
10), is granted.
          Plaintiffs’
10/4/24 request for judicial notice of The Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers,
State of California, Decision and Order, BREA Case No. L20240710-01 dated
August 14, 2024 (PA-RJN, Exh 1), is granted.
 
Meet and Confer
AAMC Defendants’ counsel declares
that on July 29, 2024, he attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel
via email.  (Decl. of Miller ¶2.)  AAMC Defendants’ counsel’s declaration fails
to state whether he attempted to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference, and is therefore insufficient under C.C.P.
§430.41(a).  However, failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas
v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson
v. Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502,
515.)  Therefore, the Court will consider
AAMC Defendants’ demurrer.
 
Summary of Demurrer
AAMC Defendants demur to the 2nd
and 4th causes of action in the 5AC on the basis the causes of action fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against AAMC Defendants and
are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.  (Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), 339(1).)
 
Failure to State a Cause of
Action
          Negligence
and Negligent Misrepresentation (2nd and 4th COAs)
A cause of action for negligence
requires the following elements: (1) defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty;
(2) breached the duty; and (3) the breach caused (4) damages.  (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.)  A complaint which lacks allegations of fact to
show that a legal duty of care was owed is fatally defective.  (See Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950.)  The existence of a legal duty of care is
properly challenged by demurrer and is a question of law for the court.  (Hegyes v. Unjian Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103,
1111.)
“Negligent misrepresentation
requires an assertion of fact, falsity of that assertion, and the tortfeasor’s
lack of reasonable grounds for believing the assertion to be true. It also
requires the tortfeasor’s intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance by
the person to whom the false assertion of fact was made, and damages to that
person. An implied assertion of fact is ‘not enough’ to support liability.”  (SI 59 LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146, 154,
internal citation omitted.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, Next
Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants failed to exercise due care in the
investigation, viewing, and opining regarding the market value of the Calabasas
Property.  (5AC ¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants and AAMC
Defendants created and distributed an inaccurate and erroneous appraisal
report.  (5AC ¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege it was reasonably foreseeable
that the appraisal report would be reviewed and reasonably relied on by persons
and/or entities, such as Plaintiffs, with interest in the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶37.) 

Plaintiffs allege Next Day
Defendants and AAMC Defendants owed a duty as licensed real estate appraisers
to Plaintiffs as it was known that they would rely on the erroneous appraisal
reports.  (5AC ¶38.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants and AAMC
Defendants were required to exercise due care and diligence in performing real
property appraisal services as a similarly situated licensed real property
appraiser would exercise.  (5AC ¶38.)
Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants
and AAMC Defendants failed to act carefully and with due diligence in the
performance of their appraisal services by failing to investigate and appraise
the Calabasas Property carefully and diligently and to not distribute erroneous
appraisal reports.  (5AC ¶39.)  Plaintiffs allege they were harmed by the
negligence of Next Day Defendants and AAMC Defendants.  (5AC ¶39.) 
Plaintiffs allege the negligence of Next Day Defendants and AAMC Defendants
was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ harm.  (5AC ¶39.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants represented facts that were true
and/or concealed material facts concerning the lending transactions and/or
appraisal value of the secured real property. 
(5AC ¶52.)  Plaintiffs allege the
representations and/or concealment of Defendants Suddarth, EWL, Next Day
Defendants, and AAMC Defendants concerning the lending transactions and/or
appraisal value of the secured real property were false.  (5AC ¶53.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants knew or should have known the
representations were false and should have disclosed the material facts that
were true.  (5AC ¶54.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants made the representations and/or
concealments recklessly and without regard for the truth.  (5AC ¶55.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants intended for Plaintiffs to rely on the
representations or should have known that Plaintiffs would have relied on the
representations.  (5AC ¶56.)
          Plaintiffs allege they
reasonably relied on the representations and/or material omissions of Suddarth,
EWL, Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants. 
(5AC ¶57.)
          Plaintiffs
allege they were harmed by the misrepresentations and/or material omissions of
Suddarth, EWL, Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants.  (5AC ¶58.)
          Plaintiffs
allege their reliance on the representations and/or material omissions of
Suddarth, EWL, Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants was a substantial
factor in causing Plaintiffs’ harm.  (5AC
¶59.)
An appraiser designated by a
lender to value its borrower’s collateral for financing purposes generally owes
its duty of care to the lender, not to the borrower.  (Greenwald & Bank, Cal. Practice
Guide: Real Property Transactions, Ch. 6-L, 6:701.)  Indeed, “[w]hether the lender conducts the appraisal in house or hires
an outside appraiser, the considerations are the same. The appraisal ordered by
the lender is for its own protections and the borrower has [their] own means of
ascertaining the desirability of the property.”  (Willemsen v. Mitrosilis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
622, 629 [noting borrower should know lender’s appraisal is intended for lender’s
benefit, not to ensure success of borrower’s investment]; see also Tindell v. Murphy (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1253-1254, [stating lender’s appraiser had no duty of care
to borrowers for inaccurate property description as appraisal was intended to
support lender’s evaluation of collateral, not borrowers’ decision
whether to purchase property].)
Here, Plaintiffs allege it was
reasonably foreseeable that AAMC Defendants’ appraisal report would be reviewed
and reasonably relied on by persons and entities such as Plaintiffs with
interest in the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶37.) 
AAMC Defendants’ appraisal report was provided for Lender/Client AAMC,
not for Defendant Hedger, identified as the Borrower, and most importantly, not
for Plaintiffs.  (A-RJN, Exh. 1.)  Here, as in Willemsen, there is no indication that AAMC Defendants were
aware that Plaintiffs hoped to use the appraisal report at issue as an
investigational tool upon which to base their decision to approve or reject the
Calabasas Property when it was prepared for EWL.  (Willemsen, 230 Cal.App.4th at pg. 631.)

Further, the Loan Servicing Agreement
(“LSA”) creating the principal-agency relationship between Plaintiffs and EWL
was entered into on April 24, 2018 (e.g., after AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal).  (See A-RJN Exh. 2.) 
As such, EWL was not acting as Plaintiffs’ agent when EWL retained AAMC
for its 2017 Appraisal. Moreover, the LSA does not discuss the existence of any
agency relationship between Plaintiffs and EWL related to the decision to make
the loan or obtain AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal which allegedly induced Plaintiffs to
make the loan.  Therefore, because the
2017 Appraisal was made earlier in time than Plaintiffs’ LSA with EWL, AAMC
Defendants did not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care and made no representation to
Plaintiffs as a matter of law.  
Plaintiffs’ arguments in their
opposition based on Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370
and Soderberg v. McKinney (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1760 are
inapposite.  Unlike in Bily, here, Plaintiffs do not allege
that AAMC knew Plaintiffs were considering loaning money secured by the
property they appraised. AAMC’S 2017 Appraisal does not refer to or mention
Plaintiffs in any way and there is no allegation that Plaintiffs paid for
AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal or received a copy of it directly from AAMC.  Further, the 5AC contains no allegation that
AAMC knew Plaintiffs relied on AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal in investing money. AAMC
did not manifest the requisite intent to supply information for Plaintiffs’ use
in determining whether the Subject Property was suitable for investment for
them.  Rather, AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal
specifically limited its intended use to EWL. Thus, there was no “undertaking”
on AAMC’s part to guide Plaintiffs relative to their investment decision.  (See Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 414-415.)
Further, unlike in Soderberg, Plaintiffs do not allege that
AAMC issued its appraisal with such knowledge or intent found in Soderberg.
 (Soderberg v. McKinney (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1760, 1770.)  Rather, AAMC
knew and intended only that EWL would use AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal in determining
whether the Subject Property had sufficient value to serve as collateral.  (Willemsen, 230 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 629-632.)
Finally, Plaintiffs’ claims are
barred by the statute of limitations and after amending their complaint six
times, Plaintiffs cannot again amend to include allegations of delayed
discovery.  AAMC Defendants raised the
issue of statute of limitations in their demurrers to the SAC, 3AC, and
4AC.  Plaintiffs cannot now argue that
such bases were not raised on AAMC Defendants’ prior demurrers.  (Opposition, pg. 13.)
Causes of action for
professional negligence and negligent representation premised on a claim of
professional negligence are governed by C.C.P. §339(1)’s two-year statute of
limitations.  
Here, the Deed of Trust
(Recorder’s Instrument No. 20180427661) memorializing Plaintiffs’ $168,000 loan
to Hedger was recorded on May 2, 2018, in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s
Office.  (A-RJN, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiffs did not commence this action until
September 15, 2022, or more than four years after
AAMC’s 2017 Appraisal was prepared
and more than four years after Plaintiffs’ Deed of Trust on the 2018 loan was recorded.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ causes of action
against AAMC Defendants are barred by the two-year statute of limitations set
forth in C.C.P. §339.1(1).
Accordingly, AAMC Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd and 4th causes of action is sustained without leave to amend as to AAMC
Defendants.
 
Conclusion
AAMC Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ 5AC is sustained without leave to amend.

Next Day Defendants’ Demurrer
Request for Judicial Notice
Next Day Defendants’ 7/24/24
request for Judicial Notice of (1) Varon’s appraisal dated March 21, 2019 (N-RJN,
Exh. A); and (2) the Loan Servicing Agreement between Plaintiffs and EWL
(N-RJN, Exh. D) is granted.
Next Day Defendants’ 7/24/24
request for judicial notice of this Court’s 1/29/24 Ruling and 6/14/24
tentative ruling is denied, as this Court does not need to take judicial notice
of matters on the instant docket or tentative rulings.
Plaintiffs’ 10/1/24 request for
judicial notice of (1) Next Day’s appraisal dated January 11, 2019 (PN-RJN,
Exh. 1); and (2) The Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, State of California,
Final Order of Citation, BREA Case No. L20240612-01 dated July 19, 2024
(PN-RJN, Exh. 2), is granted.
 
Meet and Confer
Next Day Defendants’ counsel
declares that on July 16, 2024, he attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiffs’ counsel via email.  (Decl. of
Campo ¶2.)  Next Day Defendants’
counsel’s declaration fails to state whether he attempted to meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference, and is therefore insufficient
under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  However,
failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas
v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson
v. Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502,
515.)  Therefore, the Court will consider
Next Day Defendants’ demurrer.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Next Day Defendants demur to the
2nd and 4th causes of action in the 5AC on the basis the causes of action fail
to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against Moving
Defendants due to the holding in Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1239.  (Demurrer Next Day, pg. 3;
C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
Failure to State a Cause of Action
Negligence & Negligent Misrepresentation (2nd & 4th
COAs)
A cause of action for negligence
requires the following elements: (1) defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty;
(2) breached the duty; and (3) the breach caused (4) damages.  (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.)  A complaint which lacks allegations of fact to
show that a legal duty of care was owed is fatally defective.  (See Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950.)  The existence of a legal duty of care is
properly challenged by demurrer and is a question of law for the court.  (Hegyes v. Unjian Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103,
1111.)
“Negligent misrepresentation
requires an assertion of fact, falsity of that assertion, and the tortfeasor’s
lack of reasonable grounds for believing the assertion to be true. It also
requires the tortfeasor’s intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance by
the person to whom the false assertion of fact was made, and damages to that
person. An implied assertion of fact is ‘not enough’ to support liability.”  (SI 59 LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146, 154,
internal citation omitted.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, Next
Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants failed to exercise due care in the
investigation, viewing, and opining regarding the market value of the Calabasas
Property.  (5AC ¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants and AAMC
Defendants created and distributed an inaccurate and erroneous appraisal
report.  (5AC ¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege it was reasonably foreseeable
that the appraisal report would be reviewed and reasonably relied on by persons
and/or entities, such as Plaintiffs, with interest in the Calabasas Property.  (5AC ¶37.) 

Plaintiffs allege Next Day
Defendants and AAMC Defendants owed a duty as licensed real estate appraisers
to Plaintiffs as it was known that they would rely on the erroneous appraisal
reports.  (5AC ¶38.)  Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants and AAMC
Defendants were required to exercise due care and diligence in performing real
property appraisal services as a similarly situated licensed real property
appraiser would exercise.  (5AC ¶38.)
Plaintiffs allege Next Day Defendants
and AAMC Defendants failed to act carefully and with due diligence in the
performance of their appraisal services by failing to investigate and appraise
the Calabasas Property carefully and diligently and to not distribute erroneous
appraisal reports.  (5AC ¶39.)  Plaintiffs allege they were harmed by the
negligence of Next Day Defendants and AAMC Defendants.  (5AC ¶39.) 
Plaintiffs allege the negligence of Next Day Defendants and AAMC Defendants
was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ harm.  (5AC ¶39.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants represented facts that were true
and/or concealed material facts concerning the lending transactions and/or
appraisal value of the secured real property. 
(5AC ¶52.)  Plaintiffs allege the
representations and/or concealment of Defendants Suddarth, EWL, Next Day
Defendants, and AAMC Defendants concerning the lending transactions and/or
appraisal value of the secured real property were false.  (5AC ¶53.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants knew or should have known the
representations were false and should have disclosed the material facts that
were true.  (5AC ¶54.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants made the representations and/or
concealments recklessly and without regard for the truth.  (5AC ¶55.)
Plaintiffs allege Suddarth, EWL,
Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants intended for Plaintiffs to rely on the
representations or should have known that Plaintiffs would have relied on the
representations.  (5AC ¶56.)
          Plaintiffs allege they
reasonably relied on the representations and/or material omissions of Suddarth,
EWL, Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants. 
(5AC ¶57.)
          Plaintiffs
allege they were harmed by the misrepresentations and/or material omissions of
Suddarth, EWL, Next Day Defendants, and AAMC Defendants.  (5AC ¶58.)
Plaintiffs again fail to allege who
distributed the appraisal report to whom and who had knowledge of the
distribution.  (See 4AC ¶¶37-38.)
An appraiser designated by a
lender to value its borrower’s collateral for financing purposes generally owes
its duty of care to the lender, not to the borrower.  (Greenwald & Bank, Cal. Practice
Guide: Real Property Transactions, Ch. 6-L, 6:701.)  Indeed, “[w]hether the lender conducts the appraisal in house or hires
an outside appraiser, the considerations are the same. The appraisal ordered by
the lender is for its own protections and the borrower has [their] own means of
ascertaining the desirability of the property.”  (Willemsen v. Mitrosilis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
622, 629 [noting borrower should know lender’s appraisal is intended for lender’s
benefit, not to ensure success of borrower’s investment]; see also Tindell v. Murphy (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1253-1254, [stating lender’s appraiser had no duty of care
to borrowers for inaccurate property description as appraisal was intended to
support lender’s evaluation of collateral, not borrowers’ decision
whether to purchase property].)
Here, Plaintiffs allege it was
reasonably foreseeable that Moving Defendants’ appraisal report would be
reviewed and reasonably relied on by persons and entities such as Plaintiffs
with interest in the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (4AC ¶37.) 
Moving Defendants’ appraisal report was provided for EWL, not for
Defendant Hedger, identified as the Borrower, and most importantly, not for
Plaintiffs.  (N-RJN, Exh. A.)  Here, as in Willemsen, there is no indication that Next Day Defendants
were aware that Plaintiffs hoped to use the appraisal report at issue as an
investigational tool upon which to base their decision to approve or reject the
Calabasas Property when it was prepared for EWL.  (Willemsen, 230 Cal.App.4th at pg. 631.)  Unlike in Soderberg v. McKinney (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1760,
where an appraiser knew that a particular group or class of persons to
which plaintiffs belonged—potential investors contacted by a broker—would rely
on his report in the course of a specific type of transaction he
contemplated—investing in a deed of trust secured by the appraised property, Next
Day Defendants’ appraisal report was prepared for EWL, not for Plaintiffs.  (Tindell, 22 Cal.App.5th at pg. 1254.)  
The applicable contract between
Plaintiffs and EWL, the LSA, indicates that the principal-agent relationship
began only after the original 2018 loan was in place and as to specified
activities set forth in section 1.0, entitled Scope: “Lender retains Broker as
Lender’s agent to employ reasonable and prudent practices to collect all
scheduled payments on the Loan identified above (the “Loan”), including the
protection of the security for the Loan.” 
(N-RJN, Exh. D.)
The LSA never discusses the
existence of any agency relative to the decision to invest or loan additional
funds and retain the appraiser or obtain the appraisal which allegedly induced Plaintiffs
to enter into the further loan. 
Plaintiffs do not allege that
they retained Next Day Defendants and do not deny that the Appraisal was
prepared for, and solely given to, EWL.  (5AC ¶26.)  Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot allege Next Day
Defendants owed them a legal duty and that Next Day Defendants made any
representation to or concealed information from Plaintiffs.
Accordingly, Next Day
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd and 4th causes of action is sustained without leave to amend as to Next Day
and Varon.
 
Conclusion
Next Day Defendants’ demurrer to
2nd and 4th causes of action in Plaintiffs’ 4AC is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
