And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the judge regarding the motions to quash service of summons filed by the defendants, IMI Fabi, LLC and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC. The plaintiffs, Jenifer Mager and John Mandracchia, allege that the defendants supplied asbestos-containing talc to manufacturers of products, which caused Mager to develop mesothelioma. The judge states that the plaintiffs must provide specific evidence to support their claims, and that simply alleging facts is not enough.

The judge reviews the laws and case citations regarding personal jurisdiction and finds that the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction over the defendants. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' claims are vague and conclusory, and that they have failed to demonstrate a connection between the defendants' activities in California and the litigation.

Based on these findings, the judge grants the motions to quash and dismisses the complaint against the defendants without prejudice, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (h).
