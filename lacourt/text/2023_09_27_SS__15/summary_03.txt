And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the judge regarding the motions to quash service of summons filed by the defendants, IMI Fabi, LLC and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC. The plaintiffs, Jenifer Mager and John Mandracchia, allege that the defendants supplied asbestos-containing talc to manufacturers of products, which caused Mager to develop mesothelioma. The judge states that the plaintiffs must provide specific evidence to support their claims, and that simply alleging facts is not enough.

The judge reviews the laws and case citations regarding personal jurisdiction and finds that the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction over the defendants. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' claims are vague and conclusory, and that they have failed to demonstrate a connection between the defendants' activities in California and the litigation.

Based on these findings, the judge grants the motions to quash and dismisses the complaint against the defendants without prejudice, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (h).

## English Summary 

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding two defendants, IMI Fabi, LLC and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC, who are accused of supplying asbestos-containing talc used in various personal care products. The ruling primarily focuses on the issue of personal jurisdiction, which means whether the court has the authority to hear the case against these defendants. 

The judge determined that the plaintiffs, Jenifer Mager and John Mandracchia, failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the defendants have sufficient connections to California to warrant the court's jurisdiction over them. The plaintiffs' arguments relied heavily on allegations in their complaint and did not present concrete evidence of sales or activities by the defendants in California related to the products in question.

Therefore, the judge granted the defendants' motions to quash service of summons and dismissed the case against them without prejudice. This means the plaintiffs can potentially refile the case if they can provide stronger evidence of jurisdiction.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that discovery is likely to lead to the production of evidence of facts establishing jurisdiction. Therefore, the motion to quash is granted and the complaint is dismissed.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions to quash service of summons filed by Defendants IMI Fabi, LLC and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC. The Plaintiffs, Jenifer Mager and John Mandracchia, had alleged that Jenifer Mager developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in products from various companies, including Clubman, Jean Nate, Mennen, Clinique, and Johnson & Johnson. The Plaintiffs claimed that the Defendants supplied the talc for these products. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish personal jurisdiction over the Defendants. The Judge noted that the Plaintiffs relied on allegations in their complaint rather than providing specific evidentiary facts to support their claims. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' request for broad discovery was not justified, as they failed to demonstrate that discovery was likely to produce evidence of California contacts sufficient for personal jurisdiction. As a result, the Judge granted the motions to quash and dismissed the complaint against the Defendants without prejudice.

The Judge's tentative ruling is granting the motion to quash service of summons by Defendants IMI Fabi, LLC and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendants. The Plaintiffs' reliance on allegations and vague assertions of ultimate facts is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. The Defendants' contacts with California are not systematic or continuous enough to render them essentially at home in the forum State. The Plaintiffs' jurisdictional discovery request is denied due to lack of offer of proof of the existence of additional relevant jurisdictional evidence.
