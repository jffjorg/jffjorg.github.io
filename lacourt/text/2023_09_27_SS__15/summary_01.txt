The plaintiffs, Ronald Carpenter and Patricia Carpenter, filed a motion to compel Paccar Inc. to produce further responses to a request for production of documents and for sanctions. The motion was denied because the plaintiffs did not make the required showing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, and their notice of motion did not specify the type of sanction sought. Additionally, the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient facts to support the amount of sanctions they are seeking. The judge ruled that monetary sanctions are limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses caused by discovery abuse, as stated in Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020).
