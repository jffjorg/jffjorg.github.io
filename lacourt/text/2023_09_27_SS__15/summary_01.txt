And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel further responses from Paccar Inc. and seeking sanctions. The motion was filed by Ronald Carpenter and Patricia Carpenter, who are seeking further discovery after the discovery cutoff date has passed. However, they failed to mention Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 and did not make the required showing. Additionally, they did not specify the type of sanction sought and did not provide sufficient facts to support the amount of sanctions. The Judge has ruled that monetary sanctions are limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses caused by the discovery abuse, and as the motion does not meet these requirements, it is denied.
