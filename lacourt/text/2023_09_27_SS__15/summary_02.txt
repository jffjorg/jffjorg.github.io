And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Familian Corp.'s motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims that Eugene Montano was exposed to asbestos-containing products from Familian Corp. and to limit the damages to compensatory damages only.

The court has denied Familian Corp.'s motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact regarding Montano's exposure to asbestos-containing products. The court has also denied Familian Corp.'s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to present admissible evidence to support their claims of malice, fraud, or oppression.

The court has granted Familian Corp.'s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to present evidence that meets the higher standard of proof required for punitive damages. The court has also sustained Familian Corp.'s objections to certain deposition transcripts and exhibits submitted by the plaintiffs.
