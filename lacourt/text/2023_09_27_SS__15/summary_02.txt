And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Familian Corp.'s motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims that Eugene Montano was exposed to asbestos-containing products from Familian Corp. and to limit the damages to compensatory damages only.

The court has denied Familian Corp.'s motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact regarding Montano's exposure to asbestos-containing products. The court has also denied Familian Corp.'s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to present admissible evidence to support their claims of malice, fraud, or oppression.

The court has granted Familian Corp.'s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to present evidence that meets the higher standard of proof required for punitive damages. The court has also sustained Familian Corp.'s objections to certain deposition transcripts and exhibits submitted by the plaintiffs.

**Significant Statements:**

* "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff’s factually devoid discovery responses."
* "Although the clear and convincing evidentiary standard is a stringent one, ‘it does not impose on a plaintiff the obligation to “prove” a case for punitive damages at summary judgment [or summary adjudication.’  Even so, ‘where the plaintiff’s ultimate burden of proof will be by clear and convincing evidence, the higher standard of proof must be taken into account in ruling on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, since if a plaintiff is to prevail on a claim for punitive damages, it will be necessary that the evidence presented meet the higher evidentiary standard.’"

 

**English Text Summary:**

The Judge is considering a motion by Familian Corp. to be dismissed from a lawsuit filed by Eugene Montano, who alleges exposure to asbestos-containing products from Familian Corp. The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented by both sides.

The Judge finds that Montano has not provided sufficiently specific evidence to meet the burden of proof at this stage in the case, therefore Familian Corp.'s motion for summary judgment on the main claims is denied. However, regarding the claim for punitive damages, the Judge finds that Montano has not presented enough clear and convincing evidence to support his allegations that Familian Corp. acted with malice, fraud, or oppression. Therefore, the Judge grants Familian Corp.'s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages.

significant\_statements:
- "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff’s cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence."
- "A plaintiff’s deposition testimony that the plaintiff has no knowledge of any exposure to the defendant’s products may be sufficient to shift the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact."
- "Summary judgment or summary adjudication ‘ “ ‘on the issue of punitive damages is proper’ only ‘when no reasonable jury could find the plaintiff’s evidence to be clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or oppression.’ ” ’"
- "‘[I]ntentionally marketing a defective product knowing that it might cause injury and death is ‘highly reprehensible.’[Citation.]”"
- "Plaintiff failed to identify the specific evidence supporting their general allegations, the response is factually-devoid, and Defendant shifted the burden."

This tentative ruling denies the motion for summary judgment and grants the motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages. The ruling finds that Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that Defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, nor did they show that Defendant knew about the hazards of asbestos products at the time of Montano’s exposure. Additionally, the ruling sustains Defendant's objections to certain deposition transcripts from other cases and finds that Plaintiffs' response to an interrogatory asking for all facts supporting the claim for punitive damages is factually-devoid.
