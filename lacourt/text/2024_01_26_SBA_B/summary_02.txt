And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel General Motors, LLC to produce a person most qualified for deposition. The motion was filed by plaintiffs Renee Khang and Richard Khang, who served a notice of deposition on General Motors on May 26, 2023. General Motors served objections, but agreed to produce a witness at a mutually agreeable time and place. The judge found that the deposition notice was properly noticed and that General Motors failed to demonstrate good cause for objecting to the categories of deposition notice. The judge also noted that there is overlap between the categories requested in this motion and the previous motion to compel further documents, which was granted. As a result, the motion is granted, and General Motors is ordered to produce its PMQ(s) within 20 days on a mutually agreeable date and time.
