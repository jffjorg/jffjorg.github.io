The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel responses to discovery requests and demands for production of documents filed by defendants Paul Carpenter, Estate of Mary Pollock, deceased, and Atlee Pollock against plaintiffs Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel. The defendants are seeking to compel the plaintiffs to respond to their initial form and special interrogatories and demand for inspection and production of documents and things. The court finds that the discovery requests were properly served and that the plaintiffs failed to serve responses, and therefore grants the motions. The court also orders the plaintiffs to pay sanctions in the amount of $380 each.
