And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant, Nissan North America, Inc., had argued that it could enforce an arbitration agreement in a Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) between the plaintiff, Liliana Ramirez, and a non-party dealership, Carson Nissan. The court found that Nissan was not an intended third-party beneficiary to the RISC and lacked standing to enforce the arbitration agreement.

The court also rejected Nissan's arguments under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, finding that the warranty was not intertwined with the sales contract and that the plaintiff's claims against Nissan were not dependent on the obligations imposed by the sales contract.

The court followed recent Second District court of appeal cases, Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co., which rejected the manufacturer's positions on equitable estoppel, third-party beneficiary, and agency theories.

The court ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
