  Case Number:  20STCV13190    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Hooman Nissani’s Motion to Compel
Deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable of Plaintiff American Honda Finance
Corporation
Defendant Hooman Nissani moves to compel the deposition of
plaintiff American Honda Finance Corporation’s person most knowledgeable.  One
may move to compel the deposition of a party and move for production of
requested documents when that party fails to appear at deposition or produce
the requested documents “without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).)  
The motion is procedurally defective for two reasons.
First, Nissani did not include a separate statement or
otherwise make any argument in support of overruling plaintiff’s objections.  “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement.”  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a).)  This motion
involves the content of plaintiff’s responses to the notice of deposition.  Plaintiff served timely objections to
Nissani’s notice of deposition.  (McCreary
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  Granting this motion
requires determining whether that constituted “a valid objection under Section
2025.410.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).)  This motion therefore required a separate
statement stating and addressing plaintiff’s objections.
Second, the deadline to hear discovery motions has
passed.  “Except as otherwise provided in
this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete
discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action.”  (CCP §
2024.020(a).)  “Except as provided in
Section 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial date does not
operate to reopen discovery proceedings.” 
(Id., subd. (b).)  
On September 6, 2023, the court continued the trial from
September 20, 2023, to February 21, 2024. 
On December 8, 2023, the court further continued the trial to May 29,
2024.  The court’s orders did not
continue any discovery deadlines and did not reopen discovery.  At latest, the deadline to hear discovery
motions was 15 days before the prior trial date of September 20, 2023.  Defendant’s motion is untimely.  
Disposition
            Defendant Hooman
Nissani’s motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff’s person most
knowledgeable is denied.
