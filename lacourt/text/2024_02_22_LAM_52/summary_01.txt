And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable at the Plaintiff, American Honda Finance Corporation. The motion is procedurally defective for two reasons. Firstly, the Defendant failed to include a separate statement or argument in support of overruling the Plaintiff's objections. Secondly, the deadline to hear discovery motions has passed. The Judge has denied the motion, stating that it is untimely and that the Defendant failed to comply with the procedural requirements.
