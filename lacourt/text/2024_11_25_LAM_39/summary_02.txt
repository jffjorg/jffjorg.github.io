And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV13023, regarding a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by the Defendant, Van Nuys-L, Inc. The Plaintiff, Kenneth Oleesky, opposes the motion.

The Defendant seeks to compel the Plaintiff to provide further responses to special interrogatories and requests for admissions, which the Plaintiff has failed to adequately respond to. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's objections to certain special interrogatories are unfounded, and that the information sought is relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's failure to provide adequate discovery responses is an abuse of the discovery process, and awards sanctions against the Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $2,850. The Plaintiff and his counsel are ordered to pay the sanctions to the Defendant within 30 days of notice of this ruling.

The Court orders the Plaintiff to provide further discovery responses to the Defendant, and notes that the Defendant is entitled to discovery on any matter that appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
