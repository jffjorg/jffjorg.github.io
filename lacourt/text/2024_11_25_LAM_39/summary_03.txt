And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant) to the third cause of action in the first amended complaint filed by Steve Martinez and Martin Martinez Lopez (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs brought a claim under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that the Defendant failed to provide sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period of a Honda CR-V vehicle purchased by the Plaintiffs. The judge ruled that the Plaintiffs' allegations suffice for pleading purposes and that the level of specificity required by the Defendant is not warranted at this stage of the litigation. The judge overruled the Defendant's demurrer and ordered the Defendant to answer the complaint within 20 days, with notice to be provided and proof of service to be filed.
