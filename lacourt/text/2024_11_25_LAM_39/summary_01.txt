And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to reopen fact discovery filed by the defendants, Philip K. Anthony, Michael Cobo, Nicole Khoshnoud, Deepwater, Inc., and HM&R, LLC. The motion was opposed by the plaintiff, U.S. Legal Support, Inc. The defendants sought to reopen discovery to propound written discovery on the plaintiff. The judge found that the defendants' declaration failed to show diligence in seeking discovery prior to the cutoff date, and that the plaintiff's discovery was irrelevant to the issue of diligence. The judge also noted that the defendants had ample opportunity to conduct discovery prior to the cutoff date, including after learning of new information in March 2024. As a result, the judge denied the motion as being without evidentiary support.
