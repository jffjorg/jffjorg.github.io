MOTION
Plaintiffs Steve
Martinez and Martin Martinez Lopez (“Plaintiffs”) sued Defendant American Honda
Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.  Defendant demurs to the third cause
of action in Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint.  Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer.  
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
Plaintiffs’ third
cause of action is brought under Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3),
which provides, “Every manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and
for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall: [¶] Make
available to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service
literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty
period.”  In support of this claim,
Plaintiffs allege they purchased a Honda CR-V vehicle from Defendant, which
included a written warranty (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 9, 10), and “Defendant
failed to make available to its authorized service and repair facilities
sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during
the express warranty period” (id., ¶ 34).  Plaintiffs’ allegations suffice for pleading
purposes.  
The level of
specificity for which Defendants appear to argue is not warranted at this stage
of the litigation.  Defendant will have the opportunity to obtain
further information regarding Plaintiffs’ claim though discovery.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s
demurrer is overruled.  Defendant is to
answer the complaint within 20 days.  
Defendant is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
