Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses

Plaintiff Kenneth Oleesky



 
MOTION
Defendant Van
Nuys-L, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel Plaintiff Kenneth Oleesky
(“Plaintiff”) to further respond to Special Interrogatories, set three (“SROG”)
and Requests for Admissions, set three (“RFA”). 
Plaintiff opposes the motions.
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories or requests for admissions unsatisfactory,
the propounding party may move to compel further responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
2033.290.) 
In response to
Defendant’s SROG at issue, Plaintiff asserted objections.  As Defendant timely filed this motion to
compel further responses, Plaintiff has the burden to justify his objections.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
In SROG Nos. 36,
37, and 38, Defendant seeks information about payments Plaintiff received from
the Employment Development Department (EDD).  Plaintiff objects such
information is privileged.  Plaintiff is
incorrect.  Information about Plaintiff’s
submissions to the Employment Development Department is not discoverable. 
(Richards v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968) 258
Cal.App.2d 635, 638-639.)  However,
information about payments Plaintiff received does not fall within the
privilege.  Plaintiff must respond to
SROG Nos. 36, 37, and 38.  In SROG No.
39, Defendant asks Plaintiff about the information Plaintiff submitted to the EDD.  That information is privileged.  Plaintiff need not further respond to SROG
No. 39.
In SROG Nos. 44,
45, 46, Defendant asks Plaintiff about any applicable disability insurance
policies Plaintiff has.  Plaintiff cites
no applicable privilege that would justify Plaintiff’s complete failure to
respond to these requests.  Instead,
Plaintiff argues the information Defendant seeks is irrelevant.  A party may obtain discovery on any matter
that “appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence . . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.010.)  This rule is “applied
liberally in favor of discovery . . . , and (contrary to popular belief),
fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases.” (Gonzalez v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546, emphasis deleted.)  Plaintiff must respond.
In SROG No. 52,
Defendant asks, “Please state at what point (i.e. 12 months, 24 months) YOUR
leave of absence provided by DEFENDANT would have become indefinite?”  (See Separate Statement in Support of
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Set Three, p. 22.) 
Plaintiff fails to justify his objections to the SROG.  The SROG is not so
ambiguous as to be unintelligible.  (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783, superseded by statute on
another ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154
Cal.App.3d 438, 444.)  Plaintiff contends
responding to SROG No. 52 would require Plaintiff to reveal attorney work
product.  The party resisting the
discovery based on absolute work product protection must make a preliminary
showing disclosure would reveal Defendant’s counsel’s “impressions,
conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2018.030, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff fails
to do so.  Plaintiff must respond to SROG
No. 52.
Defendant moves to
compel further responses to RFA Nos. 39, 40, 41, and 42, which ask Plaintiff to
admit facts pertaining to his claim with the EDD.  Plaintiff asserted only objections to the RFA.  Plaintiff must provide an answer that is “as
complete and straightforward” as possible, and must “[a]dmit so much of the
matter involved in the request as is true . . . or as reasonably and clearly
qualified by” Plaintiff.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.220, subds. (a), (b)(1).)   Plaintiff’s objections do not warrant Plaintiff’s
wholesale refusal to respond to the RFA. 
As set forth above, the information Plaintiff submitted to the EDD is
not discoverable.  However, the privilege
that covers the information Plaintiff submitted to the EDD does not cover any
questions regarding Plaintiff’s disability claim.  If Plaintiff could not respond to the RFA as
written, Plaintiff was required to qualify his responses.  Therefore, Plaintiff must further respond to
the RFA at issue.
The Court notes in
its notice concerning concludes Plaintiff’s refusal to provide adequate
responses to the discovery is an abuse of the discovery process and awards
sanctions.  The Court imposes sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, Berenji Law Firm, APC, in the
amount of $2,850, which represents six hours of attorney time to prepare the
motions and attend the hearing at $475 per hour.  Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly
and severally, are to pay sanctions in the amount of $2,850 to Defendant, by
and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this ruling.
Defendant is
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
