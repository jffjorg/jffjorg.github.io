And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a demurrer filed by Defendant Zhenyu Qi, which seeks to dismiss the case based on the plaintiff's failure to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff, Evelyn D. Childress, alleges that she fell on August 14, 2021, when her right foot became tangled in a plant, and that the defendant is liable for the accident. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's negligence claim against the defendant fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. Specifically, the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant owed a duty of care to her, and the alleged violation of the City of Duarte Code 13.04.100 is not sufficient to establish a cause of action. As a result, the court sustains the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend.
