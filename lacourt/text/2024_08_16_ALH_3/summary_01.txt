And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter a judgment in the amount of $19,457.19. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit against the defendant on February 18, 2021, and the action was dismissed on November 15, 2021, based on a stipulation between the parties. However, the defendant failed to make payments under the stipulation, and as a result, the defendant is in default of the stipulation. The plaintiff argues that it is entitled to a judgment of $19,457.19, which is the outstanding balance of the principal plus court costs. The judge has found that the plaintiff is entitled to the judgment and has vacated the dismissal. The defendant is required to make payments under the stipulation, and if the defendant fails to make payments, the plaintiff may obtain a judgment for the entire balance of $34,900.
