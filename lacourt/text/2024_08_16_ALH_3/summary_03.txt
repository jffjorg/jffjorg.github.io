And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a personal injury case. The plaintiff, Eugene Lee, alleges that the defendant, Kia America, Inc., was negligent and that its product, a 2016 Kia Optima, was defective and caused his injuries. The defendant argues that there is no evidence that the airbags in the vehicle were defective or that the alleged defects caused the plaintiff's injuries.

The judge finds that the defendant has not met its burden of showing that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the action. The judge notes that the defendant's motion is effectively unsupported by any admissible evidence and that the only evidence filed in support of the motion is an expert declaration that is premised on facts derived from evidence that is not currently in the record.

The judge continues the hearing to September 20, 2024, and orders the defendant to file the missing declaration with the court no later than 10 court days before the new hearing date. The judge also notes that the parties may submit on the tentative ruling and elect not to appear at the hearing, but that the opposing party may still appear at the hearing and argue the matter.
