   PURSUANT TO C.C.P. § 664.6

Plaintiff American Express National
Bank (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Farlinda R. Kwanin aka
Kanung Kwanin aka Kanung K. Viriyapunt (“Defendant”) on February 18, 2021. On
November 15, 2021, the action was dismissed based on a stipulation between the
parties. On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for an order vacating the
dismissal and entering a stipulated judgment in its favor and against Defendant
in the amount of $19.457.19. 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In hearing a section 664.6 motion, the
trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms of
a settlement agreement as a judgment. (Bowers
v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.) 
The stipulation on file sets forth a
monthly payment plan. Defendant’s failure to make payments on time will result
in Defendant being placed in default under the stipulation. If Defendant fails
to cure the default, Plaintiff may obtain a judgment for the entire balance
owed by Defendant in the amount of $34,900, plus court costs, less any payments
made to date. (11/15/2021 Stip., ¶ 2.) 
Plaintiff argues that it is entitled to
a judgment of $19,457.19. Defendant stopped making payments as required under
the stipulation and $19,380 of the principal remains unpaid. (Keith Decl., ¶¶
8-10, 12.) A memorandum of costs shows that Plaintiff has also incurred $77.19
in costs. The motion is unopposed and it is undisputed that Defendant is in
default of the parties’ stipulation. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED
and the Court vacates the dismissal and enters judgment against Defendant in
the amount of $19,457.19.  
Moving party to give notice.
