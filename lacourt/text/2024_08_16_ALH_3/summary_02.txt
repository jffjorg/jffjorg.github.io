And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to appoint a referee to carry out the sale of the South Pasadena Property without prejudice. The motion was filed on February 27, 2024, and the parties were ordered to meet and confer on selecting a referee. However, no joint statement has been filed, and the parties were unable to agree on a referee. As a result, the court has no nominees to choose from and has denied the motion. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar if no submissions are received.
