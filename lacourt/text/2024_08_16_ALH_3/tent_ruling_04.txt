I.      INTRODUCTION
         On July 12,
2023, plaintiff Evelyn D. Childress (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendant Zhenyu Qi (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on September 1, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that on August 14, 2021, she
fell when her right foot became tangled in a plant. 
          On
April 12, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer.
          No
opposition or reply brief is on file. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its
face.  (City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell v. California Department of Public
Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.) In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific
factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations. (Financial Corporation of
America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)
III.    DISCUSSION
In California, negligence may be
pleaded in general terms. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 407-408.)
Despite a liberal pleading standard, however, a plaintiff must still allege the
following to plead a cause of action for negligence: (1) a legal duty owed to
plaintiff to use due care; (2) a breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage
to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006)
137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318.) 
Plaintiff’s negligence claim against
Defendant fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. Plaintiff
only alleges Defendant “violated the City of Duarte Code 13.04.100 Prevention
of Obstruction Abatement [sic]” and claims that “[Defendant] [is] at fault for
neglect allowing this shrub to encroach the sidewalk.” (FAC, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff
does not allege that Defendant owed a duty of care by owning, possessing, or
controlling the overgrown shrub or any adjacent land. (See Alcaraz v. Vece (1997)
14 Cal.4th 1149 1157-1158.) 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED. As Plaintiff did not oppose this motion or show how
amendment is possible, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. 
Moving party to give notice.
