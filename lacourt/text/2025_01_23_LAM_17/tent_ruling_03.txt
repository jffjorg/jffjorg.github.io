 Case No.: 
  24STCV17002
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 23, 2025



 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.
 
On 7/9/2024,
Plaintiff Legacy Enterprises Construction LLC (Plaintiff) filed suit against
Nicole Reyes and De Shaun Myers (collectively, Defendants), alleging unlawful
detainer.
 
On 1/13/2025,
Plaintiff moved for leave to amend.
 
The motion is
unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend to correct the misspelling in the Complaint of the name of
Defendant "De Shaun Myers" to the proper spelling, De’Shaun Myers. 
 
The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s proposed amendment consists purely of a clerical correction, and
would not make any substantive changes. Defendant did not oppose this motion,
and thus has not shown that meaningful prejudice would result if leave to amend
were granted. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend is granted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.
