  Date:  January 23, 2025



 
Plaintiff’s
motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED. Plaintiff is awarded the requested

On 11/7/2023,
Plaintiff Dmitrii Duplikhin (Plaintiff) filed suit against Corporatedoors,
Inc., Revere Production, LLC, Dmitri Kornakov, and Andrey Kornakov
(collectively, Defendants). On 2/20/2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging: (1) integrated enterprise; (2) alter ego; (3)
misclassification if employee; (4) failure to pay overtime; (5) failure to
provide meal breaks; (6) failure to provide rest breaks; (7) failure to furnish
accurate wage statements; (8) waiting time penalties; (9) failure to permit
inspection of personnel and payroll records; (10) constructive wrongful
termination; (11) retaliation; and (12) unfair business practices. 
 
On 11/4/2024,
Plaintiff moved for an order to enforce the parties’ Settlement Agreement.
 
The motion is
unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendants are in breach of their Settlement Agreement. More
specifically, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants were to
pay Plaintiff $40,000. (Serkova Decl., Exh. 1.) Additionally, the Settlement
Agreement provides that Defendants will make the payments as follows: “1st
Payment of $8,000 due July 1, 2024, 2nd payment of $8,000 due August 1, 2024,
3rd payment of $8,000 due September 1, 2024, 4th payment of $8,000 due October
1, 2024, Fifth and final payment of $8,000 due November 1, 2024…...If any
payment listed in a. through e. not received by the 5th day of each designated
month, there will be a late assessed fee of $250.00 per month” (See Exhibit 1,
pg. ¶ 5. Serkova Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Defendants
made the first payment with the late assessed fee of $250.00 pursuant to the
above schedule on July 31, 2024, of $8,250.00 and second payment of $8,250.00
on September 24, 2024, which was late and supposed to be for August 2024. (Serkova
Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendants
then failed to present the remainder of the balance for September, October, and
November 2024 installments which amount to $24,000.00 plus late fees of $250.00
for each month totaling $24,750.00, thus breaching the Settlement Agreement.
(Serkova Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 specifically permits the Court to enter judgment on a
settlement agreement made in writing by the parties.
 
The Court
considers Defendants’ non-opposition to be a concession to Plaintiff’s motion
on the merits. The Court also finds Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees
incurred to enforce the Settlement Agreement. (Serkova Decl, Exh. 1., ¶ 6. Part
G.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
