Legal Standard 
 
The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila
Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees
are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (Id.)

 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning,
their age, and their experience in the particular type of work demanded the
intricacies and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for
skilled legal training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed.
(Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 647, 657.) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 (Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Ibid.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Id.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks $13,046.77 in attorney fees. This amount consists of (1) $10,725.00 in
attorney’s fees; (2) $821.77 in costs and expenses; and (3) additional amount
of $1,500.00 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition, draft
the Reply, and attend the hearing on this Motion.
 
Rates
 
            Alex Cha seeks a rate of $550/hr. 
 
Hours 
 
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on the 19.5 hours spent by his attorney litigating this
case. 
 
After review,
the Court finds the hours claimed to be reasonable. The Court takes Defendant’s
failure to oppose as a concession to the reasonableness of the hours billed-for.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff is awarded $10,725 in attorney fees. The Court does not
address Plaintiff’s request for costs, as Plaintiff did not file a memorandum
of costs. The Court does not include time to respond to an Opposition as one
was not filed.
 
It is so ordered.
