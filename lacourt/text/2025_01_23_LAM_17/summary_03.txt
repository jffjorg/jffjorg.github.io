And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this unlawful detainer case, the plaintiff, Legacy Enterprises Construction LLC, is seeking to amend its complaint to correct a misspelling of the defendant's name, De'Shaun Myers. The proposed amendment is purely a clerical correction and would not change the substance of the case. Since the defendant did not oppose the motion, the court finds that the defendant has not shown that granting the amendment would cause meaningful prejudice. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend.
