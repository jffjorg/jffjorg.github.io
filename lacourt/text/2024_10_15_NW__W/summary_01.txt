And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Cross-Defendant David Soto Vargas. The motion seeks to determine whether the settlement between Plaintiff George Charles Sugar and Cross-Defendant Soto Vargas is in good faith. The settlement was for $15,000, which is the full policy limit of Soto Vargas' insurance policy. The judge found that the settlement satisfies the "ballpark" and "reasonable range" standards and that Soto Vargas has an insurance policy limit of $15,000 each person/$30,000 each accident. The judge also noted that no party has opposed the motion and that Soto Vargas has satisfied the Tech-Bilt factors, which include considering the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. As a result, the court has granted the motion and has determined that the settlement was made in good faith.
