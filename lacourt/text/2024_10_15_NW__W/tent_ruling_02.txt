he intended to avail himself of the Restaurant, Happy Dogs, located at 6235 Van
Nuys Blvd, Van Nuys, California. Defendants Suzanne Thomas and Michael Wolner
own the real property located there. Defendant Jin Soo Kim owns Happy Dogs.

dismissed Jin Soo Kim dba Happy Dogs. On July 18, 2024, default was entered
against Defendants Suzanne Thomas and Michael Wolner. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: GRANT
 
Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidentiary and factual support
for the requested relief.  
 
However, the court declines
to increase the attorney’s fees beyond those provided by the local rules, or
$330.   The court will not award the
investigator’s charges, as those costs are not regularly recoverable.  The court also only awards $130 in process
server fees, as the remaining amount is not supported by the record.  Total costs to be awarded are $634.93.
