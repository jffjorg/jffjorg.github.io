And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Brian Whitaker. The plaintiff, a quadriplegic and ADA tester, alleged that the defendants, Suzanne Thomas and Michael Wolner, violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act by failing to provide access to the restaurant Happy Dogs. The court found that the plaintiff provided sufficient evidence to support his claims and has granted the requested relief. However, the court has reduced the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded to the plaintiff, as some of these expenses were not supported by the record or are not regularly recoverable. The total amount of damages and costs awarded is $7,600.17. The court has scheduled a hearing for October 15, 2024, to confirm the default judgment.
