And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a case filed by Michelle Santiago against American Honda Motor Company. The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer with 15 days leave to amend, meaning that the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint is moot. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant had concealed information about a defective Sensing System in a vehicle purchased by the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient and that the claim was preempted by federal law. The judge has found that the defendant's argument is not persuasive and has given the plaintiff leave to amend to allege facts that could show that the claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also noted that the allegations made by the plaintiff are sufficient to state a claim for fraudulent concealment at the pleading stage.
