And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is about a motion to set aside a default entered against CA Glatt Mart, Inc. (Glatt Mart) in a lawsuit filed by Menachem Green (Green). Green is a legally blind person who claims that Glatt Mart's website and physical store do not comply with accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California law. Glatt Mart failed to respond to the complaint, and the court entered default. However, Glatt Mart claims that it reasonably believed its insurer, AmGUARD Insurance, would defend it in the action and did not realize it would not until after the default was entered. The court finds that Glatt Mart's mistake and excusable neglect justify setting aside the default, and the motion is granted.
