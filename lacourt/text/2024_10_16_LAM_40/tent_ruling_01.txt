 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Compel the
  Taking of the Deposition of Defendant Esmeralda Rubio; and Request for
  Sanctions [RES ID # 7852]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs Barry Robertson  and Elizabeth Robertson (collectively,
Plaintiffs) sue Defendants Michael McClinton (McClinton), Esmeralda Rubio
(Rubio), and Does 1 through 30 pursuant to a September 19, 2022 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Breach of Express or
Implied Warranty, (3) Breach of Implied Warranty, (4) Negligent Hiring, (5)
Negligence, (6) Fraud, (7) Disgorgement, and (8) Declaratory Relief. 
The claims arise from allegations
that, pursuant to a contract between the parties, and with all checks made out
to Defendant Rubio at McClinton’s direction, Defendant McClinton and his
construction crew worked on building a retaining wall on Plaintiffs’ property,
performed electrical, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) work
thereon, and promised to complete other work as well, such as installing
pavers, a new driveway, sprinkler systems, driveway lights, and new plants and
landscaping, only for Defendants to fail to complete all the work they were
paid to do or complete such work in an unworkmanlike fashion, resulting in
damages to Plaintiffs in the minimum amount of $200,000 related to the
retaining wall alone, as well as additional fees and costs Plaintiffs will need
to pay to complete the work not performed by Defendants and to repair the
damages Defendants did to Plaintiffs’ property.
B. Motion Before the Court
            On September
10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of
Defendant Esmeralda Rubio and request for sanctions against Rubio in the amount
of $3,357.00. 
On October 8, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a notice that Rubio has not filed an opposition to the motion. 
The Plaintiffs’ motion is now
before the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
If, [1] after service of a
deposition notice, [2] a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, [3] without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, [4] fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with
it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, [5] the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a) [Arabic numerals
added for clarity].) 
The motion shall also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b)(2).) 
B. Analysis
            Plaintiffs
assert that they have been attempting to depose Rubio since March 2024, but
that Rubio has failed to appear for her depositions as noticed, and has refused
to meet and confer. (Mot. p. 1:12-15; Larson Decl. ¶ 4.) The Plaintiffs contend
that on the eve of Rubio’s April 9 deposition, Rubio’s counsel informed
Plaintiffs that Rubio could not attend (Larson Decl. ¶ 6.) The deposition was
rescheduled for April 17, but again, the evening before the deposition, Rubio
informed counsel that would not attend. (Larson Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs then
scheduled a deposition for July 31, but Rubio did not respond to multiple
emails asking her to confirm her attendance or otherwise provide alternative
dates. (Larson Decl. ¶ 9.)
            Here, Rubio
is a party to this case and was properly served with deposition notices. (See
Larson Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 9, Exs. 2-3, 5.) The deposition notices were sufficient to
compel Rubio’s attendance and testimony under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2025.280 subdivision (a) and 2025.220 subdivision (a). Rubio did not serve any
objections to the deposition notices and has failed to appear for examination. 
            The
Plaintiffs are clearly entitled to a deposition of Rubio. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010 [“Any party may obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter
2 (commencing with Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth
in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2019.010), by taking in California the
oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. The person
deposed may be a natural person, an organization such as a public or private
corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency.”].) 
            Thus,
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition is GRANTED. 
C. Request for Sanctions 
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).) 
Here, Rubio has not opposed the
motion, and has therefore failed to provide substantial justification or
argument as to why the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. 
Plaintiffs seek sanctions in the
total amount of $3,357.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $400/hour for: (1) 1.5
hours preparing for Rubio’s deposition, (2) 0.4 hours waiting for Rubio at her
noticed deposition on July 31, 2024, (3) $770 for the court reporter for the
deposition, (4) 2.9 hours preparing the instant motion, (5) 1.5 hours to
prepare a reply and review Rubio’s opposition, (6) 1.0 hour for the hearing on
this motion, and (7) $60 for the filing fee. (Larson Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.) 
Since no opposition or reply were
filed, a 1.5 hour reduction is appropriate. Thus, the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions
is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $2,757.00. ($3,357.00 - $600 = $2,757.00.)
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs Barry Robertson and Elizabeth Robertson’s Motion to Compel the
Taking of the Deposition of Defendant Esmeralda Rubio, and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
Esmeralda Rubio is ordered to appear at deposition to testify in this
action within 15 days of this Order.
Esmeralda Rubio is further ordered to remit sanctions in the amount of
$2,757.00 to Larson & Gaston, LLP within 30 days of this Order.
