And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by defendant CICO to tax the costs of plaintiffs Patricia Beecham, personal representative of the estate of Praxedes E. Running, and Leia Bowers, co-trustee of the Praxedes E. Running Trust. The plaintiffs have filed a memorandum of costs in the amount of $135,237, and the defendant is seeking to strike certain costs, including $56,700 in prejudgment interest and $1,812.31 in deposition costs.

The judge has ruled that the 998 offer made by CICO is invalid due to lack of apportionment and unclear language, and therefore will not strike the plaintiffs' post-998 offer costs. The defendant has also failed to carry its burden with respect to filing fees, and the court will strike only $1,812.31 in deposition costs.

The judge has also granted the request for judicial notice and has ordered the moving party to give notice. Counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
