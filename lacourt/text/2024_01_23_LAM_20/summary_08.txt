And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the Plaintiff's sixth and seventh causes of action, alleging whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has established triable issues as to an adverse employment action, which is defined as a termination. The Judge also finds that the Defendants have not established a legitimate reason for termination by clear and convincing evidence. The Judge further finds that the Plaintiff has established triable issues as to the existence of a triable, material factual issue regarding the Defendants' alleged retaliation. The Judge denies the motion for summary adjudication and allows the case to proceed to trial.
