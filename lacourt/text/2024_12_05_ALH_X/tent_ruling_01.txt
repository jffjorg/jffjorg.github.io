  Case Number:  19STCV11399    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  X PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT’S COST BILLPlaintiff moves to strike/tax costs from Defendant KAZN AM 1300, Arthur Liu, and Yvonne Liu’s memorandum of costs filed on September 10, 2024, seeking recovery of litigation expenses in the amount of $32,387.02.  (9/10/24 Memorandum of Costs.)  On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Tax Costs, objecting to the memorandum in its entirety.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs is granted in part and denied in part.  Total costs of $6,614.91 are awarded.Legal Authority and AnalysisPlaintiff argues that the memorandum lacks supporting documentation and is unreasonable. Plaintiff asserts that without documentation, it is impossible to audit the costs incurred.  The Defendants oppose the motion, asserting that the costs are reasonable, necessary, and recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b). California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700 requires that “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.”  (Cal. Rules Court, rule, 3.1700(b)(1).)  The time for filing is extended for mail or electronic service pursuant to either Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) or 1013.  Additionally, “[t]he party claiming costs and the party contesting costs may agree to extend the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum and a motion to strike or tax costs.  This agreement must be confirmed in writing, specify the extended date for service, and be filed with the clerk.  In the absence of an agreement, the court may extend the times for serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion to strike or tax costs for a period not to exceed 30 days.”  (Cal. Rules Court, rule, 3.1700(b)(3).) The Court observes Plaintiff’s motion was filed on September 30, 2024—20 days after service. The motion attests that Plaintiff and Defendants’ counsel agreed Plaintiff had until September 30, 2024 to serve this motion to strike/tax costs, thus the motion is timely. Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing party.  To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount.  (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  In reviewing a motion to tax costs, a guiding principle is that all costs must be “reasonably necessary to the litigation” and “reasonable in need and amount.”  (Acosta v. SI Corporation (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1370, 1380.) If the items on their face appear to be proper charges, the verified costs bill is prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v. California State Auto. Ass’n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774-776.)  On the other hand, items that are properly objected to are put at issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.)  Whether an item listed on the costs bill was reasonably necessary is a question of fact for the trial court.  (Bender v. County of Los Angeles (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968, 989.)  The contesting party may meet its burden by showing the entire costs bill is improper rather than by challenging particular items.  (Fennessy v. DeLeuw-Cather Corp. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1192).  Courts have discretion to disallow costs that were unreasonably incurred. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1201.)   Here, the right to recovery of costs remains unchallenged.  Rather, Plaintiff challenges the reasonableness of the items in the memorandum because of the lack of attachments, documentation, or attestations to the validity and reasonableness of the costs.  The memorandum of costs lists the following items:1. Filing and motion fees, $4,229.232. Jury fees, $375.004. Deposition costs, $11,023.565. Service of process, $890.028. Witness fees, $4,100.0011. Court reporter fees as established by statute, $11,539.4114. Fees for electronic filing or service, $223.12TOTAL COSTS of $32,387.02Notably, Defendants did not file a MC-011 worksheet to detail and support their memorandum of costs.  Plaintiff did not proffer any evidence in support of his motion, but Plaintiff’s counsel, Frank Carleo, filed a declaration on December 2, 2024 in response to the opposition.  The Carleo Declaration attests that Plaintiff’s counsel never consented to service via email, as required by Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) 1010.6(a)(i) & (ii).  On September 11, 2024, he informed opposing counsel that he did not consent to the service of a Memorandum of Costs.  A legal assistant named Shin agreed to serve documents by USPS in the future and retracted the service of the Memorandum of Costs.  The only cost document served was the Memorandum of Costs dated September 10, 2024, signed by attorney Gi Nam Lee.On November 22, 2024, Carleo discovered a 52-page document—the Lee Declaration which supports Defendants’ opposition—that had been served electronically, contrary to their agreement.  Defendants’ attempt to substantiate their claimed costs in defense counsel’s declaration.  (See Lee Decl., Exh. A [filing fees, jury fees, deposition costs, service of process, expert witness fees, court reporter fees, and fees for electronic filing of service].)  The Carleo Declaration asserts that the Lee Declaration does not include a Judicial Counsel Form MC-011: Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet) and is poorly organized.The Court agrees—the Lee Declaration is not clearly organized.  For example, all the receipts are included in a single Exhibit A of the Lee Declaration, without descriptions of each receipt and which “Item” the receipt falls under in the memorandum of costs.  Form MC-011 is not mandatory but assists the Court in determining the reasonableness of the costs requested.  There having been no worksheet submitted nor descriptive explanations of the receipts in Exhibit A of the Lee Declaration, the Court and Plaintiff cannot studiously evaluate Defendants’ claimed costs.  Accordingly, based on the Court’s review of the documents, the Court will award the following as costs:  Filing and motion fees of $2,614.98; Jury fees of $265.37; and Deposition costs of $3,734.56.  The motion to strike is denied as to these costs and the total allowable costs are $6,614.91.  The motion to strike is granted as to the remaining costs asserted. ConclusionPlaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs is granted in part and denied in part.  Total costs of $6,614.91 are awarded.
