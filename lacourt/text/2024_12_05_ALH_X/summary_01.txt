And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's costs bill. The defendant has claimed costs of $32,387.02, but the plaintiff argues that the bill is unreasonable and lacks supporting documentation. The judge agrees that the bill is poorly organized and lacks a worksheet to detail and support the costs. However, the judge is willing to award some of the costs, specifically the filing and motion fees, jury fees, and deposition costs, totaling $6,614.91. The motion to strike is denied as to these costs, but granted as to the remaining costs asserted. The judge's decision is subject to change after further review and hearing.
