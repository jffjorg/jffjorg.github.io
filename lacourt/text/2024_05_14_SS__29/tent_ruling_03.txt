 Case Number:  20STCV35691    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Leave to Compel Compliance with
Demand for Physical (Neurological) Examination of Plaintiff filed by Defendant
Richard Marc Zucker 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is denied.
 
Background 
 
On September 17, 2020, Yanera Cooper (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Richard Marc Zucker (“Defendant”), Shaw Industries, Inc.,
and Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident on
the 405 Freeway.  The complaint states
that the accident occurred on October 3, 2020, but that must be a typographical
error, as the complaint was filed in September 2020.
 
On April 15, 2022, Richard Marc Zuker (“Zucker”) and Shaw
Industries Group, Inc. (erroneously sued as Shaw Industries, Inc. (“Shaw”)
filed an answer.
 
Shaw demanded a medical examination of Plaintiff by an
orthopedic specialist regarding injuries to her back.  This examination, by Dr. Steven Dennis,
occurred in December 2023.  (Panah Decl.,
p. 6:28; Mathis Reply Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Plaintiff also was subject to a mental (neuropsychological) examination
by Dr. George K. Henry in April 2024, for which Shaw sought and obtained leave
of the Court.  (Panah Decl., p. 7: 1-2;
Mathis Reply Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
On February 22, 2024, Zucker served a demand for a physical
examination by Martin D. Levine, M.D., a neurologist.  (Mathis Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh. F.)  The examination was scheduled for April 2,
2024.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff timely served objections to the
demand.  (Id., ¶ 7 & Exh.
G.)  Zucker than served an amended demand
on February 29.  (Id., ¶ 8
& Exh. H.)  Plaintiff did not serve
any objection to the amended demand.  (Id.,
¶ 9.)  Plaintiff did not
attend.  (Id., ¶ 11.)  
 
On April
10, 2024, Zucker filed this motion to compel Plaintiff to comply with his demand
for a physical examination by Dr. Levine. 
On the next day, April 11, the Court granted Zuker’s ex parte
application to advance the hearing date to May 14, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff
did not file a timely opposition. 
Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition on May 7, 2024 (six days late).  Zucker filed a reply on May 10.
Trial is
currently set for June 13, 2024.  All discovery
deadlines are based on that trial date. 
(See Minute Order of August 11, 2023.)
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a
physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent of
any party, or (3) a natural person in the custody or under the legal control of
a party, in any action in which the mental or physical condition (including the
blood group) of that party or other person is in controversy in the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220,
subdivision (a), provides that in a personal injury action, and subject to
certain conditions, “any defendant may demand one physical examination of the
plaintiff.”  
 
Within 20 days of service of a demand for a physical
examination, the plaintiff to whom the demand is directed must respond in
writing and state that the plaintiff “will comply with the demand as stated,
will comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will
refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded
physical examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2032.230, subd. (a).)  Failure to serve
a timely response waives any objection to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (a).)
 
If a plaintiff fails to comply, the defendant may
move for an order compelling plaintiff to appear at and submit to a physical
examination. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd.
(a).)  The motion “shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (b).)
 
If a defendant seeks a further physical examination
of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first file a motion
and “obtain leave of court” under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.310.
 
Motions relating to discovery (other than expert discovery)
must be heard at least 15 days before trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Zucker seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to submit to a
physical (neurological) examination.  
 
Plaintiff’s opposition was not timely filed, and Zucker argues that the
Court should disregard it.  The Court
exercises its discretion to consider the untimely opposition submitted by
Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff argues that the motion is untimely.  There is no merit in the argument.  A motion regarding discovery is timely if
heard at least 15 days before trial. 
Trial is currently set for June 13, more than 15 days after the hearing
date.
 
More substantively, Plaintiff opposes Zucker’s motion on the ground that
Plaintiff has been examined twice: first in a physical (orthopedic) examination
demanded by Defendant Shaw, and then in a mental (neuropsychological)
examination ordered by the Court on Defendant Shaw’s motion.
 
Plaintiff raises the issue of whether, in a multi-defendant case, a
plaintiff may be subject to multiple physical examinations, each demanded by a
different defendant as of right under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220.  Although the matter is not free from doubt,
and although neither party cites any case law on point (and the Court is aware
of none), the statutory language appears to support Defendant Zucker’s argument
that each defendant may demand one physical examination as of right.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd. (a) [“any
defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff”].)  A leading treatise supports this reading of
the statute, while at the same time noting that a plaintiff could obtain a
protective order if repetitive or duplicative examinations were requested.  (2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial [2023]. ¶ 8:1522-1523.)
 
The Court adopts this interpretation of the statute and concludes that Defendant
Zucker properly demanded one physical examination of Plaintiff under section
2032.220.  Plaintiff’s objections to the
initial notice are overruled, and Plaintiff did not serve any objections to the
amended notice. 
The Court further notes that even
treating this motion as a request for leave for a second physical examination,
the Court finds good cause for the requested neurological examination of
Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the motion is
granted.
Defendant Zucker’s request for
sanctions is denied.  Plaintiff acted
with substantial justification in objecting on the ground that Zucker was
requesting a second physical examination of Plaintiff without seeking advance
leave of the Court.  Although the Court
disagrees with, and ultimately rejects, Plaintiff’s interpretation of the
statute, it was substantially justified for Plaintiff to argue for the opposite
view.
Conclusion

The Court GRANTS Defendant
Zucker’s motion to compel the physical (neurological) examination of Plaintiff.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to
appear and be examined by Martin D. Levine, M.D., at 511 East Manchester
Boulevard, Inglewood, California 90301, on May 21, 2024, at 12:30 pm.  The examination must be conducted in strict
compliance with the Civil Discovery Act, including, but not limited to, Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2032.510 and 2032.520.
