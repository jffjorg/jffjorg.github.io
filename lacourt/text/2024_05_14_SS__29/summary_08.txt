And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court granted Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in the dispute between Mari Goto (the plaintiff) and Uber Technologies, Inc. The court found that the parties had agreed to arbitrate disputes in their terms of service, and therefore the dispute should be arbitrated rather than litigated in court. The court also stayed the litigation of plaintiff's claim against Uber Technologies, Inc., but the litigation of plaintiff's claims against other defendants and the claims in the cross-complaint are not affected by this ruling.
