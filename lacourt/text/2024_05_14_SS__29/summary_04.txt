And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (RFAs) filed by Cross-Defendant Juan G. Lopez. However, the Judge grants the request for sanctions in part. The motion was filed because Transportation (Tavares Transportation, Inc.) failed to serve timely responses to the RFAs, despite being served with them on October 27, 2023. The Judge finds that Transportation's conduct is not substantially justified and would not be unjust to impose sanctions against them for their violation of the Civil Discovery Act. The Judge orders Transportation to pay monetary sanctions to Lopez in the amount of $585.
