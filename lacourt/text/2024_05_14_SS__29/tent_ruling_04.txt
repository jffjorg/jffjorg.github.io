 Case Number:  21STCV19395    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matter Asserted filed by Cross-Defendant
Juan G. Lopez.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On May 21, 2021, Juan
G. Lopez, Diana Rojas-Lopez and Maria Rojas (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Pedro Tavares, Tavares Transportation, Inc., and Does 1
through 25, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on June 19, 2019,
on the 210 Freeway near Lake Avenue in Pasadena.
 
On August 20, 2021,
Pedro Tavares and Tavares Transportation, Inc. filed an answer to the complaint
and a cross-complaint against Juan G. Lopez (“Lopez”) and Roes 1 through
100.  On December 13, 2021, Lopez filed an
answer to the cross-complaint.
 
On March 10, 2023,
Plaintiffs amended their complaint to name Frank Martin Chavez as Doe 1.
 
On October 27, 2023,
Lopez served Tavares Transportation, Inc. (“Transportation”) with Requests for
Admission (“RFAs”) (Set One).  (Lewis
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Transportation
did not serve responses to the RFAs.  (Id.,
¶¶ 4-5.)
 
On April 12, 2024, Lopez filed this
motion for an order deeming Transportation to have admitted the truth of the
matters specified in the RFAs.  Lopez
also seeks sanctions.  Transportation filed
an opposition on May 1, and Lopez filed a reply on May 7.
 
While this motion was pending,
Transportation served verified responses to the RFAs on April 30, 2024.  (Purcell Decl., ¶ 8 & Exh. A.)
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party
“may move for an order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must
a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 “The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
Lopez served Transportation
with the RFAs on October 27, 2023.  (Lewis
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Transportation
did not serve timely responses, and in fact did not serve any responses at all
until more than six months later, on April 30, 2024.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5; Purcell Decl., ¶ 8 & Exh. A.)
 
Transportation did, however, serve responses
before the hearing.  These responses are
in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  Accordingly, the
motion for a deemed admitted order is denied. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
The request for sanctions is granted in part.  Transportation’s failure to serve timely
responses to the RFAs necessitated this motion, the conduct of Transportation
is not substantially justified, and it would not be unjust to impose sanctions
against Transportation for its violation of the Civil Discovery Act.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Sanctions are also sought and awarded against counsel, as counsel failed
to calendar the response date properly. 
(Purcell Decl., ¶ 4.)  
 
Given
the relatively straightforward nature of a motion for a deemed-admitted order,
the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $585, calculated based on 2.5 hours
of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $210 per
hour, plus the $60 filing fee.  (See Lewis
Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Lopez’s
motion for a deemed-admitted order.
 
The Court GRANTS in part Lopez’s request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Tavares Transportation, Inc. and the Law Office of Steven R. Odell,
jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Lopez under the Civil
Discovery Act in the amount of $585 within 30 days of notice.
 
Moving party is ORDERED
to give notice.
