English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling discusses the summary judgment motions filed by Defendants Unzueta and Mercy Eye Care Medical Group, Inc. The Court denied Unzueta's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding Unzueta's alleged failure to meet the standard of care during the cataract surgery performed on September 9, 2020. The Court also denied Mercy Eye Care Medical Group, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment, as its potential liability is derivative of Unzueta's. The Court will hear from the parties regarding the disputes and will exercise its discretion to accept Plaintiff's supplemental opposition.
