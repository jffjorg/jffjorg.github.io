The judge notes that the defendants have failed to respond to the discovery at issue, but also acknowledges that the defendants have made attempts to comply with the court's orders. The judge concludes that the imposition of terminating sanctions is a drastic measure and that the defendants are not outright refusing to comply with their discovery obligations. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
