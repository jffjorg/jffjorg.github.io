Summary in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to strike GEICO's Motion for Summary Adjudication. The motion was filed in response to GEICO's claim that it had a reasonable basis for denying underinsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff, Ms. Pixler. The Court found that GEICO's reliance on an unpublished opinion of a California Court of Appeal was permissible and that the motion to strike was without merit. The Court noted that the unpublished opinion was not being used as precedential authority, but rather as a means of showing that GEICO's conduct in denying coverage was reasonable. The Court also cited federal district court cases that have held that insurers may rely on unpublished opinions in making coverage determinations. As a result, the motion to strike is denied.
