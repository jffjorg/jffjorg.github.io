And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, YMCA of the East Valley, has moved to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles to San Bernardino County. The plaintiff, who initially named YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles as a defendant, had alleged that the alleged injury occurred in San Bernardino County. However, on October 11, 2023, the plaintiff dismissed YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles. Since the alleged injury occurred in San Bernardino County and no defendant resides in Los Angeles, the court grants the defendant's motion to change venue. The matter is ordered transferred to San Bernardino County, and the plaintiff is required to pay the transfer fee and filing fee within 30 days.
