And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, NKMD MGMT, LLC, has filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Manifaith, LLC, Brandon Esparza, Shelby Harvey, and Seung Song, alleging breach of contract, breach of confidence, fraud and deceit, and declaratory relief. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's substantial invocation of litigation machinery is inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate and has prejudiced them. The Judge finds that while the plaintiff has engaged in conduct inconsistent with a right to arbitrate, it is insufficiently inconsistent to constitute waiver. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's non-compete and confidentiality claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreements. The action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
