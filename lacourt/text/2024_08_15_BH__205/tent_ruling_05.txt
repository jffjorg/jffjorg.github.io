 Case Number:  24SMCV02338    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  205  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  PACIFIC PANORAMA, LLC,   Plaintiff, v.  KWALA, LLC, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV02338     Hearing Date:  August 15, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT KWALA, LLC’S MOTION    FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS   BACKGROUND This case arises from protracted litigation relating to the foreclosure of a residential property located at 17000 W Sunset Blvd in Pacific Palisades (the “Property”).   The relevant facts are as follows. Gregg Corlyn (“Corlyn”) acquired title to the Property pursuant to a Grant Deed recorded on June 29, 2001 (the “Grant Deed”). (Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) No. 1; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 1).  The Grant Deed did not grant an “easement” to Corlyn.  (RJN No. 2).  In 2007, Corlyn borrowed and promised to repay the amount of $3,697,500 pursuant to a note dated April 6, 2007 (the “Note”) secured by a Deed of Trust dated April 6, 2007 (the “1st Deed of Trust”) against the Property.  (RJN Nos. 3-5; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 2; Compl. ¶ 14.a, Ex. 3). He also entered into a revolving credit agreement secured by a Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents dated April 6, 2007 (the “2nd Deed of Trust”).  (RJN No. 9; Compl. ¶ 14.b, Exh. 4). The Deeds of Trust have the same legal description as the Grant Deed.  (RJN Nos. 6 & 9).   In 2009, the 1st Deed of Trust was assigned to Wells Fargo Bank. (RJN No. 10; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 3; Compl. ¶ 15).  Corlyn quitclaimed title of the Property to Plaintiff Pacific Panorama LLC on October 10, 2008 by way of a Quitclaim Deed that was not recorded until January 27, 2010 and sets forth the same exact legal description as the Grant Deed. (RJN No. 11; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 4; Compl. ¶ 11, Ex. 1).  The Quitclaim Deed identifies that title was quitclaimed to Pacific as a “GIFT.”  The Quitclaim Deed did not include any provision for the assumption of the Note or 1st Deed of Trust by Pacific. (RJN No. 12).  Two days after recording the Quitclaim Deed, on January 29, 2010, Pacific filed its first Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Nevada, with Case No. BK-S-10-11464-MKN, to delay WF Bank’s foreclosure.  In that case, the court granted Wells Fargo Bank’s motion for relief from the automatic stay.  The court eventually dismissed the case on April 19, 2012.  (RJN No. 13; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 35, Ex. 30 (Memorandum Decision, at p. 3)).  On June 12, 2014, a notice of default and then, on October 3, 2014, a notice of trustee’s sale, each identifying only Corlyn as the borrower, were recorded against the Property based on the 1st Deed of Trust.  (RJN Nos. 14-15; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Exs. 5-6).   On October 17, 2014, Corlyn filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank and its loan servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (“SPS”), with Case No. SC123281, to enjoin the foreclosure. (RJN No. 16; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 7). Corlyn’s complaint asserted claims based on the borrower-protection statutes and alleged he submitted several “loan modification applications” between February 2013 and July 2014, but they were repeatedly denied or ignored by Wells Fargo Bank and SPS.  (RJN No. 17; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 7 (Corlyn’s 2014 Compl. ¶¶ 17-50)).  Then, on June 28, 2019, Corlyn filed another lawsuit against WF Bank and SPS, with Case No. 19SMCV01180, to again enjoin the foreclosure, in which he asserted: “Gregg Corlyn was and is an individual and the borrower on all liens on the property” and “Mr. Corlyn has standing to sue because, though he does not live at the subject property, he is still the borrower on the loan.” (RJN Nos. 18-19; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 8 (Corlyn’s FAC ¶¶ 1 & 36)).  After another notice of default and sale were published, Pacific filed its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 28, 2021, with Case No. 2:21-bk-15239, to again stop the foreclosure. The U.S. Trustee moved to dismiss the case for bad faith, as evidenced by the filing on the eve of a foreclosure sale and Pacific having only one asset and no income.  The court granted the lender’s motion for relief from stay and the U.S. Trustee’s motion to dismiss, with a 180-day bar to refiling, finding the case was filed in bad faith “just to delay the secured creditor from enforcing its rights.” (RJN Nos. 21-23; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 13-14 & 35, Exs. 9-10 & 30 (Memorandum Decision, at p. 5)).  On April 4, 2022, the 1st and 2nd Deeds of Trust were assigned to Defendant KWALA LLC (“Kwala”). (RJN Nos. 24-26; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 15-16, Exhs. 11-12; Compl. ¶ 16, Exh. 7).  Five months later, in September 2022, Plaintiff and Corlyn sought Kwala’s consent for Pacific to assume Corlyn’s loans. (Doss Decl. ¶¶ 4-5).  Kwala denied the request.  (Doss Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. A). Thus, Corlyn remained the sole borrower on the loans.  On October 3, 2022, a notice of default (“NOD”) is recorded against the Property based on the 1st Deed of Trust. (RJN No. 28; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 18, Exh. 14; Compl. ¶ 18, Exh. 9 [NOD]).  On December 2, 2022, Pacific files an action against Kwala entitled Pacific Panorama, LLC v. Kwala LLC et al., with Case No. 22STCV37755 (the “Prior Action”), seeking to enjoin foreclosure, despite that Pacific had never assumed the loan. (RJN No. 29; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 19-20, Exhs. 15-16).  That complaint asserted the same legal description for the Property as set forth in the Grant Deed and Quitclaim Deed. (RJN No. 30; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 20, Exh. 16).  In response to a demurrer, Pacific filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging the “NOD falsely represents that as of September 30, 2022 there were unpaid payments due Defendants and each of them in the sum of $208,394.55, when in fact that representation was materially false and misleading and was burdened with claims which were not due and not supported.” (RJN No. 32; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 18; see Compl. ¶ 25.b, at 10:6-9).  On or about January 4, 2023, Kwala caused its foreclosure trustee California TD Specialists to record a notice of trustee’s sale and scheduled the sale for January 31, 2023. (RJN No. 31; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 17). Following an ex parte application, the court issued a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) on January 23, 2023 enjoining the sale and setting an OSC Re Preliminary Injunction.   On March 29, 2023, the preliminary injunction hearing went forward, and on April 17, 2023, the court denied Pacific’s request for preliminary injunction and dissolved the TRO, finding that Pacific had no standing to challenge the amounts owed under the 1st Deed of Trust and that Kwala’s accounting as to the default amount owed was otherwise “accurate.” (RJN No. 33; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. 19 (Order Denying Request for Preliminary Injunction, 04-17-23)). Specifically, the court found: “Plaintiff lacks standing on both the contract related claims and the derivative declaratory relief claim. [Citations.] For this reason, Plaintiff also is not a ‘borrower’ under title 12 of the Federal Regulations section 1024.41 and lacks standing to assert any violation of the regulation.”  The court concluded “Plaintiff has not demonstrated its standing to assert various claims of the borrower on the loan.” (RJN No. 34; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. 19, at pp. 7 & 9).  Alternatively, the court held “Defendants have provided Plaintiff with a reasonably accurate accounting of the default claimed.” (RJN No. 35; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. 19, at pp. 7 & 9]). Kwala then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings challenging that Pacific lacked standing to assert any cause of action in the FAC because it was not the borrower on the loans and had not assumed the loans in any writing approved by the lenders. (Dicecca Decl. ¶ 23). On April 25, 2023, the court granted Kwala’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on Pacific’s FAC with leave to amend, finding that Pacific “has no standing to assert any of the contractual or statutory claims in the First Amended Complaint (‘FAC’) because Pacific is not a borrower under the two security interests held by Kwala.” (RJN Nos. 36-37; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 25, Ex. 20 (04-25-23 Minute Order, p. 1)).  On May 12, 2023, Pacific filed its second amended complaint (“SAC”) and Kwala filed another demurrer challenging standing. (RJN Nos. 39-40; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 19 & 26, Ex. 15).  Pacific did not file an opposition, and instead filed a notice of withdrawal of the SAC and then dismissed the action on June 8, 2023. (RJN Nos. 41-42; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 26, Exs. 21-22).  The very next day after the court dissolved the TRO, on April 18, 2023, Pacific filed its third Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with Case No. 23-11599-MKN, seeking to stop the foreclosure. (RJN No. 38; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 27-28, Exs. 23-24). Then, the day after the voluntary dismissal of the Prior Action, on June 9, 2024, Pacific removed the Prior Action to the bankruptcy court. (RJN No. 43; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 19 & 27, Exs. 15 [Civil Docket, at p. 1] & 23 [BK Docket, Doc 35 at p. 5]). Kwala filed a motion for relief from stay and a motion to remand the Prior Action back to the state court, which were both granted. (RJN Nos. 44-48; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 29-31, Exs. 25-27).  In its ruling on the motions, the bankruptcy court found that Pacific engaged in “forum shopping” to avoid the adverse rulings from the Prior Action and that Pacific would be unable to effect a reorganization with Kwala’s loans because “it’s not their debt” and because “they have no money.” (RJN No. 46; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 29, Exh. 25 (Transcript at pp. 59-60 & 62-64, italics added)). The bankruptcy court’s order granted Kwala “leave to foreclose on the Property and to enforce the security under the First Deed of Trust.” (RJN No. 47; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 30, Exh. 26).  Kwala’s trustee then scheduled the foreclosure sale for October 17, 2023. (Dicecca Decl. ¶ 32). The day before the sale, however, a notice of a new bankruptcy case filed by 17K West Sunset, LLC (“17K West”), with Case No. 23-15559-GS, was served on Kwala’s counsel. (RJN No. 51; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 32 & 34, Ex. 29). 17K West was formed after Kwala was granted relief from stay and was assigned the junior deeds of trust before filing bankruptcy. (RJN Nos. 49-50; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 33, Ex. 28).  In response, Kwala moved for in rem bar relief in the Pacific bankruptcy and to dismiss the 17K West bankruptcy.  Both motions were granted, and the bankruptcies were dismissed. (RJN Nos. 52-58; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 35-39, Exs. 30-34). In granting in rem bar relief, the court found that Pacific and 17K West engaged in a “scheme to hinder, delay or defraud Kwala and thwart its efforts to foreclose.” (RJN No. 53; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 35, Ex. 30 (Memorandum Decision, at p. 16)).  After this ruling, the foreclosure sale was scheduled for March 27, 2024 pursuant to a newly-issued Notice of Trustee’s Sale.  (RJN No. 59; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 40, Ex. 35). On March 4, 2024, Pacific filed an appeal in the bankruptcy and, on March 18, 2024, filed an emergency motion to stay the foreclosure sale, which was denied on March 19, 2024.  (RJN Nos. 60-61; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 41-42, Exs. 36-37). The next day, on March 20, 2024, Pacific filed another emergency motion for stay in the district court, and on March 26, 2024, the district court denied that motion and instructed “the foreclosure sale that is set for tomorrow may proceed.” (RJN No. 62; Lin Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B (Transcript at p. 19:18-19)). In its ruling, the court noted: “It is, I’ll say, troubling to this Court that this proceeding is being held here today after what appears to be over 12 years of abuse of process and an attempt to manipulate court proceedings.” (RJN No. 63; Lin Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B (Transcript at p. 18:17-25)).  The foreclosure sale took place the next day on March 27, 2024. The opening bid amount was $5,403,655.84.  Kwala made a “full credit bid” for that amount plus an additional $1,174,577.24 for the highest bid of $6,578,233.08.  No one for Pacific appeared at the sale or bid.  No one other than Kwala bid at the sale.  Kwala was the winning bidder. (RJN No. 64; Snyder Decl. ¶ 8; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 43, Ex. 38).  After the sale, the trustee received “notices of intent to bid” pursuant to Civil Code § 2924m. Pacific did not submit a notice. Ultimately, no bids were received, and the sale became final on May 13, 2024.  (Snyder Decl. ¶ 8).  A Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was recorded on May 20, 2024 in favor of Kwala.  (RJN No. 68; Snyder Decl. ¶ 8; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 44, Ex. 39). On April 17, 2024, 17K West filed a civil action with Case No. 24SMCV01839, which alleged that Kwala had rejected its tender of “all amounts due and owing” under the 1st Deed of Trust.  On April 30, 2024, the court denied 17K West’s ex parte application for a TRO to enjoin the recording of the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, and on May 14, 2024, 17K West dismissed the action. (RJN Nos. 65-67; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 46-49, Exs. 41-44).  Two days later, on May 16, 2024, Pacific filed the present action, asserting wrongful foreclosure and related causes of action based on the same alleged statutory violations as the Prior Action.  The operative complaint alleges eight claims for (1) wrongful foreclosure, (2) quiet title, (3) removal of cloud on title, (4) voiding/invalidating deed to real property, (5) slander of title, (6) injunctive relief - equitable, (7) injunctive relief – statutory, and (8) declaratory relief.  This hearing is on Kwala’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Kwala argues that the present action is nothing more than a collateral attack on the Prior Action, in which the Court found that Plaintiff had no standing because Plaintiff was not the borrower and never assumed the loan and alternatively that the default amount claimed by Defendant was “accurate.”  There was no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.    LEGAL STANDARD A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).)  “A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself. [Citation.]”  (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)  “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.  Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (citations omitted).)   The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)   Like a demurrer, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be addressed to the pleading as a whole or to separate counts.  If addressed to the pleading as a whole, the motion must be denied if even one count is good.  (Lora v. Garland (1946) 27 Cal.2d 840, 850; Heredia v. Farmers Ins. Exch. (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1345, 1358.)  If addressed to separate counts, the motion may be granted as to some counts and denied as to others.  (Steiner v. Rowley (1950) 35 Cal.2d 713, 720; Heredia, 228 Cal.App.3d at 1358.) MEET AND CONFER A party moving for¿judgment on the pleadings must¿meet and confer in person or telephonically with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to determine if an agreement can be reached regarding the claims raised in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a).) The moving party must file a declaration detailing the¿meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 439, subd. (a)(3).)  Kwala submits the Declaration of Michael Dicecca which shows that despite repeated requests, Plaintiff’s counsel would not provide dates for a meet and confer by telephone.  This satisfies the meet and confer requirements of § 439.  Plaintiff is admonished to comply with requests to meet and confer.     REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Kwala requests judicial notice of recorded instruments, facts that can be adduced from the recorded instruments, and orders, findings of fact and conclusions of law in court records.  The Court grants the request pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(c), 452(d), 452(h), and 453.   DISCUSSION Defendants argue that Pacific’s first claim for violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 10130 and 10131.1 fails because Wells Fargo Bank is expressly exempt from the licensing requirements of the statute.  The Court agrees. Bus. & Prof. Code § 10130 provides that “It is unlawful for any person to engage in the business of . . . a real estate broker . . . within this state without first obtaining a real estate license from the department . . . ”.  Section 10131.1(a) defines real estate broker to include a person “in the business of . . . selling to, or exchanging with the public, . . . promissory notes secured directly or collaterally by liens on real property.”   The Complaint alleges Coryln’s loan was sold in violation of those provisions because WF Bank did not have a real estate broker license. (Compl. ¶¶ 16 & 25.a).  As a result, the Complaint alleges the assignment should be declared “void” pursuant to Finance Code § 22750(b). (Compl. ¶ 25.a).  Under Bus. & Prof. Code § 10133.1(a)(1), Wells Fargo Bank is expressly exempt from the licensing requirements of Section 10130.  (Bus. & Prof. Code § 10133.1(a) (“Subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 10131 . . . do not apply to any of the following: (1) Any person or employee thereof doing business under any law of this state . . . relating to banks.”) & § 10006 (“‘Person’ includes corporation, company or firm.”); see also Arzamedi v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (E.D. Cal. March 8, 2018) 2018 WL 1210978, at *4 (“Federal banks are explicitly excluded from the definition of ‘real estate licensee’ . . . .” (citing Section 10133.1(a)(1))).  And if Wells Fargo Bank was not exempt, then the claim would be preempted by federal law, which governs a bank’s rights to sell mortgages.  (See 12 U.S.C. § 371(a) (“Any national banking association may make, arrange, purchase or sell loans or extensions of credit secured by liens on interests in real estate.”); 12 C.F.R. § 34.4(a) (“A national bank may make real estate loans under 12 U.S.C. § 371 and § 34.3 without regard to state law limitations concerning: (1) Licensing . . . (10) Processing, origination, servicing, sale or purchase of, or investment or participation in, mortgages.”); see also Akopyan v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. (2013) 215 Cal. App. 4th 120, 151-158 (state law claims against Wells Fargo Bank based on violations of Bus. & Prof. Code were preempted by the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. § 21 et seq.).) Moreover, no authority supports that the sale or assignment is “void” because it was made by a non-licensed party in violation of Section 10130.  Rather, the consequences for violating Section 10130 simply subject the non-licensed party to fines or citations (Sections 10139 & 10080.9) and bars that party from recovering compensation from the transaction (Section 10136).  The Complaint alleges the assignment should be declared void under Finance Code § 22750(b), which provides that a willful violation of the Finance Code in the “making or collection of a loan” renders the loan contract “void.”  But no violation of the Finance Code is alleged based on the assignment, and in any event, Wells Fargo Bank is expressly exempt from the Finance Code’s requirements pursuant to Finance Code § 22050(a).  In relevant part, § 22050(a) states “this division [Finance Code §§ 22000-22780.1] does not apply to any person doing business under¿any law of any state . . . relating to banks.”   Aside from the claim that the assignment is void, the Complaint’s eight causes of action are all based on alleged statutory violations relating to the Note and 1st Deed of Trust.  However, as the court in the Prior Action already found, Plaintiff lacks standing to assert those claims because it is not the borrower and never assumed the loan in any writing approved by the lender, as required by the 1st Deed of Trust.  (RJN Nos. 3-5; Doss Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. A.)   Even though Plaintiff acquired title to the Property, obtaining title did not automatically make Plaintiff a successor borrower.  (Wolfert v. Guadagno (1933) 130 Cal.App.661, 663 (“It is settled law that a purchaser of real property who buys under a writing which makes his purchase ‘subject to’ a mortgage or deed of trust does not thereby assume or agree to pay the obligation so secured.”))   Rather, Plaintiff had to expressly assume the obligations in writing and obtain lender approval.  Paragraph 13 of the 1st Deed of Trust provides that “any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower’s obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower’s rights and benefits under this Security Instrument.”  (RJN No. 8); see Green v. Cent. Mortg. Co. (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2015) 2015 WL 5157479, at *5  (“[A] successor in interest does not assume a borrower’s obligations simply upon obtaining title to property when the deed of trust requires an assumption be made in writing and approved by the lender.”); Anolik v. Bank of Am. Loans (E.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2011) 2011 WL 1549291, at *1, *3 (property owner lacked standing as he “was not the borrower on the loan and had not assumed the obligations under the loan in writing and with lender’s consent, as required by the Deed of Trust”).)   Also, under the statute of frauds, any agreement to assume a secured loan or to modify a deed of trust had to be in writing and signed by the lender.  (See Civ. Code §§ 1624(a)(6) & 2922 (mortgage must be in a writing); Secrest v. Sec. Nat’l Mortg. Loan Trust 2002-2 (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 544, 553 (“An agreement to modify a contract that is subject to the statute of frauds is also subject to the statute of frauds.”); Rossberg v. Bank of Am., N.A. (2013) 219 Cal. App. 4th 1481, 1502 (2013) (statute of frauds barred cause of action against lender under deed of trust for breach of purported loan modification agreement).   As such, Pacific lacks standing, and its claims are subject to demurrer.  (See Green, 2015 WL 5157479, at *4 (“Courts thus have dismissed foreclosure-based claims—like Ms. Green’s negligent misrepresentation, fraud, wrongful foreclosure, UCL, cancellation of deed, and declaratory relief claims—by persons who were not parties to mortgage loans.”).) Moreover, even if Pacific has standing, its claims must otherwise fail based on “the tender rule.”  In a wrongful foreclosure action, the plaintiff must plead and prove that it “tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.”  (Chavez v. Indymac Mortg. Servs. (2013) 219 Cal. App. 4th 1052, 1062.)  “[T]he rationale behind the tender rule is that if [the borrower] could not have redeemed the property had the sale procedures been proper, any irregularities in the sale did not result in damages to the [borrower].”  (Turner v. Seterus, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal. App. 5th 516, 528.)  While no tender is required as to a challenge that an assignment is void, the rule applies to challenges based on other alleged irregularities, as here.  (See Yvanova v. New Century Morg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 929 n.4.)  The Complaint seeks an equitable declaration that the foreclosure sale is void as a result of a number of alleged irregularities beyond the claim that the alleged assignment is void, and as to each of those claims, the tender rule applies. (Compl. ¶ 25.b-f).  But the Complaint does not allege that Pacific tendered the total indebtedness or that it was excused from doing so based on a recognized exception to the rule.  Pacific never tendered, or offered to tender, any amount to Kwala prior to the sale.  (Dicecca Decl. ¶ 50). Thus, even assuming Pacific has standing, its claims otherwise fail based on the tender rule. Because the above bases alone support dismissing the Complaint, the Court declines to consider other grounds raised in Kwala’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant Kwala LLC’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED:  August 15, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
