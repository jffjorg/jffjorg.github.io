And here is the English text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case arises from a car accident that occurred on May 28, 2021, when Plaintiff BRENT AMIRI was driving southbound on S. Beverly Dr. and Defendant ESTHER SAEEDIAN allegedly ran a stop sign and collided with his car. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging two claims for "motor vehicle" and general negligence, but the case was dismissed due to counsel's failure to appear at the case management conference held on February 8, 2024. The Plaintiffs have moved to set aside the dismissal, citing a calendaring mistake by counsel that resulted in the failure to appear at the conference.

The Court has granted the motion, concluding that the dismissal was not procedurally equivalent to a default and that the attorney's affidavit of fault and the strong policy favoring a resolution of cases on their merits justify the setting aside of the dismissal. The case is reinstated, and a case management conference is set for October 2, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
