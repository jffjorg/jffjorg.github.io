And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Summary**

The Court has considered the special motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Defendant Scott Wells. The motion is based on the anti-SLAPP statute (California Civil Procedure Code §425.16) and seeks to strike references to an eviction proceeding and two claims for wrongful eviction and abuse of process.

The Court finds that the allegations and claims Defendant seeks to strike relate to the filing of an unlawful detainer complaint, which is subject to the litigation privilege. The litigation privilege immunizes litigants from liability for torts, other than malicious prosecution, which arise from communications in judicial proceedings.

As a result, the Court grants Defendant's special motion to strike and awards sanctions in the amount of $1,685. The Court also awards Defendant attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $1,685, based on a reasonable hourly rate of $250 and the time spent by defense counsel.

The Court concludes that Defendant has met the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute and that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the second prong. The Court finds that the claims for abuse of process and wrongful eviction are barred by the litigation privilege.

The parties are advised to file written objections to the tentative ruling within 5 days.
