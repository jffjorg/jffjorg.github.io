  Case Number:  23SMCV02070    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  BRENT AMIRI, et al.,   Plaintiffs, v.  ESTHER SAEEDIAN, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV02070     Hearing Date:  August 15, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO    SET ASIDE DISMISSAL    BACKGROUND This case arises from a car accident.  On May 28, 2021, Plaintiff Brent Amiri was driving southbound on S. Beverly Dr. at or near the intersection of Alcott St., in Los Angeles.  Plaintiff Gemma Rodriguez was a passenger in Amiri’s car.  Plaintiffs were traveling straight through the intersection when Defendant Esther Saeedian allegedly ran a stop sign and entered the intersection, colliding with Plaintiffs’ car.   Plaintiffs filed a form complaint alleging two claims for “motor vehicle” and general negligence.   A case management conference was held on February 8, 2024.  Plaintiffs failed to appear, and the Court accordingly dismissed the Complaint.   This hearing is on Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal.  Plaintiffs seek relief from the dismissal because of counsel’s calendaring mistake.  Counsel represents Plaintiff Brent Amiri in two different cases, this case and Case No. CIVSB2218364.  Plaintiff’s counsel incorrectly calendared the CMC for this case under Case No. CIVSB2218364; thus, counsel did not appear at the CMC for this case.  There was no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling. LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both discretionary and mandatory relief are available to parties when a case is dismissed.  Discretionary relief is available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Id.)  The purpose of the attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64.)  Mandatory relief is available even if counsel’s neglect was inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–517.)   An application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) “[W]hen relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Any doubt in applying section 473, subdivision (b), must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.  (Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 1474,¿1477-1478.)   Where relief is promptly sought and no prejudice would be done to the opposing party, only very slight evidence is required to justify the setting¿aside of a default.  For this reason, orders denying relief under section 473 are carefully scrutinized on appeal. (¿Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal..4th 975, 980;¿Elston v. City of Turlock¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.) DISCUSSION The mandatory relief provision of §473(b) refers to both “default judgment or dismissal”.  The inclusion of “dismissal” by the Legislature was intended to “put plaintiffs whose cases are dismissed for failing to respond to a dismissal motion on the same footing with defendants who are defaulted for failing to respond to an action.”  (Jackson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 166, 175.).   However, although the language of the mandatory provision, on its face, affords relief from unspecified ‘dismissals’ caused by attorney neglect, “our courts have, through judicial construction, prevented it from being used indiscriminately by plaintiffs’ attorneys as a ‘perfect escape hatch’ to undo dismissals of civil cases.”  (Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 961, 967.)   Courts have construed the provision as reaching only dismissals that are “procedurally equivalent to a default.”  (Jackson, 32 Cal.App.4th at 174.)  Dismissals that are sufficiently distinct from a default, thereby falling outside the scope of the mandatory provision, include “dismissals for failure to prosecute, dismissals for failure to serve a complaint within three years, dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement.” (Leader v. Health Industries of America Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.)   Here, the dismissal was not due to any of the items listed above.  Counsel attests that he failed to appear at the February 8, 2024 CMC due to a calendaring mistake.  Counsel is representing Plaintiff Amiri in two separate matters.  (Shakhgeldyan Decl. ¶2.)  The CMC was calendared in the wrong case, resulting in counsel’s failure to appear at the CMC in this case.  (Id. ¶10-11.)   Given the attorney affidavit of fault and the strong policy favoring a resolution of cases on their merits, the Court grants the motion to set aside dismissal.  (Bouvett v. Layer¿(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 43, 47¿(court properly granted relief pursuant to¿Section 473¿where counsel entered wrong date for hearing on motion and this mistake caused counsel to miss hearing); Maclas v. Vapes, 2024 Cal. Super. LEXIS 11764 at *5 (granting relief where there was a calendaring error and health issues); Mota v. Castillo, 2021 Cal. Super. LEXIS 76913 at *2 (granting relief where the attorney forgot to enter the hearing date into his calendar); Kirk v. Coe, 2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 89646 at *1-2 (granting relief where trial dates were accidentally removed from the attorney’s calendar); Munoz v. Wright, 2022 Cal. Super. LEXIS 35458 at *2 (granting relief when the attorney failed to appear for a non jury trial due to mistake or neglect).) CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside dismissal.  The action is reinstated.  The Court sets a case management conference for October 2, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: August 15, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
