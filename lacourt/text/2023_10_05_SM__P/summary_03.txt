And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendant's petition to compel arbitration is granted. The plaintiff, Poulton, had argued that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable due to procedural and substantive unconscionability. The judge finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable as there is no evidence of surprise or oppression in the formation of the contract. The judge also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable as it is bilateral and applies only to claims related to Poulton's employment. The judge orders the matter to be referred to arbitration and stays the action. A status conference will be set to review the status of the arbitration in 6-9 months.
