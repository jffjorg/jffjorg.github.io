Shamooil v. State
Farm, Case No. 23SMCV02897
Hearing Date
October 5, 2023 
Defendant State
Farm’s Motion for Second Physical Examination 
 
In this uninsured
motorist case, plaintiff claims migraines and has been treated by a
neurologist. Shepard Decl. Ex. A, form interrogatory responses. State Farm conducted
an orthopedic examination and seeks to conduct a second, neurologic examination.

 
A party may
conduct one physical or mental examination of another party if the party’s
physical or mental state is at issue as a matter of right, but further examinations
require leave of the court and a showing of good cause. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§2032.020. 
 
Shamooil claims
ongoing migraines as a result of the inciden and has seen a neurologist three
times. Shepard decl. exhibit A. In opposition, Shamooil argues the headaches
are not neurological in origin, but she has been treated by a neurologist (see
response to form interrogatory 6.4). This is an adequate basis to allow State
Farm to conduct a neurological examination.
 
Shamooil also
opposes the motion on the grounds that it does not include a separate
statement. While a separate statement is required for a motion to compel
further responses to discovery requests, it is not necessary for a motion
requesting a second physical examination. GRANTED.
