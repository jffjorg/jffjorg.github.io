And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shamooil v. State Farm, granting State Farm's motion for a second physical examination. The case involves an uninsured motorist claim, and Shamooil claims to have migraines that have been treated by a neurologist. State Farm had previously conducted an orthopedic examination, and now seeks to conduct a second, neurologic examination to determine the origin of Shamooil's headaches. The judge finds that, under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง2032.020, State Farm has shown good cause to conduct the examination, as Shamooil's physical state is at issue. The judge also notes that a separate statement is not required for a motion requesting a second physical examination.
