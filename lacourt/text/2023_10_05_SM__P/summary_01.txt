Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the defendant, Chompol Properties, LLC, and its members. The judge has granted summary adjudication in favor of the defendants on the assault and battery claims, finding that the undisputed evidence shows that the bouncers were independent contractors and not employees of Chompol Properties, LLC. The judge has also granted summary adjudication in favor of the defendants on the breach of contract cause of action, finding that Adefuye admitted no contract existed between him and Chompol. Finally, the judge has denied summary adjudication on the premises liability cause of action, finding that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether the presence of untrained, unsupervised security guards at the Surly Goat constituted a dangerous condition.
