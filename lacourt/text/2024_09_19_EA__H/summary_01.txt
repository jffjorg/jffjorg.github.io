And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Allison L. Westfahl Kong has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for a new trial. The Plaintiffs, Aknine Group Inc., Key Ecommerce Inc., and Yizhong Chen, alleged that their former employee, Zhongliang Wang, embezzled $4.5 million from their business bank accounts and transferred the funds to various bank accounts controlled by him. The Plaintiffs had previously filed a First Amended Complaint asserting causes of action against Wang and several other defendants.

The Court had previously granted a preliminary injunction, ordering the Defendants to return the funds to the Plaintiffs and requiring the Plaintiffs to maintain and provide a detailed accounting of the receipt and usage of the funds. However, the Court later granted Defendant Wang's motion to vacate and set aside the preliminary injunction, ordering the Plaintiffs to transfer the funds back into a trust account.

The Plaintiffs had filed a motion for new trial, citing various Code of Civil Procedure sections. However, the Court has denied the motion, stating that there has not been a "trial" in this matter, and therefore, the motion is not applicable. The Court also noted that there has been no verdict or judgment entered in this case.
