ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
 
Hon. Allison L. Westfahl Kong
  Department H
September 19, 2024



 
Plaintiffs’
motion for a new trial is DENIED.
Plaintiffs Aknine Group Inc. (“Aknine”), Key
Ecommerce Inc. (“KEI”), and Yizhong Chen (“Chen”) (together, “Plaintiffs”)
allege that their former employee, Zhongliang Wang (“Wang”), embezzled at least
$4.5 million from Plaintiffs’ various business bank accounts between August 26,
2022 and September 9, 2022 and transferred the funds to various bank accounts
solely controlled and managed by him, including those opened in the names of AZ Express Group Inc. (“AZ Express”), KB Int’l Inc. (“KB
Int’l”), Luckie Trading LLC (“Luckie Trading”) and EZ Supply Group LLC (“EZ
Supply”) (collectively, “Defendants”). On
September 12, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting
causes of action against Wang, AZ Express, KB Int’l, Luckie Trading, EZ Supply,
and Does 1-50 for (1) breach of contract, (2) conversion, (3) breach of
fiduciary duty, (4) theft and misappropriation under California Penal Code §
496(c); and (5) unjust enrichment.
On May 2, 2023, pursuant to the parties’
stipulation, the Court (the Honorable Thomas Falls) issued an order granting
Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Court ordered Defendants to
return to Plaintiffs all proceeds, monies, funding, cash, and savings obtained
by Defendants. The Court ordered Plaintiffs to maintain and provide a detailed
accounting of the receipt and usage of any funding returned to Defendants and
ordered Plaintiffs to use the funds in the normal course of business.
On March 7, 2024, the Court (the Honorable Bryant Y. Yang) granted Defendant Wang’s Motion to Vacate and Set Aside the May 2, 2023
Order because the motion was not opposed and because Plaintiffs had failed to
comply with the Court’s order to provide a detailed accounting of the funds.
The Court ordered Plaintiffs to transfer the funds back into a trust account.
On July 31, and August 1, 2024, Judge Yang held an
evidentiary hearing to obtain an accounting of the funds and to determine how
the funds were used by Plaintiffs. Following the hearing, the Court found that
Plaintiffs had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the
funds transferred by Defendants to Plaintiffs were used in the normal course of
business, as required by the May 2, 2023 Order. Accordingly, on August 1, 2024,
the Court ordered Plaintiffs to post bond in the amount of $2,956,675.49 or
transfer said amount into the trust account by September 30, 2024.
Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for New Trial under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 660, 661, 629, 657, 658, 659, and 664.5. Plaintiffs’
motion fails because there has not been a “trial” in this matter. (Code Civ. Proc., § 657 [delineating circumstances where new
trial motion can be granted].) There similarly has been no verdict or judgment entered in this case. While
a motion for new trial may be proper “where judgment had been entered in
a number of situations, including judgment on the pleadings, judgment for
failure to state a cause of action, judgment after a plaintiff's opening
statement or at the close of a plaintiff’s evidence, judgment on a directed
verdict, judgment after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and
judgment on an agreed statement of ultimate facts,” State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co. v. Superior Ct. (2004) 121 Cal. App. 4th 490, 498, here, there has
been no judgment. None of the authorities cited by Plaintiffs holds that a new
trial motion is appropriate in this context. The motion is summarily denied.
