Significant Statements:
  - "The Court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a demurrer, only where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court." (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed." (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)
  - "Plaintiffs have failed to factually allege circumstances of malice, oppression, and/or fraud. Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations that moving defendants knew or should have known of the alleged dangerous condition and had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition is insufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages."
  - "The Court declines to consider Plaintiffs' argument pertaining to CalMat's purported disregard of a 'left turn only' sign, as it is extrinsic to the face of the pleading and not properly before the Court through a judicially noticeable document."
  - "Plaintiffs have failed to allege a duty, let alone a breach of duty. The demurrer is sustained."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on three motions: CalMat's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, SoCal Sealcoat, Meister, Thorson, and Held's motion to strike, and CalMat's motion to strike. The judge is denying the SoCal Sealcoat, Meister, Thorson, and Held motion to strike in part and granting it in part. The judge is sustaining CalMat's demurrer and denying its motion to strike as moot. The judge is also denying the motion to strike the punitive damages claims.

The judge is ruling that the plaintiff's decedent was killed in a motorcycle accident and that the plaintiff's decedent was allegedly killed due to the negligence or willful conduct of the defendants. The judge is finding that the plaintiff's decedent was allegedly killed due to the failure of the defendants to take measures to prevent the accident.

The judge is also ruling that the plaintiff's conclusory allegations that the defendants knew or should have known of the alleged dangerous condition and had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition are insufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages. The judge is further ruling that the plaintiff's failure to allege a duty, let alone a breach of duty, is sufficient to sustain CalMat's demurrer.
