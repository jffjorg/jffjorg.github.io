Here is a summary of the document in English text:

The document is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Holly J. Fujie on July 26, 2024, in a class action lawsuit filed by Jorge L. Vasquez Hernandez against Caliber Aerospace, LLC, and Employer Solutions Staffing Group II, LLC. The lawsuit alleges violations of California labor laws, including failure to pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, and keep accurate records. The tentative ruling grants the motion for preliminary approval of the class and PAGA representative action settlement.

The settlement was reached through arm's-length bargaining and provides for a gross settlement amount of $110,000.00, which will be distributed to class members based on their number of workweeks during the class period. The settlement also provides for attorney fees, class counsel litigation expenses, and settlement administration fees.

The court finds that the settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the parties have demonstrated compliance with Labor Code section 2699(l)(2) by submitting the proposed settlement to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. The court sets a final approval hearing for November 5, 2024, and orders the parties to provide notice of the tentative ruling.
