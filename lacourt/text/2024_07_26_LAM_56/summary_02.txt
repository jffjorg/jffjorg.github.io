Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Simco Pacific Corp. The motion is based on a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs, Dr. Payam Vahedifar and Shadi Vahedifar, and Simco Pacific Corp. The settlement agreement provides for payment of $3,000 to the plaintiffs in exchange for dismissal of their claims.

The court has reviewed the settlement agreement and finds that it was entered into in good faith. The settlement amount of $3,000, when combined with the $76,000 that the plaintiffs have already received in a prior settlement, is more than double the amount of the at-issue property deposit. The court finds that this rough approximation of the plaintiffs' total recovery does not weigh against a finding of good faith.

Since the motion is unopposed, there is no evidence to suggest that the settlement agreement was not entered into in good faith. The court grants the motion and finds that the settlement agreement was entered into in good faith.
