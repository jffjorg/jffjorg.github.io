And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion for an order to show cause re: contempt against plaintiff Jane Doe. The defendant had argued that Jane Doe failed to provide notice or copies of her ex parte applications for accommodations, as required by California Rules of Court 3.1203(a) and 3.1206, and that she failed to provide medical records establishing her claimed disability, as required by Vesco v. Superior Court. The defendant also pointed out that Jane Doe attended and argued at an appellate hearing in a different matter, despite her claimed need for accommodations.

However, the judge finds that the defendant has not met its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that Jane Doe unlawfully interfered with the proceedings of the court. The judge notes that Jane Doe is not required to provide notice of her requests for accommodations, and that she is not required to provide medical documentation to the defendant unless a Vesco hearing is ordered. The judge will order Vesco hearings for any further requests for accommodations, so that the defendant can review medical records and argue any requested continuance or accommodation.
