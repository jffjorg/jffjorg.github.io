Doe v. Olson, Case no. SC126806
Hearing date October 25, 2024
Defendants’
Motion for Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt Against Plaintiff Jane Doe
Plaintiffs
Jane and May Doe, in pro per, and plaintiff John Doe sue defendants
Curtis Olson, Nexus Development Corporation and 14 others for 38 COAs arising
out of alleged sexual assault, battery and harassment. Defendants filed a
demurrer, a motion to strike and motions to compel discovery. Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed requests for ADA accommodations under Cal. Rules of Court 1.100 on 7/17/2024
and 8/1/2024. 
Defendants
assert plaintiff Jane Doe’s requests were not made in good faith and ask the
court to set an OSC re: contempt. Defendants offer the declarations of counsel Partida
and Eballar. Plaintiff Jane doe opposes, offering her own declaration and that
of limited counsel G. Scott Sobel.
“[T]he
following acts or omissions in respect to a court of justice, or proceedings
therein, are contempts of the authority of the court: (9) Any other unlawful
interference with the process or proceedings of a court.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§1209(a)(9). "Civil contempt proceedings under CCP §§1209-1222, whether
punitive or coercive, may arise out of either civil or criminal litigation.
Furthermore, even though they are denominated civil, these proceedings are
criminal in nature because of the penalties that a judge may impose. The
constitutional rights of the accused must be observed.” See Koehler
v. Superior Court (2010) 181 Cal. App.4th 1153, 1158. 
Defendants
assert plaintiff failed to provide notice or copies of her ex parte
applications for accommodations. Decl. Partida para. 4. “A party seeking an ex
parte order must notify all parties no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day
before the ex parte appearance, absent a showing of exceptional
circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice.” Cal. Rules of Court 3.1203(a).
Parties “must serve the ex parte application…on all other appearing
parties at the first reasonable opportunity. Absent exceptional circumstances,
no hearing may be conducted unless such service has been made.” Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1206. Defendants argue plaintiff failed to provide notice of the ex
parte applications in violation of Cal. Rules of Court 3.1203(a) and
3.1206, and unlawfully interference with the proceedings of the court under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1209(a)(9).
Defendants
argue plaintiff failed to provide medical records establishing her claimed
disability, as required by Vesco v. Superior Court (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 275, 279. Decl. Partida para. 4. Defendants argue this constitutes
additional unlawful interference under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1209(a)(9).
Plaintiff
is not required to give notice of requests for accommodations. Cal. Rules of
Court 1.100(c). Plaintiff is also not required to provide medical documentation
to defendants unless the court orders a Vesco hearing. The court will
order Vesco hearings for any further requests for accommodations so as
not to infringe on defendants’ rights. At any future Vesco hearing
plaintiff will be required to produce medical records establishing the claimed
disability. Supra, at 275.
Defendants
assert that despite plaintiff’s 8/1/2024 request for accommodations, she
attended and argued at an appellate hearing in a different matter on 8/8/2024.
Decl. Eballar para. 4. They argue this demonstrates plaintiff’s requests for
accommodations were made in bad faith and in an attempt to delay litigation. 
Plaintiff
asserts her requested accommodations and continuances resulted from injuries to
her wrist in a severe accident. Decl. Jane Doe paras. 2-3; Decl. Sobel paras.
2-4. Plaintiff asserts these injuries prevented her from completing paperwork
which, as she was proceeding in pro per, necessitated the requested continuations
but did not prevent her from delivering oral arguments in the other matter.
Decl. Jane para. 6. 
Defendants
bear the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that plaintiff unlawfully
interfered with the proceedings of the court. In re MR, supra;
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1209(a)(9). An OSC re: contempt is not appropriate on the
facts presented. DENIED. However, to the extent any further requests are made
by Jane Doe, the court will order a Vesco hearing, wherein defendants will have
an opportunity to review medical records and argue any requested continuance or
accommodation.
