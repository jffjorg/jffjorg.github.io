And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering two motions for attorney's fees filed by the plaintiff, Hannah Vu, M.D. The first motion seeks attorney's fees and costs for the appeal of the judgment, and the second motion seeks attorney's fees and costs for collection efforts. The judge grants both motions, finding that the rates and hours billed by the plaintiff's counsel are reasonable, although there are some slight inefficiencies. The judge orders the defendant to pay an additional $47,849.35 in attorney's fees and costs.
