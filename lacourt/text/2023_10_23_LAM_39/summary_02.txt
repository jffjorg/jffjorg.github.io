And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant BF Properties 1, LLC's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The judge has granted the motion, finding that Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. Specifically, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendant's officers, directors, or managing agents acted with malice, oppression, fraud, or recklessness in deciding not to remedy issues with the apartment. The judge has denied Plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint to re-allege the claim for punitive damages, but has left the door open for Plaintiffs to seek leave to amend in the future if they develop sufficient facts to support their claim. The judge has also ordered Defendant to file an answer within 30 days.
