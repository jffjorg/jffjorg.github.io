Legal
Standard
 
With respect to attorney fees
and costs, unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§
1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP
§ 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for
attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP
§§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall
determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of
suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).)¿Any notice of
motion to claim attorney fees as an element of costs under shall be served and
filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed;
if only attorney fees are claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be
served and filed within the time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a
memorandum of costs.¿(CRC 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc.
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.) 
 
“It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the
absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A]
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)¿General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 

 
Analysis
 
Defendant Sotheby’s International
Realty Inc. (SIR) moves for an award of contractual Attorneys’ Fees against
Plaintiff Ryan Ben Davis in the sum of $76,574.07. (Civ. Code § 1717; CRC
Rule 3.1702.) 
 
SIR argues that it is the prevailing
party from the mandatory dismissal under the 5-year statute on June 16, 2023. Indeed,
the Court granted SIR’s motion to dismiss due to Plaintiff’s failure to bring
this action to trial within 5 years. SIR also shows that the contract giving
rise to this action has an attorneys’ fees clause. Specifically, section 17 of
the ICA provides: “In any action, proceeding, or arbitration between Broker and
Associate-Licensee arising from or related to this Agreement, the prevailing
Broker or Associate-Licensee shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and
costs.” In light of the disposition of the arbitration and the mandatory
dismissal of the instant action, SIR is entitled to its attorneys’ fees as the
prevailing party.
 
Plaintiff argues that because the arbitrator
declined to conduct the arbitration, there was no award, and therefore, no
prevailing party. Plaintiff contends that if fees were to be awarded, only the
arbitrator has jurisdiction. (See Corona v. Amherst Partners (2003) 107
Cal. App. 4th 701 [while confirming the arbitration award, the trial court lacked
jurisdiction to award fees where plaintiff's entitlement to fees was within the
scope of the arbitration agreement and plaintiff did not bring the issue before
the arbitrator]; Heimlich v. Shivji (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 350 [“Shivji was
required to request costs from the arbitrator in the first instance. Failure to
do so would have precluded relief.”].) The cited cases are materially
distinguishable from the facts of this matter. Each of the above-cited cases involved
a completed arbitration with a party seeking to enforce or vacate an award. Here,
the arbitrator refused to proceed with the arbitration and did not issue an
award at all. There is no arbitration award to confirm or vacate. As such, the
Court is not confined to the same statutory strictures as the trial courts in
the above cases. 
 
The specific contract language also
undercuts Plaintiff’s position. At section 10 of the underlying agreement, the
arbitration clause provides that “All disputes or claims between
Associate-Licensee and other licensee(s) associated with Broker, or between Associate-Licensee
and Broker, arising from or connected in any way with this Agreement, which
cannot be adjusted between the parties involved, shall be submitted to the Association
of REALORS®… If the Association declines jurisdiction over the dispute, then
arbitration shall be pursuant to the rules of California law.” (Ex. 3 § 10,
emphasis added.) Here, the Association indisputably refused jurisdiction over
the action. As stated by counsel for the court ordered arbitrator, the Greater
Los Angeles Realtors, the Association “leave[s] it to the Court as to how to
proceed in this matter, but this Association will have nothing further to do
with the matter. (Henein Decl. iso Opposition to Motions to Dismiss, Ex. O.)
Thus, following the Association’s refusal to arbitrate, the case proceeds under
California law. When contractually agreed-upon, California law requires the
Court to award fees to prevailing parties. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) As noted
above, the parties’ contract had a prevailing-party attorneys’ fees clause. Accordingly,
the Court will grant fees.

            SIR’s counsel provides
verified billing records. (See Trester Decl., Ex. 7.) The billing statements
claim $76,574.00 in fees related to this action. Counsel provides a foundation
for the reasonableness of the rates, as well as totals for each of the seven years
this action was pending. (Id., ¶¶ 10-17.) Counsel also provides foundation for
the reply fees of $1,200.00. (Mollis Decl., ¶ 5.) 
 
            Plaintiff
objects to $13,575.25 in fees because such fees were incurred in connection
with a previous case in which the arbitrators held that the parties shall bear
their own fees and costs. Plaintiff explains that SIR was not a party to this
action until December 23, 2015, when he filed the first amended complaint.
Plaintiff observes that the last entry for 2015 shows a review of a petition to
correct award. Plaintiff notes that the award provided that all parties were to
bear their own fees and costs. (Henein Decl., ¶ 14.) Plaintiff requests that
the court strike $8,902.50 requested for work done in 2014 and 2015, and $4,672.75
requested for work from January 2016 through April 2016. Plaintiff shows that
the above fees are not associated with this action, but a separate action
subject to an arbitration award. SIR does not respond to this contention in
reply. Thus, the $13,575.25 fees will be stricken as requested. 
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED. Fees are awarded in the reduced total amount of $64,198.75.
