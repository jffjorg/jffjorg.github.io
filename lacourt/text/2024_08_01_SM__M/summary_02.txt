And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion to strike (a special motion to strike) brought by the defendant, Robert Wiener, against the plaintiff, Gyanmitra Prasad. Wiener is trying to get the court to strike certain claims made by Prasad in his complaint. The court is considering whether Wiener's actions, including sending letters to Prasad, were protected under the anti-SLAPP statute, which is designed to shield defendants from meritless claims arising from protected activity.

The court finds that Wiener's May 5, 2022, letter and two December 2022 letters are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. These letters were part of a dispute between Prasad and Wiener over Prasad's termination from employment. The court also finds that Wiener's failure to return funds to Prasad, which were withdrawn from a joint account, is not protected under the anti-SLAPP statute.

The court grants the special motion to strike in part, but not entirely. The court finds that Prasad has failed to provide evidence to support his claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. The court also finds that Wiener's malpractice claim is not protected under the anti-SLAPP statute.

Finally, the court grants, in part, Wiener's request for attorneys' fees.
