Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Honda of Santa Monica's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Cheatham, had filed a complaint alleging fraud, recission, and violation of trust in connection with the purchase of a 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid vehicle. The court found that Honda of Santa Monica presented evidence that it made no misrepresentations regarding the down payment or nature of the loan, and that the plaintiff's allegations of misrepresentation were unfounded. The court concluded that the plaintiff did not meet his burden to show a dispute of material fact and therefore granted the motion for summary judgment.
