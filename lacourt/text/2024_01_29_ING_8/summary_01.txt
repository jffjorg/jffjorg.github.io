And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint on June 29, 2022, and had previously moved to continue the trial date to May 17, 2024. The plaintiffs had also filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint on January 2, 2024, and had not received opposition to this motion. The judge notes that the plaintiffs have been aggressively pursuing additional information regarding the defendant, Ultracor, inc., and have encountered various roadblocks in their efforts to amend and update their complaint. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but wants to ensure that the plaintiffs do not need to continue the trial date in the related case. The judge also requests information on whether Ultracor's principal, Nongkhai, attended her deposition on January 17, 2024.
