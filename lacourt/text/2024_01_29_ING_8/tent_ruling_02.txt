I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff,
Ronald Guritzky (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, Herbert J.
Henry, Jr., and DOES 1 through 10. On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of
Promissory Note; (2) Breach of Contract; (3) Common Counts – Open Book Account;
and (4) Common Counts – Account Stated. 
 
On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded on Defendant his first set of discovery requests. On August 7, 2023,
Plaintiff notes that Defendant served his responses to Plaintiffs discovery
requests. Plaintiff contended that Defendant’s responses were deficient
procedurally and substantively, and not Code-compliant. As a result, on August
18, 2023, Plaintiff sent a letter to defendant outlining the deficiencies in
his responses. Having no response received by August 28, 2023, nor in response
to a follow-up letter, Plaintiff has brought these four motions to compel
further responses. 
 
On December 5, 2023, this Court
continued the hearing and ordered the parties to meet and confer prior to the
next hearing regarding discovery, to see if the scope of the matters in dispute
could be narrowed and requiring Plaintiff to submit a status report to the
Court detailing the outcome of the meet and confer. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed his motions to
compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission, Set One. To
date, no opposition briefs have been filed. 
On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff submitted the Court-ordered status report
on the matters remaining in dispute. 
 
¿II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Motions to
Compel Responses 
 
Per Plaintiff’s status report, Plaintiff
asserts that the parties had agreed and compromised as to what defendant would
be producing: 
 
1.      Form
Interrogatories.
As to the Form Interrogatories, Defendant would provide responses that are code
compliant and, if there are any objections, contain only proper objections, as
to form interrogatory numbers 2.8, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.2 - 50.6. In the spirit
of good faith and compromise in the discovery process, Plaintiff agreed to
withdraw his request for a further response to form interrogatory number 50.1.
2.      Request for Admissions:
As to the Requests for Admissions, Defendant would provide responses that are
code compliant and, if there are any objections, contain only proper
objections, as to requests for admissions numbers 1-25.
3.      Requests for Production;
As to the Requests for Production, Defendant would provide responses that are
code compliant and, if there are any objections, contain only proper
objections, as to requests for production numbers 1-26. 
4.      Special
Interrogatories:
As to the Special Interrogatories, Defendant would provide responses that are
code compliant and, if there are any objections, contain only proper objections
as to special interrogatory numbers 2,3,7,8,9,10,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 and
25. In the spirit of good faith and compromise in the discovery process,
Plaintiff agreed to withdraw his request for further responses to special
interrogatory numbers 6,11,15,16 and 27.
 
Plaintiff also indicates the parties
agreed Defendant would provide the responses by a certain date, which was twice
moved back but still well before this hearing. 
By January 16, 2023, per Plaintiff’s status report Defendant emailed
further responses to all four of the pending discovery requests but the
Requests for Production still lacked a signature. Further, Plaintiff notes that
the verified responses produced on January 16, 2023 were different than the
responses produced on January 12, 2023. After review of these, Plaintiff notes
that there are still issues with the following: 
1.      Form
Interrogatory Response Nos.: 50.3 — 50.6 still
contain what Plaintiff contends to be meritless and improper objections and
inadequate and/or evasive responses; 
2.      Request
for Production of Documents Response Nos.: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 17,
18, 21, 22, and 24, which indicate responsive documents exist, are still
non-compliant with Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.280(a) as referenced
herein above. 
3.      Special
Interrogatory Response Nos.: 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22,
24, 26 and 27, still contain what Plaintiff contends to be meritless and
improper objections and inadequate and/or evasive responses.
Based on the above, this Court analyzes the responses below.
 
First, with respect to Plaintiff’s
observation that the substantive responses changed between one date and another
in January of 2024, the Court is only concerned with the verified response, and
if the verified responses are different from unverified ones, the Court will
ignore the differences.  As to the Form
interrogatories remining at issue, the  Court GRANTS Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Form Interrogatory No. 50.3, and orders Defendant to provide a
still further verified answer without objection by February 23, 2024.  As to FROGS 50.4-50.6 the Court finds Defendant
provided sufficient answers, subject to objections that the Court overrules.  Thus, the Court orders the answers to stand
and the objections to fall.  
For the Motion to Compel further
responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, the Court is confused
what the reference is to Defendant’s First View of Exhibit A on 12.22.2022 as
referencing RFP No. 1 and 2. This confusion will likely require further
responses, to be discussed at oral argument. For RFP Nos. 4, 5, 7, 10, 17, 18,
21, 22, and 24, Defendant indicates he will comply in whole or part with the request
but does not provide an answer or reference to any documents.  A party intending to respond to a category of
demanded documents by reference to documents being produced is required to identify,
such as by Bates number, or the produced documents themselves “shall be
identified with the specific request number to which the documents
respond.”  Code of Civil Proc. §
2031.280(a).   Accordingly, Defendant’s further responses are
not Code compliant. As such, the Court GRANTS the motion as to all of RFPs 4,
5, 7, 10, 17, 18, 21, 22, and 24, ad orders Defendant to provide a further
verified written response without objection by February 23, 2024 days AND to
produce the requested documents also by that date in accordance with the
requirements of Section 2031.280(a).   RFPs 1 and 2 may also fall into this same ruling
depending on what the parties explain about the “First View.”  
Lastly, for the Motion to Compel Responses
to the Special Interrogatories, The Court will address each remaining SROG in
dispute below. As to SROG No. 11, Defendant’s additional response does not answer
the requested question, so the Court GRANTS the motion to compel further
response, and the Court Orders Defendant to provide a still further verified
answer by February 23, 2024.  Special
Interrogatory 14 requires further response as the objection is overruled.
Special Interrogatories Nos. 15 and 16 are not, in the Court’s view, irrelevant,
so the objections to each are also overruled. Next, Special Interrogatory 17 seems
sufficiently responded to, even if they are not the responses Plaintiff is
looking for. For Special Interrogatories Nos. 22 and 24 the answers given to
date are insufficient and require further response as they do not answer the
question being asked. For Special Interrogatories Nos. 26 and 27, these again require
further responses as the answer given does not answer the question being asked.
  The Court thus order verified, still
further responses to SROGs 11, 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 26, and 27, without objection,
by February 23, 2024.  
            In addition to the four substantive motions,
three of which the Court has granted in whole or in part, Plaintiff also requests
monetary sanctions to be awarded against Defendant in the amount of $2,682 for
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs, $1,957.50 for the Motion as to
Special Interrogatories, and $1,440 for the motion as to Form Interrogatories. Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate is asserted as $345, and the hours spent on each motion
appear to be largely reasonable. Because Plaintiff has continuously had to
follow up on these motions, because Defendant did not provide any opposition to
the motions nor a separate statement, because Defendant originally provided unverified
responses and failed to comply with the law regarding the identification of documents
produced to correspond to the categories of the RFPs to which they correspond, because
two hearing were required in order to obtain partial compliance but still
further verified responses are required, the Court finds Defendant has engaged
in misuse of the discovery process within the meaning of Code of Civil
Procedure §2023.010(d), (e), and (f) without substantial justification.  Accordingly, the Court awards Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions in the amount of $5,000 as against Defendant, to be paid
to counsel for Plaintiff by February 23, 2024. 
 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give written notice of the Court’s
rulings.
