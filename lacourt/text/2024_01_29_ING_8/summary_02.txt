The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses from the Defendant, Herbert James Henry, Jr., etc., et al., in the case of Ronald Guritzky v. Herbert James Henry, Jr., etc., et al. (22TRCV01468). The Plaintiff, Ronald Guritzky, filed a Complaint against the Defendant on December 12, 2023, and a First Amended Complaint on December 14, 2023. The Plaintiff propounded discovery requests on May 22, 2023, and the Defendant served responses on August 7, 2023. However, the Plaintiff contends that the Defendant's responses were deficient procedurally and substantively, and not Code-compliant. The Plaintiff brought four motions to compel further responses, which the Defendant did not oppose.

The Judge granted the motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents, ordering the Defendant to provide verified responses without objection by February 23, 2024. The Judge also ordered the Defendant to produce the requested documents in accordance with the requirements of Section 2031.280(a). The Judge awarded the Plaintiff $5,000 in sanctions against the Defendant for engaging in misuse of the discovery process without substantial justification.
