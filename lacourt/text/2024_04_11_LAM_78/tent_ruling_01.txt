(KlopstockDecl., ¶4.) Plaintiff also provides a copy of the invoice showing Assignor deducted a credit of $2,250.15 from Defendant’s premium, leaving a debt of $31,415.34. (Id., Exh 1.) The demand for damages is supported by evidence.Plaintiff requests $3,555.93 in interest at a rate of 10% per annum, which is permitted under Civ. Code, section 3289(b) for a breach of contract action. Plaintiff’s counsel properly provides a calculation of interest. (Jyoo Decl., ¶4.)Plaintiff also seeks $1,200 in attorney’s fees. Attorney’s fees are permitted by statute. Plaintiff cites Civ. Code, section 1717.5, which provides that in any action on a contract based on a book account entered into on or after January 1, 1987, which does not provide for attorney’s fees and costs, the party who is determined to be the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees. Attorney’s fees allowed pursuant to this section shall be the lesser of the maximum amount allowed by this section, the amount provided by any default attorney’s fee schedule, or an amount as otherwise provided by the court. (Civ. Code, section 1717.5(b).) Local Rule of the Court, rule 3.214(a) provides, in relevant part: When a promissory note, contract, or statute provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees, the following schedule will apply to the amount of the new judgement unless otherwise determined by the court. Default case: $0.01 to $1,000, 15% with a minimum of $75.00; $1,000.01 to $10,000, $150 plus 6% of the excess over $1,000; $10,000.01 to $50,000, $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000; $50,000.01 to $100,000, $1,890 plus 2% of the excess over $50,000; Over $100,000, $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000.The calculation under Rule 3.214(a) is (($31,415.34 - $10,000) X .03) + 690 = $1,332.46. Because the amount provided under Civ. Code 1717.5, $1,200, is less than the amount provided under Rule 3.214(a), the proper award is $1,200.Plaintiff seeks to recover costs for filing fees and service of process. These costs are allowable.
