And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff's counsel reported that the dismissal arose from a mistake due to a medical condition, and the court found that this was a valid reason to set aside the dismissal. The court has also set a new hearing to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute diligently and failure to serve promptly.
