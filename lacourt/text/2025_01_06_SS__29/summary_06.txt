Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial in this medical negligence case. The plaintiff's counsel has been experiencing serious medical issues and has not yet fully recovered. The judge has found that this constitutes "good cause" for a continuance, and has therefore granted the motion. The trial has been continued to a date on or after July 22, 2025. The judge has also reset the final status conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
