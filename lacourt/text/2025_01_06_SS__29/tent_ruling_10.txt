Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019.
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on
July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024,
Plaintiffs amended their complaint to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John
Ivascyn as Doe 2.
On March 22, 2024, Wanda and John Ivascyn
filed an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The cross-complaint was
dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On October 22 and November 22, 2024, the
Court granted the motion of Plaintiffs’ former counsel to be relieved.
Before the Court and set for hearing on January
6, 2025, are four discovery motions filed by Defendant on November 12, 2024:
(1) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to Respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set Two); (2) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to
Respond to Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One); (3) Motion to Compel
Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to Respond to Supplemental Requests for Production
(Set One); and (4) Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to Have
Admitted the Truth of the Matters Specified in Requests
for Admission (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions in
each motion.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a
motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents
are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move
for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely
response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has
engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On August 21 and September 24, 2024,
Defendant served Erick Ojeda with Form Interrogatories (Set Two), Supplemental
Interrogatories (Set One), Supplemental Requests for Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Zuniga
Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff Erick
Ojeda has not responded. (Id., ¶¶ 3-5.)
Defendant need show nothing more.
The Court grants the motions to compel and
grants the request for a deemed-admitted order.
On the three motions to compel, the requests
for sanctions are denied.  In the
chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing interrogatories and requests for
production, the Legislature has authorized sanctions in the context of a motion
to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiff Erick
Ojeda has not opposed the motions.
On the motion for a deemed-admitted order,
the request for sanctions is granted.  In
the chapter of the Civil Discovery Act governing requests for admissions, the
Legislature has provided that sanctions are mandatory against a party whose
failure to respond to requests for admission necessitates a motion for a
deemed-admitted matter.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff’s failure to
respond has necessitated this motion.
The Court sets
sanctions in the requested amount of $455.34, based on two hours of attorney
time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $160.17 per hour, plus
one hour of legal assistant time at a reasonable rate of $75 per hour, plus a
$60 filing fee.  (Zuniga Decl., ¶ 5.)

The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to
compel Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to respond to Form Interrogatories, Supplemental
Interrogatories, and Supplemental Requests for Production.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Erick Ojeda to
serve written, code-compliant, verified responses, without objection, to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set Two), within 10 days of notice.

deemed-admitted order.
