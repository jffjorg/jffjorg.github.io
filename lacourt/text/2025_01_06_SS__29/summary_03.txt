And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the City of Los Angeles's motion for leave to serve a late designation of expert witnesses. The City had previously served a demand for the exchange of witness information, but due to various circumstances, including the departure of an attorney and the service of expert designations to the wrong person, the City was unable to serve its expert designation in a timely manner. The judge found that the City had not relied on the absence of a list of expert witnesses to its disadvantage and that there was no unfair prejudice to the plaintiff in allowing the tardy designation. The motion is granted, but is conditioned upon the City making all designated experts available for deposition by January 17, 2025.
