Background
On October 27, 2021, Reza Mohammad Rejaeian (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Ralphs; The Kroger Co.; Ralphs Grocery Company;
Kroger; Owners of Property located at 22915 Victory Blvd., West Hills, CA 91307;
and Does 1 through 50, asserting a cause of action for general negligence arising
out of injuries that Plaintiff alleges he sustained on October 30, 2019.
 
On May 4, 2023, Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs (erroneously
sued as Ralphs, The Kroger Co., Ralphs Grocery Company, and Kroger) (“Defendant”)
filed an answer.
 
On November 7, 2024, Defendant filed these
four motions: (1) Motion to Compel Plaintiff to
Respond to Form Interrogatories (Set Two); (2) Motion to Compel Plaintiff
to Respond to Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One);
(3) Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Supplemental
Requests for Production (Set One); and (4) Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff to
Have Admitted the Truth of the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set
One).  Defendant seeks sanctions in each
motion.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On September 11, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set
Two), Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One), Supplemental Requests for Production
(Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One). (Feffer Decls., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the discovery. (Id.,
¶ 7.) 
Defendant need show nothing more.
The motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the form interrogatories, supplemental interrogatories, and supplemental requests
for production are granted.
The motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to
have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for admission is
granted.
The requests for sanctions in connection with
the form interrogatories, supplemental interrogatories, and requests for
production are denied.  In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, no opposition has been filed.
The request for sanctions in
connection with the requests for admission is granted.  The chapter in the Civil Discovery Act
governing requests for admission provides for a “mandatory” imposition of
sanctions “on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [for a
deemed-admitted order].”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response has necessitated this
motion.
The Court sets sanctions in the
amount of $510, calculated based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by
counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Feffer Decl., ¶ 10.)
