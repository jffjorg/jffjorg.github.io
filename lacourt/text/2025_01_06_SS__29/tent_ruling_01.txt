19STCV29995
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant Jonathan A. Almache 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
 
Background
The
procedural history of these matters (including the related and consolidated cases)
is somewhat complex, and the Court will not attempt to summarize that history
here.
 
As is
particularly relevant here, in the lead case, Matthew Cawley filed the
complaint on August 22, 2019 against Jonathan Alexander Almache (“Defendant”), Viviana
Almache, and Does 1 through 100.
 
Four
days later, in one of the consolidated cases, Plaintiffs
Joselyn Pham, Steven Uy and Jeffrey Zhu (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against
Lyft, Inc. Matthew Cawley, Defendant, Viviana Almache, and Does 1 through 100.
 
On November 12, 2024, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed this motion to compel the deposition of Defendant. Plaintiffs also request
sanctions.
 
Defendant filed an opposition on November
22, 2024.
 
The case was previously assigned to
Department 32 and was transferred to Department 29 on or about December 9,
2024.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Request for Judicial
Notice
 
The Court grants
Defendant’s request for judicial notice. 
Discussion
On July 10,
2024, Plaintiffs served a deposition notice for Defendant, which was later
taken off-calendar. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 9.) On August 30, 2024, Plaintiffs
served another notice of Defendant, set for September 13, 2024. (Id. ¶
10, Exh. 3.) On September 9, 2024, counsel for Defendant asserted they could
not contact Defendant, and stated he would likely not appear at the deposition.
(Id. ¶ 11.) On September 13, 2024, Defendant did not appear for the
deposition and a certificate of non-appearance was obtained. (Id. ¶ 12,
Exh. 5.) 
 
Plaintiffs
properly noticed the deposition of Defendant. 
Defendant failed to appear or object. 
According, the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant is granted.
 
Plaintiffs
request monetary sanctions against Defendant only (not his counsel of
record).  That request is granted in
part.  Given the straightforward nature
of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,036.75, calculated
based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of
$350 per hour for work of this nature, plus court reporter fees of $276.75 for the
certificate of nonappearance and the filing fee of $60.
