22STCV16159
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Sy Siamak Saremi.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On May 13, 2022, Sy Siamak Saremi (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Arthur Nava, Yadira Reyes, and Does 1 through 50 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence arising out of an alleged automobile accident
on May 13, 2020.
 
No defendant has answered or otherwise appeared.
 
On May 16, 2024, the Court dismissed this matter based on
Plaintiff’s non-appearance for the OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Serve/Prosecute
Pursuant to CCP Sections 583.410, 583.420(a)(1) and CRC Rule 3.110(b) and (f). 
 
At the Final Status Conference on October 27, 2024, no
defendant had answered or otherwise appeared. 
No proof of service had been filed.
 
On January 25, 2024, the Court set an OSC re dismissal
for failure to serve.  When there was no
appearance at the hearing on the OSC, the Court dismissed the action without
prejudice on May 16, 2024.
 
On November 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal. No opposition has
been filed. This matter was continued on December 6; Plaintiff filed an
additional declaration on December 17.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for mandatory and
discretionary relief from dismissal. “The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Code of Civil Procedure
§ 473(b). Where such an application for discretionary relief is made, the
motion shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be
filed, or the application will not be granted. (Id.) The court must
grant relief from dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
(Id.) In either case, the application must be made within a reasonable
time, and in no case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.) 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 473(d).)
Discussion
Plaintiff requests the dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint
be set aside under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) as the dismissal
arose from counsel’s mistake.
 
The Court finds this motion timely as it was filed within
six months of Plaintiff’s complaint being dismissed.  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel has established inadvertence
and neglect due to counsel’s medical condition. 
(Bald Decl., ¶¶ 1-8; Bald Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 1-11.)  Counsel reports that if the condition is not
resolved, he will substitute in new counsel to handle the case.  (Bald Supp. Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
Good cause has been shown.  The motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the
dismissal of this action.
 
The Court SETS ASIDE the dismissal of the action entered
on May 16, 2024.
 
The Court SETS an Order to Show Cause Why the Action
Should Not be Dismissed for Failure to Prosecute Diligently and Failure to
Serve Promptly Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 583.410, 583.420(a),
and California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(b) and (f), or Alternatively a Trial
Setting Conference, in approximately 90 days.
 
Any response to the Order to Show Cause must be in
writing and must be filed at least five days in advance of the hearing.
