Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' application to expunge the lis pendens recorded on the subject property. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish the probable validity of his claim, as the alleged transfer of assets to a revocable trust does not support a claim under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act. The court also notes that the defendant has posted a bond of almost $100,000, which adequately protects the plaintiff's judgment and renders the lis pendens unnecessary.
