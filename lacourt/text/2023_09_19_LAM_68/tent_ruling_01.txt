  Case Number:  20STCV47167    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
Marcia
Pellitteri, et al. vs. Krane & Smith APC, 20STCV47167

Moving
Party: Defendant Krane & Smith APC

Motion
            Defendant Krane & Smith APC
(Defendant) filed this motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories against Plaintiff Marcia Pellitteri (Plaintiff) on April 17,
2023. The motion has been continued several times because Plaintiff’s counsel
indicated that Plaintiff would comply with the motion. However, as the status
of Plaintiff’s compliance is currently unknown, the Court is proceeding with a
ruling on the motion. 
            Defendant’s motion indicates that it
filed this motion because Plaintiff had engaged in discovery evasion and has
made frivolous and inapplicable objections to Defendant’s discovery requests.
Further, Defendant argues that its requests were appropriate and targeted and
were for the purpose of getting Plaintiff to identify and state the facts
underpinning various contentions in her complaint regarding Defendant’s alleged
malpractice for the following topics:
·        
that Defendants failed to bring claims on
Pellitteri’s behalf (Interrogatory No. 90);
·        
that Defendant failed to conduct necessary
discovery (Nos. 91 and 92);
·        
that Defendant failed to properly oppose and
then failed to appeal the underlying court’s ruling on two (2) motions for attorney’s
fees granted against Pellitteri (Nos. 93-100); 
·        
that Defendant failed to advise Pellitteri of
the “benefits” of the Underlying Action (No. 104);
·        
that Defendant’s actions violated a number of
Rules of Professional Conduct (Nos. 110-115); 
·        
that the settlement terms of the underlying
action were not agreeable to Plaintiff (Nos. 116-117); and
·        
that Defendant state the amount of lost monetary
recovery for the breach of the royalty agreement in the Underlying Action and
the amount of lost profits (Nos. 118-119).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s responses to Interrogatories Nos.
92-100, 104, 110-115, and 116-119 were deficient because Plaintiff answers most
of them by saying she cannot answer the interrogatory until an expert is
consulted. Defendant also seeks $3,660 in sanctions against Plaintiff (9 hours
of attorney work at $400 an hour and the $60 filing fee) for needing to bring
this motion. (Brooks Decl., ¶ 21.)
Order
After reviewing the interrogatories at issue, the Court rules as
follows:
Defendant’s motion is granted for Special Interrogatories Nos. 92, 93,
94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, and
119.
Defendant’s motion is denied for Special Interrogatory No. 104.
Plaintiff’s answer was sufficient for this interrogatory.
Sanctions are granted against Plaintiff Pellitteri in the amount of
$3,660 payable to Counsel for Defendants.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses to the interrogatories and to
pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of this order.
