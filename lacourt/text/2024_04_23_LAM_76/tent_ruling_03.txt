 Case Number:  23STCV00357    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  76             Plaintiffs allege that
Defendant’s employee negligently pumped a few hundred gallons of caustic into a
peroxide tank at Plaintiff Tri-Star’s premises, which set off a chemical
reaction that caused a fireball to erupt, followed by a geyser of caustic and
peroxide mixture that damaged the premises.
Defendant Brenntag Pacific, Inc. moves
to “compel responses” to second set of form interrogatories, second set of
special interrogatories, second set of requests for production, and first set
of requests for admission. Defendant also seeks the imposition of sanctions
against Plaintiff.
TENTATIVE RULING
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff served verified supplemental responses to
these written discovery requests. (Kim Decl., ¶ 18; Exhs. 5 – 8.) As such, the
motions to “compel responses” are MOOT. Defendant may bring properly-noticed
motions to compel further responses as to these April 5, 2024 responses.
            Defendant’s requests for sanctions
are DENIED. Defendant improperly reserved these motions as motions to compel responses—not
further discovery—when in fact they were motions to compel further
responses. This was an improper use of the Court Reservation System (“CRS”) in
an attempt to cut in line in front of litigants who properly reserve motions to
compel further responses. The Court will not reward such conduct.
