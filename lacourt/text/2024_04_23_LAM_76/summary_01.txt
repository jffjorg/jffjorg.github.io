And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the eleventh cause of action (Indemnity) in favor of Defendant Avery M. Williams. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not state a cause of action for indemnity as a matter of law. The judge notes that indemnity is only available among tortfeasors who are jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff's injury, and that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to establish joint liability. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel failed to respond to meet and confer efforts, which satisfies the requirements of Civil Procedure Code, § 435.5(a)(3)(B).
