And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on the case. The judge has decided that the motions to compel responses are no longer necessary because the plaintiff has already served verified supplemental responses to the written discovery requests. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, stating that the defendant improperly used the Court Reservation System to try to get ahead in line. The judge does not want to reward such behavior.
