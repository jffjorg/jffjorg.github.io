ANALYSIS

Motion For Judgment On The Pleadings

respond to meet and confer efforts. This satisfies Civ. Proc. Code, §
435.5(a)(3)(B).
Discussion
Defendant
Avery M. Williams moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the Fifth Amended
Complaint.
1.         Eleventh
Cause of Action (Indemnity). 
A derivative equitable indemnity action is based on an
indemnitee's joint legal obligation with an indemnitor to a third party, not
the indemnitor's direct liability to the indemnitee. (See Western Steamship Lines, Inc. v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1994)
8 Cal.4th 100, 114–115 [32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 263, 876 P.2d 1062] [describing
derivative nature of action for equitable indemnity]; accord, GEM Developers, supra, 213 Cal.App.3d at p. 430
[indemnitee may seek apportionment of loss to indemnitor upon any theory that
injured third party could have successfully prevailed upon in action against
indemnitor].)

(Greystone Homes, Inc. v. Midtec, Inc.
(2008) 168 Cal. App. 4th 1194, 1218 [bold emphasis added].)
 
It is well settled in California that equitable indemnity is only
available among tortfeasors
who are jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff's[1]
injury. (Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Service (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th
1109, 1115 [103 Cal. Rptr. 2d 858]; Munoz v. Davis (1983) 141 Cal. App. 3d 420,
425 [190 Cal. Rptr. 400].) With limited exception, there must be some basis for
tort liability against the proposed indemnitor. (Munoz v. Davis, supra, 141
Cal. App. 3d at p. 425.) “Generally, it is based on a duty owed to the
underlying plaintiff [citations], although vicarious liability [citation] and
strict liability [citation] also may sustain application of equitable
indemnity. In addition, implied contractual indemnity between the
indemnitor and the indemnitee can provide a basis for equitable indemnity.
[Citation.]”  [*1041]  (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v.
Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852 [14 Cal. Rptr.
3d 721].) 
 
(Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v. Brown &
Toland Medical Group (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1040-41 [italics in
original].)
 
            Here, indemnity is not a proper theory for Plaintiff to assert
against Defendant Avery Williams. Indemnity would only apply if Plaintiff, individually,
or Infinity, derivatively, and Defendant Avery Williams were joint tortfeasors
as against a third party and Plaintiff, individually, or Infinity,
derivatively, paid more than his fair share of liability to the third party.
 
            Rather, this cause of action alleges damages to Infiniti (5AC, ¶¶
155, 156). As such, the facts pled do not state a cause of action for indemnity
as a matter of law.
 
            The motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the eleventh cause
of action is GRANTED without leave to amend.
