And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to stay proceedings in the state court case. The case involves a dispute over an arbitration award issued in favor of the City's employees, who are seeking backpay. The federal court has acquired jurisdiction over the dispute, and the judge finds that a stay of the state court proceedings is appropriate to avoid duplicative litigation and promote judicial efficiency. The judge notes that the federal court has already acquired jurisdiction over the dispute and that the outcome of the federal court case may impact the arbitration award. The judge sets a status conference for May 31, 2024, and orders the parties to file a status report detailing the progress of the federal court case.
