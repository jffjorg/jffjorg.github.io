And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to extend the time to seek default judgment against all six defendants in the case. The plaintiff, KBS HOLDCO, LLC, filed a complaint against the defendants, including S3D PARTNERS, LLC, JAYESH KUMAR, VIMAL PATEL, GOVIND KUMAAR, MADHUBEN KUMAR, and KETAN KUMAR, for various causes of action. The plaintiff has been unable to serve the remaining three defendants, despite diligent efforts, and seeks an extension of time to complete service and seek default judgment. The Court finds that good cause exists for the extension, as the plaintiff has shown that it has not been able to serve the remaining defendants and that preserving judicial resources and avoiding multiple prove-up proceedings will be accomplished by allowing the plaintiff to pursue service by publication on the remaining defendants. The Court sets an OSC re filing of a request for default judgment against defendants for October 18, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
