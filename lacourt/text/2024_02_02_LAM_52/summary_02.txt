English-text summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' request for default judgment against the defendants. The Judge finds six defects in the plaintiffs' application: (1) the judgment exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint, (2) the complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations, (3) punitive damages are unavailable, (4) the request for attorney fees is excessive, (5) the proposed judgment is insufficient, and (6) the plaintiffs failed to request dismissal of the Doe defendants. The Judge grants the plaintiffs leave to file a first amended complaint and orders them to dismiss the Doe defendants.
