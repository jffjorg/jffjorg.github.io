 Case Number:  23STCV01202    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of
Default Judgment
Plaintiffs Paul Claydon, Luciana Muchaty, Christian
Rodriguez, Gloria Martin, Christopher Owhadi, and Ocean Point Development, Inc.
request court judgment by default against defendants Elegant Windows and Doors, Inc.,
Artor Ghahermanian, Armond Shahnazarian, and Edvin Ghahermanian.
Plaintiffs’
application for default judgment has six defects.
1. Judgment Exceeds Amount
Demanded by Complaint
Plaintiffs request
judgment for relief exceeding the amount demanded in the complaint.  “A default judgment greater than the amount
specifically demanded in the complaint is void as beyond the court’s
jurisdiction.”  (Airs Aromatics, LLC
v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013,
1018.)  “Where no amount of damages is
demanded any amount awarded is by definition greater than the amount
demanded.”  (Falahati v. Kondo
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830–831.)
Plaintiffs’ request for court judgment on form CIV-100
requests a judgment totaling $35,001,072.68. 
Plaintiffs’ proposed judgment on form JUD-100 seeks a total of
$440,257.54.  The complaint, however, neither
demands nor alleges any specific amount of damages.  The prayer for relief demands, “Compensatory
damages in an amount to be proven at trial” and “General and special damages in
an amount to be proven at trial.” 
(Comp., p. 12.)  
Based on this complaint, the court cannot award damages via
default judgment.  To recover
damages, plaintiffs must amend the complaint. 
Filing an amended complaint vacates defendants’ defaults.  After a plaintiff “file[s] an amended
complaint praying for a different amount of damages and/or other appropriate
relief… she must serve her amended complaint on defendants, who will be
entitled to file a new answer; all issues will then be at large, including
liability.”  (Greenup v. Rodman (1986)
42 Cal.3d 822, 830; accord Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery
Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1025 [filing amended
complaint vacates default].)  The amended
complaint must be served in the manner of a summons.  (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436,
444.)
2. Insufficient Factual
Allegations
Plaintiffs’
complaint does not allege sufficient facts for the second through eighth causes
of action.  “Under the ‘well pleaded’
complaint rule, it is error to enter a default judgment on a complaint that
fails to state a cause of action against the defaulting defendant.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 509, 539.)  Plaintiffs’ only
well-pleaded allegations are that three pairs of plaintiffs entered contracts
with defendants to pay “for sale and installment of windows and doors” (Comp.,
¶¶ 24-26), they each “paid a down payment” (¶ 27), and defendants “failed to
perform” (¶ 28). 
In
addition to the first cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiffs assert
seven tort causes of action against defendants. 
The complaint makes only conclusory allegations to support them.  The factual allegations show no more than
breach of contract.  Plaintiffs cannot
recover tort damages, including emotional distress, based on those factual
allegations.  “[T]he economic loss rule
‘prevent[s] the law of contract and the law of tort from dissolving one into
the other.’ ”  (Robinson Helicopter
Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.)  “[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract
becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract
arising from principles of tort law.”  (Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)  “[T]he reasons for denying tort recovery in
contract breach cases” include “the different objectives underlying tort and
contract breach; the importance of predictability in assuring commercial stability
in contractual dealings; the potential for converting every contract breach
into a tort, with accompanying punitive damage recovery, and the preference for
legislative action in affording appropriate remedies.”  (Id. at p. 553.)
Plaintiffs
also do not allege sufficient facts for any cause of action against the
individual defendants: Artor Ghahermanian, Armond Shahnazarian, and Edvin
Ghahermanian.  Where “the liability of
the individual defendants” relies “upon disregard of the corporate entity by
application of the alter ego doctrine,” a complaint’s “bare conclusory
allegation[s]” are insufficient for a default judgment against the individuals.  (Vasey v. California Dance Co. (1977)
70 Cal.App.3d 742, 748-749.)  Plaintiffs’
complaint alleges only boilerplate legal conclusions that the individual
defendants were each alter egos of Elegant Windows and Doors, Inc., among other
assorted forms of vicarious liability. 
(Comp., ¶¶ 20-21.)
Plaintiffs’
evidence includes contracts only between the following parties: (1) plaintiff
Paul Claydon and defendant Elegant Windows and Doors, Inc. (Claydon Decl., Ex.
A), (2) plaintiff Christian Rodriguez and defendant Elegant Windows and Doors,
Inc. (Rodriguez Decl., Ex. A), and (3) plaintiff Ocean Point Development, Inc.
and defendant Elegant Windows and Doors, Inc. (Owhadi Decl., Ex. A).  Not only are none of the individual
defendants parties to the contracts, but also neither are plaintiffs Luciana
Muchaty, Gloria Martin, or Christopher Owhadi. 

3. Punitive
Damages
            Plaintiffs’
brief states they seek $150,000 in punitive damages.  Plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages
for two reasons.  First, for the reasons
discussed above, plaintiffs allege nothing more than breach of contract.  Punitive damages are only available “for the
breach of an obligation not arising from contract.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294(a).)  Second, plaintiffs present no evidence of
defendants’ financial condition.  “[E]vidence of the defendant’s financial
condition is a prerequisite to a punitive damages award.”  (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d
105, 119.)  The plaintiff bears the
burden of introducing such evidence.  (Ibid.)
4. Attorney Fees
            Plaintiffs
also seek excessive attorney fees of $50,000.
 Attorney fees for a default judgment are generally limited to
a specified schedule based on the amount of damages.  (Local Rule 3.207(a), 3.214(a).)  Plaintiffs may recover “a fee greater than listed in the [default]
schedule because of extraordinary services.” 
(3.214(d).)  Plaintiffs’ counsel fails
to show extraordinary services justifying a fee greater than permitted under the
schedule.
5. Proposed Judgment
Plaintiffs did not
submit a sufficient proposed judgment or judgments.  A
plaintiff seeking default judgment must submit “[a] proposed form of
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(6).)  Plaintiffs submitted a
single proposed judgment on form JUD-100. 
It only provides for entry of judgment in favor of one of the
plaintiffs, Paul Claydon.  (JUD-100, §
5.a.)    
6. Doe Defendants
            Finally,
plaintiffs did not request dismissal of defendants Does 1-25.  A request for default judgment must include
“[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiffs do not seek
default judgment against the Doe defendants and therefore must dismiss them.
Disposition
Plaintiffs’ request for court judgment by default is
denied.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), the court hereby grants plaintiffs
leave to file a first amended complaint.
