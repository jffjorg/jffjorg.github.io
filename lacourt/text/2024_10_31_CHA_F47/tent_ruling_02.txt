SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the sale of a fencing company,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant KSJV3, Inc. dba Five Star Fence (Five Star), from
Defendants/Cross-Complainants Yusheng Shew (Shew) and Jill Van (Van) to
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Gevork Voskanian (Voskanian) and Mary Keryan
(Keryan).  
 
On 10/20/23, Voskanian, Keryan and Five Star (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed this action against Shew and Van (collectively, Defendants) for:
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant
of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Fraud and Deceit, (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation, (5) Accounting, (6) Declaratory Relief, (7) Unjust
Enrichment, (8) Conspiracy, (9) Intentional Interference and (10) Negligent
Interference. 

 
On 12/18/23, Shew and Van filed and served a
cross-complaint against Voskanian, Keryan and Five Star for: (1) Fraud – Promise Without Intent to Perform, (2) Breach
of Stock Purchase Agreement, (3) Breach of Secured Promissory Note, (4) Breach
of Guaranty, (5) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (6)
Judicial Foreclosure of UCC-1 Lien, (7) Interference With Contract, (8)
Accounting and (9) Declaratory Relief.   

 
On 12/26/23, Shew and Van/Defendants filed and served a
demurrer, with a 3/8/24 hearing date, to the 1st – 5th
and 7th and 8th causes of action in the complaint.  On 2/22/24, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Fraud and Deceit, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation,
(5) Accounting, (6) Declaratory Relief, (7) Intentional Interference, (8)
Negligent Interference, (9) Assault and (10) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendants had with the First Amended Complaint, on 4/29/24, Defendants served
and filed a demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
6th, 9th, and 10th causes of action in the
First Amended Complaint.  On 6/21/24, the
Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with 30
days leave to amend making a Second Amended Complaint due 7/22/24 (since
7/21/24 was a Sunday).
 
Although Plaintiffs served the Second Amended Complaint
on 7/22/24, it was not filed until 7/24/24 due to the ransomware attack
experienced by the Los Angeles Superior Court. 
Additionally, as confirmed with court staff, due to problems caused by
the ransomware attack, the Second Amended Complaint did not appear in eCourt as
being filed on 7/24/24 until early September (sometime between 9/4/24 and
9/6/24).
 
On 9/10/24 and 9/11/24, Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ counsel
exchanged emails regarding a response to the Second Amended Complaint with
Plaintiffs taking the position that a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint
at that point would be untimely and, therefore, refusing to meet and confer
regarding issues Defendants’ had with the Second Amended Complaint.  (See Chien Decl. ¶¶8-10, Ex.D, Ex.F).  On 9/12/24, Defendants’ counsel filed a
“Declaration of Demurring Party In Support of Automatic Extension and on 9/13/24,
Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration in response thereto reaffirming
Plaintiffs’ position that the demurrer is untimely.  On 9/20/24, Defendants filed and served the
instant demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs have opposed the demurrer and Defendants
have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Timeliness of the Demurrer
 
CCP 430.40(a) provides: 
 
“A person against whom a complaint
or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of
the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.”
(emphasis added)
 
The proof of service attached to the Second Amended
Complaint shows that it was electronically served on defense counsel on 7/22/24
and defense counsel does not refute this in his declaration filed in support of
the demurrer or claim that the Second Amended Complaint was not received on
7/22/24.  (See Chien Decl.).  Additionally, defense counsel admits that on
8/5/24, Plaintiffs’ counsel forwarded him a filing receipt indicating that the Second
Amended Complaint was accepted for filing on 7/24/24.  (Chien Decl. ¶4, Ex.C).  Despite the foregoing, defense counsel did
not begin meet and confer efforts regarding the Second Amended Complaint until 9/10/24,
when the statutory deadline for filing a demurrer is 30 days after service of
the subject complaint/cross-complaint, not the filing of same.  See CCP 430.40(a).  Defense counsel also did not file a
declaration regarding automatic extension until well beyond such deadline.  
Defendants also claim that “the very first opportunity
that Defendants would have been capable of filing a responsive pleading to the
SAC would have been September 5, 2024… .” 
(See Demurrer, p.7:25-27). 
However, Defendants provide no evidence that they attempted to file a
demurrer earlier and it was rejected.  Even
if a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint would not have been accepted for
filing until the Second Amended Complaint appeared in eCourt sometime between
9/4/24 and 9/6/24, Defendants have failed to adequately explain their failure
to meet and confer regarding Second Amended Complaint and have a demurrer ready
for filing as soon as the Second Amended Complaint appeared in the court
system, rather than waiting until 9/20/24 to file and serve the instant
demurrer.  
 
Despite the foregoing, since the Court considered
Plaintiffs’ opposition to the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, which
was filed and served 5 days late, it has also considered Defendants’ late demurrer
to the Second Amended Complaint on its merits. 
(See 6/21/24 Minute Order, p.2); CRC 3.1300(d).  Once again, the parties are warned that
failure to timely file and/or serve papers in the future may result in the late
papers not being considered by the Court. 
(See 6/21/24 Minute Order, p.6).     
   
Grounds for Demurrer
 
Among others, a demurrer may be based on the grounds that
the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action;
the complaint fails to allege whether the contracts sued on are written, oral
or implied by conduct and/or that the pleading is uncertain and ambiguous.  CCP 430.10(e), (f), (g).
 
1st cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
To state a claim for breach of written contract, the
plaintiff must plead the existence of a contract, its terms which establish the
obligation at issue, the occurrence of any conditions precedent to enforcement
of the obligation, and the breach of that obligation.  FPI Development, Inc. (1991) 231 CA3d
367, 383.  A written contract may be pled
by setting forth the terms, verbatim, in the complaint, by attaching a copy of
the contract to the complaint and incorporating it by reference, or by pleading
its legal effect (i.e., allege the substance of its relevant terms).  See McKell (2006) 142 CA4th
1457, 1489.
 
Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that they and Defendants
entered into a written “Stock Purchase Agreement” (SPA) and various ancillary
written agreements.  (SAC ¶7).  The Second Amended Complaint also makes clear
that Plaintiffs are claiming that Defendants breached the SPA.  (SAC ¶32). 
Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the legal effect of the SPA,
Plaintiffs’ performance under the SPA, the conduct of Defendants which
Plaintiffs claim breached the SPA and damages resulting therefrom.  (See SAC ¶¶7-13, 29-33).  
 
2nd cause of action – Fraud and Deceit
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1) false
representation by defendant, (2) intent to deceive or induce reliance, (3)
justifiable reliance by plaintiff, (4) resulting damages.  Service by Medallion, Inc. (1996) 44
CA4th 1807, 1816.  Fraud claims must be
pled with specific facts showing how, when, where, to whom and by what means
the misrepresentations were made.  Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645; Stansfield (1990) 220 CA3d 59, 73.  
 
The allegations in the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently
meet the pleading standards for a fraud cause of action.  (SAC ¶¶14-22, 27-28,
34-42).
 
3rd cause of action – Negligent
Misrepresentation
 
A claim for negligent misrepresentation has the same specific
pleading requirements as a fraud claim.  Small
(2003) 30 C4th 167, 184.   As with the fraud and deceit claim, Plaintiffs
have sufficiently pled the negligent misrepresentation cause of action.  (SAC ¶¶14-22, 27-28, 43-49).  
 
5th cause of action – Declaratory Relief
 
In a declaratory relief cause of action, a plaintiff may
seek a judicial declaration of the plaintiff’s rights or duties with respect to
another in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties
of the respective parties.  Alborzian
(2015) 235 CA4th 29, 40.  Declaratory
relief is appropriate when a party seeks a judicial determination of the
parties’ respective rights under a contract or other agreement.  See CCP 1060.
 
The Second Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that
Plaintiffs are seeking a judicial determination regarding the rights and
obligations of the parties under the SPA and related ancillary agreements.  For example, Plaintiffs contend that the Promissory
Note and Security Agreement should be offset based on the alleged fraudulent
conduct of Defendants.  (See SAC
¶¶7-22, 53-57).
 
8th cause of action – Assault
 
The elements of an assault cause of action are: (1)
defendant acted, intending to cause harmful or offensive contact, (2) plaintiff
reasonably believed that plaintiff was about to be touched in a harmful or an
offensive manner or that defendant threatened to touch plaintiff in a harmful
or offensive manner; that it reasonably appeared to plaintiff that defendant
was about to carry out the threat; that plaintiff did not consent to
defendant’s conduct, (4) plaintiff was harmed and (5) defendant’s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm. 
CACI 1301.  
 
This cause of action is alleged
solely by Voskanian against Shew and incorporates all of  the previous and subsequent paragraphs.  Based on the allegations in the Second
Amended Complaint, it is clear that the assault claim is based on Shew’s
alleged threatening Voskanian with a 9-millimeter gun and demanding that they
meet at a park to “hash stuff out.”  (SAC
¶¶23, 68, 69).  Contrary to
Defendants’ assertion, it cannot be determined from the face of the pleading
that there was a lack of immediacy and proximity component to the alleged
threats.  It cannot be determined from
the face of the pleading whether or not Voskanian and Shew were together at the
time of the alleged threat, whether Shew pointed the gun at Voskanian, etc.,  especially in the face of the allegation that
Voskanian was aware of the caliber of gun with which the alleged threat was
made.    
 
9th cause of action – Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
The elements of an intentional infliction of emotional
distress cause of action are: (1) defendant’s conduct was outrageous, (2)
defendant intended to cause plaintiff emotional distress or defendant acted
with reckless disregard of the probability that plaintiff would suffer
emotional distress, knowing that plaintiff was present when the conduct
occurred, (3) plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress and (4) defendant’s
conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s severe emotional
distress.  CACI 1600.  
 
This cause of action is also alleged solely by Voskanian
against Shew and incorporates all of  the
previous and subsequent paragraphs.  The
intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action is also based on the
allegations that Shew allegedly threatened Voskanian with a 9-millimeter gun
and demanded that they meet at a park to “hash stuff out” among other things  (SAC ¶¶23, 25, 26, 74-80).  Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, the Court
finds that threatening physical violence against someone over a business
dispute is sufficiently outrageous to support the cause of action.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.  Answer is due within 30 days.  
 
Once again, both parties are reminded to comply with the
filing deadlines and are warned that failure to timely file and/or serve papers
in the future may result in the late papers not being considered by the
Court.
