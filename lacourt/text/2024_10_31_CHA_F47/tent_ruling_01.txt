MOTION TO
ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT & ENTER JUDGMENT
 
Motion filed on 7/29/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff United States Senate Federal
Credit Union
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Michelle H. Borrows
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
enforcing the settlement agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant
for entry of judgment pursuant to CCP 664.6. 


 
RULING: The motion is denied without
prejudice.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendant Michelle H. Burrows’
(Defendant) default on a Home Equity and Homeowner Loan (Loan) from Plaintiff United
States Senate Federal Credit Union (Plaintiff). 
On 1/11/21, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant for breach of
contract seeking damages in the amount of $78,938.31 for the remaining
principal balance of the Loan.
 
In July of 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered a
written settlement agreement which resulted in the filing of a Stipulation and
Order Re: Settlement, Retention of Jurisdiction, and Dismissal on 8/19/21.  (Kostelidis Decl., Ex.A).  The settlement agreement required Defendant
to pay the total amount of $84,039.29 with one payment of $3,500.00 due on or
before 7/29/21, and additional payments of $500.00 beginning 8/23/21, and
continuing to be paid monthly on the 23rd of each month thereafter until 7/23/22.  Id. 
And lastly, payments of $1,000.00 beginning 8/23/22 to be paid monthly
thereafter until full payment of $84,039.29 is satisfied.  Id. 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant has failed to comply with the terms of
the settlement agreement by failing to make the agreed scheduled payments.  (Kostelidis Decl. ¶3(2)).
 
Therefore, on 7/29/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion
seeking an order enforcing the settlement agreement entered into between
Plaintiff and Defendant for entry of judgment pursuant to CCP 664.6.  On 8/19/24, Plaintiff filed proofs of service
indicating that the motion was served on Defendant by mailing the documents to
Defendant at 27621 Skylark Lane, Santa Clarita, CA 91350.  Defendant has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff makes this motion pursuant to CCP 664.6(a)
which provides: 
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.”
 
The following deficiencies in the motion preclude the
granting of same:  
 
First, the Court cannot confirm that Defendant had proper
notice of the hearing on the instant motion. 
As noted above, the motion was served on Defendant by mail.  (See Proofs of Service filed on
8/19/24).  However, Defendant never
appeared in this action; therefore, there is no address of record for Defendant
in the court file.  Also, as noted above,
there is no response to the motion by Defendant to cure the defect in
notice.  
 
Second, Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient
evidence/information regarding the requested judgment to be entered against
Defendant.  See Rooney (1973)
10 C3d 368-369.  The declaration
submitted in support of the motion indicates that Plaintiff is requesting “that
the Court award Plaintiff the full amount demanded in the complaint, plus
interest according to proof, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
bringing this motion, less any payments made prior to breach, as provided for
in the Settlement Agreement.” 
(Kostelidis Decl. ¶4(2)). 
However, Plaintiff does not provide any information/evidence regarding whether
Defendant made any payments under the settlement agreement and/or the specific amount
of the judgment Plaintiff seeks to have entered.  (See Motion, generally; Kostelidis
Decl.; proposed Order).  Rather,
Plaintiff merely indicates that Defendant “has failed to comply with the terms
of the Settlement Agreement by failing to make the required payments.”  (Kostelidis Decl. ¶3(2)).      
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
