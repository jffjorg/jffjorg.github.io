And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants is overruled. The defendants had filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint, alleging that it failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The Judge has reviewed the demurrer and has found that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. The Judge has also found that the allegations of assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress are sufficient to support those causes of action. The Judge has warned both parties to comply with the filing deadlines and has reminded them that failure to timely file and/or serve papers in the future may result in the late papers not being considered by the Court. The answer is due within 30 days.
