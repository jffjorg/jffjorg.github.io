And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment without prejudice. The motion was filed by the United States Senate Federal Credit Union against Michelle H. Borrows, who defaulted on a Home Equity and Homeowner Loan. The settlement agreement required Borrows to make scheduled payments, but she failed to do so. The judge found that the motion had deficiencies, including a lack of confirmation that Borrows had proper notice of the hearing and insufficient evidence/information regarding the requested judgment. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not provide information regarding whether Borrows made any payments under the settlement agreement and/or the specific amount of the judgment sought to be entered.
