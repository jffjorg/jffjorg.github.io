  Case Number:  21BBCV01044    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEESI.        INTRODUCTION
           In this breach of contract action, Plaintiffs
David Myers and Sunny Park (collectively Plaintiffs) allege that the contractor
who agreed to remodel their home breached the remodeling contract. Defendants
are the owners and principals of the contractor, Davis Brothers Construction
(collectively Davis Defendants). Defendant Morning Star is a separate entity
formed by Tim Davis in Idaho after Davis Brothers Construction, Inc. shut down.

This Court found it instructive to examine the
history of this case.  On January 6,
2023, Defendants jointly filed a motion to compel arbitration, which Plaintiffs
opposed. On February 28, 2023, the Court issued an 8-page order granting
Defendants’ motion and ordering the parties to arbitrate their dispute.  The parties subsequently paid their
arbitration fees ($29,250 ÷ 3 or $9,750), except for Morning Star, which was
either unable or unwilling to pay the $9,750 price of admission.  This effectively ended a process that Defendants
had initiated. On March 13, 2024, the Court ruled that Morning Star was a
drafting party to the arbitration agreement and had materially breached the
arbitration agreement.  The Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and imposed
sanctions on Morning Star in the amount of $7,687.50.
          Plaintiffs now ask the Court to impose
attorneys fees, jointly and severally, on all Defendants.  This motion was filed February 6, 2024. Davis
Defendants filed an opposition on February 28, 2024. Defendant Morning Star
filed an opposition on February 28, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a reply on March 4,
2024. Plaintiffs also submitted a supplemental declaration of their attorney,
Lawrence Szabo, in reply. 
          The Court previously continued the
hearing on this motion for further clarification into certain billing records.
Plaintiffs’ attorney submitted a supplemental declaration on April 4, 2024. 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          “[I]n an employment or consumer arbitration that requires,
either expressly or through application of state or federal law or the rules of
the arbitration administrator, the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs
before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to initiate an
arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration...” (CCP
§ 1281.97(a).) 
          CCP Section 1281.99(a) provides that “[t]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an
arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or
subdivision (a) of 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.” (CCP § 1281.99(a).)
III.     ANALYSIS
A. Consumer Arbitration
 The
arbitration between the parties is a consumer arbitration, as Plaintiffs were
the consumers/recipients of home improvements by Defendants. (Motion, p.8:
1-8.)
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
The
analysis of reasonableness of attorney fee awards considers “the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required and sjill
employed in handling the litigation, the attention given, the success of the
attorney’s efforts, his learning, his age, and his experience in the particular
type of work demanded…” (Berry v. Chaplin (1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 669,
678-679, citations omitted.) There is no requirement that billing records be
provided to a trial court in connection with a motion for fees pursuant to
contract. The declaration of counsel as to the hours spent on this litigation
and the hourly rates charged for such time is all that is required. “[T]here is
no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to support a
claim for attorney fees.” (Mardirossian & Associates, Inc. v. Ersoff
(2007) 135 Cal.App.4th 257, 269.) “[T]here is no legal requirement that such
statements be offered in evidence. An attorney’s testimony as to the number of
hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even
in the absence of detailed time records.” (Steiny & Co., Inc. v.
California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
Here,
the declaration of Plaintiffs’ attorney, Lawrence Szabo, supports the request
for attorney fees. He declares that he has been licensed in California since
1974 and has practiced construction/real estate law for over 30 years. (Szabo
Decl. ¶ 21.) His hourly rate is $375. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 21.) He declares that his
work stipulating to the motion to compel arbitration totaled 4.1 hours or
$1,537.50. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 24.) He declares he spent 16.60 hours initially
opposing the motion to compel arbitration but reduced his fee amount to
$3,806.25 or 10.15 hours. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 25.) He declares that in connection
with the arbitration, his firm spent 95.6 hours. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 26.) He also
declares that plaintiffs paid interest of 10% per year on the amount owed, for
a total of $1,957.30. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 29.) He includes a description of the
total fees incurred. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 32.) He declares all fees incurred were
necessary. (Szabo Decl. ¶ 33.) He attaches copies of the papers submitted by
both sides on the motion to compel arbitration, the arbitrator’s letters, his
response to the letters and communications with other counsel regarding the
arbitrator’s fees. (Exhs. 1-15.) He also attaches a timesheet printout of the
fees Plaintiffs have incurred in prosecuting this case. (Exh. 16.) The
timesheet printout provides a brief description of attorney activity and is
sectioned by motion/proceeding. (Id.) He also attaches a schedule of
interest at Exh. 17.
With
respect to this motion, he declares he spent 14.1 hours and expects another 4.5
hours to respond to opposition and appear at the hearing. (Szabo Decl. ¶¶ 28,
30-31.)
Plaintiff
David Myers’ declaration also supports the attorney fee request. He declares
that Plaintiffs retained Mr. Lawrence Szabo as their attorney in this matter
for $375/ hour. (Myers Decl. ¶ 3.) He declares that plaintiffs have paid their
attorney up to January 2024, for which they have not received a bill. (Myers
Decl. ¶ 4.) He provides the amount they have paid so far: $50,548.00. (Myers
Decl. ¶ 5.) 
In its
opposition, Morning Star urges that it was not a drafting party to the
arbitration agreement. (Morning Star Opposition p. 4: 22.) However, per CCP
Section 1280(e), Morning Star is a drafting party, as it moved to compel
arbitration and in doing so, was a third party relying on the arbitration
agreement. (CCP § 1280(e).) 
Secondly,
Morning Star urges that the fees sought by Plaintiffs in this motion are
“patently unreasonable.” (Morning Star Opposition p. 7: 3-4.) Morning Star
highlights several things: (1) Exh. 12 attached to Plaintiff’s motion is not
very descriptive, (2) the amount claimed in attorney fees for this motion is
high, (3) the motion to compel arbitration was made necessary by the conduct of
Plaintiffs’ attorney, (4) the entry of December 4, 2023 is unreasonable (23.2
hours), (5) an entry in January of 2024 purports that 32.1 hours were spent on
this case in one day and that overall, the amount requested is unreasonably
high. (Morning Star Opposition p. 7: 1- p. 10: 28.) Morning Star also attaches
the declaration of its attorney, David M. Grey, who declares that the fees
sought  are “both disproportionate and
outrageously excessive. I make this observation based on my 43 years of experience
as a civil litigator in Southern California.” (Grey Decl. ¶ 9.) 
In their
opposition, the remaining defendants, individual Davises and entity Davis
Brothers Construction, urge that they are not responsible for any fees as they
did not materially breach the arbitration agreement, which is the impetus for
this motion. (See Davis Opposition p. 7: 1-28.) Indeed, per Exh. H of their
attorney’s declaration, Davis defendants were found to have paid their
arbitration fees. (Bodie Decl. Exh. H.)
Additionally,
the Davis Defendants urge that the billing records submitted in support of this
motion demonstrate block-billing, bill-padding and excessive hours claimed.
(Davis Opposition p. 12:2- p. 13: 27.) Specifically, the Davis Defendants point
out that on January 2, 2024, Plaintiffs’ attorney claimed to perform 34 hours
of work on the file, despite there only being 24 hours in a day. (Id.) They
also urge that the descriptions provided often trail off, and that this
prevents them from analyzing whether the fees are reasonable. 
In
their reply, Plaintiffs reduce the amount of fees requested as “Plaintiffs
received a refund in the amount of $15,855.82 from the American Arbitration
Association, thereby reducing the amount Plaintiffs have paid to the American
Arbitration Association from $25,480.00 to $9,624.18.” (Reply p. 2: 8-10.)
Plaintiffs are adjusting their request for fees by the refund amount of $15,855.82.
Plaintiffs’
attorney, Lawrence Szabo, provided a supplemental declaration on April 4, 2024.
He declares that “The January 2, 2024 date that Defendants have stated reflects
a total of 34+ hours of time billed on that date is the date of the January
invoice, and not a date that the services described on that invoice were
provided.” (Supplemental Szabo Decl. ¶ 22.) He further declares that the
services billed on December 4, 2023, were charges for the entire month of
December. (Id.) He attaches individual invoices to reflect this. (Supplemental
Szabo Decl. Exhs. 3-5.) However, Exh. 3 includes an invoice dated December 1,
2022, one dated January 3, 2023 and one dated March 8, 2023. It is unclear to
the Court how these three much-earlier invoices related to the charges of
January 2, 2024  or December 4, 2023. Exh.
4 contains the same invoices as Exh. 3. Exh. 5 does provide the specific
invoice for December 4, 2023, with dates the services were rendered
(Supplemental Szabo Decl. Exh. 5 p. 39-41) and the invoice for January 2, 2024.
(Supplemental Szabo Decl. Exh. 5 p. 42-44.)
          The Court has examined the evidence presented by Plaintiffs
and makes the following findings: the rate requested is reasonable. 112 total hours
requested is reasonable, given that this matter proceeded to the eve of
arbitration. The interest incurred is reasonable. As to the current and anticipated
fees spent on this motion, the Court finds 14.1 hours plus 4.5 hours excessive.  The Court awards a total of 10 hours at $375
per hour or $3,750.  
          C. Additional Sanctions
          The Court declines to award sanctions beyond monetary
sanctions. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiffs’ motion
for attorney fees is granted. Defendant Morning Star is ordered to pay $43,282.90
in attorney fees to Plaintiffs.  However,
Plaintiffs ask this Court to impose this order on all Defendants jointly and
severally.  The Court asks the parties to
address this question at the hearing and provide legal authority supporting their
respective positions. The question is whether the Court can order attorneys
fees as to a non-breaching drafting party. Stated differently, is there
derivative liability for Morning Star’s breach? 
 As noted above, CCP Section 1281.99(a)
provides that “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction against a
drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement….”  The statute does not refer to all
drafting parties. It is worthwhile to
note that the sanctions previously awarded by Judge Oldendorf were imposed only
on Morning Star.
 Plaintiffs
to give notice of this order.
