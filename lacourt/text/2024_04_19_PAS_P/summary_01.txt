Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling grants plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees. The court finds that the rate of $375 per hour is reasonable and that the total hours requested (112) are reasonable, given the complexity of the case. The court awards a total of 10 hours at $375 per hour or $3,750. The court also declines to award sanctions beyond monetary sanctions. The case revolves around a breach of contract and arbitration agreement, with the court finding that Morning Star, a drafting party, materially breached the arbitration agreement. The court orders Morning Star to pay attorney fees to plaintiffs in the amount of $43,282.90. The court asks the parties to address the question of whether the court can order attorneys' fees as to a non-breaching drafting party.
