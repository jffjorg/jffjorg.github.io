alleging breach of a verbal agreement. 
 
            On

compel further discovery. Counsel and Defendant were advised to exchange
discovery forthwith, and placed the filing of any supplemental materials (if

supplemental materials have been filed since the IDC. Accordingly, the Court
considers the matter to be moot. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
