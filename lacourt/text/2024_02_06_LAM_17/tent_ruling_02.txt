  vs.
 
MARIO A. FELIX
  dba EUROSPORT
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV06780
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 6, 2023



 
 
 
            After
review, the Court has identified the following deficiencies with Plaintiff’s
default judgment packet:
 
-        
Plaintiff must explain the breakdown of
the $66,000 damages. Based on the submitted exhibits, Plaintiff’s damages
appear to exceed this amount. As such, the Court is unclear what evidence
should be considered to establish this particular sum, or why only this amount
is being claimed in damages. While Plaintiff is limited to recover the amount
claimed in the Complaint (i.e., $66,000), the Court is confused as to how the
$66,000 figure is being calculated, and what particular damages compose this
figure.  
 
-        
Plaintiff must submit title to
establish ownership over the vehicle.  
 
-        
DOE Defendants have not been
dismissed
