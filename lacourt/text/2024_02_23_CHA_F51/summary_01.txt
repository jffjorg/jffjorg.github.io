Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred by collateral estoppel, citing a previous small claims court judgment in favor of the plaintiff. However, the judge found that the evidence proffered by the defendant was insufficient to show that the issues presented in the small claims court action were identical to the instant claims, and that those claims were "actually litigated and necessarily decided" in the previous action. The judge noted that the small claims court judgment was not a formal judgment and did not contain a complete, clear, and concise record of the proceedings, making it unclear what issues were addressed and what conclusions were drawn. As a result, the judge found that a triable issue exists and denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
