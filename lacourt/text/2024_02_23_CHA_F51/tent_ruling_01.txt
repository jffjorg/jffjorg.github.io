  Case Number:  21CHCV00807    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  F51  FEBRUARY 22,  2024    MOTION FOR SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 21CHCV00807    Motion Filed: 12/8/23                                                                                    Jury  Trial: 6/16/25   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Business Alliance Insurance  Company (“Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Eve Sagi (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication in  favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied.   REQUEST FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE: Defendant’s  request for judicial notice is granted as to the existence, but not the  contents, of Exhibits A–C.   Despite having been previously warned to comply with the  “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” set forth in the 5/13/19 First Amended General Order  Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil, Defendant’s counsel has again failed  to bookmark the declarations, exhibits and proof of service attached to the  motion. (5/13/19 First Amended General Order, pp.4:4–5; CRC 3.1110(f)(4); 7/21/23  Minute Order.) Accordingly, the Court imposes $100.00 in monetary sanctions  against Defendant’s counsel.   BACKGROUND    On  12/29/20, Plaintiff entered into a contract for the provision of labor and  materials towards the improvement of certain real property with an unidentified  “contractor” party. The total contract price was $100,000. Plaintiff made a  $40,000 partial payment, and alleges that the contractor defendant abandoned  the project, thereby forcing Plaintiff to hire a new contractor. Defendant  provided the surety bond to the contractor. Plaintiff allegedly submitted a  claim on the bond for $15,000, which Defendant eventually denied.    On  10/13/21, Plaintiff filed her original complaint against Defendant, alleging  the following causes of action: (1) Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond; (2)  Violation of Unfair Competition Law; and (3) Conversion. On 11/5/21, Plaintiff  amended her complaint to name Marcos Quintanilla, the contractor, as Doe  Defendant 11.   On 7/28/23,  Plaintiff filed her operative fourth amended complaint (“4AC”), alleging the  following causes of action: (1) Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond; (2)  Conversion; and (3) Recovery of Payments Made to Unlicensed Contractors. Only  the first cause of action is alleged against Defendant. On 8/9/23, Defendant  filed its answer to the 4AC.   On 12/8/23,  Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On 2/9/24, Plaintiff  filed her opposition. No reply has been filed to date.    ANALYSIS   The function of a motion for  summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an  opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to  enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure  section 437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary  judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably  deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or  evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.  Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of  the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the  issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether  there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the  pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65,  citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381–382.)    As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant  moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by  presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)  128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519–1520.)     Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts  to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts  exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable  issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial  responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally  construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and  resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.  Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Collateral  Estoppel   Res judicata, or claim  preclusion, “applies when (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and  on the merits, (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the  prior proceeding, and (3) the parties in the present proceeding or parties in  privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding. Upon satisfaction of  these conditions, claim preclusion bars not only issues that were actually  litigated but also issues that could have been litigated. (Planning &  Conservation League v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th  210, 226 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)   The doctrine of collateral  estoppel, or issue preclusion, is narrower than that of res judicata, and  operates to bar the relitigation of issues previously litigated, applying only  “(1) after final adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3) actually litigated  and necessarily decided in the first suit and (4) asserted against one who was  a party in the first suit or one in privity with that party.” (Samara v.  Matar (2018) 5 Cal.5th 322, 327.)    Here, Defendant argues that “Plaintiff  already filed and obtained a judgment for the exact same damages she now seeks  against Quintanilla. As such, she cannot seek damages for the same loss in this  action.” (MSJ 8:8–10.) Defendant proffers Plaintiff’s complaint in her 5/4/21  Small Claims action (LASC Case No. 21CHSC00536) against Quintanilla relating to  the monies owed to her stemming from the same abandoned project as in the  instant case. (Ex. A to Def.’s RJN.) Defendant also proffers the 7/2/21 Minute  Order in the Small Claims action, in which the Court entered judgment for  Plaintiff and against Quintanilla in the principal amount of $10,000.00  and costs of $115.00 for a total of $10,115.00. (Ex. B to Def.’s RJN.)  Defendant therefore argues that under the theory of collateral estoppel, “Plaintiff  cannot now make an identical claim for the same damages in a subsequent suit.”  (MSJ 8:28–9:1.)   Small claims court judgments are given special  treatment for purposes of res judicata because of the special characteristics  of small claims court actions: “the small claims court functions informally and  expeditiously. The chief characteristics of its proceedings are that there are  no attorneys, no pleadings and no legal rules of evidence; there are no juries,  and no formal findings are made on the issues presented. At the hearings the  presentation of evidence may be sharply curtailed, and the proceedings are  often terminated in a short space of time. The awards—although made in  accordance with substantive law—are often based on the application of common  sense; and the spirit of compromise and conciliation attends the proceedings.”  (Sanderson v. Niemann (1941) 17 Cal.2d 563, 573.)    Here, Plaintiff  argues that collateral estoppel is inapplicable to bar the instant action  because “the prior proceeding in the current case is a small claims court  matter for which BAIC has failed to actually provide any competent or otherwise  admissible evidence relating thereto, where we have no record or evidence of  what transpired in the small claim proceeding.” (Pl.’s Opp. 4:7–10.) “Questions  remain … of whether identical issues were ‘actually litigated’ when comparing  the small claims case to the current matter.” (Id. at 4:10–12.) “Without  a complete, clear, and concise record of the proceedings in the small claims  action, or any admissible record it is entirely unclear what issues were  addressed, much less if ‘identical’ issues were litigated, and what conclusions  may have been drawn therefrom.” (Id. at 4:22–24.)   The Court agrees with Plaintiff, and finds that the  evidence proffered by Defendant is insufficient to show that the issues presented  in Plaintiff’s Small Claims action are identical to the instant claims, and  that those claims were “actually litigated and  necessarily decided” in the previous action. (Samara, 5 Cal.5th at 327.) Here, Defendant proffers the complaint filed in the  Small Claims action, the Minute Order ruling in favor of Plaintiff, and the  Notice of Entry of Judgment. (Ex. A–C to Def.’s RJN.) However, as Plaintiff  observes, the proffered documents do not contain any record of the issues  actually considered and litigated in the Small Claims action, such that would  allow for this Court to determine whether collateral estoppel applies.   Based on the foregoing, the  Court finds that a triable issue exists. Accordingly, the Court denies  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.    CONCLUSION   The motion is denied.
