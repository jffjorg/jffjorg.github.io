and 16 request documents relating the qualifications of anyone who replaced
Plaintiff in her position as Negotiation Manager. RFPs 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23
concern sexual harassment, retaliation, discrimination claims filed against the
individual defendants. RFPs 33 and 73 request the personnel files of employees
other than Plaintiff. There is a substantial risk of private information being
released with each of these requests. The Court directs Plaintiff to provide a
proposed protective order as to this request within 10 days and file a
stipulated protective order, if the parties agree, or an ex parte application
for a protective order, if the parties do not. The parties are directed to the
model protective order on the LA Superior Court website and are encouraged to
use that form. The order for PLG to produce documents is stayed until a
protective order is issued.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as to the following
RFPs: 35, 82.
 
The Court also DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as to the following
RFPs on the grounds that they are vague and ambiguous:  11, 14, 52, 60, 61, 62, 63.

the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production.

Discussion
 
Informal Discovery Conference
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s motions are procedurally
deficient because Plaintiff did not schedule an IDC as requested by the
Courtroom Rules for Department 72. The Court deems this procedural issue to be
harmless.
 
 
Form Interrogatories, Employment Law
 
The Court has reviewed the parties’ briefs and separate
statements.
 
The Court grants the motion as to the following items:
 
201.5, 207.1, 207.2, 209.2, 211.1, 211.2, 211.3, 215.1, and
215.2.
 
 
Requests for Production
 
The Court has reviewed the parties’ briefs and separate
statements.
 
Plaintiff notes that some of the RFPs are misnumbered because
PLG failed to respond to RFP No. 30 and numbered the subsequent RFPs beginning
at 30, instead of 31. The Court refers to the RFPs with the numbering as
responded to by Defendant except where otherwise noted.
 
The Court grants the motion as to the following items:
