Background
 
This is a Song-Beverly Act action relating to a 2019 Buick
Encore (the “Vehicle”) that Plaintiff purchased from Defendant on January 16,
2019.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on November 14, 2022, raising
claims for (1) violation of Civil Code, section 1793.2, subd. (d); (2)
violation of Civil Code, section 1793.2, subd. (b); (3) violation of Civil
Code, section 1793.2, subd. (a)(3); (4) violation of Civil Code, sections
1793.2, subd. (a) and 1794; and (5) breach of implied warranty of
merchantability.
 
On April 8, 2024, the parties reached a settlement
agreement. On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.
 
On October 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney’s fees on October
24, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition and Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
A buyer who prevails in an action under the Song-Beverly Act
may recover their reasonable costs and expenses, attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended. (Civ. Code, § 1794.)
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted based on factors specific
to the case, which may include, without limitation, “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Warren,
supra, at p. 36 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant has agreed to pay Plaintiff’s attorney fees and
expenses upon motion to the Court. (Wood Decl. ¶ 62.) Defendant disputes the
amount of the fees.
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiff requests the following hourly rates for his
attorneys:
 
(1) Carey Wood ($525.00);
(2) Vanessa Oliva ($470.00); 
(3) Lara Rogers ($350.00); 
(4) Erik Whitman ($475.00); 
(5) Laura Schwartz ($430.00); and 
(6) Jessica Anvar ($515.00).
 
(Wood Decl. ¶¶ 67-73.)
 
            Plaintiff
requests hourly rates of $210.00 for Elaine Astorga and $225.00 for Richard
Ruiz, both of whom are paralegals. (Wood Decl. ¶¶ 74-76.)
 
            The
Court finds these hourly rates to be reasonable based upon each person’s
experience level. (See Wood Decl. ¶¶ 67-76.)           
 
Hours
 
The Court finds that most of the hours expended were
reasonable. This case was litigated for two years, and the accrual of tens of
thousands of dollars in attorney’s fees foreseeably resulted.
 
The Court notes Defendant’s objection to Plaintiff’s request
for fees for the paralegals insofar as they performed work that can be
classified as clerical. However, Courts have held that attorney fee provisions
also include paralegal fees because “[a]n award of attorney fees which does not
compensate for paralegal service time would not fully compensate the attorney.”
(Guinn v. Dotson (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 262, 269.) The Court finds the
paralegal fees incurred to be reasonable. The Court therefore does not strike
any of the paralegal fees.
 
Plaintiff seeks $4,000.00 in attorney’s fees in connection
with reviewing Defendant’s opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the
hearing, which Plaintiff predicts will take “well over ten hours”. (Motion at
p. 1:8-10.) Plaintiff has not explained who performed this work or what hourly
rate applies. Plaintiff already seeks roughly nine hours of attorney time in
connection with the preparation of this motion. (Wood Decl., Ex. 14 at pp.
49-50.) The Court deems that 10.0 hours total regarding the motion is adequate
in light of the routine nature of this motion and the limited nature of
Defendant’s opposition.
 
The Court awards a lodestar of $33,936.50.
 
Lodestar Enhancement
 
There is nothing unusually complex or novel about this case
warranting a lodestar enhancement. The Court has considered the factors
relating to a multiplier but does not conclude that a multiplier is
appropriate.  The Court therefore does
not grant one.
 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff
requests $1,319.95 in costs. 
 
Defendant objects that Plaintiff has not attached a
memorandum of costs and states that it will file a motion to strike costs.
 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on October 3, 2024 and
served it on Defendant’s counsel electronically.
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. …. If the cost
memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).)
 
“Any period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of
the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days[.]”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
 
Even including the 2-day extension, Defendant’s time to file
a motion to strike or tax costs has run.
 
In the memorandum of costs, Carey Wood avers that Plaintiff
expended $1,316.95 in costs. The Court finds these costs to be reasonable and
approves them.
