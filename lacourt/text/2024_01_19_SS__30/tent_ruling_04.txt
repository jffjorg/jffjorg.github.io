On the morning of 02/24/2022 at approximately 7:57am, a caregiver employed by defendants, who was supposed to have been providing the decedent with 24-hour home health care, found the decedent lying face down on the bathroom floor in a pool of her own blood. She was rushed to the hospital and spent eight excruciating days in the hospital on life support. On 03/04/2022, the decedent was pronounced dead from brain hemorrhage. The caregiver employed by the defendants admits in a 911 emergency call to having just woken-up five minutes ago, despite “Daily Caregiver Notes,” filled-out and submitted to State Farm for payment by defendants that indicates said employee was supposed to be providing 24-hour home health care to the decedent for the nighttime hours of 02/23/22, through the early morning hours of 02/24/22.On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence (wrongful death), (2) negligence (survivor action), (3) negligence per se, (4) negligent hiring, supervision, or retention, (5) fraud (intentional misrepresentation, (6) fraud (negligent misrepresentation), (7) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (8) violation of Unfair Competition Laws, and (9) violation of California’s False Advertising Laws.On October 20, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) as to both Defendants.On November 17, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories (set three) as to both Defendants.On November 28, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Caring Hearts, Caring Hands to provide responses to request for production (set three).On November 29, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Tolentino to provide responses to request for production (set three).On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating and monetary sanctions. On December 29, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition. On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.Legal StandardCCP section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that "[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery....""The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionPlaintiff moves for terminating and monetary sanctions against Defendants on the ground that Defendants failed to comply with the Court's orders compelling them to respond to discovery.On October 20, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) as to both Defendants. The Court ordered Defendants to serve responses to the Form Interrogatories within 30 days. (10/20/2023 Minute Order.) On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff provided notice to Defendants regarding the Court order on October 20, 2023. (Carney Decl., Exh. 5.)On November 17, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories (set three) as to both Defendants. The Court ordered Defendants to serve responses to the Special Interrogatories within 20 days. (11/17/2023 Minute Order.) On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff provided notice to Defendants regarding the Court order on November 17, 2023. (Carney Decl., Exh. 6.)On November 28, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Caring Hearts, Caring Hands to provide responses to request for production (set three). The Court ordered Defendant to serve responses to the Request for Production within 20 days. (11/28/2023 Minute Order.)On November 29, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Tolentino to provide responses to request for production (set three). The Court ordered Defendant to serve responses to the Request for Production within 20 days. (11/29/2023 Minute Order.) On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff provided notice to Defendants regarding the Court orders on November 28th and 29th, respectively. (Carney Decl., Exh. 7.)Despite the Court’s Order, Defendants have failed to respond to the Court-ordered discovery.Defendants have filed an opposition. Defendants argue they filed an Answer to the First Amended Complaint on December 28, 2023, after they retained new counsel on December 27, 2023. Defendant served responses, without objections, on December 28, 2023, to the third set of request for production, with 84 pages of responsive documents; and Defendant served responses, without objections, on December 28, 2023, to the third set of special interrogatories.However, as Plaintiff points out in the reply, Defendants have not provided responses to the outstanding Form Interrogatories (Set Two), after they were ordered to do so by this Court on October 20, 2023.As such, the Court will continue this hearing to allow Defendants one final opportunity to respond to the outstanding form interrogatories. If they do not provide responses prior to the next hearing on this motion, the Court is inclined to grant the motion for terminating sanctions. Defendants are ordered to file a supplemental declaration no later than 5 days before the continued hearing date to inform the Court as to whether they have complied with the outstanding court-ordered discovery. If they fail to file the declaration informing the Court as to whether they have complied or not, the Court will have no choice but to grant this motion.In the reply, Plaintiff seeks sanctions. However, Plaintiff fails to provide adequate notice that monetary sanctions were being sought in the notice of motion. A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040.) As such, the request for sanctions is denied without prejudice.
