The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, filed by Andranik Novchadian and Saro Novchadian. The motion is granted because Varujan Melikyan, the opposing party, has failed to provide any responses to the discovery request served on him on May 10, 2023. The Court finds that the moving party is entitled to a court order directing Melikyan to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery request. The Judge orders Melikyan to provide the responses within 20 days of the order and requires the moving party to give notice.
