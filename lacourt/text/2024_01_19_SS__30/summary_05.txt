And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to strike punitive damages brought by Defendant Sola Real Estate Fund I, LLC, and has tentatively ruled in favor of the motion. The court finds that the Plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC) does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. Specifically, the court finds that the FAC does not demonstrate that the Defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The court notes that the FAC alleges that the Defendant knew of the dog's vicious propensities but failed to take action to abate or remove the dog from the premises. However, the court finds that this conduct is not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also notes that the Plaintiff has failed to show how the complaint can be amended to cure the defect. As a result, the court grants the motion to strike punitive damages without leave to amend.
