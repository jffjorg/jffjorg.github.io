And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel compliance with the subpoena for business records. The defendants are seeking the production of medical, billing, and x-ray records from June 25, 2021, to the present, which relate to the plaintiff's injuries from a vehicle collision. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the subpoena, and the judge notes that the proof of service shows that the subpoena was issued and served on the custodian of records for Illuminated Path, and a notice to consumer was served on the plaintiff. The judge finds that the defendants have shown a reasonable basis for the subpoena and grants the motion.
