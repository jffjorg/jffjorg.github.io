Significant Statements:
  - "The Court notes that discovery remains open and given the pending criminal case against moving Defendant, he is subject to being deposed and asked to respond to written discovery thereby placing them at risk of having to choose between defending the civil action and invoking Fifth Amendment rights."
  - "Although it is unclear from the moving and opposing papers the date of any criminal trial against Defendant, there is no trial date set in this civil matter."
  - "This, coupled with the fact that Plaintiff has alleged claims against numerous tortfeasors supports the Court’s conclusion that a brief stay of discovery as to Defendant Aghajanyan would not significantly impact Plaintiff’s ability to continue to litigate this action."
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Aghajanyan's motion to stay discovery as to himself only. The Judge finds that, given the pending criminal case against Defendant Aghajanyan, he is at risk of having to choose between defending the civil action and invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. Therefore, a brief stay of discovery as to Defendant Aghajanyan would not significantly impact Plaintiff's ability to continue to litigate this action. The Judge also notes that the interest in managing its docket and judicial economy favors a stay. The Joinders filed by other defendants are granted consistent with this ruling.
