SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
August 14, 2021, Plaintiff Bank of Hope filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract/Guaranty and Money Due alleging a balance due of $482,959.60. On
November 2, 2023, the court entered summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and
against Nishant Patel on the second and fourth causes of action. On November
17, 2023, the court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff for $112,448.33
representing the remaining unpaid balance due. 
 
On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
Bank of Hope moves for $22,023.91 in attorney fees as the prevailing party in
the action and upon the terms of the underlying contract/commercial guaranty. Defendant
Nishant Patel in opposition challenges the motion on grounds that Plaintiff is
not entitled to recover fees pursuant to the contract; said contract provision
is unconscionable and unenforceable due to the lack of mutuality; and the fees
are unreasonable. Plaintiff in reply reiterates the right to attorney fees pursuant
to contract, and denies any unconscionability. Plaintiff also defends the
reasonableness of the sought after fees
 
A motion for attorney fees must be served and filed within
the time for the filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case. (Cal. Rules Ct.,
rule 3.1702(b)(1).) The time for the filing of a notice of appeal in an
unlimited action is 60 days if a “Notice of Entry” of Judgment was served by
the court clerk or a party to the action, or within 180 days of entry of
judgment. (California Rules of Court rule 8.104.) Judgement was entered on November
17, 203. The motion was filed on April 29, 2024—164 days after entry of
judgment. The motion was filed less than 180 days from entry of judgment, and
is therefore timely under California Rules of Court rule 3.1702(b)(1).
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides “[e]xcept as
attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are
entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” A prevailing party in
entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).) “In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract….” (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
“‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that
defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs
between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted
under Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032.)
 
“(1)
The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is
the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this
section, whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment. Except as provided
in paragraph (2), the party prevailing on the
contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the
action on the contract. The court may also determine that there is no party
prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.” (Civ. Code, § 1717,
subd. (b).) The court found in favor of Plaintiff. The court determines
Plaintiff is the prevailing party.
 
The
commercial guaranty agreement provides for the recovery attorney fees: “Guarantor
agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender’s [Bank] costs and expenses, including
Lender’s attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses, incurred in connection
with the enforcement of this [Patel] Guaranty. Lender may hire or pay someone
else to enforce this Guaranty, and Guarantor shall pay the costs and expenses
of such enforcement. Costs and expenses include Lender’s attorneys’ fees and
legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys’ fees and
legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings . . . Guarantor also shall pay all
court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by the court.”
[Declaration of Ki Wook Lee, Ex. 3: Commercial Guaranty, Attorneys Fees;
Expenses; Declaration of Steven Han, Ex. 4.]
 
Plaintiff challenges the basis for recovery based on
references to the “Note,” quoted as follows: “ATTORNEYS’ FEES; EXPENSES. Lender
may hire or pay someone else to help collect this Note if Borrow does not pay.
Borrower will pay Lender that amount. This includes, subject to any limits
under applicable law, Lender’s attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses,
whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys’ fees, expenses for
bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic
stay or injunction), and appeals. Borrower will also pay any court costs, in
addition to all other sums provided by law.” Nothing in the motion includes any
actual document identified as “Note.” 
 
A business loan agreement (“Promissory Note”) was executed
by other parties, along with the Guaranty documents, but Patel was not a party
to said “Note.” The only agreement between the actual parties in the subject
action is the above referenced “Commercial Guaranty.” [Lee Decl., Ex. 3.] Even
if such “Note” agreement existed between the parties in the instant motion,
Defendant offers absolutely no address to the lack of any adjudication on said
“Note” rather than the presented, unchallenged Guaranty executed by Defendant.
 
The court therefore relies on the actual cited language in
said Guaranty agreement. The plain language of the agreement allows Plaintiff
to recover attorney fees pursuant to the contractual agreement. 
 
The court finds no support barring recovery based on a claim
that any fees should be added to the debt itself. Patel is not a borrower. Any
additional debt on the note involves a non-party to the subject guaranty. Application
of the rule to add on “charges” to the debt (Note) otherwise violates mutuality
rules. (See Chacker v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
351, 356-357; Hart v. Clear Recon Corp. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 322, 327.)
 
Patel next challenges the agreement on grounds of
unconscionability. The court finds no application of the standard utilized for
employment arbitration clauses to commercial loans on a guaranty. (See Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 114; Carmona
v. Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 88-89.) To the
extent Patel appears to additionally challenge the clause on the lack of
mutuality of remedy (e.g. lack of language allowing Patel to seek recovery of
fees), the court declines to make a finding on unarticulated positions
regarding the lack of an equal remedy if Patel prevailed (which is unsupported
by the law even if stated). (See Hsu v. Abbara (1995)
9 Cal.4th 863, 870.)
 
The court therefore considers the request for $22,023.91 in
attorney fees. Plaintiff submits a detailed billing sheet in support of the
request. [Han Decl., Ex. 11.] Patel challenges the recovery as “unreasonable
and excessive,” including redundant entries and billing entries at attorney fee
time for administrative tasks. Patel also challenges fees incurred on behalf of
co-defendant Rajinder Adlakha. 
 
The reasonableness of attorney fees lies within the
discretion of the trial court. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) The court makes it
determination based on the consideration of a number of factors, including,
“the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (Ibid.) The court should apply an objective standard of
reasonableness. (Id. at p. 1098.) “A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635.) The court adheres to the “market
rate” approach for contingency cases, and finds the “Laffey” charts general and
only suggestive. (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619-620.)
 
Counsel
requests a billable rate of $350 per hour for all three handling attorneys, but
the actual billing statement indicates a rate of $300/hour. [Han Decl., ¶ 13
& Ex. 11.] The subject action in no way presents unusual or remarkably
difficult legal issues. The court finds the unchallenged $300 hourly rate reasonable
for Los Angeles County. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North
America, LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240,
247, 256; Center for Biological Diversity
v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619-620; see
Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of
Phila. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp. (3d
Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 161, 167.) 
 
On the number of hours in total, Plaintiff
lists 91.90 hours total. Counsel represents a $4,281.09 credit based on an
agreement for payment of said amount in exchange for setting aside the default
and default judgment. The court finds the deduction reasonable and accurate.
The court otherwise finds no identified administrative staff, only handling
attorneys. As addressed further below, the court addresses the reasonableness
of the entries associated with the case against Patel alone, which subsumes
concerns regarding reasonableness for administrative tasks billed at $300/hour.
 
Patel raises a valid argument in
that Plaintiff should not recover for work completed against co-defendant Rajinder
Adlakha. All entries however identify Rajinder Adlakha in the “matter” column, which
presumably occurred due the complaint being filed against both guarantors. Examination
of the actual entries clearly identify items related to Patel, while a number
of items contain redacted entries or other references to third party creditors,
with no specific distinctions allowing determination whether the fees were
incurred only as to Patel.
 
The
declaration of Han lacks specific address to any differences between the
parties. (Mountjoy v. Bank of America,
N.A., supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 280
accord Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1329.) The court considers
both the descriptive and chronological entries. 
 
The
default was entered against Patel on January 19, 2021. Summary judgment was
granted against Rajinder Adlakha and judgment entered on October 6, 2022. The
motion for summary judgment against Patel was not filed until after August 15,
2023. Applying the credit for payment of fees on the vacated default, and with
the answer by Patel only filed on June 15, 2023, the court declines to find any
and all fees between the default and answer attributable to Patel. In other
words, given the two separate guaranty agreements and complaint with individual
causes of action against each individual guarantor, the court finds no basis
for the recovery of fees against Patel for fees involving the claims against Rajinder
Adlakha. [Han Decl., ¶ 15.] 
 
The entries relating to the
default are already credited. The court also deducts entries directly related
to Rajinder Adlakha preceding both the judgment and the entry of default
against Patel, as well as all blocked entries (though certain entries are
presumably already deducted if they relate to vacating the default). The court
therefore deducts all fees between the default and the set aside default. Said
fees total $13,370. 
 
The court cannot make assumptions
as to the applicability of the described entry given the potential for work
against both co-defendants at this time period. The court finds certain joint
entries, such as the drafting of the complaint, reviews of the bankruptcy
filings, and third party creditor claims valid as to Patel however in that such
expenses appear inextricably intertwined. The court therefore finds these
entries valid.
 
Beginning with the base of $22,023.91
less $13,370 in additional deductions for the period between default and
vacated default, including the blocked billing deduction, the total, equals $8,653.91.

 
The
motion only awards attorney fees. The memorandum of costs was unchallenged and
any time for a motion to tax lapsed.
 
Because the amount of fees exceeds $5,000, the order is
immediately appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(12); Doe v. Luster (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
139, 146.) The court will set an OSC re: Status of Appeal(s) at the time of the
hearing.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
