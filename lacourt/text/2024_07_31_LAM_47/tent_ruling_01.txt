DISCUSSION:
 
Defendants La Brea Rehabilitation
Center, The Rehabilitation Center on La Brea, La Brea Rehabilitation Center,
LLC, Hugo Pena, and Karen Crucena move to compel the Los Angeles County Aging
& Disabilities Department – Adult Protective Services to produce business
records in response to Defendants’ deposition subpoena. 
 
Procedural Posture of Motion
 
            Defendants
purport to bring this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 and
section 2025.480. Section 2025.450 authorizes motions to compel deponent
testimony and production when a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, employee, or designee thereof fails to appear for examination,
fails to proceed with the examination, or fails to produce documents. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(a).) This section, by its plain text, does not apply to
deposition subpoenas propounded to non-parties. In contrast, section 2025.480
authorizes a party seeking discovery to move for an order compelling production
when a deponent, not merely a party-deponent, fails to produce a
document sought in a deposition subpoena. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.480(a).) The
Court therefore construes this motion as a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.480(a). 
 
Legal Standard for Compelling Non-Party Compliance
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.480(a) states:
 
If a deponent fails
to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent's control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.480(a).) A separate statement is
required pursuant to the Rules of Court unless no response has been received to
the request for discovery. (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345(a)-(b).) A motion to
compel compliance under section 2025.480 must be made “no later than 60 days
after completion of the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.480(b).) The motion must also be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration under section 2016.040. (Id.) Further, notice of the motion
must be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally at the
examination or by subsequent service in writing. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.480(c).) 
 
Failure to Comply with Procedural Requirements
 
            Defendants’
moving papers do not comply with any of the procedural requirements for a
motion to compel under section 2025.480. Defendants have, for example, failed
to serve the motion on the County of Los Angeles, from whom documents are
sought, as required by section 2025.480(c). Nor have they provided a Separate
Statement, as required by Rule of Court 3.1345. Further, Defendants provide no
evidence that they ever attempted to meet and confer with the County of Los
Angeles regarding the County’s objections to the subpoena, as required
subdivision (b). Were these the only deficiencies in the motion, the Court might
be inclined to continue the matter and order Defendants to correct these
deficiencies. However, as discussed below, Defendants’ motion is untimely,
which is an incurable defect. 
 
            Although
Defendants contend that no objections were received from the deponent, that
contention is belied by a cursory examination of Defendants’ supporting
declaration. Defendants served the subpoena seeking “all records from Adult
Protective Services as it pertains to Plaintiff Marilyn Sands and her daughter,
Monique Sands” via mail on November 14, 2023, with documents to be produced on
December 12, 2023. (Declaration of Rita R. Kanno ISO Mot. ¶ 2 Exh. A.) That
declaration plainly establishes that the County of Los Angeles “sent
correspondence” via U.S. mail on December 7, 2023, stating that the County
objected to the subpoena as seeking records which are privileged and
confidential. (Id. Exh. B.) Put differently, the County of Los Angeles,
as the deponent, served objections more than three calendar days before the
date of deposition, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. Thus,
the record of deposition was complete on the date of service of those
objections, i.e., December 7, 2023, and the 60-day deadline began to run on
that date. (E.g., Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
123, 137.) The deadline to bring this motion therefore expired on February 5,
2024. This deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1987) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1408-1410.) For that reason alone, the
motion must be denied as untimely.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion
to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business
Records is DENIED.  
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
