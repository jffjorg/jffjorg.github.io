 Case Number:  23SMCV02189    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGCONTINUEThe “tenant ledger” is confusing and difficult to determine the basis of the judgment amount as it includes superfluous information about other tenants. It appears Plaintiff is seeking a judgment exceeding the amount in the complaint, i.e., Plaintiff appears to seek $41,150.00 in unpaid rent when he sought only $26,450.00 in the complaint. The judgment cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint per Code of Civil Procedure section 580. Plaintiff must either reduce the amount requested or amend the complaint.
