Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Cuijuan Liu, as to defendant Richard Song only. The court has also granted defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff in the reduced amount of $3,075. The court has denied defendant's request for an order compelling the production of documents. The court has noted that defendant Law Offices of Dixon Wong & Associates is currently suspended and, as such, plaintiff's objection has merit on this ground.
