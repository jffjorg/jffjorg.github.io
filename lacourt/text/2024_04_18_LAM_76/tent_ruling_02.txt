ANALYSIS
Motion For Attorney’s Fees
Discussion
The Court
granted Plaintiff HE&E Triggs LLC’s motion for summary judgment and entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff. Plaintiff now seeks an award of attorney’s fees.
The determination
of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095; Akins
v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.
App. 4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted
by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) In
setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider
the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community
for similar work.’" (Bihun v. AT&T
Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of
$450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees
to prove reasonableness of the fees. (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th
603, 615.)
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining
the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent
a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings
not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of
the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura
v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
The operative
lease contains the following attorney’s fees clause at ¶ 31 of the operative lease,
attached as Exhibit 1 to the Complaint:
 
31.       Attorney’s Fees. If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding
involving the Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare
rights hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereinafter defined) in any such proceeding,
action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees.
Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, . . .
The term, “Prevailing Party” shall include, without limitation, a Party or Broker
who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether
by  . . . 
judgment . . . The attorneys’ fees ward shall not be computed in accordance
with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys’
fees reasonably incurred. In addition, Lessor shall be entitled to attorneys’
fees, costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and service of notices of
Default and consultations in connection therewith, whether not a legal action
is subsequently commenced in connection with such Default or resulting Breach ($200
is a reasonable minimum per occurrence for such services and consultation).
 
(Bold emphasis added.)
 
      Civil
Code, § 1717(a) provides:
 
(a) In any action on a contract, where
the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred
to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on
the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall
be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.

(Civ. Code, § 1717(a).)
 
Civil Code, §1717(b) provides:
 
(b)
 
(1) The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is
the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the party
prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in
the action on the contract. The court may also determine that there is no party
prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.

(Civ. Code, § 1717(b).)
 
            Here, because judgment was entered in
favor of Plaintiff, Plaintiff is the “prevailing party” pursuant to ¶ 31 of the
Lease and Civ. Code, 1717(b). As such, Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable
attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff seeks $122,867.50 in attorney’s
fees.
 
The Court notes that the form unlawful
detainer complaint and supplemental allegations were filed on August 1, 2023. Defendant
filed a motion to quash service of summons on August 17, 2023, which was denied.
After Defendant answered the Complaint on December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion
for summary judgment on January 5, 2024. The Court took the matter under submission
and granted the motion for summary judgment on January 16, 2024, which was amended
and corrected on January 22, 2024. Judgment was entered on January 29, 2024. 
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an application for writ of possession.  Defendant
opposed Plaintiff’s ex parte application filed on February 9, 2024 for an order
granting relief from forfeiture of lease due to hardship, and/or for stay of execution
of judgment. The Court denied that application.
 
On February 14, 2014, Plaintiff filed
a memorandum of costs. Defendant did not file a timely motion to tax costs, so the
costs shall be entered on the judgment in the amount of $3,736.40.
 
            The Court will approve counsel’s hourly
rate of $625/$650 as reasonable for an attorney who was admitted to the California
State Bar in 1983 and has been practicing since. (Declaration of Scott L. Zimmerman,
¶ 2.)  However, the Court assumes that counsel
who charges this rate has experience in unlawful detainer matters—generally not
a complex area of law—such that counsel already had sufficient knowledge of unlawful
detainer law and did not need to perform research on recurring issues.
 
In the opposition, Defendant details
several time entries that Defendant argues were unnecessary or indicate
unreasonable amounts of time spent on routine, minor tasks.  The Court has reviewed the billing summary attached
as Exhibit B to the Zimmerman Declaration.  In light of the nature of the action (commercial
unlawful detainer) and amount of law and motion (low to moderate), the Court finds
that the lodestar amount of reasonable attorney fees incurred is $75,000.  This accounts for the type of case, the fact
that Defendant’s litigation strategy required additional motion practice on
Plaintiff’s part, and the Court’s assessment of the amount of time reasonably necessary
to complete the case.  The Court does not
find that Plaintiff’s counsel engaged in bill padding or performance of unnecessary
tasks.
 
            As such, the
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $75,000. 
 
            Costs
shall be entered on the judgment in the amount of $3,736.40.
