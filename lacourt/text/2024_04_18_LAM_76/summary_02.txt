The judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff HE&E Triggs LLC is entitled to an award of attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $75,000. The judge found that the amount of attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff's counsel was reasonable, considering the nature of the case (a commercial unlawful detainer action) and the amount of law and motion practice involved. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's counsel had experience in unlawful detainer matters, which reduced the need for research and increased the efficiency of the work performed. The judge granted Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and awarded $75,000 in attorney's fees. The judge also ordered that costs of $3,736.40 be entered on the judgment.
