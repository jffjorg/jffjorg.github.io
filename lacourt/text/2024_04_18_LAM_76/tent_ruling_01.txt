ANALYSIS
Motion To Compel Deposition
On March 6, 2024, the Court ordered
the Complaint dismissed with prejudice as to Defendant Dixon Yick-Sung Wong only.
As such, the case remains pending as to Defendants Law Offices of Dixon Wong & Associates and Richard Song.
Defendants Law Offices of Dixon Wong
& Associates and Richard Song move to compel Plaintiff to appear at deposition
and for monetary sanctions.
Plaintiff emailed objections on August
4, 2023 to the August 7, 2023 scheduled deposition, and refused to sit for her deposition.
(Declaration of Richard Song, ¶¶ 3 – 4.) 
Civ. Proc.
Code, § 2025.450 provides in pertinent part as follows:
 
(a) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee
of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
. . . to proceed with it, . . . the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, . . .
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall
comply with both of the following:
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition
notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information,
or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
. . .
 
(g)
 
(1) If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
. . .
 
(h) If that party or party-affiliated
deponent then fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production,
the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom
the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against that deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated,
and in favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the expectation
that the deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that order.
 
. . .

     (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2025.450.)
 
            Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2025.280(a) provides:
 
(a) The service of a deposition
notice under Section 2025.240 is effective
to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.

(Civ. Proc. Code, § 2025.280(a)[bold emphasis added].)
 
            Here,
Defendants have not made a fact-specific showing of good cause for each of the nine
categories of documents requested in the deposition notice. The Song Declaration
simply restates the request, without explaining how the discovery sought will tend in reason to disprove a disputed
fact of consequence.  This is insufficient:
            Civ.
Proc. Code § 2031.310(b)(1) requires that a motion to compel further responses to
requests for production “shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  (Bold emphasis added.) 
“Although the scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless.”
(Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223 [61
Cal. Rptr. 2d 567].) Discovery devices must “be used as tools to facilitate litigation
rather than as weapons to wage litigation.” (Id. at p. 221.) A party seeking to
compel discovery must therefore “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying
the discovery sought.” (§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); see Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at p. 223.)  To establish good cause, a discovery proponent
must identify a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason
to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove
or disprove the fact.
 
(Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224 (bold emphasis and underlining added), overruled
on other grounds in Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557, n. 8.)
Although the scope
of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless. . . .  [Former] Section 2031, subdivision (l), which
applies to document production requests served on a party, requires a  [*224] 
party seeking to compel such production to "set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the inspection demand . . . ." (Italics in original.) . . .

In law and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of
declarations. Thiem provided argument but no evidence at all to permit the court
to conclude the material sought was "admissible in evidence or appear[ed] reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."  The only justification for the request is contained
in Thiem's "Statement Pursuant to Rule 335(a)" and in a document entitled
"Combined Opposition to Calcor Space Facility, Inc.'s  Motion for Protective Order and Reply Brief in
Support of Motion to Compel Calcor Space Facility, Inc.  to Comply with Deposition Subpoena for Production
of Business Documents." Neither document is verified, and thus they do not
constitute evidence. 

Even were we to ignore that the statements purporting to justify an order compelling
Calcor to produce its documents and other materials are unverified, they still fail.
There is an absence of specific facts
relating to each category of materials sought to be produced; the justifications
offered for the production are mere generalities. The very vice of the
subpoena's promiscuity is well illustrated by Thiem's inability to provide focused, fact-specific justifications for its demands.
The noted generality of the subpoena's
definitions, instructions and categories which
merely add up to a demand Calcor produce everything in its possession having anything
to do with gun mounts, precludes Thiem
from demonstrating any particular item or category in fact constitutes or contains
matter which "is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (§ 2017, subd. (a).)
The purported justification for imposing this great burden on Calcor necessarily
suffers from the same generality as the subpoena itself. 

Although appellate courts have frequently stated "fishing expeditions"
are permissible in discovery, there is a limit. As noted in Gonzalez v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1539 [39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 896], "These rules are
applied liberally in favor of discovery ( Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 785, 790), and (contrary to popular belief),
fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases." (Id. at p. 1546.) However,
early in the development of our discovery law our Supreme Court recognized the limits
on such "fishing expeditions." In 
[*225] Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal. 2d 355 [15 Cal. Rptr.
90, 364 P.2d 266], the seminal case in California civil discovery, the court gave
examples of improper "fishing" WHICH CLEARLY APPLY HERE: "The method of 'fishing' may be, in a particular
case, entirely improper (i.e., insufficient identification of the requested information
to acquaint the other party with the nature of information desired, attempt to place
the burden and cost of supplying information equally available to both solely upon
the adversary, placing more burden upon the adversary than the value of the information
warrants, etc.). Such improper methods of 'fishing' may be (and should be) controlled
by the trial court under the powers granted to it by the statute." ( Id. at
pp. 384-385.) . . .
 
(Calcor Space Facility v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-25 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
            As such, no
order compelling the production of documents will issue.
            Defendants are entitled to an order compelling
Plaintiff to appear for her deposition. Plaintiff’s objections to the format of
the deposition notice are without merit and do not form a basis for Plaintiff to
refuse to sit for her deposition. (Song Decl., Exh. 2.) Notably, even if Plaintiff
already produced documents in response to a request for production (doubtful), a
party may seek discovery by multiple methods.
A party is permitted to use multiple methods
of obtaining discovery and the fact that information was disclosed under one method
is not, standing alone, a proper basis for refusing to provide discovery under another
method. ( Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 218-219 [23 Cal.Rptr. 393,
373 P.2d 457].)  


(Irvington-Moore,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 733, 739.)
            Plaintiff’s objection that Defendants
may not propound discovery until they file an answer is without merit.
            Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2025.210 provides:
Subject to Sections 2025.270 and 2025.610,
an oral deposition may be taken as follows:

 (a) The defendant may serve a deposition
notice without leave of court at any time after that defendant has been served or
has appeared in the action, whichever occurs first.


(Civ. Proc. Code, § 2025.210.)
            As
for the objection that Defendant Law Offices of Dixon Wong & Associates is a
suspended business entity and may not defend this action, such objection does not
apply to Defendant Richard Song. However, a Business Records Search reflects that
Defendant Law Offices of Dixon Wong & Associates is currently suspended and,
as such, Plaintiff’s objection has merit on this ground.
A corporation's powers, rights, and privileges may also be suspended
if a corporation fails to file annual statements of information pursuant to Corporations
Code section 1502, as PRH failed to do. (See Corp. Code, § 2205.) “[A] corporation
suspended under the Corporations Code, like a corporation suspended under the Revenue and Taxation Code, is also disabled from
participating in litigation activities.” (Palm Valley
Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Design MTC (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 553, 556 [102 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 350]; see id. at p. 560.) The corporation may revive its powers
by complying with the requirements of Corporations Code section 2205, subdivision
(d). (85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 561–562.)

(Tabarrejo v.
Superior Court (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th
849, 863.) 
As such, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED
as to Defendant Richard Song only. As noted above, no order compelling production
of documents will issue. Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff Cuijuan
Liu is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $3,075 which includes the costs associated
with the deposition that did not occur, and in bringing this motion. (Song Decl.,
¶ 9, 10.) Sanctions are to be paid to Defendants’ counsel within 10 days.
