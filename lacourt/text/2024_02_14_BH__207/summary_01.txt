And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion by Plaintiff Christian Jones to set aside the dismissal without prejudice previously entered by the Court on September 13, 2023, and to enter a dismissal with prejudice. The motion is unopposed. The Court has reviewed the record and finds that the dismissal without prejudice was caused by attorney mistake or inadvertence. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and sets aside the dismissal without prejudice. The Court also orders Plaintiff to resubmit a Request for Dismissal seeking to dismiss the entire action with prejudice. The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal on March 8, 2024, and Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
