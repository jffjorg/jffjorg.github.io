And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant, Sergey Menshikov's, motion to quash service of the summons and complaint, as Menshikov still resides in the Russian Federation and has not returned to the United States since 2019. The judge finds that the plaintiff's attempt to serve Menshikov at a new address in West Hollywood, California is improper and in violation of the Hague Service Convention.

The judge also grants in part and denies in part the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiff and the process server. The judge orders the plaintiff, Fred Behfarin, to pay monetary sanctions to the Clerk of the Court in the amount of $500.00 within 20 days of notice of the Court's order.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff's explanation for serving Menshikov at the new address strains credulity and that the plaintiff did not rely in good faith on a new statement of information in forming the opinion that Menshikov moved back to California.
