Background:
On or about November 4, 2020, Plaintiff Pericles Chamis underwent an upper endoscopy procedure, during which “Plaintiff began vomiting and convulsing on the operating table.”

Procedural History:
Plaintiff brought suit against the surgeon, Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D. and Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D., Inc. (“Prokupek”); Dr. Prokupek’s company, Defendant Millennium Medical Associates, Inc. (“Millennium”); Dr. Prokupek’s employee Defendant Andrew Gelis (“Gelis”); anesthesiologist Defendant Michelle Dinh, M.D. (“Dinh”), Defendant Soma Surgery Center, Inc. (“Soma”), where the endoscopy was performed; Defendant Sean Ravaei, owner and operator of Soma (“Ravaei”); nurse practitioner Defendant Jeanne Hershey-Weber (“Hershey-Weber”); and nurse Defendant Melanie Kerr (“Kerr”); alleging three causes of action: (1) professional negligence – medical malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) intentional misrepresentation.

Legal Standard:
The court will apply the standard for a stay of proceedings pending appeal as set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 916.

Analysis:
Moving Defendants argue that a stay is warranted under section 916 because (1) “Having a trial go forward with the remaining defendants carries with it the risk that a second, separate trial would go forward solely against MILLENNIUM”; (2) it would prejudice the remaining defendants to not have potentially two other defendants not placed on any jury verdict; and (3) it would protect the appellate court’s jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided.

Conclusion:
For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Moving Defendants’ motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending the appeal of the Millennium Judgment.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending the appeal of the Millennium Judgment. The motion was brought by the defendants, who argued that a stay is warranted under California Code of Civil Procedure section 916 because of the risk of a second, separate trial against Millennium, prejudice to the remaining defendants, and the need to preserve the status quo until the appeal is decided. The judge disagrees with these arguments and finds that the defendants' claims are largely separate and unrelated, and that a stay would not be necessary to preserve the status quo.
