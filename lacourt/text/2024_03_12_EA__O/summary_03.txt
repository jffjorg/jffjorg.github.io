And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the Plaintiff's motion to preserve documents and electronic data files related to Heritage. The Defendant/Cross-Defendant has alleged that the Plaintiffs took large amounts of money from Heritage and misrepresented those transactions in the company books and records. However, the Defendant/Cross-Defendant's cross-complaint does not contain sufficient evidence to support these allegations. The Judge has determined that the Defendant/Cross-Defendant's claims of fraud are unsubstantiated and that the Plaintiffs' motion to preserve evidence will be granted. The Judge will continue to review the evidence before making a final ruling in the case.
