[1] Category 1 sought
that Defendant “Preserve all documents, devices, electronic data files in
Defendant’s possession and/or copied and information relating to Heritage,
including communications between Defendant and Heritage’s customers, clients,
vendors, contractors, and potential clients relating to Heritage, Defendant’s
employment with Heritage, and Heritage’s CSLB license No. 1061808.” (Ex Parte
Application p. 2.) 
 


[2] Of pertinence to the
instant motion, Defendant/Cross-Defendant alleges that Plaintiffs spent and
took large amounts of money from Heritage and misrepresented those transactions
as something else in the company books and records and took and used company
funds and resources for their personal benefit or other purpose not benefiting
the company. (CC ¶83.) 


[3] Though Defendant’s
cross-complaint is verified as to the purported fraud allegations, it does not
contain sufficient evidentiary facts (i.e., pointing to specific checks
on specific dates in specific amounts that show individual
Plaintiffs improperly withdraw amounts from the corporate account). (See CCP
section 527(a); Bank of America Nat’l Trust & Sav. Ass’n v. Williams (1948)
89 Cal.App.2d 21, 29.)  
 


[4] Former controller
and current consultant of Heritage.
