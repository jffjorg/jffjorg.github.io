 Case Number:  22STCV08186    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  57 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6, the Court is granting the unopposed motion of Plaintiff Norma Maria Emanuel ("Emanuel") to enforce the February 22, 2023 settlement agreement  ("the Agreement") between Emanuel and Defendant John Ratevosian ("Ratevosian"). Emanuel''s motion shows that Ratevosian failed to comply with the terms of the Agreement.  The Agreement contains a provision authorizing either party to sue to enforce the Agreement under Section 664.6.  In granting Emanuel's motion, the Court is exercising Section 664.6 jurisdiction.  Consistent with the terms of the Agreement, Emanuel is entitled to a judgment against Ratevosian for $2,000.00, which is the amount Ratevosian agreed to pay Emanuel to settle the action, but that has not been paid,  plus interest on the unpaid balance.  Under the Agreement,  Emanuel also is entitled in the judgment to recover the amount of attorney's fees and costs Emanuel incurred in connection with the motion to enforce the Agreement.  The motion seeks an award  of attorney's fees in the amount of $3,500.00, and an award of costs in the amount of  $121.65.  Emanuel's request to recover those amounts in fees and costs is adequately supported in the motion.  The Court directs counsel for Emanuel to file and serve a proposed judgment memorializing the Court's ruling on Emanuel's motion.The Court is vacating the final status conference set for April 26, 2024 and the trial set for May 6, 2024.
