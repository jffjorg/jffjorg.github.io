And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Maganda Corporation's motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens recorded by AMKO, LLC. The court is granting the motion and entering an order expunging the notice of lis pendens, but is declining to award Maganda its attorney's fees incurred in connection with the motion.

The court found that AMKO failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of its claim related to the Property. The court noted that the signature and initials of Maganda's agent, Faramarz Fred Faramarzi, on the Purchase Agreement were forged, and that AMKO offered insufficient proof of Merzian's actual or ostensible authority to sign the Purchase Agreement. The court also noted that AMKO offered insufficient proof of the purpose of the payments made to Maganda, and that there is an addendum to the Purchase Agreement indicating an exchange for another piece of real estate.

The court declined to expunge the notice of lis pendens on the ground of the service defect, noting that substantial compliance with the service requirements was achieved, and that a trial court risks reversal on appeal for expunging a notice of lis pendens based on a technical defect in service when the party seeking expungement received actual notice of the recording of a lis pendens.
