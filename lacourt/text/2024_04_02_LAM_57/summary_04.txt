Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which claimed that they complied with the standard of care and did not cause the plaintiff's injury. The judge found that there are disputed issues of material fact arising from the competing expert declarations submitted by both parties. Specifically, the plaintiff's expert, Dr. Tepper, opined that the defendants fell below the standard of care and that their conduct caused the plaintiff's injury, while the defendants' expert, Dr. Pinzur, disagreed. The judge concluded that a trial is necessary to resolve the disputes and that the defendants' motion for summary judgment must be denied.
