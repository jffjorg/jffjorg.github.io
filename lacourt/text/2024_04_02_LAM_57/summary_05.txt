And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge sustains the demurrers filed by the Naum Defendants and Vera Shekhter to the complaint of Plaintiff Alex Nerush. The demurrers target different causes of action in the complaint, but the Judge finds that all three causes of action are barred by applicable statutes of limitations. Additionally, the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support any of the causes of action. The Judge grants leave to amend, suggesting that the Plaintiff may be able to cure the pleading defects identified in the demurrers. The ruling will be discussed further at a hearing scheduled for April 2, 2024.
