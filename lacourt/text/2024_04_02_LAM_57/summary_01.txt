And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $96,470 without prejudice. The motion is denied because it is unclear whether the amount sought is attributable to the work done on the successful claim for breach of the nondisclosure agreement (NDA), for which an award of attorney's fees is authorized under Civil Code 1717(a), or whether it also reflects work done on other successful claims for which an award of attorney's fees is not authorized. The judge is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to resubmit an amended motion for attorney's fees that conforms to the principles set forth in this ruling.
