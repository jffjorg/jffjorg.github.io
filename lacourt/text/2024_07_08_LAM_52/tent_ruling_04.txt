 Case Number:  BC635357    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  52 Judgment
Creditor FCP Brands, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney Fees
            Judgment creditor FCP Brands, Inc.
(FCP) moves for $77,919 in attorney fees from judgment debtor Mimi Park aka Mi
Jin Kim.  
Evidentiary
Objections
            Park makes 7 objections to FCP’s
evidence.  Objection No. 1 is overruled.  Objection Nos. 2-7 are sustained.  
Attorney
Fees
FCP
seeks fees incurred in opposing Park’s motion to compel acknowledgment of
satisfaction of judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 724.050.  Code of Civil Procedure section 724.080
provides, “In an action or proceeding maintained pursuant to this chapter, the
court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party.”  FCP prevailed in such a proceeding.  It is entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney fees.
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable fee, the court ordinarily begins with
the lodestar, that is, “the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by
the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (PLCM).)  The court may rely
on its own experience and knowledge in determining the reasonable value of
attorney fees.  (Id. at p. 1096;
accord Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228,
1249.)  
Hourly
Rates
            FCP’s hourly rates are
reasonable.  “The reasonable hourly rate
is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) 
The court should consider many factors, including the nature and
difficulty of the litigation, the stakes involved, the skill required and
employed by the attorney in handling the case, the attorney’s experience, the
success or failure of the litigation, and other relevant circumstances.  (Id.
at p. 1096; Contractors Labor Pool, Inc.
v. Westway Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) 
            Michael Adams charges an hourly rate
of $875.  Adams is a managing partner of
Rutan & Tucker, LLP.  (Adams Decl., ¶
7.)  He graduated from Stanford Law
School and has practiced law for over 25 years. 
(Ibid.)  Heather Blackinton
charges $650 hourly.  Blackinton graduated
from the University of California Los Angeles, School of Law in 2001 and has
practiced business litigation since then. 
(Ibid.)  Seth Jessee
charges $635 hourly.  Jessee has
practiced business litigation since he graduated from the University of
Virginia School of Law in 2009.  (Ibid.)  Marcel Budiono, who graduated from the
University of California, Irvine School of Law in 2019, charges $460 hourly.  (Ibid.)  Considering their credentials and experience,
each attorney’s hourly rate is reasonable.  

            Park’s opposition argues FCP has not
introduced evidence showing plaintiff “in fact agreed to pay these rates.”  (Opp., p. 6.) 
Courts may award hourly rates exceeding the amount billed or paid.  (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65
Cal.App.5th 1050, 1058.)  “There is no
requirement that the reasonable market rate mirror the actual rate
billed.”  (Syers Properties III, Inc.
v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 701.) 
The court finds FCP’s attorneys claim appropriate market rates for their
work.    
Reasonable
Hours
            FCP did not reasonably incur attorney
fees for all 104.1 hours it claims.  In
calculating the lodestar, the court must determine whether the tasks performed
by an attorney were necessary and whether the amount of time billed for each
task was reasonable.  (Baxter v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th
775, 793.)  The moving party has the
burden of proof on these issues.  (Ibid.) 
FCP
billed an excessive amount for drafting the papers in support of its opposition
to Park’s motion to compel acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment.  Between December 11, 2023, and January 2,
2024, Blackinton billed 32 hours to draft the papers.  (Adams Decl., Ex. A, pp. 1-4.)  The opposing memorandum was only 10 pages.  Of those 32 hours, at least 4.2 were billed
for drafting the declaration of Michael Chang in support of the
opposition.  Chang’s declaration was 10 paragraphs long.  Four paragraphs merely describe and
authenticate exhibits.  (Chang Decl. Dec.
20, 2023, ¶¶ 2-5.)  Other portions are
identical or nearly identical to a prior declaration Chang submitted on June
12, 2023, with the reply brief in support of FCP’s motion for a charging order.  (Id., ¶¶ 1, 7-10.)  Blackinton’s work on these papers should have
taken no more than 18 hours.  The court
therefore will reduce FCP’s attorney fees by $9,100, representing 14 hours of
fees at $650 hourly. 
FCP
also billed an excessive amount for preparing for the hearing on the
motion.  Between February 7 and February
28, 2024, Adams billed 35.4 hours for various tasks related to preparing for
the hearing.  (Adams Decl., Ex. A, pp.
6-8.)  Based on the tasks described, the
court concludes this work should have taken no more than 26 hours.  The court will therefore reduce FCP’s
attorney fees by $8,225, representing 9.4 hours at $875 hourly.    
  After
reviewing the billing records, the court finds all other fees were reasonably
incurred.  FCP therefore will recover
$60,594.50 in attorney fees.  
Disposition
            Judgment creditor FCP Brands, Inc.’s
motion for attorney fees is granted in part.  Judgment creditor FCP Brands, Inc. shall
recover $60,594.50 in attorney fees from judgment debtor Mimi Park aka Mi Jin
Kim.
