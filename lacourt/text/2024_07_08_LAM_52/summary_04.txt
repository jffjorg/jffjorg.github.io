And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses FCP Brands, Inc.'s motion for attorney fees incurred in opposing Mimi Park's motion to compel acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment. The court finds that FCP prevailed in the proceeding and is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees. The court begins by calculating the lodestar, which is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The court finds that each of FCP's attorneys' hourly rates are reasonable, based on their credentials and experience.

However, the court also finds that FCP did not reasonably incur attorney fees for all 104.1 hours it claims. The court reduces FCP's attorney fees by $9,100, representing 14 hours of fees at $650 hourly, and by $8,225, representing 9.4 hours at $875 hourly, due to excessive billing for drafting papers in support of FCP's opposition and preparing for the hearing. After reviewing the billing records, the court finds that all other fees were reasonably incurred and awards FCP $60,594.50 in attorney fees.
