And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Magdalena Lopez's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records is granted. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) did not produce documents in response to the third category of the subpoena, and its affidavit does not comply with Evidence Code section 1561(b). The judge orders DWP to either produce the responsive documents along with an affidavit authenticating them, or provide an affidavit stating it has no such documents, within 20 days. The judge also denied the motion for $2,775 in sanctions against DWP, finding that monetary sanctions are not just under the circumstances.
