  Case Number:  22STCV18057    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter’s Motion to Set Aside
Judgment
            Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter moves to set aside the
judgment and enter an amended judgment including prejudgment interest. 
            Plaintiff shows good cause to correct the judgment.  Courts have inherent power to correct or
amend judgments.  (Curci Investments,
LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214, 220; Ames v. Paley (2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 668, 672.)  After the
court trial, the court’s minute order dated January 10, 2024, states, “The
Court awards damages in the amount of $61,440.00 plus costs as provided by law
and prejudgment interest as provided by law.” 
The judgment entered on February 23, 2024, does not include any
prejudgment interest.  Plaintiff submitted
a proposed judgment including $22,826.43 in prejudgment interest, along with a
spreadsheet explaining how that amount was calculated.  (Stefan Decl., ¶ 9.)   
            Plaintiff did not, however, file proof of service of this
motion on defendant The Skid Row Housing Trust. 
Defendant is entitled to notice of the motion.  The court will continue the hearing on this
motion to give defendant an opportunity to respond and be heard.           
            The court hereby continues the hearing on
plaintiff’s motion to set aside judgment to August 9, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.  
Plaintiff
Danielle Schlichter is ordered to serve the moving papers and notice of
the continued hearing on defendant The Skid Row Housing Trust forthwith.  Plaintiff shall file proof of service of the
papers and notice of hearing no later than July 22, 2024.
