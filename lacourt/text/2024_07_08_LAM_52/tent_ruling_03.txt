 Case Number:  24STCV05287    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment               
            Plaintiff Jefferson Enterprises LLC
requests court judgment by default for possession of the premises only against
defendants Newton Solutions LLC, Jefferson Solutions, LLC, and Lase Retail LLC.  The first two defendants filed a timely
answer to the complaint.  The court
cannot enter default judgment against them because they did not default.  They did, however, submit an unlawful
detainer stipulated judgment (on form LASC CIV 293), which the court signed and
entered on May 29, 2024.
Defendant Lase Retail LLC did not file an answer.  The clerk entered its default on April 16,
2024.  Plaintiff shows grounds for
default judgment for possession of the premises against Lase Retail LLC.  The court will modify the proposed judgment plaintiff
submitted on form UD-110 by deleting the names of defendants Newton Solutions
LLC and Jefferson Solutions, LLC, who answered the complaint.  The court will then sign and enter the
judgment.
Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is granted in part.  After modifying it as stated above, the court
will sign the proposed judgment for possession of the premises plaintiff
submitted on form UD-110.
