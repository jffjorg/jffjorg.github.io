And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion by State Farm General Insurance Company to bifurcate the liability phase of a trial from the punitive damages phase. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Henghame Abaghi, alleging breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim against State Farm. State Farm denied the claim and requested that the court bifurcate the trial so that the company would not have to disclose its financial condition until it has been found liable and the trier of fact has found that the company acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The court has granted State Farm's motion, ordering that the liability claims will be the first phase of the trial and the punitive damages financial phase will be the second phase.
