RULING
            Plaintiff The Kennedy Commission’s
Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED in amount of $418,560.00.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On July 31, 2015, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendants for violation of California’s Housing Element Law,
Government Code section 65580 et seq. for passage of a general plan and
subsequent amendment thereto that Plaintiff alleged failed to comply with the
state’s requirement of affordable housing by not meeting and by reducing the
number of housing units that could be developed in the City. 
 
            Plaintiff also filed a Writ of
Mandate for an order ceasing enforcement, administration and implementation of
the amendment to Defendants’ specific plan. The trial court granted the writ. On
appeal, the District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s order, agreeing
with the Defendants that amendment of its housing element to comply with the
governing Government Code sections was possible, which meant leaving the
specific plan in place while allowing Defendants more time to amend its housing
element. (The Kennedy Commission v. City of Huntington Beach (2017) 16
Cal.App.5th 841.) The case was remanded back to the trial court for resolution
of the remaining causes of action alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
            On January 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed
a Motion for Attorney Fees. Defendants filed an opposition on February 22,
2021. Plaintiff filed a reply on March 22, 2021. On July 8, 2021, this Court
granted the motion and awarded Plaintiff $3,531,201.10 in attorney fees. (Min.
Order 7/8/2021.) Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal on August 23, 2021. On
appeal, the District Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court’s order, agreeing
that Plaintiff was a successful party under the catalyst theory and finding the
trial court did not abuse its discretion by applying the 1.4 multiplier.
(Appeal – Remittitur 7/20/2023.) The District Court of Appeal also awarded
Plaintiff costs on appeal. (Id.)
 
            On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5. Defendants opposition was due on January 10, 2024. As
of January 17, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
            
LEGAL AUTHORITY
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1021.5, states in pertinent part: “Upon motion, a court may award attorneys’
fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action
which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the
public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of
enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to
make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of
justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1021.5.)

Merits of the Motion
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order awarding attorneys’ fees in the amount of $418,560.00 incurred
defending this Court’s 2021 Fee Ruling in this matter against Defendants.
Plaintiff argues this present motion is timely pursuant to California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1702(c) and 8.278(c) because the Court of Appeal issued remittitur
on July 20, 2023. Plaintiff’s argument is availing because this instant motion
was filed and served on August 28, 2023, which is thirty-nine (39) days after
the remittitur was issued, thus within the forty (40) days deadline. 
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues it is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees for
fee-related litigation. Plaintiff contends Defendants appealed this Court’s
order awarding Plaintiff Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 fees, forcing
Plaintiff to respond and defendant its fee award. Plaintiff also contends
because of its efforts, Plaintiff secured a unanimous published decision
affirming its fee award, which the California Supreme Court declined to review.

 
Moreover,
Plaintiff argues the attorneys’ fees incurred defending against Defendants’
appeal were reasonable because (1) Counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable and
(2) the hours expended are reasonable. Plaintiff asserts the declarations
supporting this present motion demonstrate Plaintiff’s attorneys are requesting
reasonable hourly rates based on their respective qualifications and current
market rates. (Darmer Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5; Rawson Decl. ¶¶ 1-19, 23-24; Reisman Decl.
&& 7-34; Walker Decl. ¶¶ 2, 9, 11-16.) Plaintiff further asserts the
rates for Jones Day reflect the actual rates charged to paying clients. (Darmer
Decl. ¶ 6.) Additionally, Plaintiff contends the rates requested in this
instant motion are similar to the rates this Court awarded in the 2021 Fee
Award excluding the slight increase to reflect inflationary increases and
increased experience levels of the attorneys. (Reisman Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. 15.) 
 
            Plaintiff
also argues the submitted declarations and billing statements demonstrate a
reasonable numbers of hours were expended on the appeal. In addition, Plaintiff
contends its attorneys have exercised substantial billing discretion by cutting
hundreds of hours worked by all paralegals, legal fellows, research librarians;
administrative tasks; co-counsel strategy calls from non-primary attorneys; and
organization request for fees for non-primary attorneys from the lodestar
calculation to account for potential duplication of efforts. Lastly, Plaintiff
asserts its attorneys performed the following tasks that formed the basis for
its lodestar calculation: (1) researching and drafting the Response Brief; (2)
researching and drafting the Opposition to the Motion for Judicial Notice; (3)
preparing and presenting oral argument; (4) filing an MTA to correct the
record; (5) filing a stipulated motion to consolidate Defendants multiple
appeals; (6) responding to Defendants petitions to the California Supreme Court
for review and depublication; and (7) drafting the instant fee motion. (Darmer
Decl. ¶ 4; Rawson Decl. ¶¶ 21-22; Reisman Decl. ¶¶ 36-47; Walker Decl. ¶¶ 2,
5.)
 
            In Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, the court held “absent circumstances
rendering the award unjust, fees recoverable under section 1021.5 ordinarily
include compensation for all hours reasonably spent, including those necessary
to establish and defend the fee claim.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 639.)
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because Plaintiff incurred attorneys’ fees for
defending against Defendants’ multiple appeals of its 2021 Court ordered Fee
Award and the District Court of Appeal awarded Plaintiff costs incurred on
appeal. Furthermore, the attorneys’ fees requested are reasonable. Under the
lodestar approach commonly used by courts in calculating attorneys’ fees,
Plaintiff request is $418,560.00. The legal work set forth in the supporting
declarations and attached billing statements were reasonable for the hours
expended in a lengthy appellate matter, apportioned to the experience level of
the primary attorneys, and accounted for the inflation in legal industry. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in the amount
of $418,560.00. 
 
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
