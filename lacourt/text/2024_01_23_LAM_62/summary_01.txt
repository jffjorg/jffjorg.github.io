And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Rolf M. Treu, Judge, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gerardo Guerrero and Maria Guerrero (Plaintiffs) versus General Motors LLC and DOES 1 through 10 (Defendants). The case involves a claim under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that General Motors sold a 2021 Chevrolet Traverse with multiple defects and failed to service or repair the vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts.

The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents, set one, nos. 16-21, which seeks documents relating to General Motors' internal investigation and analysis of the defects plaguing the vehicle. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer in good faith and that the objections are well-founded.

The Court finds that the Plaintiffs are entitled to code-compliant objection-less further responses to the request for production of documents. The Court grants the motion and orders the Defendant to comply with the order within 20 days. The Court finds that the Defendant's objections are not proper objections and that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently met and conferred on the matter.
