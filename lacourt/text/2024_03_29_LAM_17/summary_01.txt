Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, THE ESTATE OF REYNALDO PEREZ ORTIZ, and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, 26 STAR, LLC. The demurrer was filed for insufficient allegations and uncertainty. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action.

The judge noted that the defendant's declaration in support of the demurrer was incomplete and missing exhibits. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's creditor claim in the probate matter was untimely, but the judge found that it was timely filed. The defendant also argued that the lawsuit was untimely under CCP § 366.2, but the judge found that the continuing violation doctrine tolled the limitations period.

The judge also addressed the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, but found that the claim was timely filed. The judge concluded that the demurrer was without merit and that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action.
