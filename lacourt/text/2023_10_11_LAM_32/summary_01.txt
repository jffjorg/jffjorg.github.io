And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion in limine no. 5 to exclude evidence of agreements between Plaintiff and its partner bakeries. The agreements are relevant to identifying potential alternative causes of the flavor issue, and Defendant is entitled to proffer alternative causes. The judge also allows Defendant to introduce evidence of settlement communications to Plaintiff, despite Plaintiff's objections. The judge concludes that the communications are protected by the collateral source rule, but argues that Defendant is entitled to introduce evidence of alternative causes of the flavor issue. The judge grants Plaintiff's motion in limine no. 4 to exclude evidence of settlement communications to Western Pacific Foods, but allows Defendant to use the Rothamel Report that was attached to the excluded email.
