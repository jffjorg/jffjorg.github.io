  Case No.:  22STCV00517
  Hearing Date:  October 11, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees
  and sanctions




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 6, 2022, Plaintiff Hermenegildo
Ahumada-Burgara filed this employment discrimination action against Defendants
M.S. Aerospace Inc. and Harry Smith. Plaintiff alleges that he is a disabled
Latino male over 40 years old who was terminated while on medical leave and
replaced by a younger, less qualified employee. Defendant M.S. Aerospace was
allegedly Plaintiff’s employer, and Defendant Smith is allegedly a manager of
M.S. Aerospace. 
            On October 31, 2022, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. Arbitration was thereafter
initiated, and an arbitrator was appointed. However, on May 17, 2023, JAMS
issued an invoice for $86,000 that was due upon receipt. Defendant did not pay
the invoice on the due date or within thirty days. On July 31, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from arbitration. 
            On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees and sanctions pursuant to the
withdrawal from arbitration. Defendant filed its opposition on September 28,
2023. Plaintiff filed his reply on October 4, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If the employee or consumer withdraws the
claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court . . . [t]he employee or consumer
may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney’s fees and
all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.98(c)(1).) Additionally, “[t]he court shall impose sanctions on
the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.” (Id., §
1281.98(c)(2).) Sanctions under Section 1281.99 include “reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach,” as well as evidence, terminating, and contempt
sanctions. (Id., § 1281.99.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Fees and Costs
            a. Plaintiff’s Entitlement to
Costs
Plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs
of the abandoned arbitration proceeding. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.98(c)(1).) Additionally, monetary sanctions are mandatory after a material
breach. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99(a) [“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction . . .”].)  
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff is
only entitled to costs associated with the material breach, which means only
costs incurred after the breach. However, Section 1281.98 expressly allows
recovery of “all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration
proceeding,” not just the material breach. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(c)(1).) While
Defendant is correct that sanctions under Section 1281.99 are limited to those
incurred as a result of the material breach, those sanctions are in addition to
the costs of the abandoned arbitration. (See id., § 1281.98(c) [“If the
employee or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a
court . . . both of the following apply . . .”].) The statute allows
recovery of both the costs of the abandoned arbitration and sanctions
under Section 1281.99. 
            Defendant argues that Section 1281.97
limits sanctions to those enumerated in Section 1281.99. However, Section
1281.97 does not govern here. Section 1281.97 applies when “the drafting party
[fails] to pay certain fees and costs before the arbitration can
proceed, [and] the fees or costs to initiate an arbitration proceeding
are not paid within 30 days . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a)(1).) By
contrast, Section 1281.98 applies when “the drafting party [fails to] pay
certain fees and costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding,
[and] the fees or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding
are not paid within 30 days . . . .” (Id., § 1281.98(a)(1).) 
            Section 1281.98 applies here because
the $86,000 fee that Defendant failed to pay was assessed during the pendency
of the arbitration and was required for the arbitration to continue. Section
1281.98 allows recovery of all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(c)(1).)      
            b. Reasonable Amount
Plaintiff’s counsel claims to have spent
175 hours at a rate of $450 per hour and requests a 1.5 times lodestar
multiplier, resulting in $118,125 in attorneys’ fees. (Rand-Lewis Decl. ¶ 77.)
Plaintiff additionally claims $435.24 in filing fees and $1,350 in reporter
fees. (Id., ¶¶ 78, 81.) In total, Plaintiff requests $119,910.24 in fees
and costs. (Id., ¶ 82.)   
Defendant argues that 105 of the hours
claimed were incurred before the material breach and are therefore unrecoverable.
As discussed above, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs of the abandoned
arbitration. Nonetheless, the Court finds the hours to be exaggerated when
taking into account the complexity of the issues involved and counsel’s
experience. (See Rand-Lewis Decl. ¶ 70.) The Court finds that Plaintiff
reasonably spent 50 hours associated with the arbitration and breach. Defendant
does not contest the hourly rate of $450, which the Court finds reasonable. The
Court does not find a lodestar multiplier to be appropriate. This results in
attorneys’ fees of $22,500. The Court further finds that Plaintiff reasonably
incurred court reporter fees and filing fees totaling $1,785.24. Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to monetary recovery of $24,285.24.  
II.
Nonmonetary Sanctions
The court “may order” evidence,
terminating, or contempt sanctions, “unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.99(b).) 
Plaintiff requests terminating and
contempt sanctions on the grounds that Defendant engaged in bad faith conduct by
failing to pay arbitration fees, misrepresenting facts, and maintaining
positions clearly contradicted by legal authority. Plaintiff argues that Defendant
intentionally sought to drag out the case and increase the costs to Plaintiff.  
Nonmonetary sanctions are discretionary. Here,
the Court does not find a sufficient showing to warrant terminating or contempt
sanctions. Defendant argued in good faith and was not frivolous. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is
GRANTED in part. The Court awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of
$24,285.24. The Court declines to impose terminating or contempt sanctions.
