And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to requests for admission (RFAs) filed by the plaintiff, Arexy Rios, against the defendants, California Eye Specialists Medical Group, Inc., et al. The plaintiff alleges employment discrimination based on pregnancy and wage violations. The defendants responded to the RFAs with lack of information or knowledge, which the plaintiff argues is not sufficient and that the defendants must conduct a reasonable inquiry and verify their lack of information.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement and that the defendants' responses do not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge orders the defendants to provide further responses to the RFAs within 15 days and denies sanctions as the parties acted with substantial justification.
