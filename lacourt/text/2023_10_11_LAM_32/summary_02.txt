Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and sanctions, awarding the plaintiff $24,285.24 in fees and costs. The judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs of the abandoned arbitration proceeding, including the $86,000 arbitration fee that the defendant failed to pay. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, which were estimated at $22,500. The judge declines to impose terminating or contempt sanctions on the defendant, finding that the defendant's actions were not frivolous and that the defendant argued in good faith.
