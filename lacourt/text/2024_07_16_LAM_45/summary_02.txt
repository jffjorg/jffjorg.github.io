The judge has considered the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Lafayette Apt. Associates, LP against Kristine Rose J. Robles, et al. and has denied the motion. The judge has also granted the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,142.98 against Keane due to his failure to comply with the court's order to provide discovery. The court finds that Keane's evasive conduct during his depositions and refusal to answer relevant questions violated the court's order and is a misuse of the discovery process. The court has imposed monetary sanctions to compensate Plaintiff for the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of Keane's conduct.
