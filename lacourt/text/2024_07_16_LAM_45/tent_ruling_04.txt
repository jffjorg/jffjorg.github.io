Motion to Enforce Settlement 
The court has
considered the moving papers.
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement. 
 
Background 
            The
dispute involves the partition of the real property located at 1109 North
Avenue 64, Los Angeles, CA 90042. On July 18, 2013, Plaintiff Raul Sarmiento
(“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint against Defendant Irma Castillo
(“Defendant”). 
            The
parties participated at a voluntary mediation. The mediation was held on
September 12, 2014. The Parties agreed to sell the subject property. Defendant
agreed in writing to settle the case. The Parties agreed that Castillo would
have 120 days to refinance or buy-out Plaintiffs interest with certain credits
and that Sarmiento would release any interest in the business known as VIVA
BAGS. The settlement agreement was finalized and executed on April 22, 2015.
            On
April 29, 2016, the Court ordered dismissal. 

            On May 28, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
            On July 8, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition. As of July 12, 2024, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
            Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” In ruling
on a motion to enter judgment the trial court acts as a trier of fact. It must
determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. To
do so it may receive oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v.
Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.) However, “the power of
the trial court under section 664.6 ‘is extremely limited.’” (Howeth v.
Coffelt (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 126, 134.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves this court for an order enforcing the
Settlement Agreement and entering an order to sell the subject real property
and disbursing sale proceeds pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the
parties. 
The Settlement
Terms are as follows: 
“Dismissal
with Prejudice: SARMIENTO shall dismiss the ACTION against CASTILLO
in its entirety and with prejudice, within SEVEN (7) calendar days of receipt
of the signed settlement agreement. This Settlement Agreement, as set forth in
this is intended to bind all parties· hereto, pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure Section 664.6.: In the event of any default by any party, of
any type of the terms and/or provisions, of this Settlement, the court shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to section CCP 664.6. SARMIENTO and or
CASTILLO shall be entitled to recover any and all costs, including attorneys'
fees; incurred in connection with enforcing the terms and provisions of this
Settlement Agreement.” (emphasis added.) (Galindo Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. A at p. 3.) 
“Real
Property: 
In consideration
of the AGREEMENT, The Parties agree to the following: The subject real property
located at 1109 North Avenue 64, Los Angeles, CA 90042 (hereinafter the
"Property''), shall be appraised by an independent appraiser which has
been identified as Donald Chambers 310-791-6172, unless the Parties otherwise
agree in writing. The cost of the appraisal will be split equally and paid when
due. The appraiser has not worked for either party or their respective
Attorneys and has no relationship with anyone associated with this case. The
appraiser is to determine the fair market sales price of the Property. Upon
receipt of the appraisal CASTILLO shall have one hundred (120) days to make a
good faith effort to purchase SARMIENTO's equitable interest. The Equitable
Interest shall be calculated as set forth in the following section. After the
on hundred twenty (120) day period has lapsed and if CASTILLO has not closed on
the refinance escrow the subject property shall be listed forthwith at a
listing price equal to 110% of the appraised value with a 5% reduction of the
listing price every 30 days until sold, the Parties agree otherwise in writing
or until the price is determined to be below the Credit to Castillo, set forth
below. The Parties shall/is the subject real property with their daughter
Erika, a licensed real estate agent to sell the proper and be paid the usual
and customary commission therefrom; however, all listing agreements an purchase
offers shall be reviewed and approved by the Parties. . When the Parties agree
to accept a offer, CASTILLO shall have days thereafter to exercise a first
right of refusal to purchase SARMIENTO'S "net proceed or equitable
interest" calculated upon the same terms as the acceptable offer. During
this period CASTILLO shall have exclusive right to use and possession and shall
not further encumber the Property without written consent from SARMIENTO.
CASTILLO shall also maintain the subject property and keep the First mortgage
payments current. Castillo has disclosed that the Second Mortgage is in arrears
and the property taxes for 2013 and 2014 have not been paid.” (Id. at
Ex. A p. 5.)
“Credit to
CASTILLO The Parties agree that CASTILLO shall receive a credit of
$230,000.00. This amount was agreed to after numerous negotiations and exchange
of documentation. It is a compromised amount from disputed claims and deemed to
be fair between the Parties. The $230,000.00 credit shall be applied after
costs of sale are deducted from the gross selling price and other liens and
encumbrances. The cost of sale shall be the cash sale price less payment of any
liens, encumbrances, mortgages, taxes, commissions, escrow fees and cost and
then the Credit of $230,000 to Castillo, and the balance thereafter shall be
the "Net Proceeds or Equitable Interest. " The net proceeds
thereafter shall be split 50-50.” (Id. at Ex. A p. 6.)
The terms show
that the parties entered into an agreement to sell the disputed property and
split the profits in half. However, Defendant has failed attempts to refinance
the subject real property and /or list the subject property for sale. (Galindo
Decl. ¶ 5.) Nevertheless, the terms show that the parties agreed that the court
shall retain jurisdiction pursuant to section CCP 664.6. Thus, Plaintiff has
met his burden under CCP section 664.6. Notably, Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
 
 
It is so ordered.
