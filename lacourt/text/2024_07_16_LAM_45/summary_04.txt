And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce settlement and orders the sale of the disputed property located at 1109 North Avenue 64, Los Angeles, CA 90042. The parties had previously agreed to sell the property and split the profits in half, but the defendant has failed to refinance or list the property for sale. The plaintiff has met his burden under CCP section 664.6, which provides that the court may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement. The court orders that the defendant shall have 120 days to refinance or purchase the plaintiff's interest, and that if the defendant fails to do so, the property shall be listed for sale with a 5% reduction in price every 30 days until sold. The parties shall also agree to split the net proceeds from the sale 50-50.
