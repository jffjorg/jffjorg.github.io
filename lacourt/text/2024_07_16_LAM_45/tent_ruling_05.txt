Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Erika Rice. 
The court has
considered the moving and opposition papers.
The court CONTINUES Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Erika Rice. 
 
Discussion
Loyst P. Fletcher,
Law Offices of Loyst P. Fletcher (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of
record for defendant Erika Rice. The court has discretion to allow an attorney
to withdraw and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no
prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of
justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has substantially
complied with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Counsel filed the required forms and declared
that there has been a breakdown of the working relationship with the client.
(Fletcher Decl. ¶ 2.) Counsel further states that the specific facts which give
rise to this motion are confidential and required to be kept confidential but
would provide further details in an in-camera hearing outside the presence of
all other parties. (Id.) Moreover, Counsel states that he has been
unable to contact his clients for over 2 years and has been unable to verify
whether his clients are still alive or have passed from their conditions.
(Fletcher Decl. on MC-052 ¶¶ 2,5.)
 
However, there are
still discrepancies within the forms. For instance, the Court notes that MC-053
(Proposed Order) lists the next hearing as the Motion for Sanctions on July 29,
2024. However, the next hearings are the Motions to be Relieved as Counsel
scheduled for July 26, 2024. Counsel was aware of these hearings because on
July 9, 2024, the Court continued the hearings and Counsel did not file the
moving papers for the instant motion until July 10, 2024. Counsel also filed a
combined MC-052 for all three defendants but in the caption lists the hearing
date as July 26, 2024, and not July 16, 2024, for Defendant Erika Rice.
Moreover, it is unclear why Counsel submitted the first page of Mary Guidry’s
Objection to the Third Amended Notice of Deposition of Mary Guidry and Request
for Production of Documents in MC-052 (Declaration In Support Of Attorney's
Motion To Be Relieved As Counsel). 
 
Again, Plaintiff has not filed an amended
signed declaration. Thus, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s
opposition/declaration’s signature space is blank and therefore is unable to be
considered by the Court. 
 
The Court
therefore CONTINUES Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel to allow
Counsel to fix the discrepancies. The Court encourages Counsel to review CRC,
Rule 3.1362 prior to filing the amended documents to ensure sure full
compliance. 
 
It is so ordered.
