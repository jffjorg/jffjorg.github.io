Background
Plaintiff
Lafayette Apt. Associates, L.P. (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Lafayette”) filed
this action on September 2, 2021 against Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian
Apple J. Robles, Roselle Poblete, and Derek Keane (“Keane”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract;
and (2) account stated.[1]
The complaint alleges that the parties entered into a lease agreement in May
2019 for the premises located at 401 S. Lafayette Park Place, Unit 206, Los
Angeles, CA 90057. (Compl. at pg. 3; Exh. 1.) Defendants allegedly breached the
agreement on May 1, 2020 by failing to pay rent. (Id. at pg. 3, ¶ BC-2.)
Defendants allegedly owe to date a total of $39,802.47 in past due rent. (Id.
at ¶ BC-4.) 
On December 6,
2022, Keane filed a Cross-Complaint on December 6, 2022 against Lafayette and
his co-defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Retaliatory
Eviction; and (2) Contribution. The Cross-Complaint alleges Lafayette
unlawfully evicted Keane, who is alleged to be a third-party beneficiary
residential occupant of the subject premises, based on his inability to pay
under the then-applicable Civil Code § 1942.5(d). (Cross-Compl. ¶ 9.) Keane
alleges the eviction was wrongful since the three-day notice overstated the
amount that was actually due. (Id. at ¶ 10.) The eviction was also
wrongful because the occupants were protected by Civil Code § 1511, as their
ability to pay rent starting in March 2020 was attributable to governmental
regulations. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Further, Keane alleges the eviction violated
the City and County Covid eviction moratoria, the Tenant Relief Act of 2020 and
the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
On March 19,
2024, the court granted in part Plaintiff’s ex parte application to compel the
taking of Keane’s second deposition. 
On April 25,
2024, the court continued Keane’s motion for summary judgment pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 437c(h) in order for the completion of Keane’s deposition.

On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for terminating sanctions against Keane for his failure to abide
by the court’s March 19, 2024 Order. Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions
against Keane in the amount of $8,142.98.
On May 31, 2024,
the court denied Keane’s motion for summary judgment in part pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 437c(i) due to Keane’s failure to answer questions asked
of him during his deposition on May 1, 2024. 
 
Legal
Standard
“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.) “[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant
incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb
the abuse.” (Ibid.) Where discovery
violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules,
the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.) A trial court has broad
discretion to impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a
prerequisite to the imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
Where discovery sanctions are requested against a party, there must be a
failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful. (Ibid.) 

 
“A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly.” (Creed-21 v.
City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial court’s order to
impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical.” (Id. at
702.)  “[W]here a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Id. at p. 702.) Trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully
disobeyed one or more discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)
Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s lack of compliance with the
discovery process has caused the opposing party prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.)
 
Discussion
            Terminating Sanctions
As advanced in Plaintiff’s motion, Keane has failed to comply with the
court’s March 19, 2024 order because, during his depositions on April 9, 2024
and May 1, 2024, Keane was evasive during his scheduled depositions and refused
to answer basic factual questions. (Motion at pp. 8-17; Exh. E at pp.
12:18-13:21, 27:6-20, 30:12-33:21, 35:6-36:17, 78:1-81:3.) 
Under the circumstances, the court finds that Keane’s conduct is in clear
violation of the court’s March 19, 2024 Order. While Keane attended his
scheduled hearings, he failed to meaningfully participate in them. Because Keane
has chosen not to file an opposition, he has failed to explain why he has been
unable to comply with the court’s order, and as a result, the court finds that Keanne
has willfully misused the discovery process by this lack of diligence. (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 [“Lack of diligence may be
deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the
ability to comply, and failed to comply.”])
Nevertheless, the court is mindful that an order for terminating
sanctions must not be made lightly and any sanctions must be tailored to the
discovery violation. (Creed-21, supra, 18
Cal.App.5th at 702; Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at 992.) Thus, the court must take an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions. The court therefore finds that terminating sanctions are
not appropriate at this time.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiff also requests the court to
impose monetary sanctions against Keane in the amount of $8,142.98 due to
Keane’s discovery abuses.
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  A misuse of the discovery
process “include[s] . . . [d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”  (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at 991.)  
            Because Keane’s evasive conduct
during his properly noticed deposition and refusal to answer relevant questions
violated the court’s March 19, 2024 order, the court finds that monetary
sanctions are appropriate against him. In this instance, Plaintiff seeks to
recover 8.75 hours of attorney time (i.e. $3,900) spent fruitlessly conducting
Keane’s three separate depositions as well as deposition related costs in the
amount of $4,242.98 (Motion at pg. 18; Exh. F.) Under the circumstances, the
Court finds that this amount is reasonable and supported by contemporary
billing entries and invoices. (Ibid.)
            Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Keane in the amount of $8,142.98. Keane is ordered to tender payment to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30
days of notice of this order.

It is so
ordered.
