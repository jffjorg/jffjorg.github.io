Motion to Quash John Roman’s Subpoena for Production
of Business Records of Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc.
 
The court has
considered the moving papers. No opposition was received.
The court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to quash the
deposition subpoena for production of business records of Sedgwick Claims
Management Services, Inc. 
 
Background
This is a wrongful
termination action. Plaintiff John Roman (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint on
March 24, 2021, against Defendant Pacific Beach House (“Pacific” or
“Defendant”).  The Complaint seeks
damages for Disability Discrimination, Failure to Accommodate, Failure to
Engage in the Interactive Process, Hostile Work Environment, Failure to Prevent
Harassment and Discrimination Based on Disability, Retaliation under FEHA,
Interference under CFRA and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy.

On December 26,
2023, Defendant filed this motion to quash. As of July 12, 2024, Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition. 
 
Legal
Standard
If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of documents, the court may, upon motion reasonably
made, make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare,
including protective orders. (CCP §1987.1(a).)
 
Discussion
            Pacific
Beach House seeks an Order quashing the Deposition Subpoena for the Production
of Business Records on the grounds that there is no good cause for production
of Pacific Beach House’s private and attorney-client privileged insurance
records. 
 
            The
subpoena seeks the following:
Any and all DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ROMAN
contained in any file or other location under YOUR possession, custody, or
control, including, but not limited to the following: 
1. Any and
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO any claim YOU received from or on behalf of ROMAN
RELATING TO any work injury from July 1, 2019 to present. 
2. Any and all
DOCUMENTS RELATING to ROMAN’s claims or worker’s compensation cases, including,
but not limited to, Claim Number 30193140781-0001 (Sedwick ID: 17666374.6.5201)
and Case Numbers ADJ12539765 and ADJ14080366.1 3. Any medical DOCUMENTS or records
YOU received from ROMAN, or on his behalf, from July 1, 2019 to present,
regarding any claim, including, but not limited to, Claim Number
30193140781-0001 (Sedwick ID: 17666374.6.5201) and Case Numbers ADJ12539765 and
ADJ14080366. 
4. All

PACIFIC BEACH HOUSE, LLC, including any of its employees including, but not
limited to, the following individuals: Hiron Wilson, Rigo Turcios, Jasmine
Stevenson, Jose Galvez; Lisa Binninger, and Marje Bennetts. 
5. All
correspondence RELATING TO ROMAN from July 1, 2019 to present between YOU and
any medical provider, including, but not limited to, MCMG LB Occupational
Medicine and Concentra.
6. All

7. All

Everest National Insurance and Everest Insurance Company. 
8. Any and all
documents RELATING to ROMAN’S medical treatment and/or any request for
accommodations or leave YOU sent to anyone from July 1, 2019 to present.
 
            Defendant
argues that the insurance records relating to Pacific Beach House are
completely irrelevant to this personal injury litigation because Defendant has
not put anything relating to its insurance at issue. (Mot. at p. 6.) Moreover,
these requests are overly broad, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence because it is a
“fishing expedition.” (Id.) Defendant further argues that instead of
serving a nonparty for the requested documents, the requests for the
appropriate documents should be made in demands for production of documents to Pacific.
(Mot. at p. 9.) Also, there is no compelling and opposing state interest
justifying the production of these records from Pacific’s insurance carriers. (Mot.
at p. 8.) 
 
            The
Court notes that this lawsuit involves Plaintiff’s alleged wrongful
termination, with the issues being limited to potential liability and any
alleged damages. Thus, Plaintiff’s attempt to delve into Pacific’s privileged
communications with its insurers and its agents are outside the scope of this
litigation. Notably, Plaintiff failed to file an opposition showing good cause
for the requests. 
 
            The
court therefore GRANTS Defendant’s unopposed motion to quash the deposition
subpoena.
 
It is so
ordered.
