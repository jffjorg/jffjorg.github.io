And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a dismissal of a cross-complaint filed by Omid Khorshidi. The court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the motion because a notice of appeal was filed on September 17, 2024, which stays proceedings in the trial court. The court notes that the filing of a notice of appeal "divests the trial court of further jurisdiction in the cause" and that the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court. Therefore, the court denies Khorshidi's motion to set aside the dismissal.
