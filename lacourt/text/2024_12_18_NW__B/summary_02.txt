significant_statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
  - "Plaintiffs did not comply with the Court's October 14, 2024, order. Additionally, Plaintiffs have to date refused to participate in this litigation, indicating that less severe sanctions would fail to produce Plaintiffs' compliance."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Nancy Martinez, to dismiss the case due to the plaintiffs' failure to comply with a court order. The plaintiffs, Evan Pugrad, Trenton Hearin, and Caroline Draper, filed a lawsuit against the defendant alleging motor vehicle negligence. However, they have failed to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions as ordered by the court. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' former counsel was relieved in November 2024, and the plaintiffs have remained unresponsive in the case since serving the defendant in October 2023.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's order is willful and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the case without prejudice.
