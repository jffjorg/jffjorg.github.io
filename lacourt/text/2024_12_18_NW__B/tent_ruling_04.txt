BACKGROUND
 
On May
25, 2018, Plaintiff Ron A. Rosen Janfaza (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Omid Khorshidi (“Khorshidi”) and Does 1 to 50 (collectively
“Defendants”), alleging six causes of action: (1) assault and battery; (2) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; (3) negligent hiring, training, supervision
and retention of employees; (4) negligence; (5) false imprisonment; and (6)
violation of the Bane Civil Rights Act. The complaint alleges that, on May 26,
2016, Defendants violently beat Plaintiff, causing Plaintiff to sustain
injuries and damages as a result.
 
On June
22, 2020, Khorshidi filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Roes 1 to 5
alleging two causes of action: (1) assault; and (2) battery. Khorshidi alleges
that, at the time of the underlying incident, he was an attorney who had just
appeared on behalf of multiple clients that had fired Plaintiff and whom had a
pending fee dispute with Plaintiff. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 6.) Khorshidi alleges
that Plaintiff threatened Khorshidi and struck him, causing Khorshidi to
sustain injuries as a result. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 7 and 8.) On July 6, 2020,
Khorshidi amended their cross-complaint to add a cause of action for violation
of the Bane Civil Rights Act. On January 3, 2022, Khorshidi filed a third
amended cross-complaint.
 
On June 7,
2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B
at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On July
26, 2024, a jury trial was called for hearing. (See July 26, 2024,
Minute Order.) Khorshidi did not appear at trial. (Ibid.) The Court
denied Khorshidi’s request for a short trial continuance as he failed to show good
cause. (Ibid.) Consequently, the Court dismissed Khorshidi’s
cross-complaint without prejudice.
 
On September 16, 2024, Khorshidi filed the
instant motion to set aside the dismissal. 
 
On September 17, 2024, Khorshidi filed a notice
of appeal from the dismissal.
 
On December 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed their
opposition.
 
On December 11, 2024, Khorshidi filed their
reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief [from dismissal]. [Citation.]” (Pagnini
v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for
relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of
the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) Additionally, an application for relief under this section “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief
under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s
fault, the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal.
(CCP § 473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)
DISCUSSION
Jurisdiction
 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court addresses whether it retains jurisdiction to rule
upon the instant motion after Khorshidi filed a notice of appeal on September
17, 2024. 
 
“Generally,
the filing of a notice of appeal ‘divests the trial court of further
jurisdiction in the cause.’” (Avenida San Juan Partnership v. City of San
Clemente (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1267.) “[T]he perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (CCP § 916(a).)
An appeal is perfected when the notice of appeal is filed. (Kroger Co. v.
Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 952, 959.)
 
Here,
Khorshidi filed their notice of appeal from dismissal on September 17, 2024.
The notice of appeal and instant motion both seek relief from the same
dismissal and, consequently, proceedings regarding relief from dismissal are
stayed in this trial court pursuant to CCP § 916. Therefore, the trial court
does not retain jurisdiction to rule upon the instant motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Omid Korshidi’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
is DENIED as the Court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 916.
