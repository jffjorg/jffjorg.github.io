NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Petitioner
Emily Robinson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a June 1, 2019, motor vehicle
accident in which Plaintiffs Emily Robinson (“Petitioner”), Brandon Grimes
(“Brandon”), and Ben Robinson (“Ben”)(collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege that
Defendant Jonathan Presto (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 operated their
motor vehicle in a negligent or reckless manner as to collide with Plaintiff’s
vehicle and cause injuries thereof. On October 29, 2021, Plaintiffs brought
suit alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On March 30, 2023, minor Estelle Grimes (“Claimant”), by
and through her guardian ad litem Emily Robinson, brought suit against
Defendant and Does 1 through 20 alleging one cause of action for negligence. Petitioner
was pregnant with Claimant at the time of the underlying incident and alleges
that, as a result of the accident, Claimant suffered injuries which manifested
themselves at birth.
 
On April 13, 2023, Petitioner was approved as guardian ad
litem for Claimant.
 
On December 5, 2023, the two cases were consolidated.
 
On June 7, 2024, this action was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On June 12, 2024, Petitioner filed a
notice of settlement.
 
On November 26, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on
behalf of Claimant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $100,000.00
from Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 372.) For this
purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is
granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is
voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Probate Code section 3600, et seq., governs how
the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601,
the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as
follows: 
 
The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or
otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator),
costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall
be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the
benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code § 3601(a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601,
“unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use
a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).)
In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except
where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later
events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioner seeks court approval for a
settlement under which Claimant would receive $100,000.00. Of the $100,000.00
settlement, $640.05 will be used to reimburse medical expenses, $15,463.33 will
be used for attorney’s fees, and $3,896.82 will be used for costs. (See MC-350
Item 16.) Therefore, the net settlement amount available for Claimant is
$80,000.00. (Ibid.)
The Petition sets forth information that bears
upon the reasonableness of the compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350
Attachments 6, 8, and 11b(6).) It also provides information bearing upon the
reasonableness of the settlement apportionment. (See ibid. at Attachment
11b(6).) Additionally, attorney’s fees are reasonable as they represent
approximately 15% of the total settlement amount. (MC-350 Attachment 13a.) Claimant’s
counsel provides their retainer agreement as Attachment 17a. Costs are
reasonable considering the extent of litigation.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the
petition to confirm minor’s compromise.
Court to sign order(s) and Petitioner to give
notice
