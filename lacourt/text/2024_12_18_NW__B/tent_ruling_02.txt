[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
Hearing
  Date: DECEMBER 18, 2024
Trial
  Date: JANUARY 27, 2025



 
I.       BACKGROUND
On May 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Evan Pugrad
(“Pugrad”), Trenton Hearin (“Hearin”), and Caroline Draper (“Draper”)(collectively
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant Nancy Martinez (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiffs
allege that, on or about May 22, 2020, Defendant negligently operated her
vehicle, colliding with Plaintiffs’ vehicle and causing injuries thereof.
On June 5, 2024, the action was reassigned to
the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
On October 30, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion for terminating sanctions.
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.    LEGAL STANDARD
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 permits
the Court, in its discretion, to impose the following types of terminating
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery
process”:
(1) An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process.
(2) An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any
part of the action, of that party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default
against that party.
(CCP § 2023.030(d).) 
Conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery
process” includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (CCP § 2023.010(d)
and (g).) “Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within the
trial court's discretion, and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court
should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party
seeking discovery[.]” (Ibid. at 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to
the harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as
punishment. (Ibid.) The court should also consider whether the discovery
misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the
other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.
Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)
Lastly, courts have held that terminating
sanctions are warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate
discovery responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty
Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
1093.) For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a
record “replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery
requests.” (Ibid. at 279–280.)
 
III.
  DISCUSSION
Defendant makes this motion on the grounds
that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Court’s October 14, 2024, order to
provide discovery responses and pay sanctions. (Anderson Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. A
[ruling].) Additionally, Defendant claims that Plaintiffs have “abandoned their
case,” making dismissal appropriate pursuant to CCP § 2023. The Court notes
that, due to a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,
Plaintiffs’ former counsel was relieved in November 2024. Plaintiffs have
remained entirely unresponsive in this action since serving Defendant in
October 2023.
“A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Here, Plaintiffs did not comply with the Court’s October
14, 2024, order. Additionally, Plaintiffs have to date refused to participate
in this litigation, indicating that less severe sanctions would fail to produce
Plaintiffs’ compliance. Therefore, the Court finds terminating sanctions appropriate.
 
IV.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion
for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiffs’ operative complaint is
dismissed without prejudice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
