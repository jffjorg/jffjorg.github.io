And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production of documents, set one. The plaintiff, Sky Shamlou, is seeking to compel the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, to provide further responses to the requests for production of documents. The defendant had initially responded to the requests with boilerplate objections, but the court finds some of the responses to be not code-compliant.

The court finds that the defendant did not waive its objections, but also notes that the defendant did not provide sufficient justification for its objections. The court orders the defendant to serve further, code-compliant responses to certain requests for production of documents, including Nos. 1-4, 7-9, 11, 13, 14, 15-22.

The court also finds that the plaintiff's requests for production of documents are overbroad in certain respects, and orders the plaintiff to limit the requests to the relevant time period of 2023 and 2024. Finally, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests, but denies the motion as to other requests.
