And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion to quash or modify subpoenas issued by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The subpoenas were issued to various medical providers, including Dr. Daniel Buckner, Dr. Steven Yoon, Dr. Jasmine Yun, Dr. Roy Mansano, and Dr. Shelley Susman, seeking records related to Plaintiff's alleged sexual abuse. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the subpoenas are overly broad and not relevant to the litigation, and that they violate Plaintiff's right to privacy. The judge also notes that LAUSD has not established how the information sought is relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge has denied both parties' requests for monetary sanctions.
