            No opposition has been

            Defendant has been

been reminded of the definition of a “vexatious litigant.”
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The court is
authorized, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to impose the following
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating
sanctions, and contempt. (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030 subd. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by
an order dismissing the action against whom the sanction is imposed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿2023.030 subd. (d)(3).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010,
subdivision (g), provides that a misuse of the discovery process includes, but
is not limited to, “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.”  
 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of
New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of
the party entitled to but denied discovery. (Ibid.) “But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.,
quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280; Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702
(quoting same).)  
 
Because terminating sanctions are the most
“drastic” penalty, they are typically a “last resort” to be “used sparingly”;
however, they may still be appropriate “as a first measure” in “extreme cases”
where a litigant violates a court order and “persists in the outright refusal
to comply with [its] discovery obligations.” (Siry Investment, L.P. v.
Farkhondehpour¿(2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 1098, 1118,¿as modified on denial of
reh’g (Mar. 23, 2020).)
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
On August 17, 2023, Defendant filed the Motion
for Terminating Sanctions on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff’s Attorney Jerry
Udeochu forged the verification form and (2) misused the CCP 446 form in
responding to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories Set One. The Court found that it
cannot grant terminating sanctions based on “Defendant’s own self-serving
belief that a verification was not genuine.” (August 21, 2023, Minute Order p.
3.)
 
            Defendant now argues that new evidence has arisen that
shows that Defendant was not in the United States at the time of the
verification of Plaintiff’s response to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories Set One.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s attorney signed the verification form
stating that Plaintiff was out of the country, but Plaintiff also signed a
separate verification form stating that Plaintiff was in Carson, California.
(Lwin Decl. Exhibit A.) Furthermore, Plaintiff provides a FOIA request on
Plaintiff's travel history that shows she was not in the country at the time of
the verification. (Lwin Decl. Exhibit C.) While Defendant has shown that there
is a discrepancy between the two forms and that Plaintiff was not in the
country at the time of the verification, Defendant has not shown that this was
anything more than a simple mistake, nor has he shown that terminating
sanctions are warranted. 
 
            Terminating sanctions
are meant to be a last resort to only be used in extreme cases. (Siry
Investment, L.P, supra, 45 Cal.App.5th 1098, 1118.) While Plaintiff may not
have been in the country at the time of the verification, Plaintiff’s location
is immaterial as Plaintiff’s attorney had already verified the documents on
Plaintiff’s behalf. (Lwin Decl. Exhibit A.) Defendant contends that this is a
serious forgery, equating it to spoliation or fabrication of evidence, that
warrants terminating sanctions, but fails to explain how the discrepancy harmed
the discovery process or benefited Defendant. 
 
            Therefore, the Court
denies the Renewed Motion for Terminating Sanctions.
 
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) In addition, a court shall
impose monetary sanctions if the motion to compel a deposition is granted
unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial justification or
other circumstances would make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
 
Defendant requests
that the court “impose a monetary sanction of $357.93 and attorney’s fee of
$2,500”. (Renewed Motion for Terminating Sanctions p. 6.) As Defendant is not
the prevailing party, they are not entitled to sanctions.
            
            Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s request for
sanctions.
