  - "A misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not limited to, '[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.'"

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's renewed motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant had alleged that the plaintiff's attorney had forged the verification form and misused the CCP 446 form in responding to the defendant's form interrogatories. However, the judge found that the defendant had not shown that this was anything more than a simple mistake, nor had he shown that terminating sanctions were warranted. The judge noted that terminating sanctions are meant to be a last resort and should only be used in extreme cases. In this case, the judge did not find that the plaintiff's attorney had engaged in a serious forgery warranting terminating sanctions. The judge also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions and attorney's fees, as the defendant is not the prevailing party.
