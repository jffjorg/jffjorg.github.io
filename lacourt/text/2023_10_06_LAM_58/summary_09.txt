And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two points: the adequacy of consideration for a contract and the applicability of the statute of frauds defenses to a promissory fraud claim. The judge holds that defendants' attempt to challenge the adequacy of consideration on demurrer is not well-taken, citing Civil Code section 1605 which defines "good consideration" as any benefit conferred or agreed to be conferred upon the promisor. The judge also rules that the statute of frauds defenses do not apply to the promissory fraud claim, citing Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 18, which held that a fraud claim is not barred by the statute of frauds if the plaintiff can establish an oral promise was made with fraudulent intent.
