[1]           Defendants’ attempt to challenge the
adequacy of the consideration on demurrer is not well-taken. Civil Code section
1605 defines “good consideration,” providing: “Any benefit conferred, or agreed
to be conferred, upon the promisor, by any other person, to which the promisor
is not lawfully entitled, or any prejudice suffered, or agreed to be suffered,
by such person, other than such as he is at the time of consent lawfully bound
to suffer, as an inducement to the promisor, is a good consideration for a promise.”
“[T]he adequacy of consideration to support a contract must be determined as of
the date the contract was entered into, and not in the light of subsequent
events. [Citations.]” (Crail v. Blakely (1973) 8 Cal.3d 744, 753.)


[2]           With respect to the second cause of
action for promissory fraud, the statute of frauds defenses does not apply.
(See Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 18, 28-30 [fraud claim
not barred by statute of frauds if plaintiff can establish oral promise was
made with fraudulent intent].)
