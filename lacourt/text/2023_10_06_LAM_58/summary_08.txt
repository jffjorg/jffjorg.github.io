And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, American Healthcare Systems Corp., Inc. and Michael Sarian, in a case brought by Modern HR, Inc. (Plaintiff). The dispute arises from an oral promise made by Defendant Michael Sarian to Plaintiff, which allegedly promised to repay the debt of $800,000 owed by South City Hospital (SCH) to Plaintiff, in exchange for Plaintiff advancing further payroll and payroll-related expenses to SCH.

The judge rules that the first cause of action, breach of contract, is not barred by the statute of frauds, as the oral agreement is considered an original obligation of the promisor under Civil Code section 2794. The judge also rules that the exception to the statute of frauds applies to the portion of the oral agreement promising to answer for the $800,000 debt owed to Plaintiff by SCH.

The judge also rules that the second cause of action, promissory fraud, is not defective, as Plaintiff has adequately alleged facts showing a breach of an oral contract and demonstrating an exception to the statute of frauds. The judge rejects the defendants' argument that Plaintiff cannot allege that they incurred damages as a result of relying on the oral promise.

The judge concludes that the demurrer is overruled in its entirety, and the defendants shall serve and file their Answer on or before October 27, 2023.
