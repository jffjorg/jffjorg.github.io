Summary in English:

The tentative ruling is a decision by a judge regarding a dispute over a subpoena seeking tax returns and financial information from Respondent. The judge finds that the tax return privilege does not apply in this case, citing public policy concerns and legislative enactments. The judge orders Respondent to produce the requested documents, including tax returns and supporting documents, and modifies the subpoena to make it clearer. The judge also denies Petitioner's request for sanctions against Respondent. The ruling is subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented at the hearing.
