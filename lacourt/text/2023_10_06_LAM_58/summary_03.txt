And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a dispute related to a subpoena issued by a state other than California, brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 2029.600. The respondent, David Williams, argues that the tax return privilege bars production of documents sought in the subpoena. However, the judge rules that the tax return privilege does not apply in this case, citing California statutes and case law that have effectively nullified the privilege in cases involving child support and spousal support. The judge also notes that the Interstate Discovery Act requires that California courts protect California policy interests, including protecting residents from unreasonable or unduly burdensome discovery requests.
