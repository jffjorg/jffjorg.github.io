 
            This action
arises over a dispute on a promise to pay $2,080,000. The Complaint alleges Plaintiff Modern
HR, Inc. (Plaintiff) had a Client Services Agreement with a hospital located in
St. Louis, Missouri known as South City Hospital (SCH) to provide human
resources services. In the course of providing these services, SCH had become
indebted to Plaintiff in the amount of $800,000. Plaintiff announced its intent
to terminate its agreement with SCH and declare a default. In May 2022,
Defendant American Healthcare Systems Corp., Inc. entered into negotiations for
a purchase of the assets and right to operate SCH. At the same time, the Complaint
alleges that Defendant Michael Sarian, made an oral promise to Plaintiff, on
his own behalf and on behalf of Defendant American Healthcare Systems Corp.,
Inc., that if Plaintiff advanced further payroll and payroll-related expenses
to SCH totaling in excess of $1,280,000, Defendants would repay Plaintiff a
total amount in excess of $2,080,000 within one week. The Complaint alleges
that Defendants breached this agreement and also never intended to honor this
promise. On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff Modern HR, Inc. filed a Complaint alleging
(1.) breach of contract, (2.) promissory fraud.  
 
Defendants now demur to the Complaint
based on the statute of frauds and failure to state a claim. Plaintiff opposes
the demurrer.   
 
            The demurrer
to the first and second causes of action is overruled. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint
or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the
purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed,
with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
. . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally construes the
complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton
v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
First
Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
            Defendants demur to this cause of action on the grounds
that it is barred by the statute of frauds, Civil Code section 1624, subdivision (a)(2).
 
            The Complaint alleges that in May 2022, Defendant Michael
Sarian made an oral promise to Plaintiff, on his own behalf and on behalf of
Defendant American Healthcare Systems Corp., Inc., that if Plaintiff advanced
further payroll and payroll-related expenses to SCH totaling in excess of
$1,280,000, Defendants would repay Plaintiff a total amount in excess of
$2,080,000 within one week, which included the $800,000 owed by SCH. (Compl., ¶
10.)
 
“The statute of frauds requires any contract subject
to its provisions to be memorialized in a writing subscribed by the party to be
charged or by the party’s agent. (Civ. Code § 1624; Secrest v. Security
National Mortgage Loan Trust 2002–2 (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 544, 552.)
Civil Code section 1624, subdivision (a)(2) provides, in relevant part: “The
following contracts are invalid, unless they, or some note or memorandum
thereof, are in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by the
party’s agent :…(2) A special promise to answer for the debt, default, or
miscarriage of another, except in the cases provided for in Section 2794.”
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff relies on the exception to the statute of frauds set
forth in Civil Code section 2794. 
 
Civil
Code section 2794 provides, in relevant part: “A promise to answer for the
obligation of another, in any of the following cases, is deemed an original
obligation of the promisor, and need not be in writing: [¶] . . . [¶] (4) Where
the promise is upon a consideration beneficial to the promisor, whether moving
from either party to the antecedent obligation, or from another person.”
 
First,
the Complaint sufficiently alleges new consideration on Plaintiff’s part in exchange
for new consideration offered by Defendants. That is, the contract at issue here
is not a contract solely to answer for the debt of another.  It is an entirely new contract with an
exchange of new consideration by both sides. Here, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff
agreed to advance additional payroll expenses in the amount of $1,280,000 in
exchange for Defendants’ payment for these services within one week. This oral
agreement also, incidentally, included an agreement to pay for the $800,000 debt
of SCH. As such, as a preliminary matter, the entirety of the agreement is not
subject to the statute of fraud.
 
Further,
based on the allegations, the exception set forth in Civil Code section 2794
applies to the portion of the oral agreement promising to answer for the
$800,000 debt owed to Plaintiff by SCH. This is illustrated by Regus v.
Schartkoff (1957) 156 Cal. App. 2d 382. In Regus, the Court of
Appeal applied this exception to find that no writing was required to enforce
an insurance adjuster’s promise that the insurance company would pay
plaintiff’s damages if plaintiff did not retain counsel. Specifically, an
Allstate agent orally promised that plaintiff's damages would be paid by
Allstate if plaintiff did not retain legal counsel and file a lawsuit (Id.
at 390-391.) By promising not to sue, plaintiff provided new consideration,
creating a separate enforceable contract that is not subject to the statute of
frauds under Civil Code section 1624,
subdivision (a)(2). 
 
In
reaching this decision, the Regus court held that: “Whenever a promise
to answer an antecedent obligation of another is made upon a fresh
consideration beneficial to the promisor, no matter from what source it may
move, the promise is an original one and valid though oral; or, as was said in
an early case, whenever the leading and main object of the promisor is not to
become surety or guarantor of another, but to subserve some purpose or interest
of his own, his promise is not within the statute, although the effect of the
promise may be to pay the debt or discharge the obligation of another.” (Id.
at 391.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges, at the time of the oral promise, it refrained from terminating
its contract with SCH in exchange for the oral promise from Defendants that
they would pay $800,000 owed to it by SCH. 
This forbearance constitutes “fresh” consideration[1]
for purposes of Civil Code 2794. In exchange, the Complaint alleges that
Defendant also received a benefit for its promise because this forbearance aided
Defendants’ efforts to “consummate the purchase” of “the assets and right to
operate SCH.” (Compl., ¶ 11.) 
 
The
breach of an oral contract has also been adequately alleged against Defendant Michael
Sarian, individually. (Compl., ¶ 10,) The Court is required to take the
allegations as true for pleading purposes on demurrer. (River's Side at Washington Square Homeowners
Association v. Superior Court of Yolo County (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 1209, 1226 [“The sole issue raised by a general
demurrer is whether the facts pleaded state a valid cause of action, not
whether they are true. No matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff's
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.”].)
 
The
Complaint adequately alleges facts showing a breach of contract and also alleges
facts demonstrating an exception to the statute of frauds. The demurrer to this
cause of action is overruled. 
 
Second
Cause of Action – Promissory Fraud
 
            Defendants
also argue that the second cause of action fails to state a claim with respect
to the $800,000 in damages sought.[2]
 
 
            Promissory
fraud or false promise “ ‘is a subspecies of the action for fraud and deceit. A
promise to do something necessarily implies the intention to perform; hence,
where a promise is made without such intention, there is an implied
misrepresentation of fact that may be actionable fraud.’ [Citations.]” (Engalla
v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 973–974.) “An action
for promissory fraud may lie where a defendant fraudulently induces the
plaintiff to enter into a contract.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.) 
 
The elements
of promissory fraud “are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without
any intention of performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform
at the time the promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promisee
to enter into a transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5)
nonperformance by the party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the
promise[e].” (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1453.) 
 
As with any
other form of fraud, each element of a promissory fraud claim must be alleged
with particularity. (Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039,
1059–1060.) “A plaintiff's burden in asserting a fraud claim against a
corporate employer is even greater. In such a case, the plaintiff must ‘allege
the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,
their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when
it was said or written.’ [Citation.]” (Lazar v. Superior Court, supra, 12
Cal.4th at 645.)
 
            In
demurring to this cause of action, Defendants argue that SCH already owed
$800,000.00 before any alleged promise was made by Defendants such that
Plaintiff cannot allege that they incurred these damages as a result of relying
on any alleged promise by Defendants. Thus, Defendants argue that “Plaintiff
cannot allege or even argue that they incurred the damages of $800,000.00 as a
result of the alleged promises made by Defendants, and Plaintiff’s cause of
action for promissory fraud should be dismissed as to the $800,000.00
previously owed by SCH.” (Dem., 4:26-28.)
 
            Plaintiff does not address this
argument in opposition.  
 
            Nonetheless, Defendants’ arguments are
not an appropriate argument on demurrer. Plaintiff seeks $2,080,000 in damages
based on Defendants’ allegedly false promise. (Compl., ¶¶ 12-13, 20-23, Prayer,
¶ a.) The demurrer here only challenges a portion of these damages: $800,000. (Dem.,
p. 5:3-4 [“For these reasons, Plaintiff’s Complaint should be dismissed as to
Count I of the Complaint and as to the $800,000.00 previously owed by South
City Hospital under Count II.”].) This is an improper basis for a demurrer. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 163 [“[A] demurrer does
not lie to a part of a cause of action.”]; PH II, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682 [“A demurrer does not lie to a
portion of a cause of action.”].) 
 
            Thus, the demurrer to this cause of
action is overruled. 


Conclusion
 
The demurrer is overruled in its
entirety.  Defendants shall serve and
file their Answer on or before October 27, 2023.
