And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration in this employment action. The plaintiff, Eric West, asserts claims for FEHA harassment and failure to prevent harassment against the defendants, including Adams Hummus Bar JV, LLC, Mizlala Wine Bar, Inc., and others. The defendants seek to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff as part of his employment. The court concludes that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) applies in this case because the plaintiff's harassment claim accrued before the EFAA's enactment date of March 3, 2022. The court finds that a dispute did not arise until the plaintiff filed his DFEH complaint in February 2024, which is after the EFAA's enactment date. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
