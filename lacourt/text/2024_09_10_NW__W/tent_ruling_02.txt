BACKGROUND
 
On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff Nicholas
Vilchis filed a complaint against Defendants Michelle Karasick, Matthew
Vasquez, Socal Self Storage-Colorado Boulevard LP (“SSS-COLORADO”), Socal Self
Storage LLC (“SSS”), and On The Move Inc. for 1. Negligence/Negligence Per-Se; 2.
Premises Liability; and 3. Negligent Hiring, Retention & Supervision.
Plaintiff alleges while in a parking lot owned and operated by SSS and
SSS-Colarado, Defendant Karasick caused her truck to crash into a dolly nearby,
which was positioned in front of Plaintiff, causing Plaintiff to fall over and
sustain severe neck injuries. 
 
On August 4, 2023, On The Move, Inc.
filed a cross-complaint against SSS and SSS-Colorado for equitable indemnity,
implied indemnity, contribution, and express indemnity.  
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff
Nicholas Vilchils’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demands for
Production, Set One from Defendant On the Move, Inc. is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Nicholas Vilchis moves this
court for an order compelling Defendant On The Move, Inc. to provide further
responses to Plaintiff’s Demands for Production, Set One on the grounds Defendant
has served responses that are insufficient under the Code of Civil Procedure
and applicable case law. Plaintiff also seeks an award of monetary sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record, Jacobsen & McElroy PC., in the
amount of $4,561.65. 
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).) To prevail, a party
moving for an order compelling further responses to a document production
demand must first offer facts demonstrating “good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).)  This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.”  (TBG
Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Plaintiff asserts good cause exists for
further responses as the demands were drafted with the aim of obtaining
discoverable documents that are relevant to the subject action. Moreover, Defendant
waived objections by failing to timely respond to discovery. According to
Plaintiff, Defendant received four extensions to respond to Plaintiff’s
discovery requests – with responses eventually due on January 26, 2024
(Koppelman Decl. ¶¶4-6.) Defendant, however, did not issue responses until
March 22, 2024. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks to compel Defendant
to withdraw all objections to Document Demand numbers 1-5, 8-9, 13-25, 30-48,
52, 54-55, and also remove the “nonprivileged” language from the response. Plaintiff
contends as answered, Defendant’s responses leave open the possibility that
responsive documents do exist, but Defendant refuses to produce them based on
privilege. Alternatively, Defendant must identify any withheld document in a
privilege log. 
 
Plaintiff also seeks further responses
for Demands for Production. Nos. 26, 27, 28, 29, 44, 49, 50 and 51, claiming
they are deficient. (See Sep. Statement.) Each of these responses assert only
objections based on vagueness, overly broad, unduly burdensome and seeks
documents based on attorney-client privilege and/or work product. 
 
The court finds good cause for further
responses. Defendant has waived objections by failing to timely respond. (Pelton
v. Delta Packaging Prods. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1577 n.13; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.
App. 4th 390, 404.) Parties cannot add late objections after service of initial
discovery responses, absent a court order pursuant to a motion for relief from
waivers. (CCP § 2031.300(a) [“The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver, based upon conditions that response in substantial
compliance was served, and the failure was result of mistake, inadvertence or
excusable neglect.” Emphasis added].) Moreover, the requests are not vague or
overly broad. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Nicholas Vilchils’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Demands for Production, Set One from Defendant On the Move, Inc. is GRANTED in
its entirety.  Further responses without
objections to be served within 30 days. 
 
Sanctions
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(d) provides that for mandatory monetary
sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(CCP § 2030.300(d).)
 
Plaintiff
seeks $4,561.65 in monetary sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of
record Jacobsen & McElroy PC for having to bring the instant motion.
Plaintiff seeks six hours meeting and conferring and preparing and revising the
instant Motion to Compel, an additional 2 hours preparing the reply brief and 1
hour attending the hearing on the matter. Counsel’s hourly rate is $500.00.
Counsel also seeks $61.65 for bringing the instant motion. 
 
The
court GRANTS the request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,061.65 (3
hours preparing the motion, 1 hour attending the hearing, and the filing fee).
The court will not award sanctions for Plaintiff’s statutory obligation to meet
and confer. Moreover, no opposition was filed.  Sanctions payable within 30 days.
