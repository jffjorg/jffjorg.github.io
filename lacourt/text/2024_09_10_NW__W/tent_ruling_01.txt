BACKGROUND
 
This is personal injury action involves an alleged slip-and-fall
incident that occurred on September 11, 2020, at a 7-Eleven franchise store
located in Van Nuys, CA (the “Subject Incident”). 
 
Plaintiff Carlos Josue Arita filed the instant action’s Complaint
on December 9, 2021 and filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December
20, 2021, against defendants 7-Eleven Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to
100. On February 17, 2023, Plaintiff added S and R Luthra Inc. (dba
7-Eleven as Doe 1, Suresh Kumar Luthra as Doe 2, and Saroj Luthra as Doe 3.
Plaintiff dismissed 7-Eleven, Inc. on March 21, 2023. 
 
The instant action is related to 22STCV28081 (Carlos Arita v.
Saros Luthra) and 22STCV28062 (Carlos Arita v. Suresh Kumar Luthra).

 
On May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. The
SAC alleges negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff added back 7-Eleven,
Inc. on December 18, 2023. On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended
Complaint after seeking leave to amend. Plaintiff now seeks leave to file a
Fourth Amended Complaint. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend the
3rd Amended Complaint and File Fourth Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves the court for an order granting leave to amend the
Third Amended Complaint and file a Fourth Amended Complaint pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), 576, and California Rules of Court, Rule
3.134.  While Plaintiff counsel filed a
notice of errata on 8/27 asserting that Plaintiff did not file their third
amended complaint and P is actually seeking to file a 2nd amended complaint,
this does not appear to be correct. The original complaint was filed 12/9/21,
another complaint was filed on 8/29/22 (as a matter of right), another complaint
was filed on 5/4/23 via ex parte application on 4/11/23, and the final one
filed 5/13/24, that was granted via motion on 4/17/24.
 
Leave to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a) and section 576. The policy favoring amendment and
resolving all matters in the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case
in which denial of leave to amend can be justified. . ..” “Although courts are
bound to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the
complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial
[citations], this policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to
the adverse party . . .. [citation]. A different result is indicated ‘where
inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is shown.
[Citation].” (Magpali v. Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
487.)  
 
A complainant may obtain leave from the trial court to amend his
pleading beyond the number of amendments allowed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 472 (a) by filing a noticed motion.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1324.)¿ The motion
must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise
to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not
made earlier.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1324 (b).)¿The motion must also include (1) a copy
of the proposed and numbered amendment, and (2) specifications by reference to
pages, paragraphs, and lines of the allegations that would be deleted and/or
added. (CRC Rule 3.1324(a).) 
 
Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to allege causes of action for
False Imprisonment and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
Plaintiff’s new counsel believes that there are facts sufficient to support these
claims, which relate to the facts already existing in the current complaint.
Moreover, the current action is still in the pleading stage and the parties
have not completed the discovery process. As such, Defendant will not be
prejudiced by the addition of the new causes of action. 
 
The motion is unopposed. Plaintiff has
substantially complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324 by
submitting a proposed copy of the proposed amended complaint. Plaintiff has
also submitted a separate declaration. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to Amend the 3rd Amended Complaint and File Fourth Amended Complaint is
GRANTED.
