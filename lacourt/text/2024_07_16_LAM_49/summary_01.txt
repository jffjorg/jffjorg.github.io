And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Julio Garcia v. The County of Los Angeles, granting the plaintiff's motion to compel disclosure of peace officer personnel records. The judge found that the plaintiff has met the good cause showing required under the Pitchess procedure, as the employee records sought are clearly material to the subject matter involved in the litigation. However, the judge modified the scope of the discovery request, limiting it to documents going back five years instead of the originally requested ten-year scope. The judge also set an in camera hearing to review the records and make a determination on their relevance to the case. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the in camera hearing, unless waived.
