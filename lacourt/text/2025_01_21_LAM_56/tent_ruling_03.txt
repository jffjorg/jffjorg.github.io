MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants City of Torrance,
Jeremiah Hart, Daniel Lee, and Karen Farmer (collectively, “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Mark Steven Hassoldt (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of an employment
relationship. On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint
(“Complaint”) alleging causes of action for: (1) discrimination based on
physical disability [Government Code (“Gov. Code”) § 12940(a)]; (2) harassment
based on physical disability [Gov. Code § 12940(j)]; (3) failure to prevent
discrimination [Gov. Code § 12940(k); (4) retaliation [Gov. Code § 12940(h);
(5) failure to accommodate physical disability [Gov. Code § 12940(m)]; and (6)
failure to engage in a good faith interactive process [Gov. Code § 12940(n)].) 
 
            On
November 15, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to deem
the demurrer (“Demurrer”) papers filed on the original filing date of November
7, 2024. On December 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Demurrer
(the “Opposition”). On December 24, 2024, Defendants filed a reply (the
“Reply”). 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.10, subd.
(e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
Second
Cause of Action – Harassment Based on Physical Disability [Gov. Code §
12940(j)]
Government Code section 12940, subdivision
(j)(1) prohibits harassment of an employee “because of race, religious creed,
color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability,
medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender
identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran
status.” (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (j)(1).) The elements of a cause of action
for harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”) are: (1)
plaintiff belongs to a protected group; (2) plaintiff was subject to
harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on the plaintiff’s
membership in the protected group; (4) the harassment complained of was
sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create
an abusive working environment; and (5) respondeat superior. (Jones v.
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1367,
1377.) 
 
Harassment involves verbal, physical,
visual and/or sexual conduct that creates a hostile or offensive working
environment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11019(b).) To establish a hostile work
environment, harassment must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the
conditions of the plaintiff’s employment and create an abusive working
environment. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, 214
Cal.App.3d at p. 609.)  “The working environment must be evaluated in
light of the totality of the circumstances: ‘whether an environment is
“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the
circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;
its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere
offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s
work performance.’ ” (Miller v. Dept. of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th
446, 462.)  Generally, negative employment decisions, such as termination
or demotion, cannot form the basis of a hostile environment claim and are
suited to a discrimination claim.  However, “some office employment
actions done in furtherance of a supervisor’s managerial role can also have a
secondary effect of communicating a hostile message.  This occurs when the
actions establish a widespread pattern of bias.” (Roby
v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 707-11 (Roby).) 
 
            Defendants demur to the second cause
of action for harassment because “Plaintiff fails to: (1) allege specific facts
establishing that the City and any of the Individual Defendants subjected
Plaintiff to harassing comments or abusive conduct, (2) any conduct complained
of was based on Plaintiff’s disability, (3) any alleged harassment was severe
or pervasive, and (4) any alleged harassment existed outside the scope of
personnel management.” (Demurrer, p. 11:19-22.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges disability harassment
under FEHA against all Defendants. The Complaint alleges as follows: When Plaintiff
learned that he was to be moved from his concealed weapons assignment to the
Radio Room, he told a Lieutenant that this assignment would adversely affect
his health, and the Lieutenant responded that “shit happens.” (Compl. ¶
23.)  At the direction of Defendant Hart,
Plaintiff was subsequently assigned to the Radio Room. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff
alleges that working the graveyard shift exacerbated his insomnia and high
blood pressure and as a result he “called off” his shifts from time to time.
(Compl. ¶ 24.) Defendant “Farmer told Plaintiff that he was taking too much
time off in the Radio Room and if Plaintiff continued to do so, she would
remove him from that assignment.” (Compl. ¶ 25.) Plaintiff alleges that in June
2024, he was told that he was not allowed to return to work until there was an
accommodations meeting and that his disability payments were terminated.
(Compl. ¶ 29.) Plaintiff alleges that in June 2024, Plaintiff’s disability
payments were reinstated but he only received 75% of the amount to which he was
entitled. (Compl. ¶ 32.) The Complaint alleges that “Defendants, and each of
them, harassed Plaintiff by continually and pervasively refusing to assign him
to light duty positions, assigning him to the Radio Room, terminating his
disability benefits and constructively discharging him, as alleged herein.”
(Compl. ¶ 47.) 
 
            Defendants argue that Plaintiff has
failed to allege any interpersonal conduct, as opposed to employment actions,
by the individual Defendants sufficient to state a harassment claim and that
the actions Plaintiff alleges are regardless not sufficiently severe or
pervasive to constitute actionable harassment. (Demurrer, pp. 11:23-17:4.) In
the Opposition, Plaintiff asserts that even a single incident of harassing
conduct is sufficient for actionable harassment (Opp. pp. 3:19-5:5), and that employment
actions can constitute harassment in violation of the FEHA. (Opp. p. 6:7-25;
Roby, supra, 47 Cal.4th at 708.) 
 
            In the Reply, Defendants reiterate
that Plaintiff’s allegations amount only to personnel management actions and do
not convey a hostile message. (Reply, pp. 2:25-6:15.) 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff’s harassment
allegations are insufficient to support a cause of action in violation of FEHA.
The conduct alleged in the Complaint, assigning Plaintiff to the Radio Room,
warning Plaintiff that he would be removed from that assignment if continued to
call out from his shifts, and terminating and then reinstating his disability
payments at 75% amount only to personnel management actions. In Roby, the
plaintiff relied on both harassing conduct and personnel management actions to
successfully support her harassment claim. (Roby, supra, 47 Cal.4th at 710.)
The Complaint does not plead how Plaintiff’s reassignment was based on
Plaintiff’s protected status. The Complaint otherwise does not allege verbal,
physical, visual or sexual conduct by Defendants that was severe or pervasive
enough to create an abusive working environment for Plaintiff. Thus, the
Demurrer to the second cause of action for harassment is SUSTAINED.
 
            Defendants’ Demurrer is SUSTAINED,
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
