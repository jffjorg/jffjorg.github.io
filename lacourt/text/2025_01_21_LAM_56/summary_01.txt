And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions of counsel Ronald Richards and Geoffrey S. Long to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Yogi Securities Holdings, LLC. The motions were filed on December 18, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge found that the motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal, citing California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(4), which allows an attorney to request permission to withdraw if the client fails to cooperate or makes it difficult for the attorney to carry out the employment effectively. The judge also noted that there is no showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings, as the trial is currently set for July 14, 2025. The judge ordered an Order to Show Cause re Representation on February 13, 2025, to discuss plaintiff's retention of new counsel.
