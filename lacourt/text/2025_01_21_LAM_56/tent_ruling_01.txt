            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            On February 9, 2024, plaintiff Yogi
Securities Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative third amended
complaint (“TAC”) against Defendants Jona Rechnitz, Robert Rechnitz, JSR
Capital, LLC, Alan “AVI” Golombeck, Agol Holdings, LLC, Ayal Frist, Stateland
Brown, LLC, (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1-100 asserting causes of
action for: (1) Breach of Contract – Count 1; (2) Breach of Contract – Count 2;
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Breach of Guaranty; (5) Conversion; (6)
Negligent Misrepresentation; (7) Fraud and Concealment; and (8) Civil Theft (Cal.
Penal Code, § 496).   
 
             On December 18, 2024, both Richards and Long
filed motions to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff (the “Motions”). The
Motions are unopposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time
before or after judgment or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the
consent of both client and attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the
application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”¿
(CCP § 284; California Rules of Court (“CRC”) 3.1362.)¿ The withdrawal request
may be denied if it would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but
the court's discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably.¿ (Mandell
v. Superior (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003)
112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)¿
 
In making a motion to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362.¿ The motion must be made using mandatory forms:¿ 
¿ 

Notice of
     Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client
     (MC-051);¿ 


Declaration
     “stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of
     the attorney-client relationship” the reasons that the motion was brought
     (MC-052);¿and 


Proposed
     Order (MC-053).¿ 

¿ 
The forms must be timely filed and served
on all parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (CRC rule 3.1362.)¿ If these
documents are served on the client by mail, there must be a declaration stating
either that the address where client was served is “the current residence or
business address of the client” or “the last known residence or business
address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current
address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the
filing of the motion to be relieved.”¿ (CRC rule 3.1362 subd. (d)(1).)¿ 
 
The court has discretion on whether to
allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is generally permitted unless
there is a compelling reason to continue the representation.  (Heple v.
Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)   
 
            Both Richards and Long filed a
Notice of Motion and Motion (MC-051), Declaration in Support of Motion (MC-052)
and Proposed Order (MC-053). As reason for the Motions, counsel states: “California
Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(4), allows a state bar member to
request permission to withdraw if the client fails, "or by other conduct
renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out the employment
effectively." (Both MC-052, ¶ 2.) The forms were served on the client and
Defendants via mail and/or electronic transmission on December 18, 2024. (All
Forms, Proof of Service.) Counsel confirmed via email that the client’s address
is current. (Both MC-052, ¶ 3(b)(1).) Finally, there is no showing that
withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings as trial is
currently set for July 14, 2025. Thus, the Court finds that the Motions set
forth an adequate basis for withdrawal.  
 
Ronald Richards’s and Geoffrey Long’s Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Yogi Securities Holdings, LLC are
GRANTED. Because Plaintiff is a corporation, it cannot represent itself in this
case. The Court therefore sets an Order to Show Cause re Representation for February
13, 2025 at 8:30 am to discuss Plaintiff’s retention of counsel.
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 21st day of January 2025
