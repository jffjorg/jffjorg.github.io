(collectively, “Defendants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants
on January 18, 2023. The action arises from alleged fraudulent transfers
and/or voidable transfers of assets—namely, Porch.Com, Inc. common unregistered
stock – by Kandela in connection with Porch.Com, Inc.’s acquisition of certain Kandela
assets. The currently operative second amended complaint (“SAC”) alleges the
following causes of action: (1) actual intent fraudulent conveyance/voidable
transfer; (2) constructive fraudulent conveyance/voidable transfer; (3)
indemnification; (4) breach of contract as to the defendant members; (5)
equitable subrogation; and (6) equitable indemnity. 
 
            On December
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for relief from waiver of
objections (the “Motion”). On January 7, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition to
the Motion (the “Opposition”). On January 13, 2025, Plaintiff filed a reply
(the “Reply”). 
             
DISCUSSION
            The trial court has broad discretion
to grant relief from waiver of objections on a noticed motion upon determining
that: (a) the moving party subsequently served discovery responses which are
substantially code compliant; and (b) the moving party’s failure to timely
serve responses “was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”  (Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”), §§ 2030.290 subd. (a),
2031.300 subd. (a), and 2033.280 subd. (a).) 
 
            On October 22, 2024, Gordon served
Plaintiff with Request for Production of Documents (Set One), Requests for
Admission (Set Two) and Form Interrogatories (Set Two). (Victor Decl., ¶ 2, Ex.
A.) Plaintiff did not serve responses by the November 25, 2024 deadline. (Mot.
p. 2:13-15) Plaintiff states that the responses were not timely served due to an
“inadvertent failure to calendar the response deadline.” (Mot. p. 8:15.) Plaintiff
has not, however, subsequently served substantially code-compliant responses. (Mot.
pp. 6:13-8:12.) Plaintiff asserts that it has not yet provided substantive
responses because responding to the discovery requests requires Plaintiff “to
include information protected by a confidentiality provision contained in a
previously executed Settlement Agreement between Defendants Eli Gordon and
David Fiedler on the one hand and Scottsdale’s insured Porch.com and Matthew
Ehrlichman on the other hand.” (Mot. pp. 6:28-7:3; Victor Decl. ¶ 4.)  The Court finds that this is not an adequate
excuse for Plaintiff’s failure to respond.
 
            The Code of Civil Procedure grants courts
with discretion to relieve a party from waiver of objections upon determining
that (1) the moving party has subsequently served a response and (2) “the
response is in substantial compliance with the statutory provisions governing
the form and content of interrogatory responses…” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 407; CCP, §§ 2030.290 (a), 2031.300 (a), and 2033.280 (a). ) In this
case, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff has satisfied either of the above
conditions. Thus, the Motion is DENIED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Relief from
Waiver of Objections is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
