And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel further responses to plaintiff's requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Pooled C. Tchang, alleges that the defendant, KIA AMERICA, INC., failed to provide sufficient responses to his requests. The defendant argues that its responses were satisfactory and that the plaintiff's claims of defects in the vehicle are unfounded.

The court finds that the plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issues informally. The parties did engage in some meet and confer efforts, but these efforts were not sufficient. The court also finds that the plaintiff's separate statement did not adequately establish a proper reason for compelling further responses.

Based on these findings, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his requests for production of documents.
