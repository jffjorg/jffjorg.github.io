Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses without objections to the requests for production of documents (set one). The plaintiff served the requests on October 12, 2023, and the defendant failed to respond. The court finds that the plaintiff properly served the requests and the defendant failed to serve verified responses. Therefore, the court orders the defendant to serve verified responses without objections to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents (set one) within 20 days of this order.
