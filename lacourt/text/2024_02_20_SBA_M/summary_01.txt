Significant Statements:

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the City of Gardena's motion for judgment on the pleadings and motion to sever. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted with 20 days leave to amend, as the first and second causes of action are duplicative and fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The motion to sever is denied, as the incidents are related and the same defendant is involved in both. The Court finds that severance would not further convenience or avoid prejudice to the Court or the parties, and that the trial of the two incidents together is more efficient and economical. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
