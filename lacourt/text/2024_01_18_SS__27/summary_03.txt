And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered Ralphs Grocery Company's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in a premises liability case involving a slip and fall incident in the parking lot of one of its stores. The plaintiff, Mark Jablonski, slipped and fell on February 2, 2020, and alleges that the store was negligent in its maintenance of the parking lot.

The judge has found that Ralphs has met its initial burden to establish the absence of a triable issue of material fact on the issue of whether the painted arrow on the ground and the wet condition of the ground due to rain constituted an open and obvious condition. However, the judge has declined to grant summary judgment on this ground, as it does not address the foreseeability of the danger and whether Ralphs had a duty to remedy it.

The judge has also found that Ralphs has established the absence of a triable issue of material fact on the issue of notice, as there is no evidence that Ralphs had prior knowledge of any dangerous conditions in the parking lot.

Based on these findings, the judge has granted Ralphs' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of material fact on the issues of duty, breach, causation, and damages.
