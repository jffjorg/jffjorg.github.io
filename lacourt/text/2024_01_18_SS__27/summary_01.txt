And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to discovery requests and request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff filed the action on November 5, 2020, and served Form Interrogatories, Set One on defendant on August 1, 2023. However, defendant failed to serve timely responses, and the plaintiff proceeded to file the motion. The court finds that defendant has since sent responses, making the motion to compel responses moot. The plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is denied due to a lack of substantial justification and the fact that the defendant was in contact with the plaintiff and sought an extension of time to provide the responses.
