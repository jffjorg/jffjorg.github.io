[2] To the
extent Plaintiff contends that the rainwater is the dangerous condition, the
Court agrees with Ralphs that rainwater is open and obvious and, thus, does not
constitute a dangerous condition here.  (See,
e.g., Nicoletti v. Kest, (2023) 97 Cal. App. 5th 140.) 


[3]   The Court recognizes that Plaintiff’s expert
took her measurements long after the incident and that Defendant’s expert took
measurements after Plaintiff’s expert that demonstrate sufficient slip
resistance.  Because the Court grants
summary judgment on other grounds, it does not herein address those issues.  
 
     The Court
also recognizes that Defendant’s open and obvious argument has some application
here. Again, because the Court grants summary judgment on other grounds, it
does not herein address that argument.
