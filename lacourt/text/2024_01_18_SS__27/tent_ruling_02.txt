     CASE NO.: 21STCV08600
 
RE:
  MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
January
  18, 2024



 
On January 17, 2024, the Court heard argument from
the parties and thereafter reviewed the videotapes that had been submitted to
the Court.  Unfortunately, the Court still
has questions regarding the Motions for Summary Judgment.  It may order additional briefing, but at
today’s hearing, it would like the parties to address the following questions:
 
How does this case differ from Abdulkadhim
v. Wu, (2020), 53 Cal. App. 5th 298?
How do the alleged negligence and
regulatory violations impact the application of the Sudden Emergency Doctrine?  Specifically, assuming for the sake of
argument that Hull violated any commercial driving regulation, can he still seek
application of the emergency doctrine? 
If not, why not?  If so, does he
have to demonstrate that the violation was not the cause of the accident? Can
he do that such that there is no factual dispute?  Same re Rodriguez?
What would be
the impact of a finding that the emergency doctrine applied to Hull on
Rodriguez?  Could Hull still somehow be
responsible for contributory damages?
Beyond these
questions, the Court would like to discuss narrowing the issues in this case
under any circumstances.  It appears Plaintiff
agrees he does not have direct causes of action against any employer here.  Correct?
