And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a slip and fall incident that occurred when rainwater accumulated on the floor. The judge agrees with the defendant, Ralphs, that rainwater is open and obvious and therefore does not constitute a dangerous condition. The court also notes that the plaintiff's expert took measurements after the incident, while the defendant's expert took measurements afterwards, which demonstrated sufficient slip resistance. The court grants summary judgment on other grounds, and does not address alternative arguments. The ruling is supported by the case of Nicoletti v. Kest (2023) 97 Cal. App. 5th 140.
