And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions for summary judgment and has questions regarding the application of the Sudden Emergency Doctrine in this case. The Court is seeking clarification from the parties on how this case differs from a previous case, Abdulkadhim v. Wu, and how the alleged negligence and regulatory violations impact the application of the doctrine. The Court also wants to discuss narrowing the issues in the case and is seeking additional briefing from the parties. The Court is specifically seeking answers to questions such as whether Hull can still seek application of the emergency doctrine if he violated a commercial driving regulation, and whether Rodriguez can be responsible for contributory damages if the doctrine applies to Hull.
