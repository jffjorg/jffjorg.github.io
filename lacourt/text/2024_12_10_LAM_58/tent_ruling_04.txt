 
The parties settled this Song-Beverly
matter except as to the issues of attorney fees and costs. Plaintiff now moves
for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
Plaintiff argues that, as the
prevailing party, she is entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d). Plaintiff seeks lodestar attorneys’ fees of $64,492.50, plus $3,500 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review
Defendant’s Opposition and draft the Reply, plus a 1.35 multiplier -- in the
amount of $22,572.38 -- and costs of $9,643.35. The total requested in
attorney fees and costs is $100,208.23. 
 
Defendants Ford Motor Company and Advantage Ford Lincoln filed an opposition, arguing the
amounts requested in fees and costs are excessive and unreasonable. (Opp.,
Ross Decl., Ex. F.)
 
The motion is granted in a reduced
amount. 
 
Plaintiff’s objection to Defendants’
evidence is ruled as follows: Nos. 1-3 are overruled. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff seeks
$67,992.5 in attorneys’ fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC, plus
a 1.35 multiplier enhancement, and costs of $9,643.35, for a total of $100,208.23.

 
In opposition, Defendant GM argues
that the Court should limit the attorney fee award to $25,092.00 in fees and not
award any amount in costs.
 
            A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ” (Id.¿at p.
1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿(Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial
courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The
essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not
to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their
overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an
attorney's time.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
I.              
Hourly Rate: 
 
            In
assessing the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on
its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation],
the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
[citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in
the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of
factors…[including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount
to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability
of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            Here, Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks court approval of hourly rates ranging from $350 to $595. (Shahian
Decl., Ex. 22.) Defendants argue that the Plaintiff’s hourly rates are
unreasonable. Specifically, Defendants note that -- five attorneys, Ivy Choderker, Joy
De Leon, Ian McCalister, Elizabeth Larocque, Karin Kuemerle -- billed at a rate
of $595 per hour for a routine lemon law case, which Defendants contend is “highly
excessive rates for the routine and cookie-cutter work performed in this lemon
law matter;” Defendants also notes that this rate was the same rate as the partner’s
billing rate, but these attorneys are not partners.
 
            While these
attorneys may not be partners, the most experienced of these individuals have nearly
25 years of legal experience. (See e.g. Shahian Decl., ¶¶ 66-67 [noting McCallister
graduated from New York University Law School in 1998 and was admitted to the
California State Bar the same year].) Thus, a review of the declaration submitted
in support of the motion for attorney’s fees – which contains a description of
attorneys’ education, experience and bar passage date – supports finding
Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates ranging from $350 to $595 are reasonable;
the rates are supported by substantial evidence under the present
circumstances. (Shahian Decl., ¶¶ 47-81.)
 
Based on the Court's familiarity
with the current local market, and Plaintiff’s evidence of the experience and
skills of the various attorneys – the Court finds that Plaintiff's requested
rates per hour – although high – are reasonable. These high hourly rates,
however, bear on the reasonableness of the hours incurred given the purported
skill and expertise of these attorneys. 
 
II.            
Number of Hours Incurred: 
 
            Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on the 136.20 hours spent by their attorneys litigating
this case. Defendants challenge the reasonableness of the number of hours
incurred for various tasks during this litigation.[1]

 
Discovery-Related Work: Plaintiff seeks 7.5 hours (or $4,055)
for drafting discovery requests, an ESI letter, and a notice of deposition of
Ford’s PMQ. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 22, p. 1.) The fees incurred on these discovery
related matters are excessive especially given the seemingly template discovery
used in this matter and Plaintiff’s counsel extensive experience in this type
of litigation. The Court will reduce the fees by 5 hours at $550 hours. (Shahian
Decl., Ex. 22, p. 1 [10-11-2021].) Plaintiff also seeks to recover 2.8 hours (or
$1,540) to draft and finalize Plaintiff’s discovery responses and prepare
document production on May 21, 2024. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 22, p. 3.) However, Defendants
represents that they did not receive additional discovery responses or document
production from Plaintiff around or after this date. The Court will strike
these hours.  Further, in reviewing other
discovery related fees, the Court will reduce the fees by 3 hours at $595 (Shahian
Decl., Ex. 22, [3-18-22]) and 3 hours at $595 (Shahian Decl., Ex. 22, [1-21-24]).
Accordingly, the Court will reduce discovery related fees by $7,860. 
 
General Fees: (1.) Plaintiff
also seeks to recover 1.4 hours or $525.00, to revise and finalize a
declaration for a OSC Re: Plaintiff’s failure to appear. Defendant argues that Plaintiff
should not be able to recover fees for their own failures in prosecuting the
case. The Court agrees and fees are reduced by $525. (2.) Additionally, Plaintiff
also requests 2 hours for preparing for ex parte to continue the trial and
relate dates, The Court will reduce this by 1 hour for $475. Thus, these fees
are reduced by a total of $1,000. 
 
Arbitration Motion: Plaintiff requests 7.5 hours, or
$3,187.50, to recover fees incurred drafting the opposition to Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 22, p. 1 [7/9/2021].) These
fees are excessive given the simple legal issues involved in the opposition and
Plaintiff’s counsel legal experience. The Court will reduce these fees by 4
hours or $1,700.
 
Fee Motion: Finally, Plaintiff billed 9.20
hours or $2,990.00 to draft Plaintiff’s instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees,
with an additional $3,500 in fees anticipated for the reply and hearing. Again,
these fees are excessive for a straightforward fee motion, which did not
involve any complex legal analysis on whether fees were warranted and there was
no apportionment or prevailing party issues. The Court will reduce these fees
by $3,000.  
 
            Multiplier
adjustment:
 
            Finally,
Plaintiff seeks a 1.35 lodestar multiplier based on the risk of taking this
case on contingency, the delay in payment, and the excellent outcome.  
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although
this matter was taken on contingency (Shahian Decl., ¶ 87), none of the other
factors support the application of a multiplier. This was a garden variety
Song-Beverly case; there were no novel or difficult questions presented. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834.) Further,
the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿that Plaintiff’s attorneys¿assert
are absorbed by¿their¿already high (albeit reasonable) hourly rates. (See¿Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
            Adjustments
to attorneys’ fees are summarized as follows:
 




Reduction Category


Reductions Amount 


Total




 


 


$67,992.50




Discovery-Related Work


$7,860


 




General Fees


$1,000


 




Arbitration Motion


$1,700


 




Fee Motion


$3,000


 




Reduced Lodestar Amount


$13,560


$54,432.50




 
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees in the sum of $54,432.50.
 
Costs: 
 
Finally, Defendants challenge
Plaintiff’s request for costs seeking a strike all the costs requested. Defendants
argue that Plaintiff seeks unrecoverable costs and does not present any
evidence to support her costs.
 
Here, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s
request for expert witness fees in the amount of $1,678 is not recoverable
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
 
In Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, the court concluded
that a statute (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d)) which allowed the prevailing party
to recover “ ‘as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney's fees' “ (italics added), was
intended “to cover items not included in the detailed statutory definition of
‘costs' “ in section 1033.5. (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc., supra,
35 Cal.App.4th at p. 137.) In concluding that expert witness fees could be
recovered as “expenses” under that statute, the Court noted legislative history
specifically supporting that conclusion. (Id. at p. 138.)


However, in interpreting section
1794, subdivision (d), the Court of Appeal in Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, held that the prevailing party still
has the burden of showing that costs or expenses were (1) reasonably necessary
to the conduct of litigation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id. at p.
816.)


Here, the reply does not address the
reasonableness of the expert witness fees. Nevertheless, such fees are regularly
incurred in this type of litigation and are reasonably necessary to prosecuting
a lemon law case. 
 
Defendants also challenge Plaintiff’s
request for costs in the amount of $300.00 for “Expense paid to WDRC for
Mediation Services” on February 22, 2024 and $270 for the same on May 1, 2024.
Defendant notes that the parties agreed to split the costs of mediation, but
now Plaintiff seeks to recover their portion. Without any legal authority,
Defendants argues that “[t]his should not be allowed.” Defendants’ objection is
not well taken. 
 
Finally, Plaintiff also seeks to
recover the cost for “Expense paid to Veritext for Hearing Attendance” for
$545.00 but does not specify why this cost was paid or what hearing it was for.
The Reply does not address this cost. This Court will strike this request for
cost in the amount of $545. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will grant costs in the reduced
amount of $9,098.35.
            
Conclusion
 
            The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. In sum, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $54,432.50, which is a reduction of the
lodestar amount by $13,560. The request for costs is granted in the
amount of $9,098.35.  
 
            Defendants
are ordered to pay to Plaintiff’s counsel the sum of $63,530.85 ($54,432.50+ $9,098.35) for attorneys’ fees and costs.  Defendants are ordered to pay this amount on
or before February 11, 2025.
