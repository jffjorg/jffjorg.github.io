[1] As noted by
Defendant, a party’s counsel has an ethical obligation when he knows the
identity of the attorney representing defendant to warn that attorney before
requesting entry of default. (Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 681, 701.) Plaintiff maintains that any failure to not inform
Defense Counsel of the default was due a clerical error because the request for
entry of default was submitted on 4/10/2024. (See Opp., Ex. 1.) It is unclear
at what time the (initial) request for entry of default was made, but Defense
Counsel’s initial email was made on 4/10/2024 at 11:25 AM. (See Motion,
Schmeckpeper Decl., Ex. B, 24 of 46 of PDF.) 


[2] The reply does not
address either case. 
 


[3] Plaintiff states
that Rogalski is different because there the defendants promptly
retained counsel to request an extension, which this Defendant could have done
it. (Opp. p. 7.) As stated before, many if not all insurance policies have a
provision that the insurance company will defend a party in the event of a
lawsuit, so the insurance company will hire and
pay for a lawyer to defend the case against the named defendant. Thus, one need
not hire an attorney. 


[4] Defendant’s
declaration states her husband, i.e., a third-party witness, observed Plaintiff
at the scene of the accident and he did not appear injured. 
 


[5] Defendant has filed
a proposed answer to the complaint, but the court docket does not provide that
a proposed order as to this motion has been filed.
