  Case Number:  24PSCV00586    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION FOR ORDERS SETTING ASIDE DEFAULT AND PERMITTING
THE FILING OF A RESPONSIVE PLEADING is GRANTED because Defendant
mistakenly believed State Farm was going to timely assign her file to counsel
for handling of her case. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident.
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff Dong Woo Kim filed suit
against Defendant Jennifer To Shen for (1) Motor Vehicle and (2) General
Negligence for an accident that happened on 10/23/2022.
 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a POS indicating that Defendant was served via
personal service on March 2, 2024.  
 
On April 11, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant.
 
On April 12, 2024 (at 3:24 PM), Defendant filed her answer
to the complaint. 
 
On April 23, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion. 
 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition.
 
On May 21, 2024, Defendant filed her reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Defendant brings forth the motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure (CCP) section 473(b) on the ground the failure to timely file an
answer was the result of mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect.
(Motion p. 2.) 
 
A mistake of fact occurs when a person understands the facts
to be other than they are. (Opp. p. 5, citing Hodge Sheet Metal Products v.
Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 653, 656.) “Excusable
neglect” refers to “‘that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably
prudent person under the same circumstances.’” 
(Lint v. Chisholm (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 615, 620, citation
omitted.) “Inadvertence is defined as lack of heedfulness or attentiveness,
inattention, fault from negligence.” (Ibid, internal citation omitted.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant’s motion presents the following series of events which
she argues supports relief:
 
-       
Within one week of being served, Defendant
made copies of the documents and forwarded them to her State Farm agent to send
to State Farm’s claims department.
-       
Defendant followed up
with my State Farm agent twice over the next two weeks and was advised
by the agent the documents had been forwarded to the appropriate person for handling
State Farm claims. The agent told her that she would be contacted by State Farm
about the case. 
-       
On March 26, 2024, State Farm prepared the
file so it could be assigned to the law firm Mark R. Weiner & Associates
(the firm) to represent defendant in the action.  The file, however, “fell through the cracks.” As a
result, the firm did not receive the file until April 10, 2024.
-       
On
April 10, 2024,
upon receipt of the file from State Farm, the firm
sent an e-mail to plaintiff’s counsel requesting an extension to answer the
complaint since it had just received the file.
-       
On April 11, 2024,
Kathy Schmeckpeper (attorney assigned to Defendant’s case) called plaintiff’s
counsel on April 11, 2024, to discuss the case. 
Plaintiff’s counsel was not available so she left a detailed message
explaining she had just received the file and requesting an extension to
answer.
-       
On April 12, 2024, Defense Counsel
followed up on the request for an extension. 
Plaintiff’s counsel responded via e-mail that default had been filed the
previous day. Defense counsel attempted to call Plaintiff’s Counsel to see if
he would agree to stipulate to setting aside the default, but Plaintiff’s
Counsel did not call back. (See Motion pp. 3-4.)[1]
Here, based off the foregoing, the court determines that relief
is warranted. Though Plaintiff argues that “Defendant failed to take any
action within the legally prescribed timeframe” (Opp. p. 2:6-7, emphasis
added) or that Defendant “Defendant chose to ignore the summons and
complaint” (Opp. p. 6:21-22) or that “Defendant[‘s] failure to retain an
attorney and file answer was not inadvertence but gross negligence” (Opp. p.
7:7-8) or that “By failing to do [ensure that her defense was managed properly
and timely], she demonstrated a flagrant disregard of her duty to present a
defense to the present action. (Opp. p. 7:24-25), the timeline completely
undermines Plaintiff’s characterization. Defendant did act promptly
by informing her insurance of the lawsuit and followed up twice on
her claim. Sure, Defendant could have contacted her insurance everyday
for thirty days starting from the date of service, but absent authority
presented by Plaintiff that the statute requires such degree of
attention, the court finds subscribing to Plaintiff’s position would “set a
dangerous precedent.” (Opp. p. 8:24-25.) 
 
To the extent that Plaintiff cites to Davis v. Thayer
(1980) 113 Cal. App. 3d 892 and Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406,
none of those cases are apposite.[2]  
 
For one, Davis included an admission by the
defendant that he made no effort in defending the action. (Id. at
pp. 905-906.) Here, however, Defendant did consult her insurance company
about what to do (and insurance companies generally represent the insured).
Thus, Plaintiff’s quotations are taken out of context, which is improper. As
for Huh, that case was based upon an attorney’s failure to oppose
a summary judgment motion. Here, however, any failure was at the expense of a
third-party (the insurance company) not Defense counsel. Even assuming the
facts were similar, there, the attorney was “aware of his failure” to file
an opposition for months. (Id. at p. 1420, italics added.) Here,
however, Defendant was not aware that her case had “fell through the
cracks” yet did nothing. 
 
If there is a case that is instructive, it is Rogalski v.
Nabers Cadillac (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, which was cited by Defendant.
There, the defendants promptly forwarded the summons and complaint to their
insurer for handling.  The defendants in Rogalski
only contacted their own attorney after the insurance company finally advised
them coverage was being denied.  The
defendants’ counsel promptly called plaintiff’s counsel to ask for an extension
only to be told the default papers had just been filed and plaintiff would not
stipulate to set aside the default.  The
appellate court found defendants reasonably believed their insurer was handling
the manner and would timely respond.  (Id.
at pp. 819-820.)  Likewise, Defendant
reasonably relied on State Farm to timely respond to Plaintiff’s complaint.[3]  (See also Fasuyi, supra, 167
Cal.App.4th at p. 694 [“Something went awry after transmittal of the complaint
to the insurance carrier, but precisely what is not known.  This was a classic instance of mistake and
inadvertence—but not on the part of [defendant], which did what all
corporations do when served with a complaint; send it to the carrier for
handling.  Thus… there are abundant
grounds for reversal under [section 473, subdivision (b)] because of mistake,
inadvertence and excusable neglect.”].)
 
To the extent that Plaintiff argues that he will be highly
prejudiced, its unclear how “further delays” will exacerbate “physical,
emotional, and financial” harm to Plaintiff. (Opp. p. 10.) To the extent that
Plaintiff argues financial stress as he will have “to pay for court fees and
other related expenses as the case drags on,” this case is not dragging on.
The case was recently filed and litigation in it of itself takes resources and
energy, hence why many choose not to pursue litigation. Plaintiff has chosen to
file a lawsuit and, as such, has consented to the conditions of litigation. If
there were a party to be prejudiced, it would be Defendant who would be
stripped of her opportunity to defend herself in an action. 
 
To the extent that Plaintiff argues Defendant’s proposed
answer does not set forth meritorious defenses, Defendant generally denies
plaintiff’s allegations as permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section
431.30(b)(1). (Reply p. 5, See Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th
1128, 1144.) Should more detail be needed, other motions are procedurally more
proper to address the matter.[4]

 
Ultimately, the law favors trial on the merits. (Reply p. 4,
citing Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1477-1478.)  Any doubts in applying
section 473 are to be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief and if that
party has moved promptly for relief only slight evidence will justify an order
granting the request.  (Id. at p.
1478.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as “[p]enalizing [Defendant] for
[Plaintiff’s] neglect would undermine the principles of fairness and justice”
(Opp. p. 11:20-21), the court grants the motion, and the default is set aside.[5]
