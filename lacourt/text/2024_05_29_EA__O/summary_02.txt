Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The judge notes that a party's counsel has an ethical obligation to inform Defense Counsel of a default judgment. The defendant claims that the failure to do so was due to a clerical error. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the failure was not due to a clerical error. The judge has not made a final decision on the matter and is seeking further information.
