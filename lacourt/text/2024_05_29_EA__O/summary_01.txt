The judge grants Defendant's motion to set aside default and permit the filing of a responsive pleading. The judge finds that Defendant's failure to file an answer was due to excusable neglect, as she mistakenly believed her insurance company would timely assign her case to counsel. The judge also finds that Plaintiff's delay in opposing the motion is not prejudicial. The judge concludes that the law favors trial on the merits, and that penalizing Defendant for Plaintiff's neglect would undermine the principles of fairness and justice.
