Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant, John Agyepong, to respond to written discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The defendant has failed to respond to these requests, and the plaintiff has filed motions to compel his responses. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide written, verified, and code-compliant responses to these requests within 10 days of notice. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's requests for sanctions, as the defendant has not opposed the motions to compel.
