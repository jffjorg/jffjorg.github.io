 Case Number:  22STCV33496    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2025    Dept:  29 Petition for
Approval of Compromise for Claimant with Disability Andrew Flores (Age 22).
Tentative 
 
The Court
excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem.
Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.  
 
The Court has
reviewed the First Amended Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise and
proposed orders filed on December 18, 2024. The Court finds several issues that
must be addressed before approval.
 
First, as
previously noted, Claimant
has signed item 21, but did not mark 2e. An adult with a disability who marks
item 21 and signs the petition must also mark both 2e and 2f.   
 
Next,
Petitioner contends she is conservator. However, while she is conservator of
Claimant’s person, she is not conservator of his estate. There is no proof
provided that she can settle this claim, nor receive the funds as elected in
18b(1). 
 
Last, the
declaration of Petitioner’s counsel fails to address the factors listed in
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b) as required.
 
These issues must
be addressed before the Court can approve the Petition.
 
Accordingly, the Court continued the hearing re Petition
for Approval of Compromise for Andrew Flores (Age 22) to __/__/2025 at 01:30 P.M. in Department 29 at Spring Street
Courthouse.
