 Case Number:  22STCV20016    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2025    Dept:  29 Expedited Petition
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Claimant Yaroslava Voronkov (Age 4).
Tentative 
 
The Court excuses
the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may
appear by telephone or video conference call.  
 
The Court has
reviewed the Expedited Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise and proposed
order filed on December 16, 2024. The Court finds several issues that must be
addressed before approval.
 
First, counsel
fails to include an attorney declaration with the petition regarding the
requested attorney’s fee. Further, counsel fails to include a copy of the
retainer agreement. This was noted as an issue in the Court’s December 2, 2024
Minute Order.
 
Second, no
Attachment 19b(2) is included with this packet.
 
Third, no
proposed order on MC-355 was included with this filing. Petitioner needs to
submit both MC-351 and MC-355 with the petitions.
 
Fourth, the
hearing date on proposed order filed on form MC-351 incorrectly lists both
November 20, 2024 and October 18, 2024 as the hearing date for this hearing.
 
These issues must
be addressed before the Court can approve the Petition.
 
Accordingly, the Court continued the hearing re Expedited
Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Yaroslava Voronkov (Age 4) to __/__/2025 at 01:30 P.M. in Department 29 at Spring Street
Courthouse.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
