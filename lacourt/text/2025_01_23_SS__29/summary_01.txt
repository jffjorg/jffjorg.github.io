And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petitions for approval of minor's compromise for Starr Olabaza (age 16) and David Meza (age 13) and has identified some issues that need to be addressed before approval. As a result, the judge is continuing the hearing to a future date (yet to be determined) at 1:30 PM in Department 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the new hearing date. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimants and their guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead.
