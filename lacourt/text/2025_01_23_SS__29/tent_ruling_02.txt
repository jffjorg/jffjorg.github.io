Background
On March 22, 2021, Emmanuel Vazquez
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Lyft, Inc., Doe Driver, and Does 1 to
100 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident on March 25, 2019.
On September 30, 2021, Lyft, Inc. filed an
answer to the complaint.
On June 20, 2022, Plaintiff named John
Agyepong (“Defendant”) as Doe Driver.
On April 21, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
On December 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed these
motions to compel Defendant’s responses to written discovery. No opposition has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant
with Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents,
Set One. (Rubio Decls., ¶ 3; Exhs. A.) No responses have been received. (Id.,
¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff need show nothing more.
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel Defendant
to respond to the discovery requests are granted.
 
The requests for sanctions are denied.  In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act
governing interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has
authorized sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses
“against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes”
the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, Defendant has not
opposed the motions, and so no sanctions are authorized.
