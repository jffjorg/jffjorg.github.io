21STCV24174
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, Evidence, and/or Monetary Sanctions 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted in part and denied in
part.
Background
On June 29, 2021, Daniel Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint Andrew Gutierrez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor
vehicle negligence arising out of an accident on July 1, 2019.
 
On October 9, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On September 11, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s
motions and ordered Plaintiff to provide further responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 4.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 10.2,
11.1, 11.2, and 20.2 and to Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 1-5, 7, 9-11,
and 15-16.  
 
Plaintiff requested, and Defendant agreed, additional
time (beyond the Court-ordered deadline) to provide the required responses.  (Hakopian Decl., ¶¶ 20, 22, 24 & Exhs. K-M.)  As it relates to the discovery responses
ordered by the Court, Plaintiff served further responses to Form Interrogatory No.
6.4 on November 13, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 25
& Exh. O.)  Plaintiff has not
provided further responses to any of the other requests ordered by the
Court.  (Id., ¶ 31.)
 
On December 23, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never justified” for a court to impose a terminating
sanction “solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction.”  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p.
615.)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for
Plaintiff’s violation of the Court’s Order of September 11, 2024, and for
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery
Act to provide code-compliant responses to the interrogatories and requests for
production at issue. 
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Defendant requests, in the alternative, issue
sanctions (among other forms of relief), but the issue sanctions identified in
the notice of motion and motion are primarily in the nature of evidence sanctions.  To the extent that Defendant is independently
requesting issue sanctions, the request is denied.  
Defendant requests, in the alternative, eleven
specific evidence sanctions.  The Court
has considered each of the requests, along with the evidence presented
regarding the discovery responses that Plaintiff did and did not provide to
Defendant, and grants in part the request for evidence sanctions.  The Court finds that Plaintiff has engaged in
a serious misuse of the discovery process by failing to provide code-complaint
responses to Defendant’s discovery requests and by violating the Court’s
discovery order, and that this misuse of the discovery process has caused
substantial prejudice to Defendant.
The Court orders that, as a sanction under
the Civil Discovery Act, Plaintiff is barred from introducing the following
evidence at trial:
(1) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding expected or anticipated future medical treatment
(including the nature of the treatment and the cost thereof);


(2) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding property damage, vehicle damage, or loss of use of a
vehicle or other property;


(3) 
Any exhibits or documentary evidence
depicting the scene of the accident;


(4) 
Any transcribed or written statement
given by any third-party witness regarding the accident;


(5) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding whether Plaintiff was or was not using a cellphone during
the accident.
The requests for additional or other evidence
sanctions are denied on this record.  In
addition, the Court notes that some of the requested evidence sanctions would
operate as essentially a terminating sanction, which, as noted above, is not an
appropriate sanction at this time.
Finally, Defendant also requests monetary sanctions.  That request is granted in part.  Plaintiff has engaged in misuses of the discovery
process that has caused Defendant to incur expenses, including the attorney’s
fees associated with bringing this motion. 
The Court sets sanctions in the amount of $ $700.68, calculated based on
four hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of
$160.17 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. 
(See Hakopian Decl., ¶ 33.)  
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendant’s
motion for sanctions.
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request
for an evidence sanction.
The Court ORDERS, as an evidence sanction
under the Civil Discovery Act, that Plaintiff is BARRED from introducing the
following evidence at trial:
(1) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding expected or anticipated future medical treatment
(including the nature of the treatment and the cost thereof);


(2) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding property damage, vehicle damage, or loss of use of a
vehicle or other property;


(3) 
Any exhibits or documentary evidence
depicting the scene of the accident;


(4) 
Any transcribed or written statement
given by any third-party witness regarding the accident;


(5) 
Any testimony, exhibits, or other evidence
of any kind regarding whether Plaintiff was or was not using a cellphone during
the accident.
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s requests for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions,
and other evidence sanctions.
The Court
GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Daniel Gomez and Plaintiff’s counsel of record Patrick
