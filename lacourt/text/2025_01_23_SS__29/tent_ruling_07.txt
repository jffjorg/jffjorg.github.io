 Case Number:  23STCV12059    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2025    Dept:  29 Rivera v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority
23STCV12059
Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff to Have Admitted the Truth of Matters
Specified in Requests for Admission
Tentative
The motion is denied as untimely.
Background
On May 30, 2023, Elio Vallecillo Rivera (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Metro”) and Does 1 through 20 asserting a cause of action for
“negligence and statutory liability” arising out of an incident on September
19, 2022, in which Plaintiff alleges that he was injured while riding on or
exiting a bus.
 
On July 21, 2023, Metro filed an answer to the complaint.
 
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name City of Los Angeles (“City”) as Doe 1.
 
Plaintiff failed to submit a timely claim to Metro under
the Government Claims Act.  On November 17, 2023, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s petition for permission to file a late tort claim.
 
On January 4, 2024, City filed an answer to the complaint
and also filed a cross-complaint against Metro and Does 1 through 10.
 
On February 2, 2024, Metro filed an answer to City’s
cross-complaint.
 
On June 4, 2024, the Court granted Metro’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings in relation to the complaint.  On August 7,
2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of Metro and against Plaintiff on the
complaint.
 
On November 18, 2024, City filed a request to dismiss its
cross-complaint against Metro.
 
On December 17, 2024, City filed this motion for a deemed-admitted
order.
 
No opposition was filed.
 
On filing, the case was assigned a trial date of November
26, 2024.  On November 12, 2024, the
Court continued the trial date to December 19, 2024, but did not extend any
discovery deadlines.  On December 5,
2024, the Court continued the trial date to February 19, 2025, but did not
extend any discovery deadlines.
 
Trial remains scheduled for February 19, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).) 
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
The Court must deny City’s motion for
an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified
in Requests for Admission.  Motions
relating to discovery must be heard at least 15 days before the date initially
set for trial.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) The initial trial date was November
26, 2024, and the two court orders continuing the trial date did not extend or
reset any discovery deadlines. 
Therefore, the motion is untimely. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES City’s motion for an
order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in
Requests for Admission on the ground that it is untimely. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
