Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yaroslava Voronkov, a 4-year-old minor, regarding the approval of a compromise claim. The Judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by phone or video conference. The Judge notes several issues that must be addressed before approval, including the lack of an attorney declaration, retainer agreement, and Attachment 19b(2). Additionally, the proposed order on form MC-351 incorrectly lists the hearing date. The Judge continues the hearing to a later date and orders the moving party to give notice.
