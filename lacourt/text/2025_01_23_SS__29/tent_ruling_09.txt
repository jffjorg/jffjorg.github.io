 Case Number:  23STCV22331    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2025    Dept:  29 Tenorio v.
Mercado
23STCV22331
Defendants’ Motion for Issue, Evidence, and/or Monetary Sanctions 
Tentative
The motion is granted in part and denied without
prejudice in part.
Background
On September 15, 2023, Marcela Tenorio (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Cristian Mercado and Does 1 through 10 for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an accident on
September 21, 2021.
 
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Cristian Mercado, Tree Service Kings, Inc.
(collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 10.
 
On February 9, 2024, Defendants filed an answer to the
FAC.
 
At a hearing on October 11, 2024, the
Court granted Defendants’ discovery motions and ordered Plaintiff to provide
verified, code-complaint responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Defendants’ Requests for Production (Set One)
within 15 days of notice.  Defendants gave
notice, by electronic service, on October 14. 

 
It now appears that Plaintiff had electronically
served responses to the discovery on October 8, 2024, prior to the
hearing.  (Morrow Decl., ¶ 10 & Exhs.
G-H.)  These responses were not verified
and, Defendants state, were not code compliant. 
(Id., ¶ 10.)  Defendants sent meet-and-confer
correspondence but received no response. 
(Id., ¶¶ 11-12 & Exh, I.)
 
On December 18, 2024, Defendants
filed this motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order
compelling answers to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order
compelling responses to requests for production, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act,
section 2023.030 provides for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating
sanctions for any “misuse of the discovery process,” “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of the discovery process”
is defined to include (among other things) failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to a
discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery; and making or
opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial justification.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an
escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and
commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used
sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486,
496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating sanction should
generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives
and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser
sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at
p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful, preceded
by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified
in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice
the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los Defensores, Inc.
v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v. Hachman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is
to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is
not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never justified” for a court to impose
a terminating sanction “solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction.”  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.)
Discussion
Defendants
seek issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for Plaintiff’s
violation of the Court’s Order of October 11, 2024, and for Plaintiff’s failure
to comply with her obligations under the Civil Discovery Act to provide
code-compliant responses to the interrogatories and requests for production at
issue.
 
Certain
aspects of this case, however, make the request for sanctions unusual.
 
The
Court’s order of October 11, 2024, was based on the factual information before
the Court – including that (at least as of the date the motion was filed)
Plaintiff had entirely failed to respond to the discovery requests.  But that was not true.  Plaintiff served discovery responses shortly
before the hearing.  The responses were incomplete
and unverified, and so of only limited value, but this case does not involve a
situation in which a party has completely ignored its obligations under the
Civil Discovery Act or refused to participate altogether in the discovery
process.
 
Indeed,
the interrogatory responses are detailed, and Plaintiff did produce responsive
documents.  Accordingly, this case does
not involve a situation in which the propounding party cannot even begin to
prepare for trial because of the adverse party’s failure to respond to
discovery.
 
This is
not to minimize Plaintiff’s misconduct. 
She has engaged in a misuse of the discovery process – and it is all the
more concerning given how easy it should be to address the fundamental problem
of the missing verifications.  Given the
detail of the responses and the production of documents, it appears that
Plaintiff must be communicating with her counsel; if that is the case, it is
indeed puzzling as to why counsel has not obtained and served the required
verifications.
 
Moreover,
although Defendants do not seek terminating sanctions (understandably), the nonmonetary
sanctions that they seek are tantamount to a terminating sanction.  Defendants state that they seek an issue or
evidence sanction, but the sanction is to preclude Plaintiff from presenting
any evidence in support of essential elements of the causes of action in her
complaint.  (Motion, at pp. 6-7.)  Where, as here, Plaintiff has the burden of
proof, such a sanction would effectively be a terminating sanction in everything
but name only.
 
Under
these unusual circumstances, the Court exercises its discretion to deny Defendants’
request for nonmonetary sanctions (issue or evidence sanctions) at this time,
and in this posture.  The denial is
without prejudice and may be renewed if Plaintiff persists in her misuse of the
discovery process, including (but not limited to) her failure to comply with
the Court’s order and provide verified, code-compliant discovery responses without
objection.
 
The
Court grants in part Defendants’ request for monetary sanction.  Plaintiff has misused the discovery process
by failing to comply with her obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and by
violating a court order relating to discovery. 
Plaintiff’s misconduct has caused Defendants to incur legal expenses,
including attorney’s fees.  The Court
sets sanctions in the amount of $1,500, calculated based on six hours of
attorney time in multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $250 per
hour.  (Morrow Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’ motion
for sanctions.
The Court DENIES Defendants’ request for issue or evidence
sanctions.
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Marcela Tenorio to pay monetary
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,500.00 to
Defendants (through counsel) within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
