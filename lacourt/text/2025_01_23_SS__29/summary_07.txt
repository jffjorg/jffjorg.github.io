  - "It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission]."
  - "The court must deny City's motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission. Motions relating to discovery must be heard at least 15 days before the date initially set for trial."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied City's motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission. The motion is untimely because it was filed after the initial trial date of November 26, 2024, and the two court orders continuing the trial date did not extend or reset any discovery deadlines. The judge notes that Plaintiff failed to respond to the Requests for Admission in a timely manner, and therefore, the court must deny the motion. The judge also notes that the City failed to file opposition to the motion, which is a procedural error.
