And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery. The Plaintiff had requested to reopen discovery to gather additional information on her medical treatment, including depositions of her treating physicians and exchange of relevant documents. The Plaintiff argued that she is still undergoing medical treatment and that discovery must be reopened so that the parties can assess her claimed damages to the full extent. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff had ample time to conduct discovery and that there was no good cause to reopen discovery. The judge found that the balancing of the factors under CCP § 2024.050, subdivision (b) weighed against reopening discovery. The judge noted that the Plaintiff had not provided evidence that she had obtained clearance with her treating physician to undergo surgery since his deposition, and that the Plaintiff had not properly supported that the surgery was necessary or essential to her damages. The judge also noted that the parties had had ample time to conduct discovery and that there was no necessity for additional discovery in this case.
