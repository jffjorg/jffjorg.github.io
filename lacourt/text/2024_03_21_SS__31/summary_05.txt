The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Edgar Esturban vs. Irlanda Sanchez, ET AL. (Case No. 22STCV08568). The Judge has determined that the motion for summary judgment filed by ZLS Trans Inc. (ZLS) is moot, as the Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on March 8, 2024, which supersedes all prior complaints, including the original complaint and the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The SAC pleads additional factual allegations against both Uber and ZLS, and the Judge has ruled that an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is unnecessary and will not be heard. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
