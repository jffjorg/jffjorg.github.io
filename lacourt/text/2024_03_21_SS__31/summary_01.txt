And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Mia Rojas' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Ryan Williamson and request monetary sanctions. The Court finds that the motion is moot since Williamson's deposition has already been completed. However, the Court does find that sanctions are warranted due to the delays and failure to provide dates after meet and confer efforts. The Court orders Williamson and his counsel to pay sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500 within 20 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
