And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash deposition subpoenas served on Kaiser Permanente Central ROI Unit (Kaiser) by defendant Access Services. The subpoenas seek insurance and medical records of plaintiff Aline Preciado, who claims to have suffered injuries and loss of consortium as a result of a motor vehicle accident.

The Court granted the motions to quash in part, modifying the subpoenas to limit the timeframe of the records sought from July 28, 2018 to the present date. The Court found that the original subpoenas were overbroad and invasive, and that the Plaintiffs had raised an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in their insurance and medical records.

The Court also noted that the parties should have attempted to resolve the issue informally before filing the motions, and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach a stipulation regarding the scope of the subpoenas. The Court will consider the parties' submissions and appearances at the hearing scheduled for March 21, 2024.
