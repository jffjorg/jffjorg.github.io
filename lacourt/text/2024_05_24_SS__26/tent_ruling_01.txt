ANALYSIS:
 
On April 19, 2023, an arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award
in favor of Maria Avila (“Petitioner”) and against American Complete Home
Services, Inc. dba American Air Conditioning & Heating (“Respondent”). On
January 19, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award (the “Petition”). Petitioner filed proof of service of the Petition on
May 1, 2024. No response to the Petition has been filed to date. 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be served
on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service
of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within
this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of
summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of
service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing, which therefore must be served
in the manner of service for a summons. (Pet., Attachment 4(b).) The Petition
and Notice of Hearing were personally served on Respondent on April 29, 2024. (Proof of Service by Mail, filed 05/01/24, ¶¶2-3.)
Therefore, the Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1290.4 are satisfied. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitration, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) As the
Award was served with the Petition on April 29, 2024, the requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 are met. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).)
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The
Petition was timely served less than a year after the Award was issued. 
 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (CCP § 1287.6; Jones v.
Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition includes a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate. (Pet., Attachment 4(b) at p. 9.) The parties
entered into a written contract on December 1, 2021, containing an arbitration
provision. (Ibid.) The Petition sets forth the name of the Arbitrator
(Hon. Susan Nauss Exon) and attaches a copy of the written award. (Id.
at Attachment 8(c).) Petitioner demonstrates that on April 19, 2023, the
arbitrator issued an award requiring Respondent to pay Petitioner $15,000.00 in
damages in full consideration for all claims. (Id. at Attachment 8(c),
p. 2.) The parties were to bear the administrative fees and expenses relating
to arbitration as incurred. (Ibid.) The Court finds that the substantive
portion of the Petition has been satisfied. 
 
Interest and Costs
 
Petitioner seeks interest at ten percent per annum from
April 19, 2023, which the Court awards. (Pet., ¶10(d).) “[A]
successful party to arbitration is entitled to post-award, pre-judgment
interest under Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a). (Pierotti v. Torian
(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 27.) The rate awarded is that stipulated by the
contract or, if not stipulated, ten percent. (Civ. Code, § 3289.) Petitioner
also seeks costs of $875.00 based on the arbitrator’s fee. (Pet., ¶10(e) and
Attachment 10(e). These costs are denied based on the express ruling of the
arbitrator that the parties were to bear the compensation and expenses of the
arbitrator as incurred. (Id. at Attachment 8(c), p. 2.) 

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is
GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS TO BE ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER MARIA AVILA IN THE
AMOUNT OF $15,000.00 PRINCIPAL PLUS INTEREST AT TEN PERCENT PER ANNUM
FROM APRIL 19, 2023. PETITIONER IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN
20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
