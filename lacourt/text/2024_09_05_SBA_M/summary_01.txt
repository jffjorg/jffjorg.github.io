Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part, denied in part, and found moot in part the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by plaintiff Addie Richburg against defendant American Airlines, Inc. The motions were filed in response to defendant's allegedly non-responsive and incomplete responses to plaintiff's discovery requests.

The court finds that many of the discovery requests were overly broad and the objections asserted by defendant were meritorious and did not need to be supplemented. The court grants the motion to compel further responses to certain discovery requests, citing incomplete and non-responsive responses.

The court denies the request for sanctions, finding that the discovery requests were overly broad and the objections asserted by defendant were meritorious. The court also notes that defendant's further responses were served after plaintiff incurred the time and expense to file the motion to compel, but finds that this does not justify an award of sanctions.

The court orders plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
