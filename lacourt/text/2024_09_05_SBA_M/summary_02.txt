And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and request to stay action. The defendant had moved to compel arbitration and stay the court action, arguing that the arbitration agreement between GameCloud Studios, Inc. and MWE Live LLC was valid and should be enforced. However, the court found that the arbitration agreement was only between the two parties mentioned, and that non-parties to the agreement were also parties to the instant action. The court further found that there was a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law between the parties to the arbitration agreement and these third parties.

The court also rejected the defendant's argument that the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable, finding that the required level of oppression and surprise was lacking. The court noted that the plaintiff had signed the arbitration agreement and that the defendant had submitted evidence that the plaintiff had reviewed the agreement and made suggestions for additions.

The court ultimately denied the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and request to stay action, finding that the proper course was to deny the request for arbitration and order the matter to proceed as a court action against all parties. The court ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
