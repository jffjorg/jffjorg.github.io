And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Defendant Maricela Espinoza's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one, and requests for production of documents, set one. Plaintiff Hovek Arzooian is ordered to provide responses without objection to these requests within 20 days of this order. The Court has denied Defendant's request for sanctions, as the notice of motion did not identify the party against whom sanctions were sought, and the motions were not opposed. The Court has also denied Defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, as this section does not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions.
