 Case Number:  22STCV29877    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  30 BORIS YURIEVICH GETMANSKIY vs MICHAEL STEVEN MATHIASTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production, and to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted, Sets Two, are DENIED as MOOT.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part. Defendant Michael Steven Mathias is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $910, within 20 days of this order.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardCompel InterrogatoriesIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905–906.)Deem RFAs Admitted“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: (b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted…. The Court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on itsdetermination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.Compel RPDsWhere there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.SanctionsSanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem matters specified in a request for admissions as true. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)Under CCP section 2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.)DiscussionOn April 21, 2023, Plaintiff propounded his Special Interrogatories, Set Two, Form Interrogatories, Set Two, Request for Production, Set Two, and Request for Admissions, Set Two, on Defendant. (Ksajikian Decl. ¶ 11; Exh. 1.) The deadline for Defendant to provide verified responses to said discovery was on or before May 24, 2023. (Id., ¶ 12.) No extensions of time were requested or granted, and no responses were received. (Id.)In opposition, Defendant argues it served verified amended responses on November 7, 2023, the same day the motion was filed. Defendant submits that because the Verified Responses were provided to Plaintiff the same day, issuing sanctions would be unfair to Defendant.As Defendant has responded to the discovery at issue, the motions to compel responses are moot.As for sanctions, sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed, under Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c). The oppositions were not unsuccessful. As such, the request for sanctions in connection with the motions to compel is denied.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)However, sanctions are mandatory in connection with the motion to deem the truth of the matter in the requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Thus, the request for sanctions in connection with this motion is granted. However, the amount awarded is reduced due to the simplicity of this motion. As such, the Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $910 ($850 per hour for one hour, plus $60 filing fee), to be paid within 20 days of this order.
