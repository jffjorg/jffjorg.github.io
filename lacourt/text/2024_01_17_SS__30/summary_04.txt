Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery, as the defendant has since submitted responses. The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering the defendant to pay $910 within 20 days of the order. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions for the misuse of discovery. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of the matters in the requests for admissions admitted, and has ordered the defendant to pay $910 in sanctions, which is reduced from the original amount due to the simplicity of the motion.
