```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena is denied as moot because the subpoena was modified as requested. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied because the defendant appears to have resolved the issue and opposed the motion with substantial justification.

The defendant's motion to strike the complaint is also denied because the defendant met and conferred with the plaintiff as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5.

The judge notes that the defendant's factual allegations do not rise to the level of "malice" as defined in Civil Code section 3294. To state a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud.

The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to show that the defendant acted with malice. The complaint alleges that the defendant was involved in street racing, was reckless and negligent, and collided with other cars and struck the plaintiff and a bystander. The judge finds that these allegations are despicable and that the defendant's conduct was outrageous and reprehensible.

The judge orders the defendant to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days and grants each moving party leave to give notice.
