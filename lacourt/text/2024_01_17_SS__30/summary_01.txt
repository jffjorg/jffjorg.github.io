And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to provide responses to discovery requests. The defendant served the requests on July 3, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond despite multiple extensions. As a result, the court has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days. The defendant is also ordered to give notice of the court's order. The court found that the defendant is entitled to a court order directing the plaintiff to provide responses because the defendant properly served the discovery requests and the plaintiff failed to respond.
