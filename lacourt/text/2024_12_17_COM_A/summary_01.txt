And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Nails' motion to compel Plaintiff Norma Wilson's deposition, but denies the request for monetary sanctions. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on or before December 20, 2024 to decide on a mutually agreeable date on or before January 31, 2025 on which Plaintiff's deposition shall proceed. The judge finds that Plaintiff's counsel acted with substantial justification in failing to appear for the November 6 deposition due to severe complications from surgery. The judge also notes that there was no pressing need for expedition and that a reasonable delay was warranted to accommodate Plaintiff's counsel's recovery from surgery.
