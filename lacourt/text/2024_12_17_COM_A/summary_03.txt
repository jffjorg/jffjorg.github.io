And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The petition, filed by Asset Security Consulting, LLC, seeks to transfer some portion of Kaiwann King's settlement rights to the company. However, the petition is partially censored, obscuring important information, and the court cannot make a determination of whether the transfer is in Kaiwann King's best interest without this information. Additionally, the court notes that a first amended verified petition for approval was filed after the original notice of motion, rendering the motion moot. Finally, there is no proof of service of the notice on the real party in interest, Kaiwann King. As a result, the court denies the petition without prejudice and orders the petitioner to give notice.
