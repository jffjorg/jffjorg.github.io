  None set
 



 
1.    
Background
The court cannot identify what events underlie
plaintiff DeAnn Loughridge’s (“Plaintiff") complaint. Plaintiff states in
the complaint that she is alleging causes of action for obstruction of justice
and civil rights against defendant State of California (“Defendant”).
2.    
Demurrer
Defendant filed a demurrer on July 3, 2024, demurring
to the entire complaint. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to comply with
the claim filing requirement of the Government Claims Act, that Plaintiff fails
to plead a statutory cause of action, that Defendant is not a person subject to
suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and that the complaint’s allegations are
uncertain.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that she has complied
with all necessary procedural requirements and has provided in her complaint
detailed accounts of her false arrest, excessive force, and subsequent injuries
derived therefrom. Plaintiff also argues that the state can be held liable for
the actions of its employees when those actions are part of official policy or
custom and that the complaint clearly outlined Plaintiff’s allegations in a
logical and comprehensible manner.   
3.    
Demurrer
Standards
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747
(Hahn).)¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.¿Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿(SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.)¿A plaintiff must set forth “the essential facts of his case with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant
with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Youngman v.
Nevada Irr. Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)
The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be
deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those
expressly alleged.¿(Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields v. County of San Diego
(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n demurrer, pleadings are read
liberally and allegations contained therein are assumed to be true.”]) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
Leave to amend a complaint following a sustained
demurrer must be granted if there is a reasonable probability that the defects
in the complaint may be resolved by amendment. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
49, 69.) 
4.    
Discussion

The court cannot identify the facts underlying the
complaint, nor can the court identify the causes of action
being brought except that they are stated in the cover sheet of the complaint.
Plaintiff has therefore failed to set forth the essential facts of her case
with sufficient particularity to put Defendant on notice of the nature, source,
and extent of her cause of action.  Plaintiff
failed to allege compliance with the claim filing requirements of the
Government Claims Act (Gov. Code §810, et seq.) 
The complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §430.10 by failing to comply with
the Government Claims Act, by failing to plead a statutory cause of action (Gov.
Code § 815), and because defendant is not a person subject to suit under 42
U.S.C. § 1983.  In addition, the complaint
is uncertain pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(f).
5.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with leave to amend.

Defendant is ordered to give notice.
