And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the defendant's demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff, DeAnn Loughridge, Dr., filed a complaint alleging causes of action for obstruction of justice and civil rights against the State of California. The defendant filed a demurrer arguing that the complaint fails to comply with the claim filing requirements of the Government Claims Act, does not state a statutory cause of action, and that the defendant is not a person subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The judge found that the complaint does not set forth the essential facts of the case with sufficient particularity, fails to plead a statutory cause of action, and is uncertain. The judge granted the defendant's demurrer and gave notice to the plaintiff to amend the complaint.
