SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 3/6/21 between a vehicle driven by Decedent Eileen Morales
(Decedent) and a vehicle driven by Defendant Joshua John Dumas (Dumas).  Decedent died as a result of injuries
sustained in the collision.  On 3/8/22,
criminal charges for vehicular manslaughter were filed in Los Angeles County
against Dumas in case number ATPMA082728-01.    
 
On 2/16/23, Decedent’s spouse, Alfredo Morales, and
children, Leslie Theresa Burrows and Mike Allen Bushaw (collectively,
Plaintiffs), filed this action for: (1) wrongful death – negligence against
Dumas, (2) wrongful death – negligence against Reman Giroin dba R&H Auto,
(3) loss of consortium against all defendants and (4) survival claims against
all defendants.  On 7/31/23, Plaintiffs
filed a request for dismissal of the complaint as to Reman Giroin dba R&H
Auto. 
 
After the parties stipulated to have his default set
aside, Dumas answered the complaint on 8/7/23. 
(See 8/4/23 Stipulation & Order; Dumas Answer filed
8/7/23).  On 8/14/23, Dumas filed and
served a motion seeking an order staying discovery as to Dumas pending
resolution of criminal proceedings against Dumas in Los Angeles Superior
Court  (ATPMA082728-01).  Plaintiffs opposed the motion.  On 12/5/23, the Court granted Dumas’ motion
to stay discovery directed to him.    
 
Dumas cannot be located, his arrest warrant in the
criminal case is still outstanding and there has been no change to the status
of the criminal proceeding.  (See Aziev Decl.; Brooks Decl.).  On 11/12/24, Plaintiffs filed an ex parte
application for an order lifting the stay on discovery as to  Dumas. 
On 11/12/24, Dumas filed an opposition to the ex parte application.  On 11/13/24, the Court set the matter for a
motion hearing on 11/22/24 and ordered a reply to be served and filed by
11/15/24.  On 11/15/24, Plaintiffs filed
and served a reply to the opposition.  
ANALYSIS
   
When deciding whether to stay civil proceedings pending
the outcome of a parallel criminal case, courts must consider the interests of and
potential prejudice to the plaintiffs in the civil litigation as well as the
defendant’s right against self-incrimination. 
See Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases (2019) 39 CA5th
1121, 1132; Avant! Corp. (2000) 79 CA4th 876, 882; Fuller (2001)
87 CA4th 299, 306.  
 
In previously granting Dumas’ motion to stay discovery, the
Court presumed that the criminal proceedings against Dumas would be timely
resolved.  Instead, the evidence before
the Court indicates that Dumas, although aware of this action, has chosen to
evade arrest for the criminal charges against him while simultaneously taking
advantage of the stay of discovery in this case.  (See Aziev Decl.; Brooks Decl.).
 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have presented evidence which
establishes that Plaintiff Alfredo Morales’ rights may be severely prejudiced
if the stay is permitted to indefinitely continue.  Mr. Morales is 91 years-old, in hospice, is bed-ridden,
and is showing significant physical and cognitive decline.  (See Aziev Decl., Ex.13).  As such, further delaying discovery and
possibly the trial of this matter could result in Mr. Morales not surviving to see
his day in court.      
 
The opposition admits that Dumas is “a fugitive from
justice,” “has not appeared in his criminal case,” has been “evading
prosecution since March 2022, and remains un-located as of” 11/12/24.  (See Opposition, p.2:17, p.4:17-19;
Brooks Decl. ¶19).  As such, any
prejudice Dumas might suffer as a result of the stay on discovery against him
being lifted is his own making.  In
arguing against lifting the stay, the opposition repeatedly states that
“Defendants,” plural, have been making considerable efforts to locate
Dumas.  (See Opposition, p.2:19-21,
p.3:1-3,p.4:14-16).  However, Dumas is
the only remaining defendant in this case. 
Therefore, he could resolve the efforts to locate himself by turning
himself in and answering the pending criminal charges against him.  Instead, by his own admission through the
opposition filed on his behalf, he is “a fugitive from justice” and “continues
to evade prosecution.”  The opposition
argument that Dumas “may not be intentionally avoiding the court but rather
unresponsive due to unknown circumstances” is pure unsupported, speculation.  (See Opposition, p.7:3-4).  The court records shows that Dumas is aware
of this action as evidenced by his answering the complaint,  responding to discovery (wherein he invoked
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at times), and moving to
stay discovery.  (See Aziev Decl.,
Ex.1-7).  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the
interests of Plaintiffs and justice weigh in favor of lifting the stay on
discovery against Dumas which was previously granted on 12/5/23.  See Polanski (2009) 180 CA4th
507, 533.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
