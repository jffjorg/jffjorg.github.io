Case #PC056453
 
MOTION FOR
ORDER COMPELLING SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENT
 
Motion filed on 9/5/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Alex Woltman 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Valencia
Gateway Retail IV, LLC
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling Plaintiff Valencia
Gateway Retail IV, LLC to provide a Satisfaction of Judgment in this action.
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued.  
 
This action arose out of a breach of a lease agreement.  Defendant AMA Corp. (AMA) leased property
from the Plaintiff Valencia Gateway Retail IV, LLC (Plaintiff) pursuant to a
written contract.  AMA defaulted on the
lease and failed to pay rent.  Defendant
Alex Woltman (Woltman) is one of three individuals who provided a personal
guarantee of the lease.  The guarantors
were not parties to the lease agreement.  The guarantors’ guarantee was in a separate
written agreement entitled Lease Guaranty (the Guaranty).  (See Woltman (unsigned) Decl.,
Ex.7).    Plaintiff sued to recover the unpaid rent.  The Court entered judgment on 12/22/17
following a bench trial.  (Id, Ex.1).  
 
The total judgment against AMA was $247,637.76.  Each of the guarantors, including Woltman, was
ordered to pay $31,933.94.  On 3/26/18, the
Court ordered that Plaintiff and cross-defendant was determined to be the
prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney's fees and reasonable
attorney's fees were determined to be in the sum of $30‚365.00.  (Hurey Decl., Ex.2).  
 
On or about, 4/24/24, Woltman delivered a cashier’s check
to Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $38,628.86 for his portion of the
Judgment.  (Hurey Decl., Ex.3, 4).  On 6/4/24, Plaintiff’s counsel returned the
check.  (Id., Ex.5).  On 9/3/24, Woltman’s counsel re-sent the
check to Plaintiff’s counsel and demanded that Plaintiff file an acknowledgment
of satisfaction of judgment.  (Id.,
Ex.6).      
 
On 9/5/24, Woltman filed and served the instant motion.  The proof of service for the motion is
unclear.  The proof of service states
that the motion was served on Plaintiff’s counsel “by placing a true copy
thereof, enclosed in a sealed envelope, addressed as follows” and then lists
the mailing address for Plaintiff’s counsel and an email address.  (See Motion, p.8).  However, service by United States Mail is not
marked in the proof of service.  Id.  Rather, service Via Email is marked.  Id. 
There is no email address for Plaintiff’s counsel in eCourt and the
email address where the motion was sent, erniep@bewleylaw.com,
does not match the email address listed on the documents filed by Plaintiff’s
counsel, ernie.park@bewleylaw.com.
 
Additionally, the motion was originally scheduled for
hearing on 2/25/25.  The 9/6/24 Minute
Order (from Department F43) indicates that the hearing on this motion is
continued to 11/22/24 and Plaintiff was ordered to give notice.  (See 9/6/24 Minute Order, p.1).  It is not clear if the Court intended to
advance and continue the 2/25/25 hearing on the instant motion or to only continue
the Judgment Debtor Examinations which took place on 9/6/24.  
 
Plaintiff did not file a Notice of Ruling regarding the 9/6/24
ruling as ordered.  On 11/19/24,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration re judgment debtor examination of
Judgment Debtor Alexander Woltman which lists 11/22/24 as the hearing date for the
judgment debtor examination with no mention of the instant motion.  As such, it appears that Plaintiff believes
that only the Judgment Debtor Examination is proceeding on 11/22/24 and/or did
not receive the instant motion.  
 
Based on the declaration of Plaintiff’s attorney, it is
clear that Plaintiff opposes the relief requested in the Motion for
Satisfaction of Judgment.  Due to the
issues noted above, the hearing on the Motion for Satisfaction of Judgment will
be continued.  Woltman’s counsel is
ordered to serve the motion on Plaintiff’s counsel’s correct email address
which will be confirmed at the hearing.  The
continuance will allow Plaintiff to file and serve a complete opposition to the
motion and allow Woltman to file and serve a reply thereto.  The opposition is due to be filed and served
at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date and the reply is due to
be filed and served at least 5 court days before the continued hearing
date.
