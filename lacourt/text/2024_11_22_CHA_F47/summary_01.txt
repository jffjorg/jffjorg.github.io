And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to lift the stay on discovery against defendant Joshua John Dumas. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Alfredo Morales, Leslie Theresa Burrows, and Mike Allen Bushaw, who are seeking to lift the stay so that they can continue with discovery in the case. The stay was originally granted on December 5, 2023, pending the outcome of a parallel criminal case against Dumas.

The court has found that the interests of the plaintiffs and justice weigh in favor of lifting the stay. The plaintiffs have presented evidence showing that Alfredo Morales' rights may be severely prejudiced if the stay is permitted to indefinitely continue, as he is 91 years old, in hospice, and showing significant physical and cognitive decline.

Dumas is a fugitive from justice and has been evading prosecution since March 2022. The court has found that any prejudice Dumas might suffer as a result of the stay on discovery being lifted is his own making, as he could resolve the efforts to locate himself by turning himself in and answering the pending criminal charges against him.

The court has cited several cases in support of its decision, including Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases, Avant! Corp., Fuller, and Polanski.
