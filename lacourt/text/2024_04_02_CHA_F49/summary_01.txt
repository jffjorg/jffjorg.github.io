Summary in English text:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on April 2, 2024, in the case of Barbara Deeann Costanzo v. Emmanuel Gonzalez, Guillermo Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1-100, Case # 23CHCV02013. The defendants filed a Motion to Strike the punitive damages allegations in the Complaint, which alleges motor vehicle liability and general negligence. The Court granted the Motion with leave to amend, finding that the Complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations of gross negligence or despicable conduct to support a claim for punitive damages. The Court also found that the defendants failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff in good faith, which precluded them from being entitled to an automatic 30-day extension for filing their motion. The plaintiff is granted leave to amend the Complaint within 10 days of notice of this order.
