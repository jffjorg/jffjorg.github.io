 Case Number:  23SMCV05654    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to deem requests for admission to be
admitted.  The motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff brought this breach of contract
case against defendant.  Defendant served
requests for admission but received to response.  The court earlier granted defendant’s motion
to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production.  This motion was
to be heard on September 13, 2024, but was continued due to a family emergency
involving plaintiff.  There is no
opposition.  The motion is therefore
GRANTED unless responses were served prior to this hearing.  If they were, and if there were no
objections, then the motion is MOOT.  If
there were objections, the objections are STRICKEN as improper, and the
responses will stand.  Any responses that
do not contain an admission or denial will be deemed ADMITTED.  There is no request for sanctions.
