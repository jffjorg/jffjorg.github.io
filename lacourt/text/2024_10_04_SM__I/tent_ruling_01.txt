  Case Number:  21SMCV00085    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  I This issue has been here before.  Bonin obtained a judgment against defendants
Chayes and Lei.  They have appealed.  Chayes obtained a bond from an admitted
surety in the amount of 150% of the judgment. 
That is sufficient to stay the judgment. 
Further, because the court had issued a writ of execution prior to the
bond having been posted, the bond is sufficient to warrant recalling the
writ.  The problem is that Chayes is on
the bond, but Lei is not.  Thus, if the
judgment against Chayes is reversed but the judgment against Lei is affirmed,
plaintiff will be left with no bond. 
Because of that, the court stayed this hearing for a little while to
allow defendants to add Lei to the bond. 
Doing so would lead to an order staying the judgment entirely and
recalling the writ entirely.  If that was
not done, then the court will stay the judgment against Chayes and order the
writ recalled to the extent it allowed execution on any of Chayes’ property,
but not as to Lei. That may require recalling the writ and issuing a new one.
