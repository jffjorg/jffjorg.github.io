And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the defendant has filed a further declaration in opposition to the plaintiff's motion. The judge is unsure what remains at issue in the dispute and appreciates the parties' efforts to resolve their differences. To resolve the remaining issues, the judge is continuing the motion for 45 days, allowing the parties to file briefs and respond to each other. The plaintiff can file a supplemental brief seeking to compel the production of remaining documents, and the defendant can oppose and the plaintiff can reply. The judge hopes that the parties have essentially resolved their differences and are close to a resolution.
