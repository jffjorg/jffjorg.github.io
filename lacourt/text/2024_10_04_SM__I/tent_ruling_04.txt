 Case Number:  24SMCV00784    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  I On Wednesday, defendant filed a further declaration in
opposition to this motion.  Defendant
states that a number of documents will be produced, although it is not clear to
the court that they have been produced. 
Nor can the court tell precisely what remains at issue.  The court appreciates the parties’ attempts
to resolve their dispute and the court just cannot tell whether the dispute is
resolved or what remains.  Accordingly,
the court believes that the best way to do this is to CONTINUE the motion for
45 days (the lengthy time frame is due to the court’s travel plans).  Plaintiff can file a “supplemental” brief
(but it should be a standalone brief) that seeks to compel whatever is
left.  Defendant may oppose and plaintiff
may reply.  Timing for the papers will be
counted back from the hearing date as per code. 
The court is hopeful that the parties have essentially resolved their
differences at this point.
