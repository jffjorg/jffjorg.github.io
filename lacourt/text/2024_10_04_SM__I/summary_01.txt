```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court is considering a case where Bonin obtained a judgment against Chayes and Lei, who have appealed. Chayes posted a bond for 150% of the judgment amount, which is sufficient to stay the judgment and recall the writ of execution that was issued prior to the bond being posted. However, the bond only names Chayes as a party, not Lei. If the judgment against Chayes is reversed but the judgment against Lei is affirmed, Bonin will be left with no bond. Therefore, the court has stayed the hearing to allow the defendants to add Lei to the bond, which would result in an order staying the judgment and recalling the writ entirely. If this is not done, the court will stay the judgment against Chayes and order the writ recalled to the extent it allowed execution on Chayes' property, but not as to Lei.
