 Case Number:  23STCV16412    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION FOR PREFERENCEOn July 13, 2023,
Plaintiffs Norayr Arutunyan and Sedik Kirakosyan filed this action for personal
injury caused by asbestos exposure.  On January
8, 2024, Plaintiffs moved for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure
section 36, subdivisions (a) and (e). 
A party who is over
70 years old may petition the court for a preference, which the court shall
grant if it makes both of the following findings: (1) the party has a
substantial interest in the action as a whole; and (2) the health of the party
is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s
interest in the litigation.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 36, subd. (a).)  An affidavit
submitted in support of a motion for preference under this subdivision may be
signed by the attorney for the party seeking preference based upon information
and belief as to the medical diagnosis and prognosis of any party.  (Id., § 36.5.)  Moreover, the court in its discretion may
grant a motion for preference supported by a showing that satisfies the court
that the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference.  (Id., § 36, subd. (e).)  
“Upon the granting
of such a motion for preference, the court shall set the matter for trial not
more than 120 days from that date and there shall be no continuance beyond 120
days from the granting of the motion for preference except for physical disability
of a party or a party’s attorney, or upon a showing of good cause stated in the
record.”  (Id., § 36, subd.
(f).)  “Any continuance shall be for no
more than 15 days and no more than one continuance for physical disability may
be granted to any party.”  (Ibid.)

Arutunyan is 70 years old
and was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma.  (Sandoval Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3.)  Arutunyan suffers from constant physical pain,
shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, physical and mental fatigue,
weight fluctuations, and trouble sleeping.  (Id. at ¶ 9.)  Arutunyan’s difficulty effectively
communicating, remaining alert, and focusing results in exhaustion and stress.  (Ibid.)  His condition is in serious decline.  (Sandoval Decl., at ¶ 10.)
Defendants do not
directly oppose Plaintiffs’ motion for trial preference but request the court
to impose certain conditions, such as shortened notice periods for motions for
summary judgement.  (CVS Pharmacy’s
Conditional Non-Opposition at pp. 3-4.)  The
court cannot shorten the notice periods for motions for summary judgement.  (McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 112, 115-18; see also Urshan v. Musician’s Credit Union
(2004) 120 Cal. App.4th 758, 765-66 [discussing McMahon and reversing judgement
for failure to provide notice by the statutorily required minimum time period].)
 The parties may stipulate to waive the
statutorily mandated minimum notice period.  (Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage
Capital v. Danning, Gill, Diamond & Kollitz (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
1290, 1301.) 
The court finds that Arutunyan
has a substantial interest in the action as a whole.  The evidence shows that granting preference is
necessary to ensure Arutunyan’s participation in the litigation and trial while
his health permits and prevent prejudicing his interest in the action.
Plaintiffs’ motion for
trial setting preference is GRANTED.  The
parties are to meet and confer on a trial setting order.  The trial is scheduled for June 3, 2024 at 9
a.m.  The final status conference is
scheduled for May 20, 2024 at 9 a.m.  A
status conference regarding the trial setting order is set for February 20, 2024
at 9:00 a.m. 
The moving party is to
order to give notice.
