Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for trial preference, citing the need to ensure Norayr Arutunyan's participation in the litigation and trial while his health permits. Arutunyan, who is 70 years old and has malignant mesothelioma, suffers from multiple health issues that make it necessary to grant the preference. The judge has scheduled the trial for June 3, 2024, and set a series of status conferences to finalize the trial setting order. The Defendant, CVS Pharmacy, does not directly oppose the motion but requests certain conditions, which the court has denied. The judge cannot shorten the notice periods for motions for summary judgment, but the parties may stipulate to waive the statutorily mandated minimum notice period.
