And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Leed Plastics Corporation, contends that the plaintiffs, Roberto E. Sotomayor and Patricia Bilgin, lack evidence that Sotomayor was exposed to asbestos-containing products from the defendant. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents do not contain evidence that the defendant's products contained asbestos. The defendant has submitted evidence that it did not make plastic parts containing asbestos. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' request to continue the hearing and the trial date is denied. The motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant is ordered to file a proposed judgment within five days.
