And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to compel: Honeywell's motion to compel further responses to some of its requests for admissions (RFAs) and form interrogatory No. 17.1, and American Honda Motor Co.'s motions to compel further responses to its RFAs.

The judge grants Honeywell's motion as to RFAs Nos. 34-40, ordering the plaintiffs to serve verified responses within 30 days. As to form interrogatory No. 17.1, the judge grants it in part and denies it in part, finding that the non-duplicative portion of the interrogatory concerns RFA No. 40 and punitive damages.

The judge grants American Honda Motor Co.'s motions to compel, ordering the plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the RFAs within 30 days. The judge notes that the RFAs standing alone are proper, and that American Honda Motor Co. did not file a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatory No. 17.1.
