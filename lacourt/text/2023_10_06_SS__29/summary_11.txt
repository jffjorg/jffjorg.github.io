```

And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the Defendant's demurrer to the first and second causes of action in the complaint, granting the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to state a valid cause of action. The Judge finds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and lacks sufficient facts to support causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's reliance on a declaration of its counsel to support its argument that the causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations is improper, as the Court cannot consider extrinsic matters in ruling on the demurrer.
