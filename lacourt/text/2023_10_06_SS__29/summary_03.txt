English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendants Mundo Trucking, Inc. and Manuel Rodriguez Santos. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, which allows a party to seek a court order determining whether a settlement between the plaintiff and one or more alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. The Judge found that the Settling Defendants have met their initial burden of presenting evidence on the Tech-Bilt factors and that Defendant Fleming has not met his burden of proving a lack of good faith. The Judge considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, including a rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after trial. The Judge found that the settlement amount of $399,999.00 is not grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person would estimate the Settling Defendants' liability to be, and therefore granted the motion.
