Defendant
Maria Lynn Taylor’s motion to compel Plaintiff Sofia Djavadian to appear at
deposition is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
On January 13, 2020, Plaintiff Sofia
Djavadian (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Maria Lynn Taylor
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for (1) general
negligence, (2) motor vehicle negligence, and (3) negligent entrustment, arising
out of a vehicle accident that occurred on January 11, 2018. Defendant filed an
answer on March 16, 2022.
 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant filed a
motion to compel plaintiff to appear at deposition. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
Trial is scheduled for November 3, 2023.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party may
obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for
(among other things) what must be included in a deposition notice, when and
where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice must be served.  
“The service of a
deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410,
subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at least three
days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does
not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
“If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action …, without having served
a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or
to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Id.,
§ 2025.450, subd. (b).)  
When a motion to
compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Meet and Confer
The motion to compel deposition
is accompanied by the declaration of Stacey D. Leaton, which satisfies the meet and confer
requirements. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450(b).)
Discussion
 
On March 16, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with a notice of taking
Plaintiff’s deposition via remote video conference set for August 11, 2022.
(Leaton Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) A month later, Plaintiff served an objection to
the scheduled deposition date. (Id. at ¶ 5, Exh. B.) On November 9,
2022, Defendant re-noticed Plaintiff for deposition set on January 9, 2023 but
that date was also rescheduled at Plaintiff’s request. (Id. at ¶ 6, Exh.
C.) On January 9, 2023, Defendant again re-noticed Plaintiff for deposition
scheduled on January 27, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 7, Exh. D.) A day before the
deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel reached out to defense counsel indicating that
Plaintiff could not appear due to a custody issue. (Id. at ¶ 8, Exh. E.)
As a result of the late notice of Plaintiff’s nonappearance, Defendant was
unable to cancel the Armenian interpreter incurring a fee of $1,225.00 and the
court reporter fee of $395.00. (Id.)
 
On March 1, 2023, Defendant re-noticed Plaintiff for a deposition date on
March 22, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 9, Exh. H.) Once again, the day before the
scheduled deposition date Plaintiff’s counsel emailed defense counsel
indicating that they had forgotten to calendar the deposition and that is now
conflicted with another deposition in another case matter. (Id. at ¶ 10,
Exh. I.) Defendant took a certificate of non-appearance incurring a fee of
$472.40. (Id.) Then, on April 22, 2023, Defendant re-noticed Plaintiff
for a deposition date on June 13, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 11, Exh. K.) Plaintiff
failed to appear for the at the deposition because her counsel forgot to inform
her about the date. (Id. at ¶ 12.) That same day, Plaintiff’s counsel
emailed defense counsel with several deposition dates including July 14, 2023,
which ended up being the new deposition date. (Id. at ¶ 13, Exh. L)
Defendant again incurred $1,225.00 for the Armenian interpreter and $500.00 for
a certificate of non-appearance taken. (Id.)
 
On June 14, 2023,
Defendant re-noticed Plaintiff yet again, with the deposition set for July 14,
2023. (Id. at ¶ 14, Exh. O.) Plaintiff failed to appear for this
deposition date and Defendant incurred another $1,225.00 for the Armenian
interpreter and $500.00 for the certificate of non-appearance taken. (Id.
at ¶15.)
 
Under these circumstances, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion. Plaintiff
has repeatedly failed to appear, without serving an objection, to a properly
noticed deposition. 
 
Request for Monetary Sanctions 
 
The Court also GRANTS Defendant’s request for a monetary sanction under
the Civil Discovery Act. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2025.450(g)(1).) There is no
evidence in the record that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification or that
the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
 
The amount of
sanctions is determined by “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) Here, that amount is significant, as Defendant has incurred
interpreter fees and court reporter fees, in addition to attorney’s fee, as a result
of Plaintiff’s conduct.
 
In the notice
of motion and motion, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $5,527.40. (In the declaration of Defendant’s
counsel, a higher amount is requested, but the Court cannot award fees in
excess of what is reasonable and what is requested in the notice of motion and
motion.) After a careful review of the evidence, the Court awards sanctions in
the full requested amount of $5,527.40, calculated as follows: (1) interpreter
fees of $3,075; (2) court reporter fees of $1,867.40; (3) filing fee of $60;
and (4) attorney’s fees of at least $525, calculated as at least 2.333 hours
multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $225 per hour. (See Leaton Decl., ¶¶
8-16 & Exhs. F-Q.)
