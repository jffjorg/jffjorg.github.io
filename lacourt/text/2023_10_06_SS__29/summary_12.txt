And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that it grants the defendant's motion to strike the complaint's request for punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The court finds that the complaint does not adequately plead the required facts to support a claim for punitive damages, as it only alleges negligent conduct and does not show malice, fraud, or oppression. The court also finds that the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to support the request for attorneys' fees. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this tentative ruling and grants the defendant 30 days leave to amend the complaint.
