Legal Standard
 
              A party must respond
to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
              In addition to initial
requests for production and interrogatories, a party may propound a
supplemental interrogatory and supplemental demand for production of any later
acquired or discovered information or documents, tangible things, land or other
property, or electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or
control of the responding party. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.070, subd. (a);
2031.050, subd. (a).)  
 
              There is no time limit
for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of documents
other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No
meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
 
              Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  
 
Discussion
 
              On July 3, 2023,
Defendant served Plaintiff with a first set of Supplemental Interrogatories,
seeking updates of prior responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, and
Request for Production of Documents. (Blozan Decl., ¶ 2) The responses became
due on August 4, 2023. (Id.) Defendant sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email
regarding overdue responses on August 8, 2023, August 11, 2023, August 23,
2023, and September 1, 2023. (Defendant’s Motion, Exh. B.) To date, Plaintiff
has not provided any responses. Therefore, Defendant’s motion to compel
supplemental responses to form and special interrogatories and request for
production of documents is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified
responses without objections within 30 days of this order. 
 
              Sanctions
 
              As Defendant’s motion
to compel supplemental responses to form and special interrogatories and
request for production of documents is granted, Defendant’s request for
sanctions is also granted.  Thus, the
Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff, in favor of Defendant, in the total amount
of $925.00 for both motions, combined (2 hours for preparation of the two
motions, .5 hours for reviewing opposition and filing a reply, 1 hour for
preparation of hearing and attendance, for a total of 3.5 hours at $230.00 per
hour, plus $60 in filing fees in each motion x 2.) Sanctions are to be paid
within 30 days of this order.
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to compel supplemental
responses to form and special interrogatories and request for production of
documents is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified responses without objections within 30 days of this
order. The request for sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $925.00 within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
