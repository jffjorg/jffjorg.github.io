 Case Number:  21STCV24705    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
 The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant
and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.
 
The Court has reviewed the Petition to
 Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a (Minor Maya Karimiha, age 7). The Court finds that the
settlement is reasonable. However, the Court notes the following issues.
 
First, no order appointing Guardian ad Litem is filed with
this Court. 
 
Second, Petitioner does not provide any medical reports or
other support for the injuries listed in item 8(c).   
 
Third, item 10 is blank. Although attachment 10(b) states that
Petitioner and Claimant reached a global settlement for $1,050,000 with
Defendants Emil Kohan, M.D. and Rodeo Surgical Institute, item 10 must be
filled out accordingly. 
 
Fourth, item 11(b) is checked off, but item 11(b)(1) is left
blank. 
 
Fifth, the amount in item 11(b)(5) is left blank. If
Petitioner requests the settlement proceeds should be divided equally between
Petitioner and Claimant, item 11(b)(5) should indicate the amount Petitioner
will receive. 
 
Sixth, item 13(b) lists litigation costs as $27,093.39.
Petitioner lists the costs in Attachment 13(b). However, a calculation of the
costs in Attachment 13(b) results in $27,063.39, not the $27,093.39 the
Petitioner lists throughout the Petition.
 
Seventh, the amount in item 15 is incorrect, considering the
miscalculation in item 13(b). 
 
Eighth, the calculations in item 16 are incorrect,
considering the miscalculation of costs, as stated above. 
 
Finally, the proposed order and order to deposit funds in a
blocked account list the incorrect calculations, as stated above. 
 
Accordingly,
the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Minor (Maya Karimiha,
age 7) is CONTINUED. Counsel is to file a new petition, proposed order, and
order to deposit funds in a blocked account addressing the issues identified
above. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
