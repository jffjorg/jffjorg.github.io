And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the court's review of the petition to approve the compromise of the disputed claim of minor Maya Karimiha, age 7. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference. The court finds that the settlement is reasonable, but notes several issues with the petition, proposed order, and order to deposit funds. Specifically, the court points out that no order appointing a guardian ad litem has been filed, that medical reports and support for the injuries have not been provided, and that there are miscalculations in the costs and settlement amount. As a result, the petition is continued, and counsel is ordered to file a new petition, proposed order, and order to deposit funds addressing the issues identified above.
