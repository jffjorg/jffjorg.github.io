 Case Number:  22STCV08694    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   The
proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of
the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed
order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. All
substantive and procedural requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel are
satisfied. Counsel declares that there is a conflict of interest that precludes
further representation of the client and there has been a breakdown in the
client relationship that precludes further representation. 
 
The motion is GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly,
the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court of the proof of service showing service of
the signed order on the client. 
 
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
