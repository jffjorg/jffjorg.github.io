And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. The motion was filed in accordance with the relevant California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure. The counsel declared a conflict of interest and breakdown in the client relationship, which precludes further representation. The judge has ordered that the motion be granted and that the counsel give notice. The effective date of the order will be delayed until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
