And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving PSFEG and Soil Pacific. The judge is addressing the issue of Section 411.35 and the Plaintiff's objection to the Defendant's filing of 121 pages, which includes numerous exhibits unrelated to the section 411.35 issue. The judge does not consider these exhibits. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not established that any privilege exists, so it does not need to reach the issue of waiver. Additionally, the judge notes that neither PSFEG nor Soil Pacific objected to the subpoenas, which waives their respective privileges. Finally, the judge finds that the Defendant has not provided any evidence of the Plaintiff's sanctionable conduct, and therefore does not request that the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff's counsel be jointly and severally liable for monetary sanctions.
