And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Michael Keyes DBA Global Ocean and Land Construction, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Glenn Vallecillos M.D., Inc., alleges that the defendant made false representations about his qualifications and insurance coverage, and that the defendant failed to obtain necessary permits and insurance. The defendant demurred to the complaint on the grounds of uncertainty, failure to state a cause of action, misjoinder of parties, and procedural defects.

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is without merit and has ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint by November 30, 2023. The judge found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and that the defendant's claims of misjoinder and procedural defects are unfounded. The judge also noted that the defendant should have filed a motion to strike rather than a demurrer to challenge the plaintiff's allegations.
