[1] Plaintiff also objects to Defendant’s filing of 121
pages, including numerous exhibits unrelated to the section 411.35 issue.  To the extent Defendant’s supplemental
opposition and related papers address issues unrelated to Section 411.35, the Court
does not consider them.


[2] Moreover, Plaintiff’s representation that the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine are not at issue,
suggests that no such subsequent consultation occurred.
 


[3] Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has not
established any privilege exists, it need not reach the issue of waiver,
although the Court does note that neither PSFEG nor Soil Pacific objected to
the subpoenas, thereby waiving their respective privileges.


[4] Although Defendant requested that Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel be jointly and severally liable for the monetary sanctions,
Defendant has not provided any evidence of Plaintiff’s sanctionable conduct.
