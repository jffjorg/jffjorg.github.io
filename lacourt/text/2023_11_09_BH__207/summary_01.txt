  - Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it disclosed confidential information to the consultants
  - Code of Civ. Proc. section 411.35 does not create a privilege in this case

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motions to quash the third-party subpoenas, ruling that the requested documents are not privileged or irrelevant. The plaintiff hired third-party consultants to evaluate damage to its building, and the defendant sought documents related to the consultants' retention and prelitigation examinations. The plaintiff argued that the documents were privileged because the consultants were not designated as expert witnesses, but the judge found that this argument was unpersuasive. The judge also found that the information sought was relevant to the litigation.

The judge awarded the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $2042.50, finding that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification in bringing the motions to quash. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion to quash.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion to quash, finding that the requested documents are not protected from disclosure. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
