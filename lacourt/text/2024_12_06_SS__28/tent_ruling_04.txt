BACKGROUND 
On

(“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort.

Nicolas Vicente’s guardian ad litem. 
On
May 3, 2021, Plaintiffs Hernan Vicente, Ani Piliposian, and Nicholas Vicente, a
minor by and through his guardian ad litem, filed a first amended complaint
against Defendant and Does 1-50 for negligence—motor vehicle (Government Code

On

On

On September
26, 2024, Petitioner Ani Piliposian (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente’s
claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas
Vicente’s claims. 
DISCUSSION 
          Section 19b(2) of the petition states that Petitioner will
provide the name, address, and branch of the depository in Attachment 19b(2).
The petition does not include an Attachment 19b(2).  However, the proposed order states that the
net settlement funds will be deposited at Chase, 17200
Saticoy Street, Van Nuys, CA 91406.  Therefore,
with this understanding, the Court grants the petition and orders that the net settlement proceeds of $3,298.33 are to be
deposited in insured, blocked accounts at Chase, 17200 Saticoy Street, Van
Nuys, CA 91406, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court.
