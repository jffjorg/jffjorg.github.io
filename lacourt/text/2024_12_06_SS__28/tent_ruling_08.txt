 Case Number:  22STCV20970    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default  judgment, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On June  28, 2022, Plaintiff Juan Carlos Calderon (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants Nancy Holloway Brown (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for  negligence.  On  December 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted  service of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on  Defendant on December 10, 2023.  On  May 10, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On  August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against Defendant.   On August 19, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff's request.  PARTY’S REQUEST            Plaintiff asks the Court to enter a default judgment  against Defendant and award Plaintiff $1,396,534.10, consisting of $395,944.30  in special damages, $1,000,000.00 in general damages, and $589.80 in costs.   LEGAL STANDARD  A.      Default judgment            California Rules of Court, rule  3.1800(a), provides:  “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party  seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry  of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following  must be included in the documents filed with the clerk:  “(1)  Except in  unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties  and the nature of plaintiff's claim;  “(2)   Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment  requested;  “(3)  Interest  computations as necessary;  “(4)  A  memorandum of costs and disbursements;  “(5)  A  declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is  sought;  “(6)  A proposed  form of judgment;  “(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not  sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under  Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each  judgment;  “(8)  Exhibits  as necessary; and  “(9)  A request  for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”  (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  B.       Damages   On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a  cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce  evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.  Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,  361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].)  The  relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed  the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where  damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement  of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice  requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker  v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures  that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice  of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment  other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has  been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter  adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction  if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or  statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.)  DISCUSSION            In default cases, “it is the duty of the court to act as  gatekeeper, ensuring that only the appropriate claims get through. That role  requires the court to analyze the complaint for itself—with guidance from  counsel if necessary—ascertaining what relief is sought as against each  defaulting party, and to what extent the relief sought in one cause of action  is inconsistent with or duplicative of the relief sought in another. The court  must then compare the properly pled damages for each defaulting party with the  evidence offered in the prove-up.”  (Heidary  v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 868 (Heidary); see LCPFV,  LLC v. Somatdary Inc. (Nov. 13, 2024) __ Cal.App.5th __ [No. B325599, 2024  WL 4762549 at *3].)            In exercising this gatekeeping duty, “[t]he court cannot  allow a plaintiff to prove different claims or different damages at a default  hearing than those pled in the complaint."  (Heidary, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th  at p. 868.)            Here, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff was injured in  an accident that took place on June 29, 2022.   (Complaint ¶ 9.)  To support his  application for default judgment, however, Plaintiff has submitted a  declaration stating the accident at issue took place on June 29, 2020.            As Plaintiff filed the complaint on June 28, 2022, it seems  likely that the allegation that the accident took place on June 29, 2022 resulted  from a typographical error.  However,  Plaintiff has not attempted to amend the complaint.  “A  defendant who defaults admits only facts well pleaded in the complaint.  Thus, if the complaint fails to state a cause  of action, a default judgment is erroneous and will be set aside on appeal.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:228, p. 5-58.)  The Court finds that the complaint does not state  a cause of action in its present form.  In  addition, the Court’s review of the medical and billing records attached to the  application for default judgment show that Plaintiff has sought treatment for injuries  sustained in accidents that occurred in 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2023.  The Court cannot fulfill its duty to act as a  gatekeeper in ruling on applications for default judgment if it overlooks the  lack of clarity about which accident and which injuries Plaintiff is asking the  Court to hold Defendant responsible for.  Last,  Plaintiff is asking the Court to award $395,944.30 in special damages and  $1,000,000.00 in general damages.  But Plaintiff’s  statement of damages lists “[g]eneral damages according to proof, however in  excess of $25,000.00” and “[s]pecial damages according to proof, however in  excess of $25,000.00 . . . ”  These  statements do not support a default judgment for more than $25,000.00 in  special damages and $25,000.00 in general damages.  (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶¶ 5:242—5:244.1,  pp. 5-64 to 5-65.) The Court denies the application for default judgment.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Juan Carlos Calderon’s application for default judgment  against Defendant Nancy Holloway Brown.  Plaintiff  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
