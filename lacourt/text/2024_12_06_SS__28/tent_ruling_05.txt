Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: “(a) Requirements of motion “(1)  A notice of motion to consolidate must: “(A)  List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record; “(B)  Contain the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and “(C)  Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. “(2)  The motion to consolidate: “(A)  Is deemed a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; “(B)  Must be served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and “(C)  Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” (Cal.
