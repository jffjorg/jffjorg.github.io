And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel defense expert Luke Macyszyn to answer deposition questions and produce deposition exhibits. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs Sharon Luong and Chris Lam, who contend that Dr. Macyszyn refused to answer questions and failed to produce documents responsive to the deposition notice during his deposition on July 31, 2024.

The judge denied the motion because it was filed more than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition on August 13 or 14, 2024, and because it lacked a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345. The judge also noted that the Plaintiffs did not provide any authority requiring a showing of prejudice to invoke the statutory time limitation on filing a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480.
