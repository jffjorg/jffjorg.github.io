Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a consolidated Third Amended Complaint. The motion was opposed by the defendants, who argued that the proposed amended complaint asserts several new causes of action and that the amendment would cause them to be unfairly prejudiced. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have substantially complied with the requirements for a motion for leave to amend under the Rules of Court and that the defendants have not offered any valid justification for denying the motion. The judge orders the plaintiffs to file a standalone copy of the Third Amended Complaint within 10 days of this order.
