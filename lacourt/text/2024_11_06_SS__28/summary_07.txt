Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the motion of Defendants U-Haul Co. of California and Jonathan Duenas for terminating sanctions, monetary sanctions, or to compel Plaintiff Raffi Semerjian to sign forms authorizing the release of Medicare and Social Security Disability Insurance records and to continue the trial and related deadlines. The judge found that Plaintiff's refusal to sign the forms was not "an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse" supporting an award of monetary sanctions, and that lesser sanctions would not have been effective. The judge also denied Defendants' request to compel Plaintiff to sign authorizations for release of records and to continue the trial and related deadlines, citing the lack of a court order requiring Plaintiff to sign the forms and the absence of a history of abuse by Plaintiff.
