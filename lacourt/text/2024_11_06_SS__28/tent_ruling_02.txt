(“Uber”) filed (1) a motion  to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents, set two, (2) a  motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, set two, (3)  a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories, set two, and  (4) a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set  two.  The motions were set for hearing on  November 6, 2024. On October 30, 2024, Uber filed a notice of non-opposition.  On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed late oppositions. Trial  is currently scheduled for February 7, 2025.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  Uber  asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents, set two,  special interrogatories, set two, and form interrogatories, set two, (2) to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff, and (3) to impose  sanctions on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff asks the Court to deny the motions.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand            Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:          “If a party to whom a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely  response to it, the following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling  a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent  exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or  any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored  information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of  the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:          “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            C.  Requests for  admission  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move  for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  DISCUSSION  On July 23, 2024, Uber served request for production  of documents, set two, special interrogatories, set two, form interrogatories,  set two, and requests for admission, set two, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and  had not served responses by the time Uber filed these motions.  Uber's motions ask the Court to compel Plaintiff’s  responses to the request for production of documents, set two, special  interrogatories, set two, and form interrogatories, set two, and to deem  admitted the matters specified in requests for admission, set two.  At the November 6, 2024 hearing on Uber's motions, Plaintiff's counsel informed the Court that Plaintiff had served verified objection-free responses to the discovery requests.  Uber's counsel confirmed receipt of Plaintiff's discovery responses. Accordingly, the Court denies as moot Uber’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses  to request for production of documents, set two, Uber’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, set two, Uber's motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set two, and Uber’s motion to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission, set two.  The Court is required to grant Uber’s request for  sanctions on its motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for  admission, set two. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that  the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely  response to requests for admission necessitated this motion”].)  Uber requests $1,800.00 in sanctions based on four  hours of attorney time to prepare the motion at a rate of $300.00 per hour, .25  hours of attorney time attempting to meet and confer with Plaintiff at a rate  of $300.00 per hour, .5 hours of attorney time to review the motion prior to  filing at a rate of $575.00 per hour, and one hour of attorney time to attend  the hearing at a rate of $300.00 per hour.  The Court grants Uber $750.00 in sanctions based on  three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour.    CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES as moot Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez’s responses to request for production  of documents, set two.  The Court DENIES as moot Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez’s responses to special  interrogatories, set two.  The  Court DENIES as moot Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff  Jose Rodriguez’s responses to form interrogatories, set two.  The  Court DENIES as moot Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff Jose  Rodriguez. The  Court GRANTS Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s request for sanctions on its  motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two,  served on Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez.  The  Court ORDERS Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez and his counsel to pay Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. $750.00 by December  6, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
