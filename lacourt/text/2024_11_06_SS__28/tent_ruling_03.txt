considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 29, 2022, Plaintiff Rayvon Aldridge (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Van Co Loi (“Loi”) and Alounkone
Malavong (“Malavong”) for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  Although Plaintiff did not list Doe
defendants in the caption or in Section 1 of the complaint, Section 6 of the
complaint and the Judicial Council form attachments for Motor Vehicle and
General Negligence name Doe defendants 1-25. 
On
June 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on
Loi of the summons, complaint, and other documents on April 24, 2022. 
On
May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of publication of the summons and
statement of damages. The statement of damages contained in the proof of
publication sought $100,000.00 in general damages for pain, suffering, and
inconvenience and $11,435.00 in special damages for medical expenses. 
On
July 19, 2023, the clerk entered Loi’s default. 
On
December 11, 2023, the Court dismissed Malavong without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request.  On July 31, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe
defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On July
25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment.  
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Rayvon Aldridge asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Van
Co Loi and award Plaintiff $112,357.23, consisting of $100,000.00 in general
damages, $11,435.00 in special damages, and $922.23 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has submitted a complete default judgment application with all required
information.  The Court grants the
application and awards Plaintiff $112,357.23. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Rayvon
Aldridge against Defendant Van Co Loi on July 25, 2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Rayvon Aldridge $112,357.23. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
