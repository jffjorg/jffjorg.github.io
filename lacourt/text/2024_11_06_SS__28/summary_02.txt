The judge has ruled on the motions filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. regarding discovery requests made to Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez.

The Plaintiff subsequently served verified objection-free responses on November 5, 2024, making the motions moot. The judge denied the motions as moot and granted Uber's request for sanctions in the amount of $750.00. The judge also ordered the Plaintiff to pay the sanctions by December 6, 2024.
