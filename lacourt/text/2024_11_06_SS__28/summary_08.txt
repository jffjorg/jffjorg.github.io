And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle tort and general negligence lawsuit between Plaintiff Lina Gonzales and Defendant Ashley Tisdale. The defendant has moved for a protective order to prevent the disclosure of her deposition testimony and video to third parties, specifically media outlets and tabloids, and to restrict the use of the testimony and video for any purpose except this lawsuit. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it would limit her right to conduct discovery. The court has granted the defendant's request for a protective order, prohibiting the disclosure of the deposition testimony and video to third parties and restricting the use of the testimony and video to only this lawsuit. The court has also ordered that the parties, counsel, witnesses, consultants, and their employees and agents are bound by the protective order.
