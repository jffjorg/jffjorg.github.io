 Case Number:  23VECV00915    Hearing Date:   February 27, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00915
Eli v General Motors
 
Tentative
ruling:  Plaintiff’s motion to compel
enforcement.  The court needs a list of specific
information that plaintiff contends have not been produced.  Rather than argument, please make a simple
list of what is missing and what specific order it is seeking with a
proposed order.  The order, as proposed,
is unenforceable as it is vague.  The
court will then discuss the matter further. 
The court will not go through the myriad documents to determine what is
missing.
