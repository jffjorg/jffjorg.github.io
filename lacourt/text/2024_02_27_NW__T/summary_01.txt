And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Forrester v Reshad, scheduled for a hearing on February 27, 2024. The judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial, finding no good cause for the delay. However, the judge has granted relief from the defendant's 1-day late designation of experts, allowing the use of treating physicians who have been known to the defendant for some time. The judge has also imposed sanctions of $250 each on both parties for failing to comply with the court's Final Status Conference order regarding witness lists, exhibits, and jury instructions. As a result, the only witnesses allowed to testify will be the plaintiff and defendant, and no exhibits will be allowed. The case will proceed as a bench trial.
