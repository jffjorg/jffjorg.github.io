And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint, naming a new defendant, Audio Tint Lab, and revising the claim against the existing defendant. The motion is unopposed. The Court finds that amendment is proper, as there is no basis to conclude that Defendant will suffer substantial prejudice from the proposed amendments, no trial date is set, and Plaintiff has stated sufficient facts which may support liability against Defendant. The Court applies a liberal policy in permitting amendments, and finds that the proposed amendments do not require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, added costs of preparation, or an increased burden of discovery.
