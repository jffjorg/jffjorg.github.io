Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Oscar Health Plan of California's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration. The Judge finds that the arbitration provision in the Evidence of Coverage (EOC) contracts is enforceable and that the claims brought by Plaintiff Curative Labs Inc. are subject to arbitration. The Judge rejects Plaintiff's arguments that the anti-assignment clause in the EOCs is voided by Health and Safety Code section 1342.2, that the arbitration clause exempts the small value claims at issue, and that reading the arbitration clause to require individual arbitrations of $200 to $300 claims for COVID-19 tests renders it unconscionable. The Judge orders the proceedings to be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
