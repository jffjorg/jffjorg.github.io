Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants plaintiff Robert Gordon's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint, allowing him to seek the appointment of a provisional director for American Voice Mail, Inc. (AVM). The judge notes that Robert has failed to provide a required declaration describing when the facts giving rise to the proposed amendment were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier, but given that Robert has provided a copy of the proposed pleading and because AVM does not oppose the amendment, the motion is granted.

The judge denies Robert's Renewed Motion for the Appointment of a Provisional Director, stating that Robert has not provided evidence that the directors of AVM are deadlocked and cannot agree on the management of the company's affairs. The judge notes that Robert only provides evidence of a single board meeting that did not move forward due to disagreements, but this meeting occurred after the initial pleading was filed and does not establish a deadlock. The judge also notes that Robert and Mark, the other shareholder and board member of AVM, have stipulated to the dissolution of the company, making it unnecessary to appoint a provisional director.
