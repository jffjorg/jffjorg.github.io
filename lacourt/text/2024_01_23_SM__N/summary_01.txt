And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants' demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The fifth cause of action alleges fraudulent inducement, and the sixth cause of action alleges violation of California Blue Sky Laws. The plaintiff's allegations are too vague and conclusory, and the court finds that the claims are not sufficiently specific as required in a fraud claim. The plaintiff must specifically allege the representations made, when they were made, by what means, and the defendant's knowledge of falsity. The defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
