Significant Statements:
  - "The right to compel arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract."
  - "Unless the parties have clearly and unmistakably provided otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator."
  - "The court should order the parties to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to cover the dispute."
