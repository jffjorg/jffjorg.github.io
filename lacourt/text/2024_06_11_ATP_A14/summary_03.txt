Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel a subsequent deposition of Plaintiff Emily McAdams. The defendant seeks to question Plaintiff about her consumption of alcohol on the night of the incident, which allegedly caused the collision. The plaintiff objects to the questions, citing her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The court notes that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff is in jeopardy of being charged with a crime and that the statute of limitations for any potential misdemeanor has likely passed. The court also inquires about a potential stay of the civil action pending the outcome of any potential criminal proceeding.
