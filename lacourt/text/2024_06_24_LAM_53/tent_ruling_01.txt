  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel vrc
  investigations to comply with deposition subpoena 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Southern California
Gas Company           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel VRC Investigations to Comply with Deposition Subpoena
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Southern California Gas Company (“Defendant”) moves the
court for an order compelling nonparty VRC Investigations (“VRC”) to comply
with the Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records that Defendant
served on VRC on January 8, 2024.  (Esterkin Decl., Exs. A [Deposition Subpoena],
B [Proof of Service on SUBP-010].) 
The court finds that Defendant has not properly served VRC with the
moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1346.)  
“A written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion to compel
an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of a document or
tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served on the
nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail
or electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on
the deposition record.”  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1346.) 
The proofs of service attached to the moving papers establish that
Defendant served VRC with this motion by electronic service.  (Mot., pp. 8-9 [proof of service of notice of
motion and motion]; Separate Statement, pp. 5-6 [proof of service of separate
statement]; Esterkin Decl., pp. 40-41 [proof of service of supporting
declaration of Jeremy Esterkin]; Ventura Decl., pp. 25-26 [proof of service of
supporting declaration of Lulu Ventura].)  The proofs of service do not state that the
moving papers were served on VRC by personal service as required. 
Moreover, Defendant did not present evidence establishing that VRC
“agree[d] to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or
electronic service address specified on the deposition record.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1346.)  The court acknowledges that the evidence filed
in support of this motion shows that VRC advised Nationwide Legal LLC that “[s]ubpoenas
may be emailed to hr@vrcinvestigations.com[,]” and that Defendant served the
moving papers on VRC at that email address.  (Ventura Decl., Ex. B, p. 1 [Dec. 26, 2023
email from VRC’s Compliance Administrator, Krista Koons].)  However, the court finds that this communication
does not (1) constitute an agreement to accept service at that email address
specified “on the deposition record[,]” or (2) establish that VRC agreed to
accept service of motions at that email address.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1346.)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant was required to serve VRC with
this motion by personal service but did not do so.  The court therefore finds that it is
appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to continue the hearing on
Defendant’s motion to compel VRC’s compliance with its Deposition Subpoena so
that Defendant can properly serve VRC by personal service pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on defendant Southern California Gas Company’s motion to compel VRC
Investigations to comply with deposition subpoena is continued to September 5,
2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendant Southern California Gas Company
(1) to serve VRC Investigations with the moving papers filed in connection with
its motion to compel compliance in the manner required by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1346, and to file a proof of service with the court no later than
August 5, 2024, and (2) to give notice of this ruling to VRC Investigations and
to all of the parties who have appeared in this action, and to file the notice
of ruling and the proof of service of the notice of ruling with the court no
later than August 5, 2024. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 24, 2024
