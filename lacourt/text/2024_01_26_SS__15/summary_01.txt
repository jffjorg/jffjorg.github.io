And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions to compel discovery in a mesothelioma case. The defendant, Vanderbilt Minerals, moves to compel an independent medical examination (IME) and genetic testing of the plaintiff, Roberto Sotomayor, claiming that mesothelioma can be caused by genetic anomalies without exposure to asbestos. The judge denies this motion, citing the lack of explanation from the defendant on how the IME and genetic testing can be conducted and the defense expert's report can be produced in the next 13 days.

The defendant, Kaiser Gypsum Company, Inc., moves to compel verifications of 77 sets of discovery responses, which the judge finds is not timely and denies. The judge also warns that unverified responses are improper and can result in monetary and evidentiary sanctions.

The plaintiff moves to compel a witness from Plastic Sales Inc. and a notice of deposition from Saint-Gobain Abrasives and Industrial Holdings Company. The judge grants the motion to compel a deposition of James Quinn, the president of Plastic Sales Inc.'s successor-in-interest, and orders the defendant to produce Quinn for deposition by February 6, 2024.

The judge also rules on several document requests, denying those that seek excessive or overbroad information. Finally, the judge grants a pro hac vice application for Jennifer Whelan to represent a party in the case.
