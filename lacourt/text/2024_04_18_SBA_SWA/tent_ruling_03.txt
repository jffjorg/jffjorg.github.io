Normally, issues of discovery and the completion thereof are heard in the IC
trial department which was initially assigned to hear a civil matter for all
purposes.  This matter came to this Court
as a long cause trial assignment – for trial only.  The assigned trial court declined to hear
this discovery issue, asking that this Court instead conduct the hearing.
