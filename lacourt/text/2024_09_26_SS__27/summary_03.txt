The plaintiff, Mireya B. De La Rosa Gallegos, filed a motion for relief from the waiver of jury trial in the case against Trukman Enterprises, Inc. et al. The plaintiff had previously failed to pay jury fees, but paid them on May 10, 2024, after realizing the oversight.

The court cited California law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 631(a), (f), and (g), and California Constitution, Article I, Section 16, in its ruling. The court also relied on case law, including Mackovska v. Viewcrest Road Properties LLC, Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co., Massie v. AAR Western Skyways, Inc., and Johnson-Stovall v. Superior Court, to support its decision.

The court ordered that the motion for relief from the waiver of jury trial be granted, allowing the plaintiff to have a jury trial. The parties were notified to submit their responses to the tentative ruling by email or to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
