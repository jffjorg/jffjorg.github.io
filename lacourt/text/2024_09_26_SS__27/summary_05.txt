And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to deem requests for admission (RFA) admitted and requests for sanctions. The defendant, Rodney Dewayne Marshall, served the plaintiffs, Alejandro Chavez and Marcela Munoz, with requests for admission on May 7, 2024. The responses were due on June 11, 2024, but the plaintiffs did not respond by the statutory deadline. The court finds that the plaintiffs did not act with substantial justification and grants the motion to deem the RFA admitted against the plaintiffs. The court also grants sanctions in the amount of $1000 for both motions, making the plaintiffs and their attorney jointly and severally liable. The court reduces the sanctions from the original amount of $869 due to the simplicity of the issues and the absence of any opposition.
