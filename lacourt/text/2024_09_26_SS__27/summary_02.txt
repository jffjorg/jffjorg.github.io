And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion to augment their expert witness designation to include Dr. Virella, a certified neurosurgeon. The judge found that Plaintiff did not act with reasonable diligence in determining to call Dr. Virella as an expert witness, as there was evidence of consideration for surgery several months prior to Dr. Virella's consultation. Additionally, the judge found that amending the expert witness list just a few days prior to the close of expert discovery poses a risk of prejudice to Defendant. The judge's ruling is based on Code of Civ. Proc. ยง 2034.620, which outlines the conditions under which a court may grant leave to augment or amend an expert witness list.
