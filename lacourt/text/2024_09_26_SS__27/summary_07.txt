Additionally, the motion was not served on all attorneys of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated. The judge notes that the granting or denial of the motion to consolidate rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.
