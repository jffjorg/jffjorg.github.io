The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel deposition and requests for sanctions. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer on the objections raised by the defendants. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's meet and confer attempt was insufficient, as the objections raised by the defendants were not limited to the deposition dates but also included each request for production and deposition topics. The Court also denies sanctions as the motions are denied. The parties are required to meet and confer on the objections, and if they fail to do so, the motion may be taken off the calendar or the Court may adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
