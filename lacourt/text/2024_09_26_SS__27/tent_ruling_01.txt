CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV33539 KEVIN MCELRATH
vs LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY et al.
Moving Party: Defendant LOS ANGELES COUNTY
METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE IS
GRANTED.
 
On September 10, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present case. At the time Defendant’s present motion to
continue the trial was filed, the trial was set for October 1, 2024. The
original reason for the continuance was that Plaintiff listed 47 non-retained
experts, and there was not enough time to conduct all of the depositions. On
September 4, 2024, the court granted Defendant’s ex parte application to
continue the trial and extended the trial date by 30 days. The trial is
currently set for October 31, 2024. On September 13, 2024, the court granted
Defendant's motion for a protective order, and Plaintiff was ordered to amend
his expert disclosure to list only the non-retained experts that Plaintiff
expects will testify at trial. On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff reduced its
expert disclosure to 13 non-retained experts.
Despite Plaintiff
reducing his non-retained experts from 47 to 13 and the court extending the
trial date by 30 days, Defendant argues that it still needs more time to
subpoena and depose the 13 non-retained experts, along with the retained
experts. Plaintiff’s non-retained experts were disclosed on September 18, 2024,
with the expert discovery deadline set for October 16, 2024, leaving a little
less than one month in between. The court finds that this timeframe, while very
tight, is sufficient to conduct depositions of the 13 non-retained experts.
Regarding the seven retained experts who were disclosed on July 8, 2024,
Defendant alleges that none have been deposed by either party. The parties have
had more than three months to depose the retained experts, and they were not
subject to the motion for protective order. Thus, the need for additional time
to conduct retained expert’s deposition is not particularly well-taken.
Additionally, Defense counsel has a five-year case
set for trial on October 24, 2024 (19STCV11651) and will be occupied with the
trial preparation for that case and is not available to take Plaintiff’s expert
depositions around that time period.
Considering the
unavailability of defense counsel and the remaining expert depositions to be
taken, the court grants a continuance of only 30 days, given that a prior
continuance was recently granted. The parties should consider the trial date
set herein as firm.
The new Trial Date is
set for
December 2,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to November__, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
With the exception of expert discovery, all other case-related deadlines will
not follow the new trial date.
