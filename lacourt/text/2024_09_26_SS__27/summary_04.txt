And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this personal injury case. The plaintiff, Patrick Rayfield, was injured on August 2, 2020, while shopping at a store in Los Angeles. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2022, but failed to list the personal injury lawsuit in his bankruptcy schedules. The defendants argue that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the case and that the case should be barred due to judicial estoppel. However, the plaintiff has since reopened his bankruptcy case and amended the schedules to include the personal injury claim. The trustee has investigated and decided not to pursue the claim, and the bankruptcy court has discharged the case. The judge finds that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding standing, and therefore denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
