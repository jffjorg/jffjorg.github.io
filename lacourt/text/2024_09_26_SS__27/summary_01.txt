And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was previously set for October 1, 2024. The original reason for the continuance was that Plaintiff listed 47 non-retained experts, and there was not enough time to conduct all of the depositions. After Plaintiff reduced its non-retained experts to 13, Defendant argued that it still needs more time to subpoena and depose the experts. The Judge finds that the remaining timeframe, although tight, is sufficient for the depositions. The Judge also notes that Defendant's retained experts were not subject to the motion for protective order and that Defense counsel will be occupied with a five-year case set for trial on October 24, 2024.

The new trial date is set for December 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to November (no specific date), 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
