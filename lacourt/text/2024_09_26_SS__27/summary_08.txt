And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel Claimant Daniel Geoulla's second independent medical examination (IME). Respondent California Automobile Insurance Company (CAIC) proposed changes to the parameters of the examination, including allowing the doctor or someone on his staff to record the examination if an observer or attorney records it on behalf of the Claimant, and requiring the Claimant to provide a copy of the audio recording to the Respondent within 20 days. The judge denied these proposed changes, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.510, which permits the attorney for the examinee to attend and observe the examination and to record stenographically or by audio technology any spoken words during the examination. The judge found that Respondent has provided no legal authority for these requests and that the proposed changes would undermine the examinee's ability to safeguard their interests. The judge's decision is tentative and parties must submit by email or appear at the hearing to argue.
