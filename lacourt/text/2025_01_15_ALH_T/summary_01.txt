And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Uber Technologies, Inc., has moved to compel the plaintiff, Alison Zatta, to undergo an independent medical examination with Dr. Ari Kalechstein, a neuropsychologist. The defendant seeks to examine the plaintiff due to her claims of traumatic brain injury and emotional distress. The defendant has noticed the examination twice, starting in October 2023, and the plaintiff did not appear. The defendant has also sought monetary sanctions.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendant has failed to show good cause for the examination and has not provided sufficient information about the tests that will be conducted. The judge also noted that the examination is more appropriately characterized as a mental exam rather than a physical exam, and therefore, the defendant's reliance on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 is misplaced. The judge further stated that the motion is denied for failure to provide good cause or listing the tests that will be completed, and therefore, the defendant's request for monetary sanctions is also denied.
