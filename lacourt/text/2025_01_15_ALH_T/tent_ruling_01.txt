  Case Number:  22STCV05716    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  T Alison Zatta vs William James Hill, et al. Motion for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Submit to Independent Medical Examination with Dr. Ari KalechsteinMoving Party: Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. Responding Party: NoneTentative Ruling: DenyBACKGROUNDOn February 15, 2022, Plaintiff Alison Zatta (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants William James Hill, Uber Technologies, Raiser LLC, Raiser-CA LLC, and Does 1 to 50 for negligence based on a motor vehicle accident that occurred on February 18, 2020. Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Defendant”) now moves to compel Plaintiff to appear for an independent medical examination. No opposition has been filed. MOVING PARTY POSITION Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination with Dr. Ari Kalechstein, a neuropsychologist, on January 31, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. at 11835 W. Olympic Blvd. Ste. 1270e 12th floor, Los Angeles, CA 90064. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.Defendant contends the examination is warranted due to Plaintiff’s claim of traumatic brain injury and emotional distress. (Sharma Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant has noticed the examination twice, starting in October 2023, and Plaintiff did not serve objections or appear. (Id. ¶ 4-5.) Plaintiff also has not provided available dates for the examination and has failed to cooperate with Defendant in scheduling the exam from June to August 2024. (Id. ¶ 6-7.) On August 15, 2024, Defendant served a third amended notice for the examination, set for November 18, 2024. (Sharma Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. 5.) Plaintiff served objections on September 16, 2024, and did not appear at the exam. (Id. ¶ 9, Exh. 6.) OPPOSITION No opposition was filed. REPLY No reply was filed.  ANALYSISI. Legal Standard“If any party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.  A motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subds. (a)-(b).)  “The court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (a); see also Sporich v. Superior Court (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 422, 427 [“the good cause which must be shown should be such that will satisfy an impartial tribunal that the request may be granted without abuse of the inherent rights of the adversary”].) A showing of good cause generally requires “that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)  And “[a] party who chooses to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in controversy.”  (Id. at p. 839.)   The examination will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §2032.020(a).)¿ This means the examination must be directly related to the specific injury or condition that is the subject of the litigation.¿ (Roberts v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 337.)¿ Often, a party's pleadings put his or her mental or physical condition in controversy ... as when a plaintiff claims continuing mental or physical injury resulting from defendant's acts: “A party who chooses to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in controversy.”¿ (See Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 837, wherein the plaintiff claimed ongoing emotional distress from sexual harassment by former employer.)¿ Discovery responses can also frame the issues regarding the injuries and damages alleged.¿¿ II. DiscussionAs an initial matter, the Notice of Motion states this motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.310, 2032.310(b), and 2032.320(e). These sections, as explained above, pertain to “a physical examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2032.310, subd. (a).) For examinations under this section, the party must obtain leave of court; there is no mechanism to compel this type of examination in section 2032.310. However, Defendant’s supporting memorandum appears to compel the examination under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220, which allows a defendant in a personal injury case to demand one physical examination from the plaintiff, and if necessary, compel attendance. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2032.240, subd. (b), 2032.250, subd. (a).) The neuropsychological examination sought here appears to be a mental examination, rather than a physical examination. The Court notes that the third amended demand (“Demand”) states this is a “psychological examination.” (See Sharma, Exh. 5.) Exhibit 1 attached to the Demand also describes this as a “neurological evaluation” and a “mental state evaluation” designed to understand the “origin, nature, and severity of any mental state difficulties/impairments.” (Id.) Most notably, the Demand states that “[t]he mental state evaluation will not involve any physical examination.” (Id.) Therefore, Defendant fails to show that the Court can compel compliance as a physical examination under section 2032.220 since this examination is more appropriately characterized as a mental exam. Moreover, Plaintiff’s objections to the examination, states, among other things, that Plaintiff already submitted to a defense medical exam. (Exh. 6.) As a result, the Court will consider the merits of the motion under sections 2032.310 and 2032.320. In support for the neuropsychological examination, Defendant’s supporting declaration only states that based on discovery responses dated January 23, 2023, Plaintiff is claiming a traumatic brain injury. (Sharma Decl. ¶ 3.) However, the discovery responses are not attached. Defendant must provide more information to support good cause. Furthermore, the motion does not list the tests that will be conducted at this examination. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) As discussed in Carpenter v. Superior Court¿(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249, the party seeking leave for a mental examination must state the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination fully and in detail. (Id. at p. 260.) This means listing each diagnostic test and procedure by name. There, the court discussed the heightened risk of intrusion that a mental examination could pose. (Id. at p. 261 [“Requiring the court to identify the permissible diagnostic tests and procedures, by name, confirms that the court has weighed the risks of unwarranted intrusion upon the plaintiff against the defendant's need for a meaningful opportunity to test the plaintiff's claims of physical or mental injury.”].) Additionally, the specificity and clarity of the order aids the examiner in complying with the parameters imposed by the court. (Id.) Here, while Defendant has described the time and place of the examination, it has failed to list by name the tests that will or could be done. For example, the Demand states, “Plaintiff . . .  will be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests. . . . Attached is the universe of tests that may be administered to the plaintiff.” (Exhibit 1 within Exhibit 5.) However, no list of the tests is attached. Therefore, the motion is denied for failure to provide good cause or listing the tests that will be completed. As a result, Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is also denied. RULING Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s Motion for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Submit to Independent Medical Examination with Dr. Ari Kalechstein is DENIED.
