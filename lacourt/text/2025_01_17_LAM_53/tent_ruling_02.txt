  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Oust, LLC     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Oust, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
default judgment in its favor and against defendants Draft Champ, Ben Frazier, and
Charley Harris (“Defendants”)[1]
in the total amount of $383,411.94, consisting of (1) damages in the amount of
$300,048, (2) interest in the amount of $78,990.78, and (3) costs in the amount
of $4,373.16.
The court finds that Plaintiff has not complied with California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1800, because Plaintiff did not dismiss the Doe defendants and
therefore did not dismiss “all parties against whom judgment is not sought” as
required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1800, subd. (a)(7); Compl. [identifying as defendants Doe defendants 1-10].) 
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on the Order to Show Cause re entry of
default judgment to February 14, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff Oust, LLC to file a Request for Dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought no later than January 27,
2025.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 17, 2025
