  Order RE:
 
(1)  
  defendant’s
  demurrer to first amended complaint
(2)  
  defendant’s
  motion to strike first amended complaint
 



 
(1)  
Demurrer
to First Amended Complaint
(2)  
Motion
to Strike First Amended Complaint
On September 10, 2024,
defendant RLoom, LLC (“Defendant”) filed the pending demurrer and motion to
strike, directed to the First Amended Complaint filed in this action by
plaintiff Water Flower Apparel, Inc. 
Thereafter, on November 26,
2024, Defendant filed a “Notice of Stay of Proceedings” with the court, in
which Defendant attached the “Voluntary Petition for Non-Individuals Filing for
Bankruptcy” filed by Defendant in bankruptcy court on November 22, 2024.  (Nov. 26, 2024 Notice of Stay, pp. 2-17
[Bankruptcy Petition].)  
Thus, the court finds that
this action is stayed as against Defendant.[1]  (Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 973, 979 [the filing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition operates as
a stay of an action against the debtor, which is “‘self-executing and is
effective upon filing the bankruptcy petition’”].) 
The court therefore orders that defendant RLoom, LLC’s demurrer and motion to strike set for hearing on
January 17, 2025 are taken off calendar, subject to being rescheduled if the
bankruptcy stay is lifted.
The court directs the clerk to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 17, 2025
