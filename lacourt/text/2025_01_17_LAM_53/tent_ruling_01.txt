RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant David Glasser, as trustee of the Glasser Family Trust
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Amended Responses to Requests for Production of Documents and
Request for Sanctions
The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with each motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court denies defendant
Michele Tritt-Glasser’s request for judicial notice because the matters to be
judicially noticed are not relevant to the disposition of the motion to compel
her further responses to discovery since, for the reasons set forth below, the
court has found that the motion is moot. 
(Malek Media Group LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 817,
825.)
The court denies defendant
David Glasser, as trustee of the Glasser Family Trust’s request for judicial
notice because the matters to be judicially noticed are not relevant to the
disposition of the motion to compel his further responses to discovery since,
for the reasons set forth below, the court has found that the motion is moot.  (Malek Media Group LLC, supra,
58 Cal.App.5th at p. 825.)  
MOTION TO COMPEL TRITT-GLASSER’S FURTHER
AMENDED RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff Radenko Milakovic (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling defendant Michele Tritt-Glasser (“Tritt-Glasser”) to serve
further amended responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, numbers 1-5, 7-8, and 62-63, and  
(2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of
$4,245. 
The court denies as moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel Tritt-Glasser’s further
amended responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
because Tritt-Glasser has submitted evidence establishing that she served
supplemental responses, which contain representations of her inability to
comply with the subject demands, on December 26, 2024.  (Bernet Decl., Ex. 1, Def. Tritt-Glasser’s Second
Amended Responses, pp. 4:20-5:3, 6:3-13, 7:14-24, 8:25-9:7, 10:12-24, 12:10-20,
13:21-14:3, 52:7-18, 53:17-28; Bernet Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant
served the supplemental responses or that this motion is moot.  (Reply, p. 2:10-11.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for an order compelling Tritt-Glasser
to withdraw her objections because (1) as set forth above, Tritt-Glasser has
served substantive responses to this discovery, and (2) Plaintiff has not cited
authority that would authorize the court to issue such an order.  (Reply, p. 2:11-15.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions because
the notice of motion does not “identify every person, party, and attorney
against whom the sanction is sought,” and therefore does not comply with Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.040. 
(Notice of Mot., p. 2:3-5 [requesting, without identification of the
parties or attorneys to be sanctioned, “at least $4,245 as sanctions in
connection with the preparation of this motion”].) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions against Plaintiff unjust and therefore denies
Tritt-Glasser’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,100.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL TRUSTEE GLASSER’S
FURTHER AMENDED RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant David
Glasser, as trustee of the Glasser Family Trust (“Trustee Glasser”) to serve
further amended responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, numbers 1-5, 7-9, and 45-50, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $4,245. 
The court denies as moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel Trustee
Glasser’s further amended responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One because (1) Trustee Glasser has submitted evidence
establishing that he served supplemental responses, which contain Trustee
Glasser’s representations of his inability to comply with the subject demands,
on December 26, 2024, and (2) Plaintiff does not dispute that Trustee Glasser
served supplemental responses or that this motion is moot.  (Bernet Decl., ¶ 5; Bernet Decl., Ex. 1, Def.
Trustee Glasser’s Second Amended Responses, pp. 4:22-5:11, 6:11-26, 7:26-8:13,
9:16-28, 11:3-16, 13:20-14:5, 15:7-20, 16:20-17:6, 59:13-60:3, 61:7-24,
63:1-19, 64:23-65:13, 66:17-67:7, 68:11-69:1; Reply, p. 2:11-12.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request that the court order Trustee
Glasser to withdraw his objections because (1) as set forth above, Trustee
Glasser has served substantive responses to the subject discovery, and (2)
Plaintiff has not cited authority that would authorize the court to issue such
an order.
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions because
the notice of motion does not “identify every person, party, and attorney
against whom the sanction is sought,” and therefore does not comply with Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.040. 
(Notice of Mot., p. 2:4-6 [stating, without identification of the
parties/attorneys to be sanctioned, that “Plaintiff also requests at least
$4,245 as sanctions in connection with the preparation of this motion . . .
.”].) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions against Plaintiff unjust and therefore denies Trustee
Glasser’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,100.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
