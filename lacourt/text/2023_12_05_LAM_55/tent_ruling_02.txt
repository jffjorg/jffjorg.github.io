MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
DOCUMENT RESPONSES
Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to serve
further responses to RFP Nos. 5-7, 9-23, 25-30, and for $1,200.00 in sanctions
against Plaintiff and counsel. Plaintiff opposes the motion.
A document response must consist of:  1) an agreement to comply, stating whether
the productions or inspection will be allowed “in whole or in part,” and that
all documents or things in the possession, custody or control of the
respondent, as to which no objection is made, will be included, by the date set
for inspection (unless informally extended in writing, or the designated timing
is subject to objection);   2) a
representation of inability to comply, with a specification of any person
believed or known to have possession of documents;  or, 3) objections and specification of
withheld documents.  CCP §§2031.210(a),
2031.220, 2031.270, 2031.280. 
 Compliance
includes all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
“‘possession, custody, or control’” of the responding party, such as from other
corporations.  Roche v. Hyde
(2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 757, 813  (quoting
CCP  § 2031.220).
With regard to document requests, a response
expressing an inability to comply shall state that a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry was made to locate the items, and the reason for an
inability to comply, including that the item never existed, was lost or stolen,
was destroyed, or is not in respondent’s possession, along with the identity
and address of anyone believed to have the document.  CCP §2031.230.  
“Even where a party deems a demand to be
objectionable, he [she, or it] still must identify those items which fall into
the category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.”  Standon Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1990) 225
Cal. App. 3d 898, 901 n.3.
“Any documents or category of documents produced in
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be
identified with the specific request number to which the documents
respond.”  CCP § 2031.280(a).
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice.  E.g.,  Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley
Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58.  “ ‘[S]ubstantial justification” has been
understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because it is
well-grounded in both law and fact.”  Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  “If the party seeking a monetary sanction
meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting
to avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’ ”  Doe v. U.S.
Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435.
Here, Plaintiff’s responses to request numbers 16, 20,
27, 29 sufficiently report an inability to comply due to lack of possession.
While Defendant argues that deponents admitted not looking for documents
responsive to RFP No. 27, the Court cannot apply deposition testimony to find
that the responses are false.  A motion
to compel further discovery responses cannot be granted based on the reason
that verified answers served are untrue. 
Holguin v.  Sup.  Ct.  (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 820, 821.  There is no statutory requirement for
respondents to correct untruthful discovery responses, but instead an
intentional failure to amend the responses creates the risks of prosecution for
perjury, or monetary sanctions.  Guzman
v. General Motors Corp. (1984)154 Cal. App. 3d 438, 442-43 n. 4.  A respondent cannot be compelled to admit a
fact in discovery, even where its truth is obvious.  Wimberly v. Derby Cycle Corp. (1997)
56 Cal. App. 4th 618, 634;  Smith v.
Circle P Ranch Co. (1978) 87 Cal. App. 3d 267, 273.  The service of willfully false discovery
responses is not covered by the current version of the Civil Discovery
Act.  Saxena v. Goffney (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 316, 333.
As to the remaining responses to RFP Nos. 5-7, 9-15, 17-19,
21-26, 28, and 30, one cannot tell from most of the responses whether any
documents have been withheld, as required by the code and case law already set
forth herein.
Furthermore, the objections to the requests are not well-founded.
No information has been provided to soundly evaluate the attorney-client
privilege or work-product objection, third-party-privacy objections and
confidential information.  
“[L]egislation amended subdivision (c)(1) of Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.240 to require the preparation of a privilege log
‘if necessary’ to ‘provide sufficient factual information for other parties to
evaluate the merits’ of a claim of privilege or protected work product.”  Bank of Amer., N.A. v. Sup. Ct. (2013)
212 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1098.  The
objecting party has the burden to file evidence of the preliminary facts
establishing a privilege exists. HLC Properties, Limited v. Sup. Ct.
(2005) 35 Cal. 4th 54, 59.  
A privacy objection is not ripe for adjudication
before a court where there is no factual basis for ruling, such as respondents’
identifying the documents withheld in a privilege log or elsewhere. Connecticut
Indem. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 23 Cal. 4th 807, 818.
The party claiming a qualified privilege, such as
confidential commercial information, has the burden of showing that the
information falls within the privilege.  
Lipton v. Sup. Ct.  (1996)
48 Cal. App. 4th 1599, 1618-19.
Additionally, the Court finds that none of the
requests are vague or ambiguous, but instead they are intelligible enough to
respond to.  Ambiguity objections as to
discovery are overruled unless requests are unintelligible.  Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 783, superseded by statute on
another ground as stated in  Guzman
v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.  Cf.   Standon Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1990) 225
Cal. App. 3d 898, 901 (ambiguity objection deemed a nuisance objection as to
request for any medical bills or expense documentation).  
Next, the Court finds that none of the requests are
overly broad, but instead relate to information reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence, such as issues of lease compliance and complaint
handling.  Further, information from
other tenants could be relevant, such as if they made similar observations or
complaints about the same conditions that Defendant allegedly complained about.  As to overbreadth objections involving no
claim of privilege, courts determine whether the discovery is “‘reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence’”, generally
resolving doubt in favor of permitting discovery.  Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 542.  “When discovery requests are grossly
overbroad on their face, and hence do not appear reasonably related to a
legitimate discovery need, a reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to
harass and improperly burden.”  Obregon
v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.  [Emphasis added.] 
In addition, the burden-and-oppression objections are
not supported with any evidence of the amount of work that would be involved,
including in the opposing declaration that does not address that.  Objecting parties must file evidence
detailing the amount of work involved, in order to support objections based
upon burden and oppression.  West Pico Furniture Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407,
417.   A court found a document request
to be oppressive, where the response would require reviewing 13,000 insurance
files, by five employees, working for six weeks.  See  Mead Reinsurance Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(1986) 188 Cal. App. 3d 313, 318. 
 
 
Finally, the Court denies the motion as to sanctions because
each side has partial substantial justification, given that the motion is not being
fully granted.
 
            MOTION
TO COMPEL DEPOSITION 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section
2025.450(a), Defendant moves to compel the deposition of Jeet Jogani, a
managerial employee of JK Residential Inc., the property management company
that manages the property in which Defendant resides. Plaintiff has not filed
an opposition. 
Section 2025.450(a) provides that after service of a
deposition notice, if a party fails to appear without service of a valid
objection, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deposition. A motion to compel deposition attendance must include a declaration
showing that moving party inquired about the nonappearance.  CCP §2025.450(b)(2).   “Implicit in the requirement that counsel
contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that
counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve
the issue," including by rescheduling. 
Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App.
4th 1109, 1124.  Further, in light of law
excusing meeting and conferring, and a conflict of the evidence, substantial
justification arguably supports the denial of monetary sanctions against Defendant. Generally, monetary sanctions
are mandatory as to parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find
substantial justification or other injustice. 
E.g.,  Foothill
Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th
1542, 1557-58.  “ ‘[S]ubstantial
justification” has been understood to mean that a justification is clearly
reasonable because it is well-grounded in both law and fact.”  Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  
Defendant served a deposition notice for Mr. Jogani,
and in response, Plaintiff asserted an objection to Mr. Jogani only on the
basis that he lacks personal knowledge of the circumstances related to this
case. (Medina Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Plaintiff failed to response to Defendant’s
attempts to meet and confer on the issue of Mr. Jogani’s deposition. Defendant
therefore complied with his obligations under the code for compelling a deposition.
Plaintiff failed to produce Mr. Jogani at his deposition. An objection for lack
of personal knowledge applies to top corporate or government executives, and
not a residential property manager. See Liberty
Mutual Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1282, 1287. Plaintiff’s sole objection to the deposition,
therefore, has no merit, and Mr. Jogani should have appeared for his
deposition. The Court therefore grants the motion to compel the deposition and
imposes sanctions of $1,625 against Plaintiff.
