And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to overrule the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Gary Stiffelman to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint of Cross-Complainant Elliot Lander. The demurrer was filed in response to the claims of breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duties, fraud and deceit, constructive fraud, intentional interference with advantageous business relationships, conspiracy, declaratory relief, implied indemnity, comparative indemnity, and specific equitable indemnity.

The Judge rejects the statute of limitations argument put forth by Cross-Defendant, finding that the claims are not time-barred. The Judge also finds that the intentional interference with advantageous business relationships claim is distinguishable from existing opinions and allows the declaratory relief claim.

The dispute centers around the allegations of improper withholding of rent payments and the breach of fiduciary duties and fraud by Cross-Defendant. The Judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to sustain the claims and overrules the demurrer. The Judge also finds that the claims are not duplicative and that declaratory relief is appropriate in this case.
