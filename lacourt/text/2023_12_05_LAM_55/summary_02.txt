And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motions to compel further responses and a deposition. With regard to the motion to compel further responses, the judge has granted the motion in part, as to document requests 16, 20, 27, and 29, and as to sanctions. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve further responses and produce documents without unsupported objections and in full compliance with the California Discovery Act.

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses as to requests 5-7, 9-15, 17-19, 21-26, 28, and 30, as the objections to these requests are not well-founded. The judge has also denied the motion to compel further responses as to sanctions because each side has partial substantial justification.

With regard to the motion to compel a deposition, the judge has granted the motion and imposed sanctions of $1,625 against the plaintiff. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to produce Jeet Jogani, a managerial employee of JK Residential Inc., for a telephonic deposition. The judge has denied the motion as to monetary sanctions because each side has partial substantial justification.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has not fully complied with discovery requests and has failed to meet and confer with the other party. The judge has emphasized that monetary sanctions are mandatory as to parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification or other injustice.
