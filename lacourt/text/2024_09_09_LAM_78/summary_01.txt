Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the third, fifth, and sixth causes of action with 15 days' leave to amend, and grants the motion to strike punitive damages and attorney fees. The ruling finds that the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) fails to allege sufficient facts to establish liability against 1Sharpe, and that the generic allegations in the SAC are insufficient to provide notice of facts showing 1Sharpe's alleged culpability. The court also finds that the parties failed to meet their burden to show how the complaint can be amended to change the legal effect of the pleading due to the lack of opposition.
