Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied without prejudice a motion to substitute Matthew Thompson as the personal representative of the plaintiff, Jesse Lauricella, who passed away. The motion was filed by the plaintiff's counsel, but no affidavit or declaration was filed by Thompson to satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. The judge ordered the plaintiff's counsel to file a supplemental declaration, but this was not done by the deadline. As a result, the motion is denied, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If no agreement is reached, the parties should submit to the court or appear at the hearing to argue their positions.
