[TENTATIVE]
  GRANTING APPLICATION FOR SALE OF DWELLING



 
I.
        BACKGROUND
On February 9, 2024, applicant Jiangmen Haoyin Trading Co
LTD (“Plaintiff” or “Judgment Creditor”) makes this application for an order
permitting the sale of real property commonly known as 507 Peckam Drive, La
Puente, California 91746 (the “Peckam Property”).
            This is Plaintiff’s second
application for an order permitting sale of the Peckam Property. The first
application, filed on March 23, 2023, was denied without prejudice.
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant renewed
application for order of sale of dwelling. On April 19, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to specially set an Order to Show Cause
Re: Why Order For Sale Of Dwelling Should Not Be Made, and set the hearing date
for July 23, 2024. (Min. Order, April 19, 2024.)
On July 1, 2024, judgment debtor Yan Leung (“Leung”) and Mei
Ling Huang (“Huang”) (collectively, “Respondents”) filed an opposition to the
application for order of sale of dwelling.
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed its reply.
On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Errata
regarding its request for judicial notice regarding Exhibits 5 through 11.
On July 18, 2024, Respondents filed two additional
declarations regarding their recent utility bills for the Packam Property.
On July 23, 2024, the Court continued the hearing due the
court-wide ransomware attack.
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed proofs of service on the
defendants.
On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental reply and
3 supporting declarations.
The Court declines to consider any documents filed on August
12 and August 30. The Court cannot continue to consider additional documents ad
infinitum simply because the Court was unable to conduct the hearing due to the
ransomware issue.
 
A.    Moving
Argument
Plaintiff declares that it obtained a judgment against
judgment debtor Leung and others on December 15, 2017 in the amount of
$121,490.98 in Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. BC650004. (Wu Decl. ¶
3; Exh. A.)  An abstract of Judgment was
recorded with the Los Angeles Recorder’s Office on August 20, 2018 creating a
judgment lien on the Peckam Property. (Id. ¶ 4; Exh. B.) As of December
13, 2023, the total outstanding balance on the Judgment is $194,445.98. (Id.
¶ 5.) On February 7, 2024, through the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Department, Plaintiff levied upon Leung’s interest in the Peckam Property. (Id.
¶ 7.) Prior to filing the instant Application, Plaintiff requested that Stewart
Title Company issue a Litigation Guarantee pertaining to the Peckam Property. (Id.
¶8; Exh. E.) The December 18, 2018 Grant Deed reflects that the property was
owned by Respondents as joint tenants. (Id. ¶ 9; Exh. F.) Wu declares
that there is no disabled veteran’s exemption for the property, that the
Litigation Guarantee reflects no exemptions recorded or filed for the property,
that the property is not a homestead and that there is no homestead exemption,
and no homestead declaration was recorded by Leung or a joint tenant for the
Peckam Property. (Id. ¶10-13.) Plaintiff proffers the declaration of
real estate appraiser Chad Harris in support of the fair market value of the
Peckam Property.
B.    Opposing
Argument
Respondents contend that Plaintiff incorrectly states that
the Peckam Property is not subject to a homestead. In support thereof,
Respondents provide certified copies of the recorded Homestead Declarations
filed for Leung (Young Decl. ¶ 2; Exh. A) and for Huang (Id.; Exh. B.).
Respondents further declare that they have continuously lived in the property
since December 2019; notably, the referenced exhibits purportedly supporting
their residence on the Peckam Property were not attached. Additionally, Respondents
argue they are entitled to an automatic homestead, and that the homestead
exemption is $600,000.
C.    Reply
Argument
Plaintiff addresses the points raised in Respondents’
opposition. Plaintiff argues the paper trail supports that no homestead
exemption exists, whether declared or automatic, because Plaintiff obtained
judgment against Leung on December 15, 2017, and recorded the Abstract of
Judgment with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on August 20, 2018. Additionally,
Plaintiff contends that Respondents are not insolvent, and that the sale would
produce a bid to satisfy the lien amounts due.
 
II.        REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
A.    Plaintiff’s
Request
Plaintiff requests the Court take judicial notice of
Exhibits 5-9 and 11, consisting of: (1) Conformed Copy of the Default Judgment
issued by the Los Angeles County Superior Court, dated Dec. 15, 2017, (2) the
Abstract of Judgment recorded with the LA County Recorder’s office on August
20, 2018, (3) The Grant Deed of the Real Property located at 507 Peckam Dr, La
Puente, CA, (4) The Grant Deed of the Real Property located at 7027 Clearwater
Ave., Las Vegas, NV, (5) The Deed of Trust of the Real
Property located at 7027 Clearwater Ave., Las Vegas, NV, and (6) The Grant,
Bargain and Sale Deed of Meiling Huang’s Real Property located at 4110
Sanderling Circle, Las Vegas, NV.
The requests are GRANTED. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d), (h).) The
court “may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the
date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction
reflected in a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative
language….  From this, the court may deduce
and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is
clear from its face.” (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 256, 265, disapproved on other grounds by Yvanova v. New Century
Mortg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 939.)
B.    Respondents’
Request
Respondents request the Court take judicial notice of: (1) a
certified copy of the recorded Homestead Declaration for Leung, (2) a certified
copy of the recorded Homestead Declaration for Huang, and (3) data from Redfin,
the California Association of Realtor, the National Association of Realtors and
RocketHomes. 
Requests 1 and 2 are GRANTED. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(h).) Request
3 is DENIED.
 
III.      EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
A.    Plaintiff’s
Objections
Plaintiff objects to Respondents’ declarations: objections
1-2. Objections 1-2 are sustained.
Plaintiff objects to the opposition claiming a $600,000
homestead exemption. Objection 3 is overruled. Plaintiff agrees that there is a
difference between a homestead declaration v. an automatic homestead. Cal. Civ.
Proc. Code § 704.730 applies specifically to a “homestead declaration”, and
there is no authority demonstrating that the amount for an automatic homestead
is similarly limited to a prior enacted amendment to Section 704.730.
Plaintiff objects to Young’s objection to “Iniguez
Declaration.” The objection is overruled. Indeed, there is no “Iniguez
Declaration”, but it is clear to this Court that Respondents intended to refer
to Declaration of Sam Wu (“Wu”), and that “Iniguez” is a typographical error. 
B.    Respondents’
Objections
Respondents object to the declaration of “Iniquez” [sic]: Objections
1 and 2 are overruled, and objection 3 is sustained.
 
III.      LEGAL
STANDARD
A.    Application
For Sale of Dwelling
            A court order of sale is required to
conduct a sale of a real property dwelling owned and resided in by a natural
person judgment debtor. The “dwelling” may be an individual debtor's house,
condominium, planned development or mobilehome affixed to land. (CCP §
704.740(a); Wells Fargo Fin'l Leasing, Inc. v. D & M Cabinets (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 59, 77–78 [“The statute thus clearly and unambiguously makes a
section 704.740 order a requirement for sale of a dwelling subject to a
homestead exemption, without differentiation between a sale by a sheriff and a
sale by a receiver”].)
            An application for sale of the
dwelling under CCP §704.740 must first be brought in accordance with CCP
§704.760. The application shall be made under oath, shall describe the
dwelling, and shall contain all of the following:
“(a) A statement whether or not the
records of the county tax assessor indicate that there is a current homeowner's
exemption or disabled veteran's exemption for the dwelling and the person or
persons who claimed any such exemption.
(b) A statement, which may be based
on information and belief, whether the dwelling is a homestead and the amount
of the homestead exemption, if any, and a statement whether or not the records
of the county recorder indicate that a homestead declaration under Article 5
(commencing with Section 704.910) that describes the dwelling has been recorded
by the judgment debtor or the spouse of the judgment debtor.
(c) A statement of the amount of any
liens or encumbrances on the dwelling, the name of each person having a lien or
encumbrance on the dwelling, and the address of such person used by the county
recorder for the return of the instrument creating such person's lien or
encumbrance after recording.
(d) A statement that the judgment is
based on a consumer debt, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 699.730, or
that the judgment is not based on a consumer debt, and if the judgment is based
on a consumer debt, whether the judgment is based on a consumer debt that was
secured by the debtor's principal place of residence at the time it was
incurred or a statement indicating which of the exemptions listed in
subdivision (b) of Section 699.730 are applicable. If the statement indicates
that paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) is applicable, the statement shall also
provide the dollar amount of the original judgment on which the lien is based.
If there is more than one basis, the statement shall indicate all bases that
are applicable.”
(CCP
§ 704.760.)
B.    Post-Application
For Sale of Dwelling
After the application is filed, the court must do the
following: (1) set a hearing date no later than 45 days after the application
is filed (unless a showing of good cause is made for a later date) and (2)
issue an order requiring the judgment debtor to appear and show cause (OSC) why
an order for sale should not be made in accordance with the judgment creditor's
application. (CCP §704.770(a).)
At least 30 days before the hearing, the judgment creditor
must serve the judgment debtor with copies of the OSC, application for order of
sale and the official notice of hearing form. 
(CCP § 704.770(b)(1).) Service may be made personally or by mail. (Ibid.)
The creditor must also personally serve the above documents on an occupant of
the dwelling; or, if there is no occupant present when service is attempted,
must post the documents in a conspicuous place at the dwelling. (CCP §
704.770(b)(2).)
            At the OSC, the Court must determine
whether a homestead exemption applies under CCP §704.780. Where Judgment
Creditor’s application sets forth an amount of exemption, the burden is on
Judgment Debtor to establish the inapplicability of that exemption amount. (See
CCP §704.780(a)(2).)
The Court must then make a determination as to (1) whether
the property is exempt; (2) if so, the amount of the exemption and the FMV of
the property. (See CCP §704.780(b).) “The court shall make an order for sale of
the dwelling subject to the homestead exemption, unless the court determines
that the sale of the dwelling would not be likely to produce a bid sufficient
to satisfy any part of the amount due on the judgment pursuant to Section
704.800.” (CCP §704.780(b).)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
The following information undisputed. Plaintiff filed the
Abstract of Judgment with the Los Angeles Recorder’s Office on August 20, 2018.
(Plf. Jud. Notice, Exh. 6.) Based on the Grant Deed, ownership of the subject
property was transferred to Respondents on December 18, 2019. (Plf. Jud.
Notice, Exh. 7.) Respondents each individually filed a homestead declaration
with the Los Angeles County Recorder on April 4, 2023. (Respondents’ Jud.
Notice Exhs. A & B.)
A.    Declared
Homestead
There is a distinction between a declared homestead and
automatic homestead. (Webb v. Trippet (1991) 235 Cal. App. 3d 647, 651.)
A declaration of homestead affords greater protections, provided that it was
recorded prior to the abstract of judgment. “The homestead exemption itself
does not have any effect on the liens created voluntarily by the property
owners, nor does it have any effect on the claims of creditors secured by liens
that have priority over the declaration of homestead.” (Title Tr. Deed Serv.
Co. v. Pearson (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 168, 174. (Title Tr.)) In
reference to Smith v. James A. Merrill, Inc. (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th 94,
“a recorded abstract of a money judgment creates a lien that attaches to all
interests in the property that are subject to the enforcement of money
judgments—except when a declaration of homestead has been recorded on the
property before the abstract of judgment is recorded." (Title Tr.,
132
Cal. App. 4th at 176.)
The Court finds that Respondents’ are not entitled to the
benefits of a homestead exemption for the Peckam Property based on the belated
homestead declarations filed over three years after Plaintiff filed its
Abstract of Judgment in Los Angeles County.
B.    Automatic
Homestead
Respondents declare that they resided in the Peckam Property
since December 2019 and that it is their principal place of residence. (Decls.
Leung and Huang, ¶2.) Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s criticism regarding
Responents’ lack of proof of residency, “ “The automatic homestead exemption is
available when a party has continuously resided in a dwelling from
the time that a creditors' lien attaches until a court's determination in
the forced sale process that the exemption does not apply." [Citations]."
(Amin v. Khazindar (2003) 112 Cal. App. 4th 582, 588 [emphasis added];
see also CCP § 704.710(c).) Here, Respondents did not acquire or live in the
property until December 2019, years after judgment was entered and after the
abstract was recorded. "[T]he legislative history of section 704.710
clearly indicates that it does not allow a homestead exemption on property
acquired by the debtor after the judgment has been recorded unless it was
purchased with exempt proceeds from the sale, damage or destruction of a
homestead within the six-month safe harbor period." (SBAM Partners, LLC
v. Cheng Miin Wang (2008) 164 Cal. App. 4th 903, 912–13.) Respondents’ most
recent brief declarations regarding their utility bills for gas, internet,
water, and trash services for the current year of 2024 are not relevant.
The Court finds that the Peckam Property is not exempt under
an automatic homestead.
C.    Fair
Market Value & Satisfaction of Liens
Plaintiff avers that the fair market value (“FMV”) of the
property is $692,000, and Respondents assert that the appraisal value is
$690,000. In sum, the parties are in agreement that the FMV is around $690,000.
In terms of Plaintiff’s request, there is no reason or this Court to appoint a
qualified appraiser to assist in determining the FMV when Plaintiff has
submitted the declaration of its appraiser, and Respondents’ asserted amount is
practically the same. It is also undisputed that there is $441,600 in senior or
priority claims, and that Plaintiff’s judgment is in the amount of $121,490.98.
Considering the FMV is not subject to any exemption, the money from the sale
would satisfy all the priority leans ahead of Plaintiff’s and be more than
enough to satisfy Plaintiff’s judgment lien.
Lastly, as Plaintiff avers, "The policy behind this
homestead exemption was to ensure that insolvent debtors and their families
should not be rendered homeless by virtue of a forced sale of their residential
property." (Webb v. Trippet (1991) 235 Cal. App. 3d 647, 650.) Aside
from the Peckam Property, Respondents have other assets such as ownership of two
real properties in Nevada (Plf. Judicial Notice, Exhs. 8-9, 11) The Court finds
no reason to not issue an order to sell the dwelling per CCP §704.780. 
 
V. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s application for an order
permitting the sale of dwelling is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
