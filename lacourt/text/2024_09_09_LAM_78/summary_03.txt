And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition of Elsie I. Wynn, a defendant in the case. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Blair Cobb and Adam Eatroff, who sought to depose Wynn regarding damages arising from the construction and destruction of a stone retaining wall. The judge denied the defendants' motion for a protective order, which sought to prevent Wynn's deposition on grounds that she has dementia and could not provide a deposition.

The judge found that there was no medical evidence establishing Wynn's incompetency, and that the defendants' objection to the deposition was not valid. The judge also noted that Wynn's counsel had continued to assert her dementia without providing evidence, and that the plaintiffs had offered to take her deposition at her home to make it more comfortable for her.

The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer on a date, time, and location most convenient to conduct Wynn's deposition. If Wynn's counsel does not participate in the meet and confer discussion, then the plaintiffs may unilaterally notice Wynn's deposition and Wynn is ordered to appear for deposition at a date, time, and location at the plaintiffs' election.

The judge also awarded monetary sanctions to the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,200.00, which includes attorney fees for the moving papers and reply, and for appearing at the hearing. The sanctions are imposed against Wynn and her counsel, jointly and severally.
