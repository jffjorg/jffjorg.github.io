And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has considered the application for an order permitting the sale of the dwelling at 507 Peckam Drive, La Puente, California, and has issued a tentative ruling granting the application.

**Background**

The plaintiff, Jiangmen Haoyin Trading Co Ltd, obtained a judgment against the defendants, Yan Leung and Mei Ling Huang, on December 15, 2017, in the amount of $121,490.98. The plaintiff recorded the abstract of judgment with the Los Angeles Recorder's Office on August 20, 2018. The defendants filed homestead declarations on April 4, 2023, and have been residing in the dwelling since December 2019.

**Arguments**

The plaintiff argues that the dwelling is not exempt from sale due to homestead exemption, as the defendants' homestead declarations were filed after the abstract of judgment was recorded. The defendants argue that they are entitled to an automatic homestead exemption, as they have continuously resided in the dwelling since December 2019.

**Conclusion**

The Court finds that the dwelling is not exempt from sale due to homestead exemption, as the defendants' homestead declarations were filed after the abstract of judgment was recorded. The Court also finds that the sale of the dwelling would satisfy the judgment lien, as the fair market value of the property is $692,000, and the outstanding balance on the judgment is $194,445.98. The Court grants the application for an order permitting the sale of the dwelling.

**Next Steps**

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. The party must also include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
