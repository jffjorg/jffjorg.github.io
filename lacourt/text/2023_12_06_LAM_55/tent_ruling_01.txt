  Case Number:  23STCV01492    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Decron
Properties Corporation to Compel Plaintiff Kelly Maadarani’s Further
Responses to Form interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Monetary Sanctions in
the Amount of $1,460.00;  Motion Thereof
to Compel Plaintiff Ali Maadarani’s Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,460.00.
 
On 1/24/23, plaintiffs, self-represented litigants,
filed a Complaint alleging that they leased a residence at 1518 Patricia Ave.,
in Simi Valley, where there was leaking plumbing causing mold, and there were
other uninhabitable conditions.  
DECRON PROPERTIES CORPORATION  (“Defendant”) filed a motion to compel
further responses, as to each Plaintiff, regarding form interrogatory numbers 2.2;
2.6; 2.7; 4.1; 6.2-6.5; 6.7; 7.1-7.3; 11.1-11.2; and 14.1-14.2.  Additionally, Defendant requests $1,460.00 in
sanctions as to each similar motion. 
Grounds for the motions include that each Plaintiff responded to the
majority of form interrogatories with incomplete responses and meritless
objections.
The reply filed 11/29/23 states that the motions are
moot as to ALI MAADARANI who served supplements, except as to requiring
verification and sanctions.  The reply
makes reference to an opposition by ALI MAADARANI, however, no such opposition
was filed. As to KELLY MAADARANI, the reply states that no supplemental
responses and opposition have been filed.
After reading the separate statements, the Court
readily agrees with Defendant that the plaintiffs’ responses are not in
compliance with the California Discovery Act. 
The responses state inapplicable objections, provide partial or very evasive
answers, and reveal that reasonable efforts to obtain information were not made
before responding.  The Court therefore
grants both motions and orders as follows:
On or before 1/8/24, Plaintiff
KELLY MAADARANI shall serve further responses, without objections, and in full
compliance with the California Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq., as to all
form interrogatories addressed in Defendant’s separate statements.
On or before 1/8/24,
Plaintiff ALI MAADARANI shall serve further responses that are verified, as to
all form interrogatories addressed in Defendant’s separate statements.
On or before that same
date, plaintiffs jointly and severally shall pay discovery sanctions in the
total sum of $1460.00 to Defendant and Cross-Complainant Decron Properties
Corporation, the Court finding the absence of substantial justification.    E.g., CCP   § 2023.030.
