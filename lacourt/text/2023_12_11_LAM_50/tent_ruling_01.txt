TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 




AND RELATED
  CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Michael
Y. Lavaee, Esq. of Lavaee Law Group (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
for Defendants and Cross-Complainants Samuel Ohana and Tamim, LLC.  
The Court finds that Counsel has complied
with the relevant procedural requirements (CRC 3.1362) and has provided
sufficient reason for withdrawal. Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.¿ 
The Court notes that on November 21, 2023,
after the instant motion was filed, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, that “[a]ll
trial related dates are advanced and vacated.” In addition, it appears that hearings on a
motion to sever set for December 22, 2023 and a motion for attorney’s fees set
for August 5, 2024 were scheduled after the instant motion was filed. Thus, the
Court orders Counsel to file and serve a revised proposed order specifying the
hearing dates scheduled in the action within two days of this order.¿
