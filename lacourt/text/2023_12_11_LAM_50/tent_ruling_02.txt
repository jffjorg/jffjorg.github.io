TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Midway Rent a Car, Inc., a California Corporation dba Midway Fleet Leasing dba
Midway Leasing dba Midway HFCA LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Jennifer Timario aka Jennifer Enriquez in the total
amount of $83,700.22, comprising $77,935.05 in damages, $2,818.47 in interest,
$498.00 in costs, and $2,448.70 in attorney’s fees.
The
Court notes one defect with the submitted default judgment package. 
Plaintiff
submits the Declaration of Kevin Hy in support of the request. Mr. Hy asserts
that “Plaintiff is entitled to Attorney Fees in the amount of $2,448.70 per
Exhibit 5 & 6 @ par. 11 ‘…the prevailing party is entitled to all costs and
[sic] incurred in the action, including attorney fees...’” (Hy Decl., ¶ 9, emphasis
omitted.) The Court notes that it is unable to locate this language in Exhibits
5 or 6 attached to the Hy Declaration. Plaintiff does not appear to cite any
additional contractual provision purportedly authorizing attorney’s fees
here.  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. Plaintiff to arrange schedule for resubmission of the
default judgment package.
