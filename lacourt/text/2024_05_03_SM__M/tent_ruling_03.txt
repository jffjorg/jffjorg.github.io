MOTION:                  Motion
to Quash by Defendant Changshuan Wang
HEARING DATE:   5/3/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 

“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .” (CCP § 418.10(a).) A court lacks
jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
“When a motion to quash is properly brought,
the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)  The plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did
give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868;
see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].)  
 
              “[C]ompliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies
with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at
1441-1442.) 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Plaintiff’s objections are SUSTAINED as to no. 3 (legal
conclusion) and OVERRULED as to the remainder. The overruled objections go to
the weight of the evidence, not admissibility. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code § 452(c), (d), (h).)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Shenshuan Wang moves to
quash service of the summons and complaint in this action. According to the
verified proof of service on file, a registered process server affected substituted
service on Wang at his usual place of abode, 1902 Canopy Ln., La Verne,
California, via a co-occupant, Shuan Li, on February 29, 2024.
 
Wang attacks this proof of service
because he claims to not reside at that property for a “significant period of
time,” or in the United States. (Wang Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Wang claims that he
“entered” the People’s Republic of China and intends to reside there
permanently. He claims that the address is not his usual abode, place of
business or mailing address. (¶ 7.) He claims that he does not have any such
address in the United States “since December 6, 2023.” (Id.) He cites an online
printout entitled “Entry and Exit Record Query Results” which shows that he
entered the PRC at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport on December 6, 2023. Even if
admissible, this evidence is of little weight. It merely purports to demonstrate
that he entered the PRC. In any case, this self-serving and conclusory evidence
is insufficient to dispute the facially proper service. 
 
Moreover, Plaintiff provides ample
evidence for the Court to conclude that the La Verne address is Wang’s usual abode,
place of business and/or mailing address. Plaintiff presents a 2015 deed of
trust identifying Defendant ChangShuan Wang as Trustor, Trustee, and
Beneficiary of 1902 Canopy Ln., La Verne, CA 91750. (Lee Decl., RJN Ex. 3-5.) In
2019, Defendant 2127 LLC filed a statement of information showing the Canopy
address as the designated office in California, initial mailing address, and
for Wang as the agent of service of process. Defendant provides no
contradictory information, aside from the bare conclusion that he has never
resided at the property or in the United States. Notably, Wang does not deny
working from that address. 
 
In reply, Defendant raises the
Hague Convention for the first time. As he did not raise this issue in the
moving papers, the Court cannot grant the motion on this basis. Wang waived the
issue by not raising it in his moving papers. Moreover, Defendant has not
demonstrated that he is a citizen of China. Wang specifically declares that he
“entered” the PRC, and never states his citizenship status either way. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
