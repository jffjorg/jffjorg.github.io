Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Changshuan Wang, has moved to quash the service of summons and complaint in this action. Wang claims that he does not reside at the address listed in the proof of service and that he has not resided in the United States since December 6, 2023. However, the plaintiff presents evidence showing that the address is Wang's usual abode, place of business, and/or mailing address. Wang also claims to have entered the People's Republic of China and intends to reside there permanently. However, this evidence is of little weight and insufficient to dispute the facially proper service. The court denies the motion to quash, finding that the plaintiff has established the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.
