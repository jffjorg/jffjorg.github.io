Large, et al.
CASE NO.:                SC129711
MOTION:                  Motion
to enter judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 
HEARING DATE:   5/3/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.
 
(CCP, § 664.6(a).)
 
“Because of its summary nature,
strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to
invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.” (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37; Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262.)
In ruling on a motion under § 664.6, the trial judge may receive oral
testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Corkland v.
Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the agreement was reached at
a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on the basis of its own
notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as any transcripts of the
proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Amag Inc. moves for the
court to enter a stipulated judgment against Defendants Corey Large and 308
Enterprises LLC in the amount of $784,121.66 ($944,121.66, less payments made
by or on behalf of Defendants since April 29, 2023). Defendants only oppose the
request for prejudgment interest. Plaintiff have abandoned their request for
prejudgment interest and thus, the motion is unopposed.
 
On April 29, 2023, a settlement agreement
and general release was entered into between the parties. (Frecek Decl., Ex.
1.) Under the agreement, Defendants were to pay as follows: (1) $10,000 payable
within 10 days of execution of the Settlement Agreement; (2) $150,000 payable
within 60 days of execution of the Settlement Agreement, plus accrued interest
at 6% per annum during that 60 day period (i.e. $6,164.38); (3) the remaining
$465,000 payable in installments every 90 days thereafter in the amount of
$50,000 (plus the 6% per annum accrued interest that had accrued during the
previous 90 days) until the remaining $465,000 balance is paid in full. (Id.,
¶¶ D-F.) Paragraph G of the Settlement Agreement, and the “[Proposed] Judgment
and Order Pursuant to Stipulation” attached as Exhibit A to the Settlement
Agreement provide that in the event of failure of the Defendants to timely make
any of the installment payments described above, AMAG, INC. was entitled to a
stipulated judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $944,121.66 (as of
May 1, 2023), less credits for any amounts paid by Defendants after May 1,
2023.
Defendants have breached the
settlement agreement. Defendants have only paid the initial $10,000 payment and
the $150,000 payment due within 60 days of execution of the Settlement
Agreement. Defendants have failed to pay any other installments or any accrued
interest on any installments. (Frecek Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) 
 
The parties present a signed writing,
stipulating for judgment in the case of default, specifically citing Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6. Defendants have defaulted by not paying in
accordance with the terms of the settlement. Plaintiff therefore shows the
requirements to enter judgment. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
 Prejudgment interest will not be
awarded.
