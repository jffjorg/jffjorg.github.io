Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on October 7, 2024, regarding the motion to quash an amended deposition subpoena filed by defendants RWF Holdings, Inc., Meir Levin, and Mark Mintz. The defendants sought to quash the subpoena, which was issued to U.S. Bank National Association by plaintiff Simon Property Group, L.P. The court agreed that a separate statement was not required, as no response was served. The court also found that document demands numbers 1 and 2 were overbroad as to time and limited the demands to the time period of August 1, 2021, to the present. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion, modifying the deposition subpoena to request production of documents specified in document demands numbers 1 and 2 from August 1, 2021, to the present. The court ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling.
