[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion to quash amended
  deposition subpoena
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants RWF Holdings, Inc.,
Meir Levin, and Mark Mintz  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Simon Property Group, L.P.
Motion to Quash Amended Deposition Subpoena 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants RWF Holdings, Inc., Meir Levin, and Mark Mintz
(“Defendants”) move the court for an order quashing the Deposition Subpoena for
the Production of Business Records issued to U.S. Bank National Association by
plaintiff Simon Property Group, L.P. (“Plaintiff”) or, in the alternative, issuing
a protective order.  (Weiss Decl., Ex. 1
to Ex. D, Subpoena.)
As a threshold matter, the court notes, as Plaintiff has raised, that
Defendants did not file a separate statement. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(5) [“The motions that require
a separate statement include a motion: [¶¶] (5) To compel or to quash the
production of documents or tangible things at a deposition”].)  In reply, Defendants contend that no separate
statement was required because no responses were served.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345, subd. (b)(1)
[a separate statement is not required “[w]hen no response has been provided to
the request for discovery”].)  The court agrees.  Moreover, even if a separate statement were
required, Plaintiff has not shown that it has been prejudiced by Defendants’
failure to file a separate statement. 
The court finds that document demands numbers 1 and 2 are overbroad as
to time and therefore limits the demands to the time period of August 1, 2021 (i.e.,
one year before the subject transfer is alleged to have taken place) to the
present.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1; Weiss
Decl., Ex. 1 to Ex. D, Subpoena, Attachment 3, ¶¶ C [defining relevant time
period], 1-2; Compl., ¶ 38, subd. (f).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part and denies
in part defendants RWF Holdings, Inc., Meir Levin, and Mark Mintz’s motion to
quash amended deposition subpoena for production of business records as
follows. 
            The court orders that the Deposition
Subpoena for the Production of Business Records issued to U.S. Bank National
Association is modified to request the production of documents specified in
document demands numbers 1 and 2 from the time period of August 1, 2021, to the
present. 
            The court orders defendants RWF
Holdings, Inc., Meir Levin, and Mark Mintz to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
