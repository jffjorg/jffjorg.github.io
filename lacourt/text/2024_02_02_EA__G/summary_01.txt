English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the judge in a case involving employment discrimination claims by Allison Oliver against Mt. San Antonio Community College District (Mt. SAC). The judge has sustained Mt. SAC's demurrer to Oliver's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend, meaning that Oliver will not be able to add any new claims to her lawsuit. Additionally, the judge has deemed Mt. SAC's motion to strike portions of Oliver's First Amended Complaint moot. The judge's decision is based on the fact that Oliver failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing her lawsuit, specifically by not seeking judicial review of the arbitrator's decision regarding her tenure denial. The judge has applied the principles of exhaustion of judicial remedies and issue preclusion to bar Oliver's claims.
