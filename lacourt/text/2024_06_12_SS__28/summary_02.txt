And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Hertz Corporation's motion to amend its answer to reflect its standing in the case, as Hertz is providing liability coverage to Defendant Jason Tanner, a citizen and resident of England. The judge also grants Hertz's motion to intervene on behalf of Defendant Jason Tanner to protect its interest in avoiding rulings against Tanner that would expose Hertz to liability.
