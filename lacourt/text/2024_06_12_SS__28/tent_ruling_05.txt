On
April 11, 2023, Brett Sutherlin and Karen Sutherlin filed an answer to Plaintiff’s
complaint and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Michael Feresten
(“Michael Feresten”) and Moes 1-10 for contribution, indemnity, declaratory

prejudice at the request of Brett Sutherlin and Karen Sutherlin. 
On December
5, 2023, Palisades, Academy, and Wamble filed a first amended answer to
Plaintiff’s complaint. 
On March
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
May 16, 2024, Petitioner Michael Feresten (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve
the compromise of Plaintiff’s action to be heard on June 12, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Michael Feresten asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action
of Plaintiff Jack Feresten. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition contains the following information about the proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $235,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $11,960.00
Reductions:                                                    $2,798.38
Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds:        $5,541.72
Attorney’s
fees:                                             $47,000.00
Non-medical
costs:                                        $13,421.15
Net
balance:                                                   $165,327.23
 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $11,960.00.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $2,798.38 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  This should
mean that $9,251.62 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition states
that only $5,541.72 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  As a result,
$3,709.90 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot grant a petition to approve
a minor’s compromise unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not
been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Section
12b(1) of the petition states that Petitioner paid $5,541.72 in medical
expenses.  This is also the amount listed
in Section 12a(4) as the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 14b(1) of the
petition states that Petition is requesting $9,251.62 in reimbursement.  Likewise, Section 16b states that $9,251.62
in medical expenses are to be paid from the settlement proceeds. 
However,
if the $9,251.62 reimbursement amount is paid to Petitioner out of the
settlement proceeds, it is not clear how the settlement will reimburse the additional
$3,709.90 owed to the ERISA self-funded plan (see Section 12b(2)). 
In
Section 12b(5)(b), Petitioner has not identified the medical service providers
or stated the amounts they charged, the amounts paid, negotiated reductions,
and amounts to be paid from the settlement proceeds.
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff
Jack Feresten’s action filed by Petitioner Michael Feresten on May 16, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
