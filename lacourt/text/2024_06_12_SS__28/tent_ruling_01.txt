PETITIONERS’ REQUEST 
Petitioners
Jennifer Corpuz and Walter Corpuz ask the Court to approve the compromise of
minor Plaintiff Joseph Corpuz’s claims against Defendants Kayla Chai and Hyun Chai. 
LEGAL STANDARD  “‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
Under
the proposed settlement, Defendant Kayla Chai and Hyun Chai (through their
insurance company) will pay minor Plaintiff Joseph Corpuz $1,000.00. The
petition states that Joseph Corpuz incurred no medical expenses and will
receive the full settlement amount. Plaintiffs’ counsel is not requesting
attorney’s fees or costs. 
Petitioners
ask that the net settlement amount of $1,000.00 be paid or delivered to Jennifer
Corpuz, 11042 Hayford Street, Norwalk, California 90650, under the conditions
specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402, without bond.  The Court grants the request. 
CONCLUSION
