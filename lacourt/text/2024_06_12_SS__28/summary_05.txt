And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jack Feresten's action. The petition includes information about the proposed settlement, including the gross settlement amount of $235,000.00, total medical expenses of $11,960.00, and reductions of $2,798.38. However, the court finds that the petition does not show that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Specifically, the court notes that the petition states that $5,541.72 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, but this is less than the total medical expenses of $11,960.00. The court also finds that the petition does not account for the additional $3,709.90 in medical expenses owed to the ERISA self-funded plan. Therefore, the court denies the petition without prejudice.
