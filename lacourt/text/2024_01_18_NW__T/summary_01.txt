And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer was sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the second and fourth causes of action, which allege elder abuse and unfair competition, respectively. The motion to strike was granted as to punitive and exemplary damages requested under the third cause of action for loss of consortium. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse were sufficient to rise above mere negligence, but insufficient to plead employer liability. The allegations of unfair competition were also found to be insufficient. The judge noted that the plaintiff's first amended complaint was uncertain and could be cured with additional pleading. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages was granted without leave to amend, as the claim of loss of consortium cannot be based on an elder abuse claim.
