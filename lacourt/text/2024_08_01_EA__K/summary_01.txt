And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants, Yeira Lisbeth Villa and Cuberto Munoz, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has found that the complaint was filed more than two years after the date of the motor vehicle accident, which is allegedly the cause of action. The plaintiff has conceded that the complaint was filed in excess of two years after the date of the incident. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to invoke tolling of the statute of limitations under California Code of Civil Procedure § 351. As a result, the demurrer has been sustained with leave given to amend.
