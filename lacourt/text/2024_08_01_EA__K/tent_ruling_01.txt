  Case Number:  24PSCV00253    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  K Defendants Yeira Lisbeth Villa
and Cuberto Munoz’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED, with
leave given to amend.
Background   
Plaintiff Henrietta E.
Anakwenze (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she sustained injury and damages in a
January 20, 2022 motor vehicle accident.
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting a cause of action against Yeira
Lisbeth Villa, Cuberto Munoz (together, “Defendants”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Motor Vehicle
A Case Management Conference and
continued hearing on the demurrer is set for August 1, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
Defendants demur, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to Plaintiff’s FAC on the basis that it fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and is uncertain. The matter
was continued on July 12, 2024 to August 1, 2024 to allow Defendants to file a
Supplemental Reply.
The demurrer is sustained, with leave given to amend.
Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s FAC is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations in Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1, because Plaintiff filed her
original complaint on January 24, 2024 and the date of injury alleged is
January 20, 2022. Indeed, “[a] complaint showing on its face the
cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations is subject to general
demurrer.” (Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano & Hatch v. Berwald (1999) 76
Cal.App.4th 990, 995.)
Plaintiff concedes that her complaint was filed in excess of
two years after the date of the incident on January 20, 2022. (Opposition, 2:5-8 [“The second
anniversary of the lawsuit fell on Saturday, By operation of the law, the
lawsuit was technically tolled to the Monday following the Saturday, January
22, 2024. The lawsuit was filed on January 24, 2024. . .”].)
“Where a complaint does not reveal on its face that it is
barred by the statute of limitations, a plaintiff has no obligation to plead
around the defense.”  (JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. v. Ward (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 678, 688.) It follows, then, that
a plaintiff is obligated to plead around the defense when the complaint reveals
on its face that it is time-barred.
Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations was tolled
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 351 (i.e., “[i]f, when the cause of
action accrues against a person, he is out of the State, the action may be
commenced within the term herein limited, after his return to the State, and
if, after the cause of action accrues, he departs from the State, the time of
his absence is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action”).
Defendants argue that section 351 was held unconstitutional as violative of the
commerce clause in Filet Menu, Inc. v. Cheng (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1276.
The Court, indeed, did hold that section 351 violated the Commerce Clause as
applied to a resident engaged in interstate commerce. (Id. at 1284). However,
the court did not foreclose the application of section 351 where the movement
of persons outside the state is “unrelated to the facilitation of interstate
commerce.” (Id.)
Plaintiff has alleged only that “defendants live out of state
and were not present in California at all times pertinent to the lawsuit.”
(FAC, ¶ MV-1; see also Id. [i.e., the allegation “Defendants out of
state”].) Nothing more has been alleged. The court does not believe that Plaintiff
has pled sufficient facts to invoke tolling pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 351.
