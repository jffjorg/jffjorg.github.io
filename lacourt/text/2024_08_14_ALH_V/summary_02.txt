And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by EcoSoft SPC Ltd for leave to file crossclaims against Archstone Distribution, LLC. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that EcoSoft has met the requirements for seeking leave to amend a pleading. The proposed amended cross-complaint seeks to add crossclaims for indemnification, contribution, and declaratory relief against Archstone, and removes Sentinel Insurance Company as a cross-defendant. The court grants the motion, finding that it is necessary for efficient adjudication and that the claims relate to the same issues and theories already at issue.
