And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion of EcoSoft SPC Ltd. for leave to file cross-claims against Archstone Distribution, LLC. EcoSoft seeks to add cross-claims for indemnification, contribution, and declaratory relief as to indemnification and contribution against Archstone. The court finds that EcoSoft has met the requirements for seeking leave to amend a pleading and grants the motion. The court also notes that the proposed amended cross-complaint removes Sentinel Insurance Company as a cross-defendant. The court's discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, and the proposed amended pleading must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading.
