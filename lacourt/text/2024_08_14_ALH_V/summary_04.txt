Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application for writ of possession filed by Financial Services Vehicle Trust (Plaintiff) against Gevorg Gevshenyan, Luxury Auto Rehab, and others (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks to repossess a 2022 BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupe, which was leased to Gevshenyan and is currently in the possession of Luxury. The court has found that the Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property. However, the court has denied the application for writ of possession because the information establishing the probable cause for the location of the vehicle is stale and no longer sufficient. The Plaintiff had previously demanded inspection and documents from Luxury, but they refused to respond. As a result, the court cannot issue a writ of possession or an order for transfer of possession to the Plaintiff.
