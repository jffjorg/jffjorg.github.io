And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Sylvia Santiago's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. The Judge orders Defendant to produce job descriptions for assignments Plaintiff occupied, and to produce policies related to employees and human resources. The Judge also awards sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $7,730.00, representing 11.8 hours of attorney work at $650 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.

The Judge's ruling is based on the Plaintiff's showing of good cause for the requests, and the Defendant's inadequate and incomplete responses to the requests. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated a need for further discovery to assess the basis for Defendant's conclusion that no further reassignment was possible due to Plaintiff's physical limitations.

The Judge also finds that the Defendant's objections to the requests were without merit or too general, and that the Defendant failed to justify its objections or provide a reasonable explanation for its failure to comply with the requests. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's motion is granted in part as to Requests No. 87-88, reinterpreted to seek only job descriptions for assignments Plaintiff occupied, and as to Request No. 89, reinterpreted to seek only policies related to employees and human resources. The Judge also grants the motion as to Requests No. 97-101.
