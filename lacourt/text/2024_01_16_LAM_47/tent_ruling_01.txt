DISCUSSION:
 
Specially Appearing Defendant Stylenquaza
LLC moves to quash service of the summons and complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction. 
 
Special Appearance 
 
No motion under Code of Civil Procedure 418.10 “shall be
deemed a general appearance by the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(d).)
Here, Specially Appearing Defendant (“Defendant”) brought this motion under
section 418.10. Thus, filing this motion does not constitute a general
appearance.  
 
Defendant’s
Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendant raises several evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Raphael Metzger in support of the opposition
to this motion. As this evidence is not material to the Court’s ruling on this
motion, the Court declines to address Defendant’s objections. 
 
Legal Standard
 
On a motion to quash service of the summons and
complaint, the moving party must first present some admissible evidence, such
as declarations or affidavits, to place the issue of minimum contacts before
the Court. (School Dist. of Oskaloosa County v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131.) “When a motion to quash is
properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish
the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 556, 568; see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].) Evidence of the facts giving rise to personal jurisdiction or
their absence may be in the form of declarations. (Arensen v. Raymond Lee
Organization, Inc. (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 991, 995.) The Court should
exclude evidence that would be inadmissible at trial. (See, e.g., Judd v.
Superior Court (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 38, 43-44 [Court of Appeal excluded
inadmissible hearsay evidence offered in support of affirmation of trial
court’s denial of motion to quash, and subsequently reversed the trial court’s
denial].) A non-resident defendant may be subject to either general or specific
jurisdiction. (See Elkman v. National States Insurance Co., supra, 173
Cal.App.4th at 1314.) 
 
General Jurisdiction
 
Defendant first contends that the Court lacks general
personal jurisdiction over them.
 
General jurisdiction exists when a defendant is domiciled
in the forum state or his activities there are substantial, continuous, and
systematic.  (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 782, 796.)  “In such circumstances, it is not necessary that
the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant’s business
relationship to the forum.”  (Id.) “The standard for
establishing general jurisdiction is ‘fairly high,’ [citation] and requires
that the defendant’s contacts be of the sort that approximate physical presence.”
(Elkman, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at 1315 (emphasis in original).) 
“Factors to be taken into consideration are whether the defendant makes sales,
solicits or engages in business in the state, serves the state’s markets,
designates an agent for service of process, holds a license, or is incorporated
there.” (Id.)
 
Plaintiffs concede that Defendant is not
subject to the general jurisdiction of this Court. Instead, Plaintiff claims
that the basis for the Court’s jurisdiction over Defendants is specific. 
 
Specific Jurisdiction
 
Defendant also contends that the Court lacks specific
personal jurisdiction over Styenquaza LLC.
 
“Where
general jurisdiction cannot be established, a court may assume specific
jurisdiction over a defendant in a particular case if the plaintiff shows the
defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits; [ie.]
the nonresident purposefully directed its activities at forum residents or
purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within
the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of local law. 
(Hanson v. Denckla (1958) 357 U.S. 235.)
 
Specific
jurisdiction involves a 3-part test in California.  California courts
adopt the same test as the test used by the court in Boschetto v.
Hansing (9th Cir.. 2008) 539 F.3d 1011,1016): (1) The nonresident
defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or
perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of
conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and
protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or
results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of
jurisdiction must be reasonable.” (Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen (9th
Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 [applying California law].).” (Jewish Defense
Organization, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (Rambam) (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.) Purposeful availment as defined by Boschetto requires
affirmative conduct promoting the transaction.  “To have purposefully
availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum, a defendant
must have ‘performed some type of affirmative conduct which allows or promotes
the transaction of business within the forum state.’” (Boschetto, 539
F.3d at 1016.) If the plaintiff satisfies the first two prongs of the test, the
burden shifts to the defendant to present a compelling case that the exercise
of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985)
471 U.S. 462, 476-78.)
 
1.     
Purposeful Availment or Direction
 
            The parties agree that the proper test for the case at
hand is whether Defendants purposefully directed their conduct at the forum
state. (See Schwarzenneger v. Fred Martin Motor Co. (9th Cir. 2004) 374
F.3d 797, 803.) “Purposeful direction” requires that the defendant has (1)
committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3)
causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum
state. (Id.) “The question is whether a defendant has followed a course
of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the
jurisdiction.” (J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro (2011) 564 U.S.
873, 884.) The proper inquiry is the nature and quality of the defendant’s
activity in the forum state, not the quantity. (As You Sow v. Crawford
Laboratories, Inc. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1859, 1870.) Minimum contacts may
be created via a non-resident’s use of telephone or email, and the Defendant
need not set foot in the forum state. (See Hall v. LaRonde (1997) 56
Cal.App.4th 1342, 1344.) However, “merely asserting that a defendant knew or
should have known that his intentional acts would cause harm in the forum state
is not enough to establish jurisdiction under the effect test.” (Pavlovich
v. Superior Court, (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 270.) The plaintiff must show
that California was the “focal point” of the tortious activity. (Burdick v.
Superior Court (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 8, 20.) 
 
Defendant contends that it
did not engage in a course of conduct that was directed at California or
purposefully availed itself of the benefits of California. To place the matter
at issue, Defendant offers a sworn declaration from its manager and part owner,
An Nguyen, as support for this position. Defendant states that it is a Texas
LLC with its principal place of business, main office, and registered agent in
Texas, doing business as “Vicostone USA” solely as a distributor of quartz
slabs supplied by Vicostone JSC, a Vietnamese quartz manufacturer. (Declaration
of An Nguyen ISO Mot. ¶ 3.) Defendant’s other owners are Hoang Anh Ho, a
citizen and resident of Vietnam, and Style Stone Joint Stock Company, a
Vietnamese corporation. (¶ 4.) Defendant principally does business in 24
states, none of which are California. (¶ 5.) However, Defendant concedes that
it distributed “insubstantial amounts” of pre-fabricated stone tops—which do
not require polishing—to California between 2018 and 2022, as well as 22 stone
slabs across six shipments during that period. (¶ 8.) Defendant avers that it
does not own property, market its products, maintain inventory or bank
accounts, pay taxes, or have offices or employees in California, nor has it
ever been licensed to do business in California. (¶¶ 13-21.) 
 
Defendant contends that
another named defendant in this action, Pental Grantie and Marble, LLC, is
responsible for distributing Vicostone-made products in California, and does so
entirely out of the control of Defendant. (Nguyen Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendant admits
that Pental occasionally purchases stone slabs from Defendant when Pental has
inventory shortages but does so “on very rare occasions” and “in very
insignificant amounts,” and in those instances, Defendant states that it has no
control over the distribution of those products. (¶ 7.) Defendant concedes that
Vicostone’s English-language website lists regional distributors in California,
but states that these distributors are affiliated with Pental, and that the
website is operated by Vicostone JCS, not Defendant. (Id. ¶ 21.) 
 
Defendant argues that these
contacts are too attenuated or insubstantial to establish purposeful availment.
The Court disagrees. Defendant admits that it explicitly and intentionally sold
products, including 22 stone slabs of exactly the type that is at issue in the
pleadings, to California. Contrary to Defendant’s assertions, this conduct is
not merely placing the products in the stream of commerce with knowledge that
the products might arrive in California, but rather a series of
transactions with the knowledge and purpose of conveying the products to
California. (See Jayone Foods Inc. v. Aekyung Indus. Co. (2019) 31
Cal.App.5th 543, 559.) Mr. Nguyen’s conclusory assertion that the fabricated
countertops were sold in “insubstantial” numbers has no evidentiary value and
does not suffice to place purposeful availment at issue. 
 
2. Claim Arising Out of
Defendants’ Activities
 
            Plaintiffs contend that the claims asserted against
Defendants arise out of the activities for which evidence is provided above.
After reviewing the essential allegations in the Complaint, the Court agrees.
Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of the sale of stone slabs in California which,
when polished or fabricated, emit toxic dust. (See Complaint ¶¶ 99-103.) Defendant’s
own papers provide evidence of the sale of these slabs. The burden now shifts
to Defendants to present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction
would be unreasonable.
 
3.     
Reasonableness of Exercise of Jurisdiction
 
            Defendant contends that the assertion of jurisdiction in
this matter over Defendant would be unreasonable. 
 
            If a plaintiff has satisfied their burden on a motion to
quash for lack of personal jurisdiction, the burden shifts to the moving party
to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (Burger
King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 476-78.) The moving party must
show that litigating the case in a foreign state would be “so gravely difficult
and inconvenient that it would put him at a severe disadvantage in comparison
to his opponent.” (Doe v. Damron (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 684, 693.) Mere
inconvenience is insufficient to defeat jurisdiction. (Id.) When
evaluating the reasonableness of the exercise of jurisdiction, courts commonly
balance several factors in making that determination, including (1) the extent
of the defendant’s purposeful interjection into the forum state; (2) the burden
on the defendant; (3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the
defendant’s state; (4) the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute;
(5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy; (6) the
importance of the forum to the plaintiff’s interests in convenient and
effective relief; and (7) the existence of an alternate forum. (See Core-Vent
Corp. v. Nobel Indus. (9th Cir. 1993) 11 F.3d 1482, 1488-89.) 
 
            Here, the evidence before the Court indicates that the
extent of the Defendant’s interjections into California consisted of the sale
of 22 stone slabs across 6 transactions between 2018 and 2022, plus an
unspecified number of prefabricated counter tops. (Nguyen Decl. ¶ 8.) Defendant
does not state the number of slabs sold to Pental, or whether it knew how many
of those slabs were destined for California. (See Id. ¶ 7.)  Defendant also argues that there would be a
substantial burden on Defendant to hear this case in California because all its
operations are based in Texas, rather than California, and it would be unduly
burdensome to require its owners to travel to California from either Texas or
Vietnam to appear in this state. Defendants offer no evidence establishing that
either individual owner traveling to California would be unduly burdensome, and
no authority establishing that out of state or international travel is an undue
burden per se. 
 
            Neither party addresses the extent of any conflict with
the sovereignty of the state of Texas, nor do they address California’s
interest in adjudication of this dispute, or the importance of the forum to
securing effective and convenient relief for Plaintiff. It is undisputed that
Texas courts would offer an alternative forum for this dispute. 
 
            In aggregate, Defendant offers very little in the way of
evidence or substantive argument supporting their position that the exercise of
jurisdiction by this Court would be gravely difficult or inconvenient for
Defendants. This is not sufficient to satisfy Defendant’s burden on this prong
of the determination of specific jurisdiction. The Court therefore does not
find good cause to quash service of the summons.

            Accordingly,
Specially Appearing Defendant Stylenquaza LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of the
Summons and Complaint is DENIED.
 
            Defendant
is deemed to have made a general appearance this date. 
 
            Defendant
is ordered to file a demurrer, answer, or other responsive pleading per code.
