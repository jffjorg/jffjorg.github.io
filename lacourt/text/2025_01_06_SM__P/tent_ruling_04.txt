Bella v. The Frizzelle Family Trust,
Case no. 24SMCV04236
Hearing date January 6, 2025
Defendants’
Motion to Compel Arbitration
Plaintiff
tenant Bella, in pro per, sues for breach of contract arising from alleged
habitability defects in a residential lease with landlord defendants. Defendants
move to compel arbitration based on the parties’ lease agreement, para. 56. Plaintiff
opposes. An unlawful detainer action based on Bella’s alleged failure to pay
rent is currently pending.
California
public policy strongly favors arbitration as an efficient alternative to
litigation. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1280 et seq., Madden v. Kaiser Found.
Hosps. (1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 706. A party waives its right to arbitrate
when it “substantially invokes” the litigation machinery before moving to
arbitrate, resulting in prejudice to the opposing party. Hoover v. American
Income Life Ins. Co. (2012) 20 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1204. Filing an answer
does not waive the right to seek arbitration. Christensen v. Dewor
Developments (1983) 33 Cal.3d 778, 782. Responding to discovery, rather
than propounding it, does not constitute invocation of the litigation
machinery. Davis v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th
205, 217. Unreasonable delay in moving to compel arbitration can lead to a
waiver of arbitration rights. Spear v. California State Auto Ass’n.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1035, 1043.
Para.
56 of the Lease entitled “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” states “any controversies or
disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement … will be submitted to
mediation….. If mediation is not successful the entire dispute or is
unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding
arbitration …” Decl. Camarillo exh. 1.
This
language is binding and enforceable. Plaintiff argues that by allegedly
breaching the terms of the lease, defendants waived their right to compel
arbitration. This is unavailing; arbitration clauses exist to govern the
parties’ conduct when the terms of an agreement have allegedly been breached.
Further, the court cannot consider the underlying merits of the claim when
considering whether to grant a motion to compel arbitration. See Code
Civ. Proc. Sec. 1281.2(d); California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v.
State of California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 198, 211. Whether defendants
breached goes to the merits of the underlying case. 
Plaintiff
argues defendants waived the rights to compel arbitration by failing to respond
to plaintiff's alleged 5/1/24 demand for arbitration. Defendants offer the
declarations of defendant and attorney Camarillo stating they never received such
demand. Decl. Camarillo para. 6. Plaintiff fails to offer analysis of the
factors establishing waiver set forth in Quach v. California Commerce Club,
Inc. (2024) 16 Cal.5th 562, 573. Plaintiff offers no declarations or
evidence other than exhibit A to the opposition, which references a draft
petition to compel arbitration but fails to include the actual draft. Plaintiff
fails to establish an unreasonable delay or otherwise conduct suggesting that the
right to enforce the arbitration provision is waived. 
Plaintiff
argues arbitration is improper because the alleged habitability breaches,
including mold, present serious health concerns and require court intervention,
citing Knight v. Hallsthammar (1981) 29 Cal.3d 46. This is unavailing,
as Knight primarily concerns jury instructions regarding habitability
and the duties of landlords. Id. Knight offers no basis for a
court to override a valid arbitration agreement. Id.
Plaintiff
failed to substantiate the arguments with evidence. Defendants established
existence of a valid binding arbitration agreement. The parties are to mediate,
either privately, or through the no-cost court Mediation Volunteer Panel (MVP)
program. If such is not successful, the parties are ordered to arbitration,
pursuant to para. 56 of the Lease. GRANTED.
