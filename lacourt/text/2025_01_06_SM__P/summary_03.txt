And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Melanie Gong, to file a second amended complaint and to stay the consideration of the defendants' pending demurrer. The plaintiff is seeking to add new allegations to the complaint and alleges that the defendants misrepresented their abilities and the potential risks and outcomes of procedures, resulting in the plaintiff's deprivation of informed consent. The defendants do not oppose the plaintiff's request to file the second amended complaint, but do oppose staying the consideration of the demurrer. The court finds that the plaintiff has complied with the applicable rules and that there is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's request to file the second amended complaint. If the court adopts this tentative ruling and the second amended complaint is filed, the demurrer to the first amended complaint will be moot.
