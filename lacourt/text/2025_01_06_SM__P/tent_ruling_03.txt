Gong v. Pincus, Case no. 24SMCV02093
Hearing date January 6, 2025
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint
Plaintiff
Melanie Gong, in pro per, sues defendants Stephen Pincus, M.D. Glenn
Vallecillos, M.D. and Hussam Antoin, Integrative Operating Theaters, Inc.,
alleging 13 causes of action, including fraud, misrepresentation, assault and
battery and medical malpractice. Plaintiff sought corrective and cosmetic
surgery following an automobile accident and alleges defendants induced to receive
procedures. Plaintiff alleges defendants misrepresented their abilities, the
potential risks, outcomes and details of the procedures, depriving plaintiff of
informed consent. Plaintiff filed the initial complaint 5/3/24 and first
amended 9/30/24. Plaintiff moves for leave to file a second amended complaint
and moves to stay consideration of defendants’ pending demurrer with motion to
strike to the FAC. Defendants do not oppose granting leave but oppose staying
the demurrer as procedurally unnecessary. 
CCP
§473(a)(1) states: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.” Courts have held “there
is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.” Mesler v.
Bragg Mgmt. Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296-97; see also Ventura v. ABM
Industries, Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 268) (“Trial courts are bound
to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint
at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial where the adverse
party will not be prejudiced.”)
Pursuant
to CRC 3.1324(a), a motion to amend must: (1) include a copy of the proposed
amended pleading; and (2) state what allegations are proposed to be deleted
from or added to the previous pleading. CRC 3.1324(b) requires a declaration
stating: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.
Plaintiff
filed her proposed SAC on 12/2/24. Decl. Gong para. 2. Plaintiff complied with CRC
3.1324 via her SAC and 12/9/24 declaration. Defendants do not oppose granting
leave. Leave is proper and granted. 
Regarding
plaintiff’s request to stay defendants’ pending demurrer, if the court adopts
its tentative, and the SAC is filed, the demurrer to the FAC is moot.
