And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Chun, has filed a demurrer to the defendant, Smith's, second amended cross-complaint. The defendant cross-complained for intentional tort arising from his arrest subsequent to an alleged assault, and also claimed intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the defendant's allegations fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The defendant's claims are based on the plaintiff's reports to law enforcement, which are protected by California Code of Civil Procedure section 47(2). The defendant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the plaintiff knowingly made false statements to the police. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
