Demurrer with Motion to Strike.
 
BACKGROUND  
            Plaintiff
Edward Melnick alleges that defendants RestoCrete, Inc (RestoCrete) and
Mauricio Marenco (Marenco) breached their contract and committed fraudulent
business practices. Plaintiff alleges six causes of action: (1) Breach of
Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3)
Violation of Business and Profession code section 17200; (4) Misrepresentation;
(5) Negligence; and (6) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
            Marenco
demurs to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action.
Marenco also moves to strike the complaint’s request for punitive damages and
pre- and post-judgment interest. 
 
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
            Marenco
demurs to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action on
the grounds that the complaint’s allegations fail to state sufficient facts and
are too uncertain to constitute a cause of action.
            Breach
of Contract – First Cause of Action
            The elements of breach of contract
are (1) existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendants’ breach (or anticipatory breach); and (4)
resulting damage.  (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y.
Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th
1171, 1178.)  Marenco alleges that there
is no contact between himself and Plaintiff. 

Plaintiff
alleges that RestoCrete entered into the written contract.  (FAC ¶ 12.) 
Plaintiff also alleges that RestoCrete is an alter ego to Marenco.  (FAC ¶ 5.) 
To allege alter-ego, Plaintiff needs
only allege ultimate facts.  (Rutherford
Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey et al. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 236
(citing Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550).) Plaintiff
alleges that Marenco was an “owner, agent, servant, employee, joint venture,
partner, subsidiary, and/or co-conspirator” of Restocrete.  (FAC, ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that Marenco is
a party to the contract, Marenco is listed as the “salesperson” on the attached
contract, and the contract is “reasonably susceptible” to an interpretation
where Marenco is a party.  Moreover, Plaintiff
also alleges in other causes of action that the contractual agreement was
between Plaintiff, RestoCrete and Marenco. 
(FAC ¶¶ 41, 61.) (Hervey v. Mercury Casualty Co. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 954, 964.) The Court overrules the demurrer to the First Cause of
Action.
            Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing – Second Cause of Action
The
elements of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are (1) the
existence of a contractual relationship; (2) an implied duty; (3) breach; and
(4) causation of damages.  (Smith v.
San Francisco (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d
38, 49.)  As with the first cause of
action, Marenco demurs on the grounds that Plaintiff fails to establish a
contract between the two parties. 
Additionally, Marenco demurs on the grounds that Plaintiff fails to
allege (1) that all conditions were met for performance and (2) that Marenco
unfairly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to receive the benefits of the
contract.  
            Plaintiff alleges that RestoCrete,
Marenco and Plaintiff entered into a contract to supply and install polished
concrete flooring, including a warranty that the floor would be free of
material defects.  (FAC, ¶ 10-11, 41,
61.) Plaintiff paid RestoCrete a portion upfront for the services, and made an
additional payment when services were complete. 
(FAC, ¶ 13-14.)  About six months
after installation, Plaintiff noticed defects. 
(FAC, ¶ 15-17.) An inspection discovered the cause of the defect was
“improper preparation, curing and/or water content in the mixture of materials
during installation.  (FAC, ¶ 18.)  After being notified of the breach of
contract, Marenco failed to remedy the defect. 
(FAC, ¶ 44.)  Marenco’s failure to
remedy the defect ripened into bad faith breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing when Defendants ignored the State Contractors Licensing
Board’s instruction that RestoCrete and Marenco repair the defect. (FAC, ¶ 21,
44.) Defendant suffered damages.  (FAC, ¶
26.)
            Plaintiff’s
allegations are sufficiently certain to allege a cause of action.  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges facts beyond
a simple breach of contract by alleging that Marenco failed to repair the
defect even after the State Contractors Licensing Board instructed him to make
the repairs.  (FAC, ¶ 44.)
            The
Court overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action. 
            Unfair
Competition Law – Third Cause of Action
There
are three prongs to Business and Professions Code section 17200.  Plaintiff alleges the unfair business
practices prong. The elements of an unfair business practice are (1) a business
practice, (2) that is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent, and (3) an authorized
remedy.  (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.)  
Plaintiff
alleges that (1) defendant failed to properly and professionally do the work
contracted for, failed to investigate the defective work, and failed to repair
or remedy the damaged flooring or refund Plaintiff’s payments.  (Complaint, ¶ 50.)  (2) Defendant’s failure was a pattern of
unfair and deceptive business practices rendered fraudulent by the empty
warranty.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 49, 51, 11, 44.)
The Court overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action.
            Misrepresentation
– Fourth Cause of Action
            The
elements of misrepresentation are (1) defendant’s assertion of an untrue fact;
(2) believed by plaintiff to be true; (3) defendant’s lack of reasonable
grounds for the belief; (4) defendant’s intent to induce plaintiff’s reliance
upon the representation; (5) plaintiff’s justifiable reliance upon the
representation; and (6) resulting damage. 
(Melican
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 168, 182.)  
            Plaintiff
pleads (1) Marenco asserted that Marenco and RestoCrete would provide quality
service and that the defects Plaintiff noticed were “normal and
temporary.”  (FAC, ¶ 55.)  Marenco and RestoCrete had warrantied the
work would be free of material defects. 
(FAC, ¶ 11.)  (2) Plaintiff
believed the misrepresentations.  (FAC, ¶
55.)  (3) Marenco was informed of the
defect in the installation process and continued to assert that the issue was
with Plaintiff.  (FAC, ¶ 19.)  (4) Marenco intended to induce Plaintiff to
pay for his services.  (FAC, ¶ 55.)  (5) Plaintiff relied on these assurances when
Plaintiff purchased Restocrete’s services. 
(FAC, ¶ 55.)  (6) Plaintiff was
damaged.  (FAC, ¶ 58.)  
Plaintiff
pleads both intentional and negligent misrepresentation in the complaint.  The elements of fraudulent misrepresentation
are (1) misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud
(induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.  (Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1244, 1255.)  Fraudulent misrepresentation must be pleaded
with heightened specificity.  (Hills Transportation Co. v. Southwest Forest
Ind., Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707.) 
Fraud must plead facts as to “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means.”  (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)  
Plaintiff alleges that Mauricio met with Plaintiff and made
written and verbal representations, including a quality warranty.  (FAC, ¶ 11.) 
These representations occurred on July 16, 2018, August 9, 2018, and
March 1, 2020.  (FAC, ¶¶ 11, 12,
15.)  Representations were made to
Plaintiff directly.  (FAC, ¶ 11.)  This meets the heightened pleading
requirement. 
            Therefore, the Court overrules
demurer to the Fourth Cause of Action. 
            Negligence
– Fifth Cause of Action
            The Statute of Limitations for negligence is 3
years. 
The complaint alleges that the work was completed around November 11,
2019.  (Complaint, ¶ 14.)  Plaintiff discovered that the flooring was
installed defectively sometime after March 1, 2020.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 18.)  Plaintiff filed the complaint on November 07,
2023.  Plaintiff fails to allege that the
discovery rule applies, the date of discovery, or that the statute of limitations
has tolled. 
            The Court sustains the
demurrer with leave to amend. 
            Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress – Sixth Cause of Action
The
elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress are (1) a legal duty to
use due care; (2) breach of that duty; (3) damage or injury; and (4)
causation.  (Huggins v. Longs Drug Stores
California, Inc. (1993) 6 Cal.4th
124, 129.)
            Like
the Fifth Cause of Action, the Sixth Cause of Action fails under the statute of
limitations.  Therefore, the Court
sustains the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action with leave to amend.
Motion to Strike
Marenco
requests that the Court strike three sections in the complaint requesting
punitive damages and a prayer for pre- and post- judgement interest.  Because the Court overrules the demurrer to
the cause of action for fraud, the Court denies the motion to strike the demand
for punitive damages in the Second Cause of Action and the Prayer for
Relief.  The Court sustains the demurer
to the Sixth Cause of Action, making the motion to strike moot.  
            In
a cause of action alleging oppression, fraud or malice, pre-judgment interest
does not require “presence of previously determinate damages.”  (Greenfield v. Insurance Inc. (1971)
19 Cal.App.3d 803, 813.)  Therefore, the
Court denies the motion to strike. 
 
CONCLUSION
The
Court sustains in part and overrules in part Defendant’s Demurrer.  The Court sustains the demurrer to the Fifth
and Sixth Causes of Action with 20 days’ leave to amend.  The Court overrules the demurrer to the
remaining causes of action.  
            The
Court denies the Motion to Strike. 
            Defendant
to give notice.
