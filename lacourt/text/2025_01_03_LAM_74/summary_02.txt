And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings pending the resolution of their Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Plaintiff, Gabriela Marquez, has not opposed the stay. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4, which allows a court to stay proceedings if an application has been made to arbitrate a controversy involved in the action. The Judge also cited cases such as OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho and Landis v. North American Co. to support the power of the court to stay proceedings when it is in the best interest of justice. The stay will remain in effect until the Motion to Compel Arbitration is heard and resolved.
