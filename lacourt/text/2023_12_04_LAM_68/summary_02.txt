The Judge has reviewed the documents related to the motion to compel deposition attendance and will not decide the motion on the merits at this time. Instead, the Judge orders an Informal Discovery Conference to be held on a date to be determined. The parties are required to conduct a meaningful meet and confer at least 10 days prior to the conference, and to file a joint statement of remaining issues. The joint statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the moving party's arguments and the opposing party's arguments. The Judge also orders that the parties submit a joint statement of the remaining issues at least 3 days prior to the conference, in a specific format that includes the category of PMQ, the moving party's statement of why it should be compelled, and the opposing party's statement of why it should not be compelled.
