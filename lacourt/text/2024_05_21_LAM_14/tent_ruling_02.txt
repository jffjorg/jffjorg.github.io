(1)  
Demurrer
 
Defendant District now demurs to
the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Second Amended Cross-Complaint, on the grounds
that the court has no jurisdiction to hear these claims, and that the
Cross-Complaint fails to state causes of action and is uncertain. 
 
Decision
 
            The
demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED, without leave
to amend.
 
The demurrer to the second, third, fifth,
and sixth causes of action is SUTAINED, with 30 days leave to amend.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Request for Judicial Notice is DENIED.
 
            Defendant
District’s evidentiary objections are OVERRULED, as the court does not rely on
the documents attached to Plaintiff’s opposition in reaching its decision
herein.
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a)
 
            The
court notes that Defendant District’s demurrer combines the grounds for
demurrer regarding failure to state a cause of action and uncertainty under
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), into one
paragraph, in violation of Rule 3.1320, subdivision (a), of the California
Rules of Court. “Each ground of demurrer must be in a separate paragraph and
must state whether it applies to the entire complaint, cross-complaint, or
answer, or to specified causes of action or defenses.” Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1320, subd. (a). The court will still consider the demurrer, but
admonishes District to comply with the requirements of the California Rules of
Court going forward.
 
Discussion
 
            Facts as
Alleged
 
The
factual allegations in the SAC are set forth in paragraphs 10-37. They describe
a course of events that began in 2017. During the fall of that year, Plaintiff
had a disruptive student in his classroom. (TAC ¶ 11). Plaintiff reported his
problems and asked to have the student removed. (TAC ¶¶ 11, 13). Nothing
happened. (TAC ¶ 13).
 
Plaintiff
appealed to a superintendent, and the student was eventually moved. (TAC ¶ 14).
However, this appeal brought negative consequences for Plaintiff from his
immediate administrative superiors, including disciplinary proceedings, that
continued through the spring of 2018. (TAC ¶¶ 15-27).
 
Plaintiff
also complains that documents which were inserted in his file in 2001 should
have been expunged. (TAC ¶ 30). Plaintiff went out on medical leave in April
2019. (TAC ¶ 31). He complains that the District sought to terminate this
medical leave in March of 2020. (TAC ¶ 31.) He further alleges that CALSTRS
conferred disability retirement status on him on December 7, 2020. (TAC, ¶ 32.)
 
FEHA
Claims
 
Each of Plaintiff’s causes of action is a
FEHA claim and therefore subject to the requirement of filing a claim with the
Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”). To
succeed on a FEHA claim, Plaintiff is obliged to both plead and prove that he
first exhausted his administrative remedies by filing a proper and timely
complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”) and
awaiting the decision of that body to act (or not). Kim v. Konad USA
Distribution, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1345. This means that there
are effectively two limitations periods that apply in FEHA actions: the
limitations period for filing the administrative complaint, and the limitations
period for filing the lawsuit after the administrative process is over.
 
Currently,
the administrative filing must be made within three years of the act that
causes the complaint. Government Code §§ 12960(c), (e)(5) (“[a] complaint…
shall not be filed after the expiration of three years from the date upon which
the unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred”). The lawsuit must then
be filed within one year after the administrative process concludes. Government
Code §§ 12965(c)(1)(C), (e)(1), (f)(1).
 
However,
the limitations period that applies to any given wrong is the limitations
period as it existed when the alleged wrong was committed. Code of Civil
Procedure § 3; Evangelatos v. Superior Court (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188,
1205-06.
 
Before
2020, the administrative statute of limitations for filing a complaint with the
DFEH was only one year. See 2019 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 709 (A.B. 9) (West). The
statute of limitations became three years on January 1, 2020. Plaintiff did not
file his DFEH complaint until April 20, 2021. Therefore, to remain actionable,
any alleged violation must have continued into 2020, and therefore be covered
by the new three-year statute rather than the old one-year statute.
 
The
only act which Plaintiff says occurred in 2020 was the denial of his continuing
medical leave. Only actions which can be legally connected to this event may
escape the statute of limitations bar. See Aryeh v. Canon Business
Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1197-98.
 
First Cause of Action: Age Discrimination
 
            To plead a case for discrimination
under FEHA, Plaintiff must allege specific facts which show “that (1) he was a
member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or
was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse
employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available
job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.” Guz v.
Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 355.
            
            Plaintiff
pleads this cause of action at paragraphs 38-50 of the TAC. But nothing in
those paragraphs connects anything that happened to Plaintiff to his age, and
there are no specific facts to show that any action was taken against him
because of his age.
 
            Given the
number of times Plaintiff has been given leave to amend, his failure to plead
specific facts demonstrating discrimination against him on the basis of his
age, and the lack of an offer of proof here, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to
the First Cause of Action without leave to amend.
 
Second Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
 
            To establish a cause of action for
disability discrimination, Plaintiff must plead that he: (1) suffered from a
disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform
the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and
(3) was subjected to an adverse employment action [(4)] because of the
disability or perceived disability. Sandell v.
Taylor-Listug,
Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 310.
 
Plaintiff
pleads this cause of action at paragraphs 51-66, but he still does not identify
his disability. It is not enough to just allege the word “disability.”
Plaintiff must allege specific facts demonstrating how he is disabled, e.g.,
whether he is quadriplegic, blind, deaf or hard of hearing, or some sort of
cognitive disability. Plaintiff does allege that he has been receiving
disability retirement benefits from CALSTRS since December 2020. (TAC, ¶¶ 7,
60.) But this only begs the questions as to what the alleged disability is.
 
Given
the indirect allegation of receiving retirement disability benefits, the court
will give Plaintiff one last opportunity to allege the Second Cause of Action.
 
Third Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in Interactive
Process
 
            This claim depends upon an adequate
pleading of the Plaintiff’s disability. See Scotch v. Art Institute of
California-Orange County, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1009-1010.
Because
Plaintiff has not properly pled a
disability, this claim cannot proceed, but the court will give Plaintiff one
last opportunity to amend for the reasons set forth above in the Second Cause
of Action.
 
Fourth Cause of Action: Retaliation
 
            To make a case for FEHA retaliation, Plaintiff must
allege facts to show that (1) he engaged in activity protected by FEHA, (2) he
was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there is some other
circumstance which suggests a causal link between the two. Morgan v. Regents
of University of Cal. (2000) 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 69-70. Government Code §
12940(h) provides that a person has engaged in protected activity wherever they
have “opposed any practices forbidden under this part or…filed a complaint,
testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.”
 
The
phrase “this part” refers to Government Code §§ 12900-12999. Plaintiff only has
a FEHA retaliation claim if he can allege that he opposed a practice forbidden
by one of those code sections, or that he previously participated in a legal
proceeding authorized by one of those code sections.
 
In the
pleading of his claim, Plaintiff identifies his filing of a “Retaliation
complaint with the Department of Labor in the year 2018.” (TAC, ¶ 80.) It is
still unclear what the complaint was, what procedure it employed, or whether it
addressed anything covered by Government Code §§ 12900-12999. Plaintiff
also refers to a writ proceeding which took place per the Education Code. (TAC,
¶ 81.) But, as noted previously, FEHA only covers writ proceedings where they
occur per FEHA – that is, they allege violations of Government Code
§§12900-12999.
 
Plaintiff
still has not yet sufficiently identified a protected activity which would
allow him to plead a claim for FEHA retaliation. Given the number of
opportunities the court has given Plaintiff to state a cause of action for
retaliation and Plaintiff’s repeated failure to allege the necessary facts, the
court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action without leave to
amend.
 
Fifth Cause of Action: Harassment
 
            Plaintiff attempts to plead that he was
harassed based on age, gender, and disability. (TAC ¶¶ 92-108). But there is
nothing in the pleadings which connects anything that happened to
Plaintiff
to his age or gender. And as explained above, Plaintiff has failed to properly
plead a disability. Therefore, Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled this claim.
But, the court will give Plaintiff one more opportunity to amend to plead based
on disability given Plaintiff’s allegations of receiving retirement disability
benefits. (TAC, ¶ 104.) 
 
Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination,
Retaliation, and Harassment
 
            This cause of action can only be
prosecuted if there is a viable claim for discrimination,
harassment,
or retaliation. Dickson v. Burke Williams, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
1307, 1314-
15; Trujillo
v. North County Transit Dist. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 284-285. Since
Plaintiff’s
other FEHA claims have not properly
been pled, this one cannot proceed. But again, the court will give Plaintiff
one more opportunity to amend plead based on disability given Plaintiff’s
allegations of receiving retirement disability benefits. (TAC, ¶ 7.)
 
 
Conclusion
 
            The
demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED, without leave
to amend.
 
The demurrer to the second, third,
fifth, and sixth causes of action is SUTAINED, with 30 days leave to amend.

Motion to Strike
 
Defendant District moves to strike
allegations from the TAC regarding punitive damages, prejudgment interest, the
statute of limitations against public entities, and actions that occurred after
the filing of the DFEH complaint on April 20, 2021.
 
Decision
 
            Given the
court’s ruling on the demurrer, the motion to strike is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR as
MOOT.
