And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Stoneybrook's Motion to Compel Plaintiff Johnson's Deposition without prejudice. The court finds that Defendant has not fulfilled the requirements for its motion to compel, specifically the need for a meet and confer declaration or a declaration stating that Defendant has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. Additionally, the court notes that Defendant has not asserted the relevant legal authority nor provided the relevant evidence to file a motion to compel compliance with the court's order.
