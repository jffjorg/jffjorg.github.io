And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the petition for declaratory relief brought by Paul Ricchiuti, seeking recognition of his birthright citizenship from Italy. The petition is based on the theory that his grandfather went by multiple names, and Italian law requires a court order finding that these names refer to "one and the same person." The judge has reviewed the petition and attachments, including documents tracing the petitioner's descent. The judge has also taken judicial notice of ten orders issued by trial courts across California in similar actions for declaratory relief. The judge has found that the petitioner's grandfather's names are all referring to the same person, and has granted the petition.
