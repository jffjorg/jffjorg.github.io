Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Culver 12 LLC's motion to compel further deposition and production of documents from the Cross-Defendants (Sachin Tejas Bettadapur, Alexander Amir Rassouli, and Ashan Naik) regarding communications between the Cross-Defendants from August 1, 2022 to December 8, 2022. The judge finds that the communications are material to the action and that Culver is entitled to discover them and depose the Cross-Defendants about them. The judge notes that the Cross-Defendants have not produced all of the requested communications and have not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge grants the motion to compel further deposition and production of documents, but denies sanctions as Culver failed to properly identify the parties against whom the sanction was sought. The hearing on the motion is scheduled for February 5, 2024.
