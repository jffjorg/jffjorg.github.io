Background
 
On October 2, 2023, Defendant served his special
interrogatories, set one, and request for production, set one, on Plaintiff.
Plaintiff did not serve discovery responses by the statutory due date of
November 3, 2023. Thereafter, Defendant provided Plaintiff several extensions,
with February 12, 2024, as the last date to produce the discovery responses at
issue. On February 7, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s former attorney's
motion to be relieved as counsel. On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff, who is now
pro per, informed Defendant’s counsel that she had not received Defendant’s
written discovery requests and was unaware of the pending written discovery
that was propounded on October 2, 2023. On the same day, Defendant’s counsel
sent a copy of the written discovery requests to Plaintiff via email and
requested Plaintiff provide a date by which she would serve her verified responses
to Defendant’s discovery requests. As of March 6, 2024, the date the present
motions were filed, Defendant’s counsel had not received any response from
Plaintiff. Consequently, Defendant now moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to
provide responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for
Production, Set One, and for terminating sanctions. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
1.         
Requests for Production and Interrogatories
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for production
of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10
days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom
the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production
of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the
formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may
propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject
matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to timely serve the discovery responses at issue. Plaintiff
did not file an opposition or show any indication that the discovery responses
were provided before the hearing. Thus, the present motions to compel are
GRANTED. Plaintiff is hereby ORDERED to provide verified discovery responses to
Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set
One, without objections within 20 days of today. 
Sanctions
As for sanctions, The Civil Discovery
Act provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to discovery
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of
New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions
should be appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should
not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.)
Defendant requested only terminating sanctions;
however, The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Defendant did
not present evidence of Plaintiff having prior sanctions, a history of
discovery abuses, or a record of disobeying court orders. What the evidence
does show is that plaintiff recently became pro per and is possibly handling
her own lawsuit for the first time. This in itself weighs against terminating sanctions
and it does not necessarily indicate a propensity for future discovery abuses. Obviously,
if Plaintiff fails to comply with the orders contained herein, more severe
sanctions, including terminating sanctions, may be warranted. But at this time,
Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED.
