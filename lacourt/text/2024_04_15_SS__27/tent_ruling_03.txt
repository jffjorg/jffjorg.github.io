TENTATIVE
 
The Court excuses the personal
appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by
telephone or video conference call.¿¿¿ 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Ismael Soto Luna, an adult
with a disability. The application is denied for the following
reasons:  
 
·       
The Court reviewed the costs and
expressed uncertainty regarding specific charges. Petitioner is required to
provide an explanation for the fees from Wexco International on June 26, 2023,
October 17, 2023, and October 31, 2023, as the purpose of these fees remains
unclear. Additionally, provide an explanation for the charges from Yarnall Firm
on October 31, 2023, and January 16, 2024. 
·       
The petitioner must fix the
inconsistency between section 12a(2), which states $11,818.23, and section
12b(4), which states $1,419.24, in the petition. 
·       
Under item 14b(1) of the petition, the
petitioner paid $14,500.00 for medical expenses, yet this amount is not
reflected in the calculations leading to the net balance owed to the claimant
 
THE COURT CONTINUES THE CASE
REVIEW RE: MINOR COMPROMISE TO MAY ____, 2024, AT 1:30
P.M.  THE COURT DOES NOT NOW DETERMINE
WHETHER THE REQUESTED ATTORNEY’S FEES ARE APPROPRIATE, BUT THE COURT NOTES THAT
THE FAILURE TO FILL OUT A REASONABLY SIMPLE FORM APPROPRIATELY APPEARS TO BE
INCONSISTENT WITH A REQUEST FOR FEES OF ABOUT $10M.   
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.¿
