Case No./Name:       22STCV08846 GAREN SEMERJIAN vs ISMAEL VANCINI
RAMIREZ
Motion:                    MOTIONS TO COMPEL SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PROUDCITON, INTERROGATORIES, AND FOR SANCTIONS
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Defendant Ismael Vancini Ramirez
Notice:                      Sufficient 
 
Ruling:                              MOTIONS TO COMPEL SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND INTERROGATORIES ARE DENIED 
 
MOTION FOR SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff served his requests
for supplemental responses to his requests for production of documents and
interrogatories on Defendant. Defendant failed to provide the supplemental
discovery responses by the statutory deadline, prompting Plaintiff to move the
court to compel the discovery responses at issue. Defendant opposes the motion,
arguing that the responses were provided on April 3, 2024, before the hearing.
No reply has been filed contesting Defendant’s contentions. Since the supplemental
responses at issue have been provided before the hearing, the present motions
are moot and therefore denied.
 
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the
attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely discovery response forced
Plaintiff to file the present motions. Furthermore, Defendant admits that the
failure to provide supplemental responses were “due to the
inexcusable neglect and inadvertence of Defense counsel’s calendaring system
and personnel changes at the time, and as such, the supplemental responses
originally due were never calendared and were ultimately missed.” Plaintiff has requested sanctions in the amount
of $
1,861.65 for each
motion. Given the simplicity of the issues involved, the Court exercises its
discretion and lowers the sanction amount to $1500.00 for both motions. The
Court ORDERS Defendant and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions
of $1500.00 to Plaintiff within 20 days of today’s date.
