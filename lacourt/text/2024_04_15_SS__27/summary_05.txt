And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the motions to compel supplemental responses to requests for production and interrogatories, as well as the motion for sanctions, in the case of Garen Semerjian vs. Ismael Vancini Ramirez. The plaintiff served his requests for supplemental responses on May 12, 2023, but the defendant failed to provide the responses by the statutory deadline. The defendant provided the responses on April 3, 2024, after the hearing. The court denies the motions to compel supplemental responses as moot, since the responses have been provided. However, the court grants the motion for sanctions, ordering the defendant and his counsel to pay $1,500 to the plaintiff for the failure to serve timely discovery responses. The court finds that the defendant's failure to provide the responses was due to inexcusable neglect and inadvertence.
