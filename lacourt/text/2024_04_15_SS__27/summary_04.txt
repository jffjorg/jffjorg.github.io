And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff, Natalie Moore, to the defendant, Melkon Chamichyan. The defendant served discovery requests on October 2, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to serve discovery responses by November 3, 2023. The defendant provided extensions for the plaintiff to serve discovery responses, but the plaintiff failed to do so. The defendant then moved to compel discovery responses, and the court granted the motion. The court ordered the plaintiff to provide verified discovery responses to the defendant's special interrogatories, set one, and requests for production, set one, without objections within 20 days of the ruling.

As for sanctions, the court denied the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, citing that the plaintiff recently became pro per and is possibly handling her own lawsuit for the first time. The court noted that terminating sanctions are only warranted in cases where a party has a history of discovery abuses or has previously disobeyed court orders.
