Adonis Rodriguez Contreras¿¿ 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Adonis Rodriguez Contreras, 4. The application is denied for the following reasons:
 
·       
Attachment 12 of the Petition needs to be
submitted.
·       
Attachment 13g of the Petition needs to be
submitted.
·       
Attachment 14a of the Petition needs to be
submitted, containing both a declaration for the requested attorney’s fees and
copy of the retainer agreement.
·       
Item 12b(3) should not include Claimant,
furthermore Claimant Perla Contreras’s name is missing.
·       
Items 11, 12, and 17 of the Petition are
inconsistent. Petitioner needs to revise these items to maintain consistency.
In one part, the gross settlement amount is stated as $3,726, while in another,
it is stated as $2,500.
·       
Item 19b of the Petition need to be completed.
 
Typically, a fee of
25% of the gross settlement is reasonable. The Court recommends reducing the
attorney’s fees to that amount and amending the petition to reflect the new
amount, or counsel can explain why a higher amount is appropriate, albeit that
showing needs to account for counsel’s failure to fill out a simple form correctly
to complete this matter in an efficient manner.
