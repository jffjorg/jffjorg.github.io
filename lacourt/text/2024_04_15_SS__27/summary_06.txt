And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian denies the Defendant's motion to reclassify the case to limited jurisdiction. The Defendant, Julio Moreno Jr., filed the motion, citing that the total damages sought by the Plaintiff, Yu Xia Zou, are below $25,000. The Defendant's motion is denied because there is a possibility that the Plaintiff's recovery could exceed $25,000. The Judge considers the Plaintiff's medical expenses of $8,020, the potential for future medical expenses, and the possibility of general damages pushing the total damages beyond the $25,000 threshold. The Judge also notes that the Defendant has not provided evidence to demonstrate otherwise. The case will proceed to a hearing on April 15, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
