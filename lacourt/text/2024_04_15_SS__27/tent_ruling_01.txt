Background
On November 18, 2019,
Plaintiffs filed the present auto accident case. On January 31, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Defendant Ann Chan’s Deposition and
awarded monetary sanctions. Pursuant to the Court order, Plaintiffs served an amended
notice of deposition on Defendant for a deposition on February 26, 2024.
Defendant did not appear at her deposition, and an Affidavit of Non-Appearance
was obtained. Plaintiffs now move the Court for terminating sanctions against
Defendant for her violation of the Court order. Defendant filed an opposition indicating
that Defendant did not attend her deposition due to her deteriorating mental
state and that Defendant has stipulated to liability and is only contesting
Plaintiffs’ damages in exchange for Plaintiffs forgoing Defendant's deposition.
Defendant is also in the process of appointing a guardian ad litem to handle
this case on her behalf. Plaintiffs did not file a reply contesting Defendant’s
contentions.
Legal Standard 
 
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract
Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)¿Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
“If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted:
continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g.,¿Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280.) 
¿ 
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions
is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It
is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct.¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613;¿Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los
Angeles¿(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction
should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better
position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with
its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co.¿(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶¿8:2214-2220.) 
 
Analysis
Termination is not
warranted under the facts of the present case. This is Defendant's first
violation of a court order by not attending her deposition on February 26,
2024. Plaintiffs did not demonstrate that Defendant had a history of prior
violations of court orders or discovery abuses. The Civil Discovery Act
mandates an "incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination."
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) It is inappropriate for the Court to impose the
ultimate sanctions upon the first violation of a court order.
From Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration, the Court notes Defendant’s deteriorating mental
condition and does not consider her non-attendance at the deposition to be
willful. Defendant’s attorney has stipulated to liability and only contests
damages in exchange for Plaintiffs forgoing Defendant’s deposition, which
Plaintiff has agreed to. Therefore, there will be no future violations of any court
order to attend her depositions. Moreover, sanctions "should not exceed
that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but
denied discovery." (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Since liability has already been stipulated, there is no
need to impose further sanctions to protect Plaintiffs' interests from the
denied deposition. Thus, the present motion is DENIED.
