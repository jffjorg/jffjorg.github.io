And here is the text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The court finds that the defendant fails to provide sufficient information regarding a conflict, such as other trial case numbers, estimated trial lengths, and likelihood of trial. The court also finds that the discovery delays were caused more by the defendant's conduct than the plaintiff's. Therefore, the court denies the motion for a continuance.
