Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to set aside a default filed by defendant Yvette Judith Chirinos. The default was entered on September 6, 2023, less than 30 days after the statement of damages was served on August 30, 2023. The defendant claims that she was surprised and excusable neglected in not responding to the statement of damages, and that she relied on her insuring agreement with State Farm to handle the defense. The court finds that the defendant's declarations are sufficient to warrant relief, and that the law favors trials on the merits. As a result, the motion to set aside the default is granted, and the defendant is ordered to file a proposed answer within five court days of the issuance of this order.
