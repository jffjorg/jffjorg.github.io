#4
 
Defendant Yvette Judith Chirinos’s Motion to Set Aside
Default is GRANTED.  Defendant’s Proposed
Answer attached as Exhibit 1 to the Moving Papers is not deemed filed.  Defendant is ordered to file the Proposed
Answer within five court days of the issuance of this order. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
 
This action was filed on February 6, 2023. Defendant’s
default was entered on September 6, 2023. 
 
Defendant argues that the default entered on September 6,
2023 is void due to the fact that default was entered less than 30 days after
the statement of damages was served.  “[A]
statement of damages pursuant to section 425.11 requires that the personal
injury or wrongful death defendant be allowed the same period of time within
which to respond to the statement of damages as other defendants are allowed to
respond to such amended complaints. Section 471.5 provides 30 days from the
date of service of an amendment to a complaint for filing of a responsive
pleading.” (Plotitsa v. Sup. Ct. (183) 140 Cal.App.3d 755, 760.) Here,
the statement of damages was served on August 30, 2023. Default was entered a
mere 7 days later on September 6, 2023.
 
In addition, “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §473(b).) The policy of hearing cases on their merits is
well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d
900.) 
Defendant Chirinos states, “It
was my understanding that State Farm would handle the defense as part of my
insuring agreement and all I needed to do was provide State Farm with the
paperwork I received.” (Chirinos Decl. ¶ 6.) Given the liberality
associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, the Court
finds the Declarations of Yvette Judith Chirinos and Mariela Leon are sufficient
to warrant relief. The law favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
 
The Court finds adequate grounds
to allow Defendant the opportunity to defend herself on the merits of this
action. The Motion is GRANTED.
