significant statements:

  - "The litigation privilege is also relevant to the second step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive defense a plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing."
  - "The Court does not find that the defendants' act of filing the unlawful detainer action equals "malice". The zealous representation of their client against the nonpayment of rent is not malicious."

English-text summary:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' special motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint is granted in part and denied in part. The motion to strike the first, fourth, and fifth causes of action is granted, while the motion to strike the second and third causes of action is denied. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity, specifically the filing of an unlawful detainer action, but that the defendants' actions were not illegal.
