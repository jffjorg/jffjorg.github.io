And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Bicycle Casino's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against Farhad Momeni. Momeni's Answer is stricken, and the request for monetary sanctions is denied. The judge finds that Momeni's refusal to participate in the discovery process, including failing to comply with the court's March 2, 2023 Discovery Order, is a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the court is imposing terminating sanctions, which means that Momeni's Answer is stricken, and the case will proceed without Momeni's participation. The court has already imposed monetary sanctions on Momeni, and additional monetary sanctions would be ineffective.
