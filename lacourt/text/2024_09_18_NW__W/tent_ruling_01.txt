[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Mohammad Hossein Shahbiki’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Responses and Production of Documents in Response
to Request for Production of Documents (Set No. One) is GRANTED
 
Defendant Mohammad Hossein Shahbiki’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and
Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Mohammad Hossein Shahbiki
move to compel Plaintiffs Nathaniel Josue Rodrigez and Amanda Marie Arce to
provide responses and documents, without objection, to Defendant’s Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) as well as provide responses, without
objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions against
Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel, Onyinye N. Anyama, Esq. of Anyama Law Firm,
APC, jointly and severally. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On February 21, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery including Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Moreno Decl. ¶1, Exh. A.) Plaintiffs'
deadline to respond was March 25, 2024. (Moreno Decl. ¶2.) Plaintiffs did not
ask for an extension of time to respond and no extension was granted. (Moreno
Decl. ¶3.) No responses were served by the deadline. (Moreno Decl. ¶4.)
Defendant did eventually receive responses to the Request for Production on
April 22, 2024; however, they were unverified and boilerplate objections.
(Moreno Decl. ¶5, Exh. B.) Plaintiffs stated they would produce the documents
by May 29, 2024, but never did so. (Moreno Decl. ¶5, Exhs. C, D.) As for the
Special Interrogatories, Plaintiffs again served unverified responses with
boilerplate objections. (Moreno Decl. ¶6, Exhs. C, D.) Plaintiffs never served
any responses to the Form Interrogatories. (Moreno Decl. ¶5.) Defense counsel
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding the deficient
responses. (Moreno Decl. ¶8.) However, no additional responses have been
received. (Moreno Decl. ¶11.) 
 
No opposition has been filed. The court agrees the unverified responses
are tantamount to no responses at all and as to the objections served, those
had been waived by Plaintiffs’ failure to timely serve responses. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Shahbiki’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Responses and Production of
Documents in Response to Request for Production of Documents (Set No. One) and
Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and
Special Interrogatories (Set One) are GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to produce responses, without objection, within 30
days. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $1,380.00 for their motion to compel production of
documents and $2,179.00 for their motion to compel interrogatories against
Plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally. If a propounding party
moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall
impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to
interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for attorney fees in the reduced amount of
$1,909.00, total ($598 for the first motion, $1,311 for the second motion). No
opposition was filed and the court finds only one appearance was necessary for
the motions. Moreover, the declarations and memoranda were nearly identical.  Sanctions are awarded against plaintiff and
counsel, jointly and severally, to be paid within 30 days.
