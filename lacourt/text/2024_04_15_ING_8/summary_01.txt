This is a tentative ruling in a case between the plaintiffs, O.R. Barkhordar D.D.S., Inc., Omid Rabi Barkhordar D.D.S., Inc., and O.H. Barkhordar Dental Group, Inc., and the defendant, Cristina Ricalday. The court rules that the demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied. The court finds that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the elements of breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. The court also finds that the defendant's alleged actions constitute unfair business practices. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for exemplary and punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged malicious intent.
