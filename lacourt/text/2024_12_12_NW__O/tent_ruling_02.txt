     CASE NO.: 24VECV01386
 
ORDER
  DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO HIS
  FIRST SET OF REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff Eduardo
Gonzalez Martinez (“Plaintiff”) alleges he purchased a defective 2020 Kia Forte
(“Subject Vehicle”) on July 4, 2023, but that Defendant Kia America, Inc
(“Defendant”) has refused to replace or repurchase the Subject Vehicle, in
violation of its obligations under the Song-Beverly Act. (See, e.g., Complaint,
¶¶ 16-26.)
Plaintiff now
moves to compel Defendant’s further discovery responses to his requests for
admission (“RFPs”) and his special interrogatories (“SROGs”).  
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act- Breach of Express Warranty; and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section
1793.2. 
On May 1,
2024, Defendant filed its Answer. 
On August 23,
2024, the Court issued its Addendum re: Lemon Law Case.
On September 12,
2024, the Court approved the parties’ stipulated Protective Order. 
On September 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Further Responses to his
SROGs (“Motion SROGs”) and RFPs (“Motion RFPs”). 
On October 28,
2024, the Court granted and denied in part Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to his requests for admission.
On December
2, 2024, Defendant filed its Oppositions. 
On December
6, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Request for Production of Documents 
In responding to a request for
production of documents, a party must provide one of the following: (1) a
legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210(a).)[1] If any objections are made,
they must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made”; and (2) “[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection.”¿(Id. at § 2031.240(b).) A statement that
the responding party is unable to comply with a particular demand “shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand”; “shall also specify whether the inability to comply
is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party”; 
and “shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.” (Id. at § 2031.230.) 
A party who
believes a responding party has served (1) an incomplete statement of
compliance, (2) an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive statement of compliance,
or (3) an unmeritorious objection can move for an order compelling further
responses but must “set forth specific acts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (See id. at §§
2031.310(a)-(b)(1).) 
B.      Interrogatories 
A propounding party may move for an order
compelling further responses to interrogatories if the responding party produced
an evasive or incomplete answer or a meritless or overly general objection in
response to an interrogatory. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(a).) A
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories lies where the party to
whom the interrogatories were directed gave responses deemed improper by the
propounding party; e.g., objections, or evasive or incomplete answers. (See
id. at § 2030.300.)¿The
moving party must also include reasons why further answers should be ordered:
legal or factual arguments why the answers given were incomplete or
nonresponsive, or the objections invalid.¿(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) 
However, where a timely motion to compel has
been filed, “the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
answer the interrogatories.”¿(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil
Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2017) ¶ 8:1179.)¿“The ruling usually is based on consideration
of the following factors: [¶] the relationship of the information sought to the
issues framed in the pleadings; [¶] the likelihood that disclosure will be of
practical benefit to the party seeking discovery; [¶] the burden or expense
likely to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information
sought.”¿(Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior
Court (Rolfe) (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19.)
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), and 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery
motion should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a supplemental declaration attesting to
the parties’ telephonic and email meet and confer efforts. (See Supplemental
Declaration of Phil Thomas filed December 2, 2024 (“Supp. Thomas Decl.”), ¶¶ 3-4,
Ex. A.) The Court finds Plaintiff has fulfilled his meet and confer
obligations.   
V.            
ANALYSIS
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motions are Denied as
Untimely 
Notice of a
motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service of
verified responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.230(c),
2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).) When responses are served by mail, that time is extended by five
days. (See id. at § 1013(a).) Electronically served responses extend the
time to file a motion by two days. (See id. at § 1010.6(a)(3).) If such
notice is not given timely, the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response. (See id.)¿¿ ¿¿
Here, Defendant
served its responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs and SROGs on June 25, 2024, via email.
(See Motion RFPs Declaration of Phil Thomas filed
September 25, 2024, ¶ 5, Ex. B; see also Motion SROGs Declaration of Phil
Thomas filed September 25, 2024, ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Plaintiff thus should have given
his Notice of his Motion RFPs and his Motion SROGs by August 12, 2024. Instead,
Plaintiff filed his Motion RFPs and Motion SROGs on September 25, 2024. (See
Motion RFPs; see also Motion SROGs.)
Plaintiff’s counsel appears to argue the Motion RFPs and Motion
SROGs are not untimely by stating the following in a supplemental declaration: “On
November 4, 2024 I spoke with Mr. Williams by phone.  He said Defendant’s position was that
Plaintiff’s motions were untimely and there was nothing else to say.  I said the motions were not untimely because
the Court instructed Plaintiff to refile them at the September 23, 2024 case
management conference.  That was the end
of the conversation.” (Supp. Thomas Decl., ¶ 4.) 
The Court did not grant Plaintiff leave to file untimely motions
to compel further responses at the September 23, 2024, case management
conference or at any other point in this action. If the Court verbally informed
Plaintiff he could file additional motions, as Plaintiff argues, such
information was intended only to communicate Plaintiff’s ability to file
additional motions and was not intended as commentary on the substantive merit of
said motions, including their timeliness. 
Accordingly, the
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs and Motion SROGs.     

VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
his requests for production and Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to his special interrogatories. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      December 13, 2024
