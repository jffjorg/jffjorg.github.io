And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Jorge Rodriguez's motion to strike the notice of errata filed by Plaintiff Maria Angela Rodriguez. The notice of errata corrected a numerical error in the Third Amended Complaint and alleged that Plaintiff owns 25% of the stock in the corporate defendants, with the possibility of owning at least 33 1/3% after excluding shares held by brother defendants. Defendant Jorge Rodriguez argued that the notice of errata was a sham pleading, but the court found that the notice of errata was proper and that the contradictory language in the complaint did not affect the outcome of the motion. The court also found that the demurrer to the involuntary dissolution causes of action against Jorge Rodriguez and his brothers was sustained without leave to amend, making the issue of the notice of errata irrelevant to Jorge Rodriguez. The court ordered Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
