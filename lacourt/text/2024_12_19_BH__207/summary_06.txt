And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the pleadings and the parties' arguments and has made a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by Defendant Andrew P. Taylor.

The court finds that the Government Claims Act (GCA) may apply to the claims asserted by Plaintiff Ariadni Kidonis Silva Perez, as Defendant is an employee of the Los Angeles Police Department and the accident allegedly occurred while he was acting in the course of his employment.

However, the court notes that Plaintiff did not allege compliance or exemption from the GCA in their Complaint, and that Defendant has not presented any judicially noticeable facts that would demonstrate compliance with the GCA's presentation requirements.

Therefore, the court denies Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, as it cannot determine whether the GCA applies to the claims asserted by Plaintiff or whether Plaintiff has complied with the GCA's presentation requirements.

The parties are directed to exchange notices of the court's ruling and to file the notices with proof of service forthwith.
