And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel and the motion for sanctions brought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks an order compelling the defendant to comply with the court's prior order to provide verified and code-compliant responses to discovery. The defendant, who retained new counsel in September 2023, claims to be unaware of the court's order. However, the reply filed by the plaintiff shows conclusively that new counsel was informed of the court's order at least three times. The court finds that the defendant's new counsel has been aware of the order for some time and has failed to provide the required responses. Therefore, the motion to compel is granted, and the defendant is ordered to provide the required responses within three court days. The court also awards monetary sanctions of $3735 against the defendant, payable within 30 days. The court notes that it was a gift that the plaintiff did not request non-monetary sanctions. The court hopes that the defendant's new counsel will comport with the opposition papers in the future.
