And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to compel and awarding sanctions against Rubin. The issue at hand is the non-compliance of the legend, which must be provided within 10 court days and specify which documents are responsive to which requests. Rubin had sought an informal process, which the court believes would have been sufficient, but instead, the motion was necessary. The court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $3000 against Rubin, finding that the motion was likely not reasonable and necessary. The court notes that while there is no requirement for an IDC (Independent Documentary Commission), it can have an impact on the necessity of some fees.
