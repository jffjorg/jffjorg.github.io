And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike costs in the case of InterSolutions v. Kares. The court has previously granted InterSolutions' motion, and Kares was dismissed on November 3, 2023. InterSolutions is seeking costs, while Kares is not. The court finds that InterSolutions is entitled to costs incurred in the litigation, including e-service fees and filing fees. However, the court is unsure why InterSolutions would pay a first appearance fee twice, and will inquire about this. The motion to tax costs is therefore granted in part and denied in part.
