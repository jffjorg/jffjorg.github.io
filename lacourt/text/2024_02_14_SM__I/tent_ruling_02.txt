 Case Number:  22SMCV00454    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to compel is GRANTED.  The legend apparently is still not
compliant.  This might have worked under
the old law, but the law changed years ago. 
The new “legend,” which will be provided within 10 court days and be
verified, must specify which documents are responsive to which requests.  That is a pain, but it is what the law
requires.  
However, Rubin consistently sought to engage an informal
process.  The court believes that such a
process would have worked and eliminated the need for this motion.  Sanctions must be reasonable and necessary;
this motion was likely not.  Sanctions
are awarded in the amount of $3000 against Rubin and not counsel because the
letter-writing process, which should have worked, did not work.  But there were more efficient and
cost-effective alternatives, in the court’s view.  While there is no requirement for an IDC, it
can have an effect on how necessary some of the fees were.
