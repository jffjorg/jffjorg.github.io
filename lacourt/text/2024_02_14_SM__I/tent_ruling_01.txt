  Case Number:  21SMCV01968    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a motion to strike costs.
As to the former, recovery of costs is governed by
statute.  The court has previously
granted InterSolutions’ motion and it is no longer in the case.  It seeks costs.  Kares was dismissed by the court on November
3, 2023, but he is not seeking costs.
Unlike a fee motion brought pursuant to Civil Code section
1717, a voluntary dismissal even without prejudice means that the defendant is
the prevailing party for cost purposes. 
The costs that were in the cost memorandum by InterSolutions are all
costs (save one) that relate to InterSolutions’ litigation of the case—either
by way of first appearance fees or filing fees. 
They are appropriate.  E-service
fees for filings by OneLegal are proper as well.  Ramirez contends that there is no evidence
that these costs were actually paid (other than those to the court).  But that is not the point.  Costs are awarded if incurred, whether or not
they are paid.
The only question is that there appear to be two first
appearance fees.  The court will inquire
about that.  If one is for InterSolutions
and one is for Kares, then the one for Kares is improper and will be
taxed.  The court is otherwise unsure why
InterSolutions would pay a first appearance fee twice.
The motion to tax costs is therefore tentatively GRANTED IN
PART AND DENIED IN PART.
