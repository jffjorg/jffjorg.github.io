And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Walmart's motion for summary judgment in the case of Sofia Aparicio v. Walmart, Inc. The case concerns a slip and fall accident that occurred on October 5, 2020, at a Walmart store in Baldwin Park. Aparicio alleges that Walmart was negligent in allowing a rotisserie chicken to leak liquid on the floor, causing her to slip and fall.

Walmart argues that it did not have sufficient notice of the spill to remedy the situation before Aparicio's accident. The Court finds that, while Walmart's regular inspections of safety hazards and immediate notice of the spill may not have been sufficient to prevent the accident, there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether Walmart breached its duty to Aparicio.

The Court notes that Aparicio's expert witness, Lisa Hamdalla, testified that Walmart's use of containers for rotisserie chicken that were prone to leaking was below the standard of care for retail stores. The Court also notes that Walmart was aware that these containers were sometimes "flimsy or broken."

Based on this evidence, the Court finds that there are triable issues of material fact on the issue of breach and denies Walmart's motion for summary judgment. The case will continue to trial.
