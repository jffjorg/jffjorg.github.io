And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The court finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the examination, citing the plaintiff's receipt of multiple injections from a pain management physician, the plaintiff's designation of a pain management physician as a retained expert, and the plaintiff's pursuit of damages for continuing injuries and future treatment.

The examination will be conducted by F. Michael Ferrante, M.D., a pain management specialist, and will take place within 30 days of the hearing on this motion. The examination will consist of a musculoskeletal and neurological examination involving body parts claimed to be injured, taking of history present status, physical examination, and review of records. The court has limited the examination to whatever condition is "in controversy" in the action.

The judge has also expressed concern that the defendants' requested examination date of September 11, two days after the hearing, may not provide adequate notice to the plaintiff. Therefore, the court has ordered that the examination take place within 30 days, or at such other time as the parties may agree to.
