Here is a summary of the judicial ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The defendant, Magic Mountain, LLC, failed to timely post jury fees, which resulted in the waiver of its right to a jury trial. However, the defendant's failure was inadvertent, and there is no indication that this was a deliberate tactical decision or a pretext for a continuance. The court has considered the evidence in the record and has exercised its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and allow a trial by jury. The court orders that the matter be set for a jury trial, and the trial date remains as scheduled. The defendant is ordered to give notice.
