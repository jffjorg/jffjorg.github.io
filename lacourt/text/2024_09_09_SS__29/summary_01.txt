As for the summary text, here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff John David Cadena's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The Plaintiff inadvertently failed to post jury fees timely, but has since posted the fees and filed a demand for a jury trial. The court finds that the waiver of jury trial was inadvertent and that no party would suffer undue prejudice from granting relief from waiver. The court exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and allow a trial by jury.
