22STCV20863
Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED in part.
Background
On June 27, 2022, Plaintiffs Jennifer Chavez and Johnish
Harrison (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against Jacqueline
Tuggle (“Defendant”), Keishia Caldwell, and DOES 1 through 50, for negligence.
 
On October 30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On December 27, 2023,
Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Jennifer Chavez. On May 8, 2024, the
cross-complaint was dismissed.
 
On August 13, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to continue the
trial. 
No opposition has been filed.
Trial is scheduled for November 4, 2024.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
Discussion
Defendant seeks to
continue trial based on the need to obtain a court order of Defendant’s motions
compel the depositions of Plaintiffs, as well as to conduct independent medical
examinations of the Plaintiffs and obtain the necessary report from defense’s
expert. (Goodwin Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendant seeks a continuance from November 4,
2024 to May 12, 2025.
No opposition has
been filed. Defendant contends she served Plaintiff Chavez notice of her
deposition on April 1, 2024 set for May 13, 2024; Plaintiff Chavez failed to appear.
(Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant served
Plaintiff Harrison notice of his deposition on May 28, 2024 set for July 18,
2024; Plaintiff Harrison failed to appear. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Defendant filed two motions to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs set to be
heard on September 10, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 6
& 7.)
The Court finds
Defendant has established good cause for a trial continuance under Code of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(7) as Defendant
is entitled to depose Plaintiffs and conduct medical examinations.  At this time, however, Defendant has not
shown good cause for the requested continuance of more than six months.  The Court finds, on this record, good cause
for a continuance of approximately 90 days.
Therefore, the
Court GRANTS in part the motion to continue trial.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS in part Defendant Jacqueline
Tuggle’s motion to continue trial. 
The Court ORDERS that the trial date is continued
for approximately 90 days, to a date in early February 2025.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
