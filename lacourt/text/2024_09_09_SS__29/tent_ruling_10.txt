 Case Number:  BC705622    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  29  
Geza v. Windsor Terrace Healthcare Center
BC705622
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Defendant’s
Counsel Giovanniello Law Group
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On May 10, 2018, Milana Le Geza (“Plaintiff”)
initiated her case against Windsor Terrace Healthcare Center (“Defendant”). 
On August 28, 2023, this matter was stayed
due to Defendant’s Bankruptcy.
On August 19, 2024, Giovanniello Law Group (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)),
and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has filed the Notice,
Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel served Defendant with
the papers by mail. Counsel contends it already ended its representation of
Defendant before the Bankrupcty and that Defendant already has new
representation. (Lorant Decl., ¶ 3.) 
As Counsel seeks an order as
against Defendant, and as this matter remains subject to the automatic stay of
federal bankruptcy law, the Court denies the motion without prejudice, subject
to being renewed once the automatic stay is lifted (or the bankruptcy court
issues an order granting relief from stay). 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES without
prejudice the motion of counsel to be relieved. 
Moving counsel to give notice.
