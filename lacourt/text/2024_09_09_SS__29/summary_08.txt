And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production. The plaintiff did not serve responses to these discovery requests, and the defendants showed that they made a good faith effort to get a response. The judge also denies the defendants' motion for an order deeming the plaintiff's failure to respond as admission. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide code-compliant, objection-free, verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The judge also grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $561.65 for the plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses to the requests for admission. The judge sets a deadline of 30 days for the plaintiff to pay the sanctions.
