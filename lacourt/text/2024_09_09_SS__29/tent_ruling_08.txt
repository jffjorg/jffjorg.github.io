Background
On September 7,
2023, Alexis Erica Alpisa (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against
Omar Mario Pena, Jr., Antonia Contreras (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1
through 20 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
September 9, 2021.
On May 9, 2024,
Defendants filed an answer.
On August 2, 2024, Defendants filed motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production as well as a motion for a
deemed-admitted order in relation to a Request for Admission. 
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
motion for a deemed-admitted order (but not the other motions) on August 6.  Defendants filed a reply on August 30.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On May 8, 2024, Defendants served Plaintiff
with Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Demand for Production, and
Requests for Admission.  (Bekaryan
Decls., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff did not serve
responses. (Id., ¶ 9.) 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 6 and
attached to counsel’s declaration a copy of Plaintiff’s response to the Requests
for Admission. (Bral Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. 1.) Plaintiff’s response is objection
free, verified, and in substantial compliance under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280(c).
Therefore, the motion to deem the truth of
Requests for Admissions is DENIED.
As for the motions to compel, however, Defendants
have shown that they propounded discovery and Plaintiff did not respond.  Defendants need show nothing more.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
The requests for sanctions in connection with the three
motions to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production
are DENIED.  The applicable statutes
authorize sanctions “against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion
to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here,
Plaintiff did not oppose the motions, and so no sanctions are authorized.
The
request for sanctions in connection with the motion for a deemed-admitted order
is GRANTED.  The chapter in the Civil
Discovery Act governing requests for admission provides for a “mandatory”
imposition of sanctions “on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated” the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
failure to serve time responses necessitated Defendants’ motion.  The Court sets sanctions in the requested
amount of $561.65 based on two hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $61.65 filing fee.  (Bekaryan Decl., ¶ 10.)
