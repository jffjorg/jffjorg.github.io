And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part Defendant Jacqueline Tuggle's motion to continue the trial date. The motion was filed on August 13, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge found that the Defendant has established good cause for a trial continuance under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(7) as Defendant is entitled to depose Plaintiffs and conduct medical examinations. However, the judge did not grant the requested continuance of more than six months, but instead granted a continuance of approximately 90 days. The trial date is now continued to a date in early February 2025, and the Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
