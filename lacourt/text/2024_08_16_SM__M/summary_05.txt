Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against defendants Marjan Farazmand and Madoud Farzmand. The defendants claim that the default was entered due to their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and they seek relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The judge finds that the defendants' reliance on a stipulation entered into by other parties was not reasonable and that they had failed to file a responsive pleading to the complaint. However, the judge grants discretionary relief and orders the defendants to file a "draft" answer as the answer and to pay the plaintiff's counsel's reasonable attorney's fees as a condition of setting aside the defaults. The judge also imposes a deadline for payment of the fees and warns that if the fees are not paid, the defaults will be reinstated.
