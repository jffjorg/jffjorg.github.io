And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents (RPDs) filed by the defendants. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to properly identify responsive documents to specific requests and have not complied with the parties' agreement at a previous meeting and conferencing (IDC). The court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to properly identify responsive documents and orders them to supplement their responses within 20 days by identifying specific bates ranges that are responsive to each of the RPDs. The court also notes that the plaintiffs' use of the same language in response to multiple requests demonstrates their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
