Here is a YAML summary of the tentative ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24SMCV01185
* Hearing Date: August 16, 2024
* Dept: M
* Case Name: Art Center Holdings, Inc., et al. v. WCE CA Art LLC, et al.

**Parties**

* Plaintiffs: Art Center Holdings, Inc., et al.
* Defendants: WCE CA Art LLC, et al.

**Arbitration Agreements**

* Three Management Services Agreements (MSAs) contain arbitration clauses
* MSAs signed by some parties, but not all

**Facts**

* Plaintiffs founded medical companies and entered into transaction with Defendants in 2019
* Transaction included two key agreements: Participating Physician Compensation Agreement (PPCA) and Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA)
* MSAs were ancillary agreements, but not signed by all parties

**Claims**

* Plaintiffs brought eleven causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, conversion, and declaratory relief
* Some causes of action brought derivatively on behalf of entities that signed MSAs

**Analysis**

* Court must determine whether parties agreed to arbitrate dispute
* Broad arbitration clauses in MSAs cover "all controversies, claims and disputes arising from or relating to" agreements
* Claims brought by direct plaintiffs not signatories to MSAs are still arbitrable due to derivative claims and reliance on MSAs

**Disputes**

* Plaintiffs argue that arbitration clauses do not bind non-signatories
* Defendants argue that equitable estoppel applies and arbitration clauses cover all disputes

**Waiver**

* Plaintiffs argue that Defendants waived right to arbitration by litigating in court, but failed to meet burden of proof

**Ruling**

* Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to compel arbitration as to all Plaintiffs and causes of action
* Action is STAYED pending outcome of arbitration

**Significant Statements**

* "Arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit."
* "Courts resolve doubts about an arbitration agreement's scope in favor of arbitration."
* "The language of the contract governs its interpretation if it is clear and explicit."

**Roles**

* Judge: decision-maker
* Parties: Art Center Holdings, Inc., et al. and WCE CA Art LLC, et al.

**Statutes**

* California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2
