Background
 
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiffs Sanaz
Afsar, individually and ex rel minors MSK and AK, Saied Kashani filed a
complaint against Defendants Marrari Inc. dba R&S Auto, Ricardo Marrari,
and Does 1-10, inclusive.  On May 9,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants
Marrari Inc. dba R&S Auto, Ricardo Marrari, Ricardo Danial Marrari and
Sally Marrari, as trustees of the Ricardo Marrari and Sally Marrari Living
Trust dated 1-11-17, and Does 1-9, inclusive.
 
On June 3, 2024, Cross-Complainants
Marrari Inc. dba R&S Auto, Ricardo Marrari, Ricardo Danial Marrari and
Sally Marrari, as trustees of the Ricardo Marrari and Sally Marrari Living
Trust dated 1-11-17 filed a cross-complaint against Roes 1-20 for equitable
indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief.
 
On July 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against the same Defendants, alleging (1) negligence
causing personal injury and property damage; (2) negligent infliction of severe
emotional distress; (3) breach of implied warranty; (4) fraud (intentional
misrepresentation); and (5) negligent misrepresentation.
 
On July 25, 2024,
Defendants filed the instant motion to vacate trial preference and continue
trial date and related deadlines.  On July 29, 2024, the Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer
to the fourth cause of action in the SAC and all causes of action based on
alter ego liability.
 
Legal Standard
“The court
may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring
the continuance.”  (California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  “Where a party
meets the requisite standard for calendar preference under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 36] subdivision (a), preference must be granted.  No weighing of interests is involved.”  (Fox v.
Superior Court (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 529, 535.)  Any inconvenience to the court or to other
litigants is irrelevant and “[f]ailure to complete discovery or other pretrial
matters does not affect the absolute substantive right to trial preference for
those litigants who qualify for preference.” 
(Swaithes v. Superior Court
(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1082, 1085.)
Analysis
 
Defendants argue that the Court
should vacate the case’s trial preference because the minors’ personal injuries
do not constitute a substantial factor in the case. They cite Code of Civil
Procedure § 36(b), which mandates a trial preference for cases involving
personal injury claims for plaintiffs under the age of 14, but includes an
exception when the minor does not have a “substantial interest in the case as a
whole.” Defendants assert that this case falls within that exception, as
discovery has revealed that the minors have not received any medical treatment
for physical injuries despite allegations of “grave personal injury” in the
SAC. The minors’ claims are primarily for stress and emotional distress, with
only one minor having attended a single psychiatric counseling session. Defendants
argue that in contrast, the primary focus of the case involves substantial
property damage and injuries suffered by the adult Plaintiff, which far
outweigh the minors’ claims. Defendants contend that trial preference is
intended for cases where the minors’ injuries are a significant factor, which
is not the situation here.
 
Defendants further argue that the
Court has the authority to continue the trial for good cause under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332. They assert that good cause exists due to their
inability to complete essential discovery before the trial date. Despite their
diligent efforts, they have not had enough time to follow up on discovery
responses because of the accelerated timeline resulting from the trial
preference order. Additionally, they have been unable to inspect critical
evidence, such as the vehicle involved in the fire, and require more time to
gather necessary testimony and documents. Defendants emphasize that these circumstances
justify a continuance and that the Court should consider the proximity of the
trial date, the lack of previous continuances, and the interests of justice
when deciding whether to grant a continuance.
 
Finally, Defendants argue that they
will be prejudiced if the trial is not continued, as they have not had
sufficient time to complete discovery and prepare their defense. They note that
they were served in this case on June 3, 2024, with the trial set for September
9, 2024, leaving them with inadequate time to pursue necessary discovery. This
includes obtaining information about a third minor present during the incident,
details of a related settlement, and conducting independent medical
examinations of Plaintiffs. They also need additional time to inspect the
vehicle involved in the fire and gather evidence from third parties. Without a
continuance, Defendants assert that they will be unable to fully evaluate the
merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, participate in informed settlement discussions,
or adequately defend themselves at trial. Moreover, they highlight that
Plaintiffs’ delays in finalizing pleadings and the recent filing of an SAC have
further complicated their preparation, underscoring the need for a trial
continuance.
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue
that minor plaintiff MSK suffered personal injuries, including severe emotional
distress and psychological injury, as a direct result of the fire caused by Defendants’
negligence. They assert that under California Code of Civil Procedure § 36(b),
MSK is entitled to trial preference as a minor under 14 years of age with a
substantial interest in the case. Plaintiffs emphasize that MSK has been
diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder,
which are considered personal injuries under California law, even in the
absence of physiological damage. Plaintiffs cite case law, including Dryden
v. Continental Bakery Co. (1938) 11 Cal.2d 33, 40 and Cain v. State Farm
(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 783, to support their position that mental distress
constitutes physical injury and, therefore, qualifies as “personal injury” under
the statute. Plaintiffs further argue that the Defendants have misinterpreted
the “substantial interest” requirement in their motion. Contrary to Defendants’
assertion, Plaintiffs contend that the statute does not require the minor’s
injury claim to make up a substantial portion of the overall damages. Instead,
they argue that the statute ensures trial preference for minors with a
significant interest in the outcome of the case, which applies to all
plaintiffs in this case. Plaintiffs maintain that each family member, including
the minors, has a substantial interest in the litigation due to the destruction
of their property, the loss of their home, and the severe emotional trauma they
endured.
 
Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants
will not be prejudiced by the trial date remaining firm. They claim that Defendants
have not diligently pursued discovery and had ample time to conduct Independent
Medical Examinations (IMEs) but delayed until the last minute. Plaintiffs also
point out that Defendants unilaterally canceled scheduled depositions and have
not attempted to reschedule them or meet and confer on discovery issues.
Additionally, Plaintiffs note that the sealed related case file, which the defendants
claim they need access to, is sealed by a court order requested by the
landlord, not by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ failure to
timely pursue discovery avenues available to them does not constitute prejudice
and that these issues should be resolved through the discovery process rather
than by delaying the trial.
 
In reply, Defendants argue that the
trial preference requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure § 36
should not apply to this case due to the need for coordination with a related
case filed by Wawanesa General Insurance Company. Wawanesa’s complaint seeks
subrogation against Defendants for amounts paid to Plaintiff Kashani related to
the same fire at issue in the current case. Defendants cite Isaak v.
Superior Court (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 792, 798-99, where the court found
that while trial preference is typically mandatory, it can be superseded in
coordinated proceedings by CCP § 404.7 and California Rules of Court, rule
3.504. These rules allow the trial court to manage coordinated proceedings reasonably,
potentially overriding the strict timelines of CCP § 36. Defendants argue that
coordinating the two cases would allow for a more orderly process and that the
current trial date should be vacated to accommodate the coordinated
proceedings. Defendants also contend that even if the minors’ emotional
distress claims qualify as personal injury, their interests do not constitute a
“substantial interest” in the case. According to Defendants, the phrase “substantial
interest” should be interpreted to mean that the minor’s injury must be a
significant portion of the overall damages in the case. They believe that a
narrow interpretation is necessary to prevent misuse of the trial preference
statute and to ensure that it is only applied in cases where minors have
substantial injuries. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ broad interpretation
could lead to trial preference in almost any case involving minors, regardless
of the severity of their injuries, which would disrupt court dockets and reward
strategic litigation tactics. They emphasize that the adult plaintiffs’
property damage claims far outweigh the minors’ claims, which are estimated to
be less than 3% of the total damages. Therefore, they argue that the minors do
not have a substantial interest in the case.
 
Finally, Defendants argue that they
are prejudiced by the current trial date due to insufficient time for discovery
and preparation. They emphasize that Plaintiffs filed the motion for trial
preference on the same day they served the Defendants, setting a trial date
only 120 days out. Despite diligent efforts, Defendants have faced delays in
receiving discovery responses, subpoenas, and medical records, leaving them
unable to complete essential discovery before trial. Additionally, Plaintiffs
have continued to amend their complaint, further complicating Defendants’ preparation.
They argue that the expedited trial schedule imposed by the trial preference
order has left them without enough time to conduct independent medical
examinations, obtain necessary evidence, or prepare adequately for trial.
Furthermore, they have been unable to file motions for summary adjudication due
to the compressed timeline. 
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs’
arguments and finds that minor plaintiff MSK suffered significant personal
injuries, including severe emotional distress and psychological injury, as a
direct result of the fire, which qualifies as a “substantial interest” in the
case under California Code of Civil Procedure § 36(b). The Court acknowledges
that mental distress, particularly when diagnosed as PTSD and adjustment
disorder, is recognized under California law as a legitimate form of personal
injury, even in the absence of physiological harm. Furthermore, the Court is
persuaded by Plaintiffs’ interpretation that the phrase “substantial interest”
does not require the minor’s injury to constitute a large portion of the
overall damages but rather ensures that the minor has a significant stake in
the outcome of the case. 
 
The Court also notes that
Defendants raise new arguments on reply, specifically regarding coordinated
proceedings. These arguments were not presented in their initial motion. “The general rule of motion
practice, which applies here, is that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers…‘[T]he inclusion of
additional evidentiary matter with the reply should only be allowed in the exceptional case …’ and if
permitted, the other party should be given the opportunity to respond.” (Jay
v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) Notwithstanding,
the Court finds that the Defendants’ arguments regarding the coordination of
cases and the potential impact on trial preference do not alter the Court’s
finding that the trial preference is appropriate in this case given the
significant personal injuries suffered by the minor plaintiff. 
 
As to prejudice, while Defendants
have argued that the expedited timeline has limited their ability to complete
discovery, the Court notes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a consistent
effort to comply with discovery obligations and that any delays or
complications are a natural consequence of the urgency inherent in cases
involving trial preference. Therefore, the Court concludes that maintaining the
current trial date is both just and in accordance with the legislative intent
behind CCP § 36(b).
 
Conclusion
 
            For
the reasons explained above, Defendants’ motion to vacate trial preference and
continue the trial date is DENIED.
 
Motion to Unseal
 
In addition, Defendants filed a
motion to unseal records in case number 24SMCV01140.  That matter is assigned to Department O and
was ordered sealed by that court. 
Defendant should bring any motion to unseal before that court. (See In
re Marriage of Oliverez (2015) 238 Cal. App.4th 1242, 1248-49 (generally,
one trial judge may not reconsider or overrule a ruling of another trial judge while
noting three exceptions that are not applicable here).
