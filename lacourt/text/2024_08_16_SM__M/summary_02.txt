Judge's Tentative Ruling:

Case No. 24SMCV00761 - Passariello, et al. v. Hana, et al.

Counsel Michael Petruzziello and Greenberg and Ruby Injury Attorneys move to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Leandro Carrasquero. They submit all mandatory forms and state that an irreparable breakdown in communication with the client has occurred. The client was served by mail at its last known address and confirmed within the last 30 days.

The court finds that since trial is not set, the client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the proposed order will be signed. Counsel is ordered to give notice to the client.

This ruling is based on California Rules of Procedure, specifically CCP § 284(2) and Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, 3-700(A)(2). The court's discretion in granting or denying a motion to withdraw as counsel is also considered.
