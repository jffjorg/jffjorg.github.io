And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Serop Bejanian v. Jamie Gao, case number 23STCV10907. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract and fraud, with leave to amend. The Court has also granted the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees.

The Court's ruling is based on the pleadings and the meet and confer efforts of the parties. The Court finds that the first cause of action does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action and therefore sustains the demurrer. The Court also finds that the request for attorney's fees is not supported by the pleadings and therefore grants the motion to strike.

The Court has given the parties an opportunity to submit on the tentative ruling and will consider any submissions before issuing a final ruling.
