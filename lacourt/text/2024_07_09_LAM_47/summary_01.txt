And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against Defendant Kenneth Corkum for spoliation of evidence. The Plaintiff's motion was filed without supporting evidence or a memorandum of points and authorities. Additionally, the Plaintiff has already secured a default against the Defendant and is seeking default judgment, which means the Plaintiff has not been harmed by the alleged discovery violations. The Judge cites a previous case, Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994), in which the court held that discovery sanctions should be tailored to the harm caused by withheld discovery. In this case, since the Plaintiff has not been harmed, the motion for sanctions is denied.
