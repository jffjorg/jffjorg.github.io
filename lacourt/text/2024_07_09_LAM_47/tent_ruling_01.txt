  Case Number:  20STCV41680    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  47 Plaintiff purports to move for
sanctions against Defendant Kenneth Corkum for spoliation of evidence. However,
no memorandum of points and authorities nor supporting evidence was included
with Plaintiff’s notice of motion. Moreover, the Court would not be inclined to
award sanctions for discovery violations where Plaintiff has secured default
against this Defendant and is proceeding to default judgment, as discovery
sanctions are to be tailored to the harm caused by the withheld discovery. (Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1618-1619.) Here,
because he has secured default and is moving to obtain default judgment,
Plaintiff does not appear to have been injured in this respect. Plaintiff’s
Motion for Sanctions is therefore DENIED.
