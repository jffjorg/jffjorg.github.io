And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the defendant's costs. The plaintiff had moved to tax the defendant's Memorandum of Costs, but the motion was filed and served well outside the period provided for in the Rules of Court. Even if the motion had been timely served, the plaintiff did not provide any basis for challenging the claimed costs, which consisted exclusively of filing fees. The judge found that the plaintiff's unsupported assertion that the costs were incorrect or invalid did not suffice to put the claimed costs at issue. As a result, the motion was denied as untimely and without merit.
