And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a civil case where the defendant has demurred to the plaintiff's complaint in its entirety and has moved to strike the complaint. The court finds that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend because the plaintiff's claims are barred by claim preclusion. The court notes that the plaintiff has alleged the same harm in five other civil actions, all of which were dismissed following a demurrer. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims in this action are therefore barred by claim preclusion. The defendant's motion to strike is moot because the demurrer has been sustained.
