Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable
costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and
must be reasonable in amount.  An item not specifically allowable under
Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be
recoverable in the discretion of the court if it meets the above requirements
(i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount).  If the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
(Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they
are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the
litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is
reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.)  However, because
the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court has no discretion
to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.)  Discretion
is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds of reason,
all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
moves to tax the entirety of Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs. 
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here, Defendant
served the memorandum of costs by mail on January 25, 2024. (Memorandum of
Costs POS.) Plaintiff’s motion was filed and served on March 18, 2024, well
outside the period provided for in the Rules of Court. For that reason alone,
the Court is within its rights to deny the motion as untimely.
 
Moreover, even if the motion had been timely served, Plaintiff
offers no basis for his challenge to the claimed costs, which consist
exclusively of filing fees, beyond his unsupported assertion that the costs are
incorrect or invalid. Plaintiff’s assertion does not suffice to place the
claimed costs at issue. The Motion to Tax Costs is therefore untimely and
without merit.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.
 
            Moving party to give notice. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
