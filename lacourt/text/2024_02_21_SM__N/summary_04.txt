And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff John Oursland's motions to compel compliance with requests for production of documents from Defendants Joe Sherman and Catherine Bampoky. The defendants failed to respond to the requests within the specified time frame. As a result, the court ordered the defendants to provide code-compliant responses, without objections, within 20 days of the entry of this order.

Additionally, the court granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $510.00, payable by the defendants to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the entry of this order. The court reduced the amount of the sanctions from the requested $2,560.00, as the matter was not particularly complex and the time spent preparing the motions and appearing at the hearing was reasonable.
