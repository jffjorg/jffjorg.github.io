 Case Number:  21STCV20318    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULING  (this is demurrer to complaint in 21STCV27187)Defendant FlipKey LLC’s Demurrer[] to Complaint of Erin Hughes (Case No. 21STCV27187) is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.Plaintiff Erin Hughes may amend her complaint only as authorized by the Court’s order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without having obtained permission to do so. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.)Defendant FlipKey LLC to give notice. REASONINGRequest for Judicial NoticeDefendant FlipKey LLC (“Defendant”) requests judicial notice of the complaint filed in Case No. 21STCV29429 (Seeler v. Booking.com B.V.) and the allegation therein that “[t]he subject property had been booked through Defendant Booking.com B.V.’s website.” Defendant’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), but the Court notes that it only takes “judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in documents such as orders, findings of fact and conclusions of law, and judgments.” (Day v. Sharp (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914.)Plaintiff Erin Hughes (“Plaintiff”) requests judicial notice of Defendant Tripadvisor LLC’s responses to Plaintiffs Holly Seeler and Tess Fisher’s Special Interrogatories, Set One in Case No. 21STCV20318. Plaintiff’s request is DENIED, as there is no basis to take judicial notice of this discovery here.Legal Standard“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967), but the Court does not “assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law” (Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125).Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)First Cause of Action: NegligenceIn order to state a claim for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)In the first cause of action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Holly Seeler rented the property between January 15 to 17, 2021, from Plaintiff to hold a “celebration of life” memorial event, which included lighting 22 candles, and Seeler allegedly failed to take proper safety precautions during the event on January 16, 2021, by lighting candles unsafely inside the property and failing to properly supervisor guests. (Compl., p. 4.) Seeler’s conduct allegedly caused a fire on the morning of January 17, 2021, resulting in damage to the property, and Hughes’ personal property was stolen in excess of $2,000,000. (Ibid.)Plaintiff provides no allegations as to the conduct underlying liability for Defendant. In her opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff argues that all defendants generally breached a duty of care to her in failing to enforce safety precautions (Opp’n, p. 2), and Plaintiff cites to discovery responses which are not subject to judicial notice here. Put simply, there are no allegations which may allow the trier of fact to determine that Defendant was negligent in any manner, as the allegations focus solely on Seeler’s conduct. Plaintiff shall amend the complaint to provide specific allegations against Defendant for this claim to continue. Accordingly, Defendant FlipKey LLC’s Demurrer[] to Complaint of Erin Hughes (Case No. 21STCV27187) is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.
