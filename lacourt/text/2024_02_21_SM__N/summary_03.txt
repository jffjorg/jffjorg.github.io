Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud is OVERRULED, and the demurrer to the ninth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is also OVERRULED. The motion to strike is GRANTED with thirty (30) days leave to amend. The judge has found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for fraud, but the plaintiffs must allege specific facts to support an award for punitive damages. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs' use of conclusory statements renders their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress insufficient.
