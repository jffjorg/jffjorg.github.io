And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the complaint in case number 21STCV27187. The demurrer was filed by defendant FlipKey LLC, and the judge has sustained it with 30 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Erin Hughes, claimed that FlipKey LLC was negligent in failing to enforce safety precautions during the rental of the property, but did not provide specific allegations against the defendant. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to state a claim for negligence and that the plaintiff had not shown a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The judge granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of a complaint filed in a different case, but denied the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of discovery responses. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff must amend the complaint to provide specific allegations against the defendant in order to continue the claim.
