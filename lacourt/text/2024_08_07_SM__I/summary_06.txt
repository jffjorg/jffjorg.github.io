The judge has reviewed the referee's report and recommendation to deny the motion for sanctions on procedural grounds. The court will discuss this with the parties and review the transcript ordered by the referee. Additionally, the court will discuss the readiness for trial and the sanctions motion. Given the complexity of the case, it's unclear if the matter will be ready for trial on the original dates of August 12 or 13. The court is considering continuing the trial dates to allow for a fuller discussion of the issues.
