 Case Number:  24SMCV00481    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  I The court has received the notice of settlement filed
7/25/24.  That makes the two motions on
calendar for today MOOT and there will be no hearing on them.  There is also no need for a CMC, so that will
go off calendar as well.  The court will
set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for some time in the future.  The court would prefer not to hold the case
on the docket for six more months, as the parties request.  Rather, the court would prefer a dismissal
but with a provision that the court retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section
664.6.  The court will discuss that with
the parties.
