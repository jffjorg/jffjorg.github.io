And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages in a case involving a plaintiff who claims that a defendant's overwatering of plants caused water to intrude into their unit and damaged their property. The judge has denied the motion, but only on narrow grounds. The judge does not believe that the overwatering alone is sufficient to warrant punitive damages, as it is not malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct. However, the judge has identified a potential issue with the case that could support a claim of fraud, specifically the defendant's alleged promise to fix the problem and the plaintiff's failure to take action due to that promise. The judge has ordered further discovery and a summary adjudication hearing to determine whether the plaintiff has sufficient evidence to prove fraud.
