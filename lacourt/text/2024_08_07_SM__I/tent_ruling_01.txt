  Case Number:  23SMCV00409    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.  The reasons are intuitively obvious and the
opposition ought not to have been filed. 
Plaintiff will file the amended complaint as a standalone document
within 5 court days.  Defendant will have
the time allowed by law to answer or otherwise respond to it, but given the
nature of the amendment, the court is not sure there is a proper demurrer to be
made.
