 Case Number:  SC125609    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the referee’s recommendation to
this court that the motion for sanctions be denied on procedural grounds.  The court will discuss that with the parties,
and the court will be interested in reviewing the transcript that the referee
ordered by lodged.  The court will also
discuss readiness for trial.  The court
has received the parties’ submissions regarding FSC materials.  That said, and in light of the referee’s
report and recommendation, it is far from clear that the matter will be ready
for trial on August 12 or August 13 (the court will be dark on August 12 and
therefore that calendar is being continued to the next day).  Under the circumstances, it might be better
to have a fuller discussion at that time about trial readiness and the
sanctions motion.
