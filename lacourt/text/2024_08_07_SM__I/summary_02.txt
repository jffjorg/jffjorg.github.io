The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Miles against Viridity's cross-complaint. The cross-complaint seeks declaratory relief and damages against Miles for breach of contract and fraud. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action (breach of contract) without leave to amend, finding that Viridity is not a third party beneficiary of the Miles/MLG contract. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer as to the third cause of action (fraud), finding that the allegations of fraud are stated with particularity and that Miles has a duty to negotiate in good faith with Viridity. The judge has given Miles 30 days' leave to answer the cross-complaint.
