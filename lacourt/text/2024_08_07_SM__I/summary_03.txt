And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case 24SMCV00423, denying the application to postpone the hearing on August 14, 2024. The court allows the plaintiff to withdraw the Motion to Assign, which will take it off the calendar for the same date. The court notes that the issue of service needs to be adjudicated eventually, but it does not need to be resolved on August 14, 2024. The hearing on that date will proceed as scheduled, with the motion to quash and the motion to stay on the docket. The court is aware of potential conflicts and the plaintiff's need to testify in another court, but these do not preclude the current motions. The judge has not reviewed the defendant's opposition and may reconsider the ruling if the defendant requests a postponement to allow the court to review the papers.
