 Case Number:  23STCV12420    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  26 The
request for default judgment submitted on September 27, 2023 is DENIED for the
following reasons:
 
 
The
Court may not enter judgment in an amount exceeding the amount demanded in the
Complaint.  (CCP 585(b).)  Here, the Complaint fails to give notice of
the amount of damages that Plaintiff seeks to recover.  Plaintiff must file and serve an amended
complaint that gives notice of the amount of damages that Plaintiff seeks to
recover.  If Defendant again fails to
respond upon being served with the amended complaint, Plaintiff can request
that Defendant’s default be entered on the Amended Complaint, then seek a
default judgment in an amount equal to or less than that stated in the Amended
Complaint.
 
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s
fees is not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214.  Nor is Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s
fees supported by a declaration explaining why a greater amount should be
awarded, including an itemized statement of the services rendered or to be
rendered.
 
 
Due
to the one-judgment rule, judgment must be entered at the same time for all
parties.  No request for dismissal
(Judicial Council Form No. CIV-110) has been filed for all remaining named and
unnamed defendants (including all un-served Doe defendants).  Plaintiff must file a CIV-110 as to all
unnamed Doe defendants.
 
Court
Clerk to give notice.
