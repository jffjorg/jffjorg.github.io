And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's renewed motion for an appointment of a receiver to enforce a monetary judgment against the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Hedgefog Research, Inc., had previously requested an appointment of a receivership three times, which the Court had denied. The Defendant, Precision Ocular Metrology, LLC, is an inactive company, and the Plaintiff has not attempted to enforce the judgment in New Mexico where the Defendant and its relevant personnel are.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of a receiver, which is a drastic and costly remedy. The Plaintiff's attempts to enforce the judgment have been insufficient, and the Plaintiff has not presented evidence to support its claims. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff should have attempted to enforce the judgment in New Mexico, where the Defendant and its relevant personnel are, rather than repeatedly attempting to invoke the extreme measure of a receivership in the instant Court.

## English Text Summary

This judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's request to appoint a receiver to enforce a money judgment against the Defendant.

The judge explains that appointing a receiver is a drastic measure, normally reserved for exceptional circumstances where the Defendant is actively trying to avoid paying the judgment.

Here, the Defendant is inactive and allegedly moved its assets through different business entities. While the Plaintiff claims this is an attempt to frustrate the judgment, the judge finds it insufficient to warrant the appointment of a receiver. 

The judge also notes that the Plaintiff has known all along that the Defendant is based in New Mexico and could have enforced the judgment there. Instead, the Plaintiff has repeatedly sought this extreme remedy in California.  

Therefore, the Judge denies the motion for appointment of a receiver.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Hedgefog Research, Inc.'s renewed motion for the appointment of a receiver to enforce a simple money judgment against Defendant Precision Ocular Metrology, LLC. The judge found that Plaintiff fails to present exceptional circumstances that would warrant the extreme remedy of a receiver. The judge noted that the default judgment against Defendant was entered on July 27, 2020, and Plaintiff has since filed three motions for an appointment of a receiver, which were denied. The judge also found that Plaintiff's attempts to enforce the judgment through various means, including serving written discovery and obtaining a writ of execution, have been unsuccessful. The judge concluded that the appointment of a receiver is not necessary in this case, and that Plaintiff should have attempted to enforce the judgment in the jurisdiction where Defendant is located, New Mexico.

English text:
The tentative ruling is for the denial of the renewed motion for appointment of a receiver by the plaintiff, hedgefog research, inc., in the case 20STCV02732. The plaintiff has previously requested an appointment of a receivership three times, which the court has denied. The plaintiff seeks the same relief in the renewed motion, but the requirements for a renewed motion must be fulfilled. The plaintiff has raised new facts that they have made some other attempts at enforcing the judgment, but these attempts are insufficient to warrant the appointment of a receiver. The court has entered a simple money judgment against the defendant, precision ocular metrology, but the evidence presented by the plaintiff does not demonstrate exceptional circumstances supporting the drastic and extreme remedy sought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's evidence demonstrates that the defendant is no longer active, and a defunct, inactive company's failure to respond to written discovery does not evidence an intentional act to frustrate the plaintiff's attempts to enforce the judgment. The plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support their claim that the assignment order was ineffective. The plaintiff's failure to obtain a judgment debtor examination based on distance is not an exceptional circumstance warranting the appointment of a receiver. The plaintiff should have been aware that they would likely need to enforce any money judgment by enforcing the judgment in New Mexico, where the principle place of business and presumably the defendant's relevant personnel would be. The final determinations by the courts of one state are entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of its sister states. The plaintiff has not attempted to enforce the judgment in New Mexico, where the defendant and its relevant personnel are presumably located. The plaintiff fails to present the necessary exceptional circumstances for the extreme remedy sought. Accordingly, the instant motion is denied.
