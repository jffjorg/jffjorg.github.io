And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's renewed motion for an appointment of a receiver to enforce a monetary judgment against the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Hedgefog Research, Inc., had previously requested an appointment of a receivership three times, which the Court had denied. The Defendant, Precision Ocular Metrology, LLC, is an inactive company, and the Plaintiff has not attempted to enforce the judgment in New Mexico where the Defendant and its relevant personnel are.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of a receiver, which is a drastic and costly remedy. The Plaintiff's attempts to enforce the judgment have been insufficient, and the Plaintiff has not presented evidence to support its claims. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff should have attempted to enforce the judgment in New Mexico, where the Defendant and its relevant personnel are, rather than repeatedly attempting to invoke the extreme measure of a receivership in the instant Court.
