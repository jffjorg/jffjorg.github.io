And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the request for default judgment. The request is denied due to several reasons. Firstly, the Complaint fails to provide notice of the amount of damages the Plaintiff seeks to recover, which is a requirement under CCP 585(b). The Plaintiff must file an amended Complaint that provides this information. Secondly, the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214 and lacks supporting documentation. Thirdly, the Plaintiff has not filed a request for dismissal (Judicial Council Form No. CIV-110) for all remaining named and unnamed defendants. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to file the amended Complaint and the request for dismissal, and then seek default judgment in an amount equal to or less than the amount stated in the amended Complaint.
