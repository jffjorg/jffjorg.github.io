Secondly, the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214 and lacks supporting documentation. Thirdly, the Plaintiff has not filed a request for dismissal (Judicial Council Form No. CIV-110) for all remaining named and unnamed defendants. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to file the amended Complaint and the request for dismissal, and then seek default judgment in an amount equal to or less than the amount stated in the amended Complaint.

## English Summary

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment due to several issues. 

The main problem is that the original complaint does not specify the amount of damages the plaintiff is seeking. The judge ruled that the plaintiff must file an amended complaint clearly stating the amount of damages. 

Additionally, the judge found the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees to be insufficient. The request did not comply with local court rules and lacked a detailed explanation and itemization of the legal services provided.

Finally, the judge noted that a dismissal request must be filed for all remaining defendants, including unnamed "Doe" defendants, before a judgment can be entered.

The judge's tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment filed on September 27, 2023, for several reasons. First, the Complaint did not provide notice of the amount of damages the plaintiff seeks to recover, and therefore, the Court may not enter judgment in an amount exceeding the amount demanded in the Complaint. The plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint that provides notice of the damages before seeking a default judgment. Second, the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214, and the request was not supported by a declaration explaining why a greater amount should be awarded. Additionally, the plaintiff must file a request for dismissal (CIV-110) for all unnamed Doe defendants. The Court Clerk is to give notice of this ruling.

Here is an English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:
The Judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment due to several issues with the complaint. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought, and the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not supported by a declaration and does not follow the required calculations. The Judge has also noted that a judgment cannot be entered until all parties, including unnamed defendants, have been properly served and/or dismissed. The plaintiff is required to file an amended complaint specifying the damages sought, and then can request default judgment in an amount not exceeding the stated damages. Additionally, the plaintiff must provide proper support for their request for attorney's fees and dismiss any remaining unnamed defendants before a judgment can be entered. The Court Clerk will notify the parties of the Judge's tentative ruling.
