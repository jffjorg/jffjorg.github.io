Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the defendants' motion to strike certain portions of the second amended complaint. Specifically, the Court has struck allegations pertaining to an alleged conflict of interest that arose during legal representation from 2012 to 2015. The Court has concluded that the statute of limitations began running at or near the time of the underlying transaction in 2015, and that the claims pertaining to the conflict of interest are untimely on their face. The Court has also dismissed the plaintiffs' arguments that the delayed discovery rule applies and that the continuous representation doctrine applies. The Court has concluded that the actual injury in this matter occurred in 2015, and that the one-year statute of limitations began running at that time.
