And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment in this case. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff, Darnell Hines, had passed away on October 18, 2023, and therefore the judgment should be vacated. However, the Judge found that the defendant had not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the plaintiff who passed away was the same person as the plaintiff in this action. Additionally, the Judge found that the relief granted to the plaintiff did not exceed the demand of the complaint, and therefore the defendant's motion was denied. The Judge also denied the defendant's alternative motion to vacate the judgment on the grounds that the complaint fails to allege a specific amount of monetary damages, citing case law that the complaint's prayer for damages is sufficient to set a ceiling on recovery.
