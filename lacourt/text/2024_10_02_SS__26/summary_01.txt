  - Petitioner: Brian Heinz
  - Respondent: TikTok, Inc., et al
  - Judge: [Name of Judge]
Significant Statements:
  - The Court must determine what the parties have agreed to—i.e., which contract controls.
  - The language “any claims” in the July 2023 Terms of Service applies to claims regardless of when they arose.
  - The Court must consider whether this change in language between the February 2019 and May 2023 terms of service—namely that the latter terms of service failed to include language that they applied to “all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement”—makes a difference to whether the July 2023 Terms of Service apply retroactively.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Petitioner Brian Heinz's Petition to Compel Arbitration is denied. The Petitioner had sought to compel arbitration of a dispute with Respondent TikTok, Inc., et al, but the judge has determined that there is no agreement to arbitrate the dispute.

The dispute centered around the existence of an arbitration agreement and the scope of that agreement. The Petitioner had argued that an arbitration agreement was in place based on the February 2019 Terms of Service, but the Respondent had countered that the agreement was superseded by subsequent terms of service, including the July 31, 2023 Terms of Service, which eliminated arbitration as a means of dispute resolution.

The judge has held that the July 31, 2023 Terms of Service, which were brought to the Petitioner's attention through a pop-up notice, are binding on the parties and that the Petitioner has not demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement as required to compel arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2. Therefore, the Petition to Compel Arbitration is denied.
