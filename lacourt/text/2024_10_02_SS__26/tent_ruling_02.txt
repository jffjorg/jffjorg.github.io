Discussion

 
Allegations in the First Amended Complaint
 
The First Amended Complaint alleges a single cause of action
for violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”) at Penal Code section
638.51(a). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant secretly deployed spyware at its
website, www.plivo.com/ (the “Website”) that accesses visitors’ devices and
installed tracking spyware before obtaining consent to do so, and then monitors
and reports visitors’ online habits after they leave the Website. (FAC, p. 2:2-3.)
Plaintiff recently visited Defendant’s Website and without Plaintiff’s
knowledge or consent, Defendant secretly accessed Plaintiff’s device and
installed “pen register” and “trap and trace” tracking software in violation of
California law. (Id. at p. 2:5-7.) Cal. Penal Code section 638.51(a) prohibits
any “person” from “install[ing] or us[ing] a pen register or a trap and trace
device without first obtaining a court order.” (Id. at ¶10.) Defendant
installs the pen register or trap and trace device (“PR/TT”) beacon on the
user’s browser, and such PR/TT beacon collects users’ IP addresses. (Id.
at ¶37.) Defendant uses the PR/TT beacon to “digitally fingerprint” each
visitor but at no time prior to use of the PR/TT beacon obtained users’ consent
or a court order. (Id. at ¶¶52-53.) As a result, Plaintiff had her
privacy invaded by Defendant’s violations of Penal Code section 638.51(a). (Id.
at ¶¶75.)
 
Demurrer
 
Defendant demurs to the First
Amended Complaint for failure to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) The demurrer is
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41. (Motion, Pearson Decl., ¶3.) 
 
The demurrer is brought on the grounds that section 638.51
of the CIPA does not prohibit the used of technology on a website to collect
visitors’ IP addresses and the First Amended Complaint does not allege facts
that plausibly establish the use of a pen register. Penal Code section 638.51
subdivision (a) states in relevant part: “Except as provided in subdivision
(b), a person may not install or use a pen register or a trap and trace device
without first obtaining a court order pursuant to Section
638.52 or 638.53.”
(Pen. Code, § 638.51, subd. (a).) A pen register is defined as “a device or
process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling
information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or
electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a
communication.” (Pen. Code, § 638.50, subd. (b).) 
 
As there are no controlling state law cases on this statute,
the Court must look to federal court rulings for guidance. In determining
whether a device is a pen register, courts must look to the type of information
being collected and not the device or process. (Greenley v. Kochava, Inc.
(S.D. Cal. 2023) 684 F.Supp.3d 1024, 1050.) This is because what constitutes a
pen register has changed as technology has shifted from telephone communication
to internet-based communications. (In re Application of U.S. for an Ord.
Authorizing use of A Pen Reg. & Trap On (XXX) Internet Serv. Acct./User
Name, (xxxxxxxx@xxx.com) (D. Mass. 2005) 396 F. Supp. 2d 45, 47; Greenley,
supra, 684 F.Supp.3d at 1050.) 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s IP address is not the type
of information that parties are prohibited from collecting by CIPA. First,
because Plaintiff voluntarily provided the information and could have no
expectation of privacy in it. (See Smith v. Maryland (1979) 442 U.S.
735, 744.) This is implicit in the allegations explaining “the IP address enables
a device to communicate with another device—such as a computer’s browser
communicating with a server.” (FAC, ¶35.) Plaintiff’s computer could not have
accessed Defendant’s website unless it provided her IP address. 
 
Second, Plaintiff’s IP address is not the type of
information collected by pen registers. Pen registers collect outgoing
information, such as outgoing telephone numbers, outgoing email addresses, IP
addresses of websites visited, location data that reveals sensitive
information, and cell site information. (In re Application of U.S. for an
Ord. Authorizing use of A Pen Reg. & Trap, supra, 396 F. Supp. 2d at 48;
Greenley, supra, 684 F.Supp.3d at 1047; (In re Application of U.S.
for an Ord. for Disclosure of Telecommunications Recs. & Authorizing the
Use of a Pen Reg. & Trap & Trace (S.D.N.Y. 2005) 405 F. Supp. 2d
435, 441; United States v. Forrester (9th Cir. 2008) 512 F.3d 500, 510.)
Although Plaintiff alleges that the IP address could reveal the device’s state,
city, and zip code, this is not the type of sensitive data to which the Greenley
court referred. (Greenley, supra, 684 F.Supp.3d at 1047 [“the Amended
Complaint outlines a data collection system that compiles “rich personal data,”
including the “[i]dentification of sensitive and private characteristics of
consumers from the location data sold.”].) Plaintiff’s device’s city and zip
code information is not analogous to this type of information, which included “a
person's religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and medical condition.” (Ibid.)
Indeed, a federal district court asked to deny a plaintiff’s discovery request
that the defendants produce incoming IP addresses on the grounds that the
discovery request violated the federal pen-register statute, refused to do so.
(Columbia Pictures Indus. v. Bunnell (C.D. Cal. May 29, 2007) No. CV
06-1093FMCJCX, 2007 WL 2080419, at *11 [“the collection of incoming IP
addresses by defendants is exempt from this prohibition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
3121(b)(1) because defendants already and necessarily capture such data in
their RAM (or Panther’s RAM) to operate the website.”].) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant has demonstrated that the
First Amended Complaint fails to allege facts showing that it violated CIPA at Penal
Code section 638.51, subdivision (a). Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition to
the instant Demurrer demonstrating what facts could be alleged to support this
cause of action, as is Plaintiff’s burden if seeking leave to amend. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) Leave to amend is denied.
