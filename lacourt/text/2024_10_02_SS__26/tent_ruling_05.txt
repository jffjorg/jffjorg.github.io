AMOUNT OF $8,530.50. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiffs 2515 Thurman, LLC and Brian
Haydel (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for unlawful detainer and rental
damages against Defendants Trinton Hurt, Eddie Mendez, and Chris Jimenez (“Defendants”).
The action was originally assigned to Department 97 in the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse. On March 27, 2024, upon a finding by the Court that possession was
no longer at issue, the matter was referred to Department 1 for reassignment.
(Minute Order, 03/27/24.) The case was then assigned to a Limited Jurisdiction
Department, Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. (Minute Order,
04/02/24.) On April 11, 2024, the Court set Plaintiffs’ (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request For
Sanctions, filed on March 7, 2024, for hearing in Department 26 on May 1, 2024.
(Minute Order, 04/11/24.) 
 
On May 1, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ discovery
motions on the grounds that they were premature and ordered Plaintiffs and
counsel of record to pay sanctions of $800.00 to defense counsel. (Minute
Order, 05/01/24.) On May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for
Reconsideration of the discovery order, which was set for hearing on July 29,
2024. Defendants filed an opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration on May
31, 2024. 
 
On July 24, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion for
Sanctions. The Motion for Reconsideration was withdrawn by Plaintiffs on the
same date. No opposition to the Motion for Sanctions has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, 
 
[R]equires that at least one attorney,
or the party if he/she is not represented by an attorney, sign all pleadings,
petitions, notice of motions and other similar papers. [Citation.] The
signature indicates that the attorney, or party, certifies that: the paper is
not being presented for an improper purpose; the legal contentions are
warranted by law or nonfrivolous argument for extension, modification or
reversal of existing law; the allegations and factual contentions have
evidentiary support or are likely to have such support after a reasonable
opportunity to further investigate; and the denials of factual contentions are
warranted by the evidence. [Citation.] If the court determines, after notice or
a reasonable opportunity to respond, that the attorney or party improperly
certified the document, it may impose a proper sanction.
 
(Barnes v. Department of
Corrections (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 126, 130.) In addition, section 128.7
contains a “safe harbor” provision specifying the motion for sanctions may not
be filed “unless, within 21 days after service of the motion, ... the
challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not
withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd.
(c)(1).)
 
Defendants complied with the safe
harbor provision by serving the Motion for Sanctions on May 31, 2024 and filing
it 54 days later on July 24, 2024. The Motion for Sanctions is brought on the
grounds that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration did not comply with the
statutory requirements. Sanctions on this basis are also permitted by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (d). 
 
 
 
Propriety of Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Reconsideration
 
A motion for reconsideration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a) must be made “within 10
days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and [be]
based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the Court’s May 1, 2024
order regarding their discovery motions. 
 
                 Timing
of the Motion for Reconsideration
 
Notice of May 1, 2024 order was
served on both parties by the clerk on the same date. (Certificate of Mailing,
05/01/24.) The Motion for Reconsideration, however, was not filed or served
until May 28, 2024. Therefore, the Court had no jurisdiction to grant the
request for reconsideration. (Kerns v. CSE Ins. Group (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 368, 391 [“the procedural prerequisites set forth for
reconsideration of orders and renewal of motions previously denied are
jurisdictional as applied to the actions of parties to civil litigation.”].) 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel contends they
searched “high and low” for notice of the Court’s May 1, 2024 order but have
been unable to locate it and were only made aware of the ruling following
service of the order by defense counsel on May 21, 2024. (Motion for
Reconsideration, Poulter Decl., ¶7.) It appears that Plaintiffs’ counsel
changed their address soon after this action was filed but did not provide the
Court with notice of the change. In the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs on
January 23, 2024, their attorney’s address is listed as 8117 Gonzaga Ave., Los
Angeles, California. (Compl., p. 1.) Less than two weeks later, on an ex parte
application by Plaintiffs, their counsel’s address is listed as 8383 Wilshire
Blvd., Ste. 822 Beverly Hills, California. (Ex Parte App., filed 02/05/24, p.
1.) The Court has been sending notice of its orders to Plaintiffs’ counsel at
the 8117 Gonzaga Avenue address and will continue to do so until a notice of
change of address is filed. (See Certificates of Mailing, 04/11/24 and 05/01/24.)
Despite Plaintiffs’ counsel’s inability to locate the notice of mailing from
the Court for the May 1, 2024 order, a simple check of the Court’s docket would
have revealed the certificate of mailing and the problem with the service
address.
 
Plaintiffs argue that despite the
Motion for Reconsideration being untimely, the Court has could reconsider its
ruling sua sponte. While this is within the Court’s inherent authority,
it has not made any motion to reconsider its discovery ruling such that
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, which is governed by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, can be rescued from its lack of timeliness. 
 
                 New
or Different Facts, Circumstances, or Law
 
A showing of new
or different facts, circumstances, or law is also a jurisdictional requirement
for a litigant’s motion for reconsideration. Additionally, there is a diligence requirement: “Courts have
construed section 1008 to require a party filing an application for
reconsideration or a renewed application to show diligence with a satisfactory
explanation for not having presented the new or different information earlier.”
(Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC
(2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.) One of the new or different facts or
circumstances to which Plaintiffs’ counsel points is that on May 1, 2024, he
was unaware of the hearing on the discovery motions and in any event, could not
attend due to being on paternity leave. (Motion for Reconsideration, Poulter
Decl., ¶4.) Plaintiffs’ counsel was not aware of the May 1, 2024 hearing in
part due to his failure to provide the Court with a notice of change of
address. Notice of the hearing date was served on both parties on April 11,
2024. (Certificate of Mailing, 04/11/24.) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s address should
have been corrected with the Court in January 2024.
 
The fact of
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s paternity leave should also have been presented to the
Court earlier. While defense counsel was purportedly aware that Plaintiffs’
counsel was on leave, no notice of unavailability was filed with the Court.
Given that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s paternity leave began on April 9, 2024, no
explanation is provided as to why a notice of unavailability was not filed well
in advance of the hearing on May 1, 2024. As a solo practitioner, Plaintiffs’
counsel cannot think it excusable to cease communication on an action for close
to a month without notice to the Court. The Motion, therefore, does not
demonstrate a satisfactory and timely explanation for Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
failure to appear at the hearing on May 1, 2024, either due to Plaintiff’s
counsel’s paternity leave, or due to the lack of actual notice of the hearing
date. 
 
Finally,
Plaintiffs contend that a new or different fact is that as of the hearing on
the discovery motions, Defendants had not served verified responses to the
discovery requests, such that the motions compelling responses or deemed
admissions were not premature. The Discovery Code, however, dictates that
motions concerning initial responses should not filed until a party fails to
serve a timely response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2033.280.) The date on
which the discovery motions were filed, not the date of the hearing, dictated
whether the discovery motions were premature. If the Court were to grant
discovery motions filed prior to the date on which a timely response to the
requests was due, this would not only contravene the express statutory
language, it would also create a law and motion quagmire where litigants might
prematurely file discovery motions to gain leverage over the party on whom the
discovery has been propounded. Defendants’ lack of response to the discovery by
the time of the hearing, therefore, would not have changed the Court’s ruling that
the motions were premature, nor its award of sanctions against Plaintiffs. 
 
            Award of Sanctions
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds the Motion for Reconsideration was presented for an
improper purpose, namely to excuse Plaintiffs’ counsel’s numerous and
inexcusable missteps as set forth above. Also, as explained above, the legal
contentions regarding reconsideration of the ruling on the discovery orders
were not warranted by law, nor did Plaintiffs’ factual contentions for
reconsideration have evidentiary support. Furthermore, Plaintiffs had 54 days
in which to withdraw the Motion for Reconsideration but did not do so until
four days before the hearing set for July 29, 2024. This forced Defendants to
file an opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration and the instant Motion for
Sanctions, and incur the costs and fees associated therewith. Accordingly,
Defendants are entitled to an award of sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.7.
 
Due to Plaintiffs’ filing of the
Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants incurred fees and costs in connection
with their opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration and the instant Motion
for Sanctions. Defense counsel spent 5.4 hours on the instant Motion and
anticipated another three hours to address any opposition and attend the
hearing. (Motion, Ackerman Decl., ¶¶24-25.) Since there is no opposition to the
instant Motion, the Court reduces that additional time to 0.5 hours to attend
the hearing for a total of 5.9 hours reasonably spent on the Motion for
Sanctions. With respect to their opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration,
defense counsel spent 6.2 hours and anticipated an additional two hours for the
hearing. (Id. at ¶¶26-27.) The two hours was not necessary because the
hearing was taken off calendar. Finally, defense counsel bills at an hourly
rate of $705.00 based on eleven years of practice in consumer/plaintiff-side
civil litigation, the Laffey Matrix, and the 2024 General Schedule Locality Pay
for Los Angeles County. (Id. at ¶¶29-32.) Based on the foregoing, the
lodestar is $8,530.50 based on 12.1 hours billed at $705.00. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Trinton
Hurt, Eddie Mendez, and Chris Jimenez’s Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED IN THE
AMOUNT OF $8,530.50.
