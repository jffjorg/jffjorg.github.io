Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Plivo, Inc. dba www.plivo.com to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Rebeka Rodriguez. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by deploying spyware on its website that accessed visitors' devices and installed tracking software without their consent.

The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's IP address is not the type of information that parties are prohibited from collecting under the California Invasion of Privacy Act, and that the Plaintiff's allegations do not plausibly establish the use of a pen register. The Judge has found that the Defendant has demonstrated that the First Amended Complaint fails to allege facts showing that it violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, and has therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
