Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendants' motion for sanctions in the amount of $8,530.50. The defendants had moved for sanctions against the plaintiffs, alleging that the plaintiffs' counsel had failed to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure, including providing notice of change of address and serving verified responses to discovery requests.

The Judge found that the plaintiffs' counsel had failed to provide notice of change of address, which resulted in the counsel missing the deadline for filing a motion for reconsideration. The Judge also found that the counsel was on paternity leave and failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for missing the hearing.

The Judge further found that the motion for reconsideration was untimely and that the plaintiffs' counsel had failed to demonstrate diligence in presenting new or different facts or circumstances to support the motion.

The Judge granted the motion for sanctions based on the plaintiffs' counsel's numerous and inexcusable missteps, including failing to provide notice of change of address, failing to appear at the hearing, and failing to provide a satisfactory explanation for missing the hearing. The Judge also found that the plaintiffs had failed to withdraw the motion for reconsideration in a timely manner, which forced the defendants to incur additional costs and fees in connection with their opposition to the motion.
