BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of an auto
accident which occurred on February 16, 2022. On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff
Hamlet Sahakyan and Sara Galumian filed a complaint against Defendant Rosalina
Michel for general negligence. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant
Rosalina Michel’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Rosalina Michel moves this
court for leave to file a cross-complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 426.50 and 428.50 on the grounds that the proposed cross-complaint arises
out of the same transaction as the complaint and is a “related cause of action”
under Code of Civil Procedure § 426.10, but was inadvertently and on good faith
not previously pleaded. 
 
Where a defendant wishes to assert a
“related cause of action” against plaintiff, it must do so in a
cross-complaint. Failure to plead it will bar defendant from asserting it in a
later lawsuit. (CCP § 426.10 [“‘Related cause of action’ means a cause of
action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of
transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges
in his complaint.”].) 
 
A cross-complaint against plaintiff may
be filed as a matter of right if it is filed before or at the same time as the
answer. (CCP § 428.50(a).) Otherwise, leave of court must be obtained. (CCP §
428.50(c).) Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during
the course of¿the action.¿(Id., § 428.50(c).) Indeed, where a cause of
action would otherwise be lost, leave to amend is appropriate even if the party
was negligent in not moving for leave to amend earlier.¿ “The legislative
mandate is clear.¿ A policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid
forfeiture of causes of action is imposed on the trial court.”¿ Silver
Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98-99 (Silver
Orgs).¿[“Factors such as oversight, inadvertence, neglect, mistake or other
cause, are insufficient grounds to deny the motion unless accompanied by bad
faith.”]; Sidney v. Superior Court (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 710, 718 [a
“strong showing of bad faith” is required].)  
 
The court finds Defendant Michel is
entitled to file the proposed Cross-Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 426.50. Defendant has met their burden in showing the
cross-complaint arises from the same transaction, occurrence, or series of
transactions or occurrences as Plaintiff’s complaint. The indemnification,
declaratory relief and apportionment of fault that Defendant invokes arise from
the same incident that Plaintiff’s complaint is based on. Through oversight,
Defense counsel neglected to file a Cross-Complaint for indemnity and property damage
at the time of serving Plaintiff’s Answer to the Complaint. (Hemati Decl. ¶7.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Rosalina
Michel’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. Defendant is
ordered to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint attached to Hootan
Hemati’s declaration in Exhibit A within ten (10) days of this ruling.
