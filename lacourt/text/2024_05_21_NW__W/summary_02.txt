And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, which means the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action against the defendant. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as public entities are immune from claims for punitive damages. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to fix the defects.
