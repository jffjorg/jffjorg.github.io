  Case Number:  24STCP00752    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  14 DECISION:        The First Amended Petition fails to provide the following information
required by Insurance Code §10139.5(c): 

 

Quivac’s address.
The name and address of Quivac’s minor child.
Quivac’s source of monthly income and financial resources

 
            The First Amended Petition also
relies on multiple Amended documents that were submitted after it was served
and filed.  Petitioner must submit a
complete Second Amended Petition with all amended attachments and serve that
complete Second Amended Petition on all interest parties.  In addition, Petitioner should attach the
Notice to Attorney identified in the Proof of Service.  Finally, Quivac’s declaration in lieu of the
settlement agreement improperly states that a copy is unavailable.  Petitioner lodged a copy of the confidential
settlement agreement with the court according to the Notice of Lodgment filed
on May 15, 2024.  
 
            In order to assess whether the
transfer is “fair and reasonable” and in Quivac’s best interest, Quivac’s
source of monthly income and financial resources must be provided.  In addition, JG Wentworth should explain the
impact of the Notice of Lien on Quivac’s ability to transfer his payment rights.  
 
JG Wentworth’s First Amended
Petition for Transfer of Payment Rights is DENIED without prejudice.
