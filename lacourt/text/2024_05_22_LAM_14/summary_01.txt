The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Quivac and JG Wentworth regarding the transfer of payment rights. The judge finds that the First Amended Petition filed by Quivac lacks required information, including Quivac's address, the name and address of Quivac's minor child, and Quivac's source of monthly income and financial resources. The judge also finds that the petition relies on multiple amended documents submitted after filing. The judge orders Quivac to submit a complete Second Amended Petition with all amended attachments and serve it on all interested parties. The judge also requires JG Wentworth to explain the impact of the Notice of Lien on Quivac's ability to transfer payment rights. The judge denies JG Wentworth's First Amended Petition for Transfer of Payment Rights without prejudice.
