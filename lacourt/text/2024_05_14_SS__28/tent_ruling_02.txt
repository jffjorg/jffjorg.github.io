rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 16, 2020, Plaintiff Angel Zamora (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Alexander Maeda, Edward Maeda, and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
September 20, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that the case had
settled.  On November 16, 2022 and April
21, 2023, counsel informed the Court that the case against one defendant had
settled. 
On

an answer. 
On
February 28, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to enforce a settlement, to be
heard on March 21, 2024. The Court continued the hearing to April 16, 2024. On

On

Trial
is scheduled for May 31, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendants
ask the Court to enforce a settlement agreement.
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  On a motion to
enforce a settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide
disputed facts and to interpret the agreement. 
(Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon &
C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶
12:977–12:978.5, pp. 12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence,
determine disputed facts including the terms the parties previously agreed on,
and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but they may not
create new material terms. (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355,
1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
October 19, 2022, Plaintiff signed a “Release in Full Settlement and
Compromise” naming Alexander Maeda and Edward Maeda as “Releasees.”  The release stated that in consideration of
payment of $25,000.00 to Plaintiff, Plaintiff released, discharged, and
acknowledged as fully paid and compromised all claims, demands, or causes of
action that Plaintiff had or might hereafter have against Releasees for
injuries, losses, and damages (not including property damages).  (Exh. A to Mader dec.) 
On
or about October 26, 2022, Defendants’ insurer paid Plaintiff $25,000.00.  (Mader dec. ¶ 4.) However, Plaintiff did not
file a request to dismiss the matter. 
On
November 3, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office requested that the $25,000.00
settlement check be stopped and reissued to Plaintiff, which was done. (Mader
dec. ¶ 5.) On November 6, 2023 Defendants’ counsel followed up on the request
for dismissal of the matter. (Mader dec. ¶ 6 & exh. B.) However, Plaintiff
has not dismissed the matter against Defendants. (Mader dec. ¶¶ 7-8.) 
Plaintiff
argues the settlement agreement is not enforceable because Defendants did not
sign the release.  In response, citing Fiege
v. Cooke (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1350 (Fiege), Defendants argue that
a defendant is not required to sign a settlement agreement when a liability
insurer providing a defense without reservation of rights has agreed to settle
the claims within the policy limits. 
(Reply p. 4.) 
In Fiege,
the plaintiff sued the defendants for injuries resulting from an automobile
accident. The plaintiff accepted settlement offers from the defendants’
insurers but later tried to avoid the settlement. The trial court granted the
defendants’ motion to enforce the settlement under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6. On appeal, the plaintiff contended that the defendants had to be
present and consent to make the settlement enforceable and that an agreement by
their insurers was not sufficient.  
The
Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the defendants were not required to
consent to the settlement because their insurance policies expressly gave the
insurers the right to settle without the defendants’ consent and the settlement
was within policy limits.  (Fiege,
supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1354–1355; see W. Bradley Electric,
Inc. v. Mitchell Engineering (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 1, __, fn. 3 [“A
client's consent to a settlement may not be required where the client's
insurance policy gives the insurer the right to settle within policy limits
without such consent”]; Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242,
1260 [distinguishing Fiege on ground that “HOA does not cite to any
portion of the record that demonstrates that the HOA was being defended under a
general liability insurance policy under which the HOA gave its insurer the
right to settle without the HOA’s consent and the right to bind the insured to
the settlement”]; Elnekave v. Via Dolce Homeowners Assn. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1193, 1199 [“As the HOA points out, its liability policy is not in
the record and there is no evidence that it gave State Farm the right to settle
without the HOA’s consent”].) 
Defendants
have filed a supplemental declaration asserting that their insurance policy issued
by the Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club gave the insurer a right
to settle the case without their consent. 
They point to language in the attached policy stating that the insurer “may
make settlement of any claim or lawsuit as we think appropriate.” 
The
Court finds that Defendants have shown that their insurance policy gave their
insurer the right to settle the case without their consent.  Therefore, Defendants have established that
the settlement agreement is enforceable without their signatures. 
 The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants Alexander Maeda and Edward Maeda to
enforce the settlement agreement with Plaintiff Angel Zamora. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
