LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
C.      Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make
this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On November
1, 2023, Defendant served request for production of documents, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests for
admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by March 20,
2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the request for
production of documents and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections and to
produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things
requested without objections by June 13, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motions to compel responses to the special and form interrogatories
and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the
special and form interrogatories without objections by June 13, 2024. 
Defendant
asserts that he served tardy but verified, objection-free responses to the
requests for admission on April 9, 2024 and May 13, 2024.  A copy of the responses are attached to
Defendant’s opposition.  The Court finds that the responses are in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  Because
Defendant served responses to the requests for admission before the May 14,
2024 hearing on the motion, the Court denies the motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Defendant
requests sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form
interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against
parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or requests for production. Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
(See Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and
monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute].  Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504 (PricewaterhouseCoopers),
review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on Defendant's motions to compel would be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300.) 
Defendant
argues the Court is required to grant sanctions on the motions to compel under Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).  But
Sinaiko did not address whether a court may award sanctions under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 against parties who did not
make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests for
production.  “It is axiomatic that cases
are not authority for propositions that are not considered.”  (PricewaterhouseCoopers, supra,
84 Cal.App.5th at p. 506.) 
The
Court is required to grant Defendant’s request for sanctions on his motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion”].)  Defendant requests $1,110.00
in sanctions based on five hours of attorney time at a rate of $210.00 per hour
and one $60.00 filing fee.  Defendant’s counsel
spent three hours preparing the motion and supporting documents and anticipated
spending over two hours to prepare reply papers, prepare for the hearing,
travel to and from the hearing, and attend the hearing. 
The
Court grants $480.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time and one
filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Byambadorj Tsendayush’s motion to
compel responses to request for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff
Jose Rodriguez to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections
and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by June 13, 2024.
