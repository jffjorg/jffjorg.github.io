**English Summary**

This is a tentative ruling by the Honorable Judge [Judge's Name] in the case of Robert Bagley v. California Institute of Technology (24STCV20221). The case is about a demurrer hearing, where the defendant is challenging the plaintiff's indemnity claim. The plaintiff, Robert Bagley, alleges that his former employer, Caltech, failed to indemnify him for costs he incurred defending a sexual harassment lawsuit from one of his subordinates.

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 14 days to file an amended complaint. The court has taken judicial notice of the fact that the allegations included that Bagley "forcibly touched and grabbed [Luna], made sexual inquiries directed at him and others, and otherwise forced [Luna] to endure a sexually charged work environment". The court has also noted that a judicial determination is required before section 2802 liability applies, and that whether Bagley committed the alleged sexual harassment is a factual question to be determined by the finder of fact in the present action.

The court has granted leave to amend because there is a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff may cure the defect. The court has also given notice to the defendant to respond to the amended complaint.
