THE WOMAN’S
  CLUB OF HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA,  
  
         vs.
 
SARA VAN
  HORN, et al.


 Case No.:  23STUD11101
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 30, 2024



 
Defendants Patrick Van
Horn’s and Sara Van Horn’s unopposed motion for summary judgment is granted.  
 
Defendants Patrick Van Horn (“Patrick”) and Sara Van Horn
(“Sara”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move unopposed for summary
judgment against Plaintiff The Woman’s Club of Hollywood, California (“TWCOH”)
(“Plaintiff”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §437c.)  Defendants move on the
grounds the material facts are undisputed, and Defendants are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law because Plaintiff admitted that it is not the owner
or the landlord of the property at issue and did not serve valid notice to
terminate tenancy, three essential elements of its prima facie case.   (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Defendants move on the grounds that even if Plaintiff
did own the property, it did not strictly comply with the unlawful detainer
statutes and is therefore not entitled to possession.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  
Defendants move in the alternative for summary adjudication
of their affirmative defense that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Los
Angeles Municipal Code Just Cause Ordinance because Plaintiff did not provide
required relocation assistance fees or file required documents with the City of
Los Angeles.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Procedural Background
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative unlawful
detainer Complaint against Defendants.  (See Complaint.)  Defendants filed their answer to the
Complaint on October 20, 2023.
On March 20, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for
summary judgment.  As of the date of this
hearing Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges on or about December 9, 2009, Sara agreed
to rent 1749/1751 N. La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046 (“Premises”) as a
tenancy for two years and agreed to pay monthly rent on the fifth of the month.  (Complaint ¶¶3a, 6a.)  Plaintiff alleges its interest in the
Premises is as owner.  (Complaint ¶4.)  Plaintiff alleges this written agreement was
made with Plaintiff.  (Complaint ¶¶6b, e,
Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff alleges the agreement
was later changed when Plaintiff agreed with Defendants to waive a portion of
the rent in exchange for services rendered, and Plaintiff later terminated this
agreement.  (Complaint ¶6d.)
Plaintiff alleges the tenancy is subject to the Tenant
Protection Act of 2019.  (Complaint ¶7b.)  Plaintiff alleges the tenancy was terminated
for no-fault just cause (Civil Code §1946.2(b)(2)) and Plaintiff waived the
payment of rent for the final month of the tenancy, before the rent came due,
under §1946.2(d)(2), in the amount of $650.00. 
(Complaint ¶8b(1).)  Plaintiff
alleges because Defendants failed to vacate, it is seeking to recover the total
amount in ¶8b as damages in this action. 
(Complaint ¶8c.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants were served a 60-day notice to
quit.  (Complaint ¶¶9a(3), e, Exh. 2.)  Plaintiff alleges the notice was served on
Defendants pursuant to C.C.P. §1162(a)(3) by posting a copy on the Premises on May
11, 2023, and mailing a copy to the Defendants at the Premises on May 11, 2023,
because no person of suitable age or discretion could be found there. (Complaint
¶¶10a.)  Plaintiff alleges on July 11,
2023, the period stated in the notice expired at the end of the day and
Defendants failed to comply with the requirements of the notice by that
date.  (Complaint ¶9b.)  
Plaintiff requests
possession of the premises, costs incurred in this proceeding, including past-due
rent of $4,620.00, reasonable attorney fees, damages in the amount of waived
rent in the amount of $650.00, damages at the rate of $22.00 per day for fair
rental value of the premises from July 12, 2023, for each day Defendants
remains in possession through entry of judgment, and statutory damages up to
$600 for Defendant’s continued malicious possession.  (Complaint ¶¶13, 14, 19.)  
 
Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
 

Unlawful Detainer (1st COA)
To establish a claim for
unlawful detainer, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) plaintiff
owns/leases the property; (2) plaintiff rented/subleased the property to
defendant; (3) under the lease/rental agreement/sublease, defendant was required
to pay rent in a specified amount per period; (4) plaintiff properly gave
defendant three days’ written notice to pay the rent or vacate the property;
(5) as of the date of the three-day notice, at least the amount stated in the
three-day notice was due; (6) defendant did not pay the amount stated in the
notice within three days after service/receipt of the notice; and (7) defendant
is still occupying the property.  (CACI
4302.)
Defendants submitted undisputed evidence
that Plaintiff does not own the dwellings and land located on Assessor’s Parcel
No. 5548-001-008.  (Defendants’
Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact [“D-USSF”] 1; 3/4/24 Minute Order; 10/11/23
Decl. of Holliday ¶2, Exh. A at RFA No. 2.) 
Defendants submitted undisputed evidence that Plaintiff admits it did
not serve valid notice of the termination of tenancy sufficient to support an
unlawful detainer action.  (D-USSF 2;
3/4/24 Minute Order; 10/11/23 Decl. of Holliday ¶2, Exh. A at RFA No. 3.)  Defendants submitted undisputed evidence that
Plaintiff is not the landlord listed on the lease attached to the Complaint.  (D-USSF 3; 3/4/24 Minute Order; 10/11/23
Decl. of Holliday ¶2, Exh. A at RFA No. 5.) 
 Defendants met their burden to
demonstrate there is no triable issue of material fact and they are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  Ordinarily,
Defendants would shift the burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of
material fact.  However, this motion is
unopposed, and no burden-shifting is applicable.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary judgement is granted.
 
 
Conclusion
Defendants’
unopposed motion for summary judgment is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
