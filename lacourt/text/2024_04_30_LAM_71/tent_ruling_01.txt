WESLEY ROBBINS,  
 
  
         vs.
 
CARL SHAFF, II, et al.


 Case No.: 
  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 30, 2024



 
Defendants Lionel Pereira’s and Southern
California Coin and Stamps’ motion for reconsideration of this Court denying
summary judgment on April 9, 2024, is denied.

 
Defendants
Lionel Pereira (“Pereira”) and Southern California Coin and Stamp (“SCCS”) (“Moving
Defendants”) move for this Court to reconsider its August 4, 2024,[1] and April 9, 2024, Rulings.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§1008(a)-(h).)  Moving Defendants move on the grounds that
recent findings of fact and conclusions of law in the April 9, 2024, Order
against Defendant Benson Williams II (“Williams”) for the 6th, 7th, and 15th
causes of action affect all Defendants as there are no remaining factual
allegations for trial for these causes of action.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Moving Defendants argue Plaintiff’s second
amended complaint (“SAC”) contains no other facts without Williams because all
other Defendants were alleged to be in the “downstream pipeline” from Williams.
 (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Moving Defendants move in the alternative for
reconsideration and modification of the April 4, 2024, Order based on the findings
of fact and conclusions of law noted above. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Procedural Background
Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed his initial
Complaint on January 29, 2021.  Plaintiff
filed his first amended complaint (“FAC”) on January 14, 2022.  Plaintiff filed the operative SAC on November
14, 2022, alleging thirteen causes of action: (1) civil conspiracy, (2) fraud
(I), (3) tortious interference (I), (4) defamation, (5) invasion of privacy,
(6) trespass, (7) conversion, (8) tortious interference (II), (9) fraud (II),
(10) gross negligence, (11) appropriation, (12) intentional infliction of
emotional distress (“IIED”), and (15) receipt of stolen property.[2]
On February 2, 2024, this Court denied Defendants Edwin
Kawasaki’s, Steve Radell’s, William Miller’s, William Janson’s, Lois Evans’,
Caj Brejtfus’, and Carl Shaff’s motion for summary adjudication.  (2/1/24 Minute Order.)  On April 4, 2024, this Court denied Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. 
(4/4/24 Minute Order.)  On April
9, 2024, this Court granted Defendant Williams’ motion for summary
judgment.  (4/9/24 Minute Order.)
Moving Defendants filed the instant motion on April 15,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on April
25, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no reply has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P.
§1008(a) “requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or
different facts, circumstances, or law. A party seeking reconsideration also
must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence
at an earlier time.”  (See C.C.P.
§1008(a); New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
206, 212.)
Any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order, file a motion for reconsideration.  (See C.C.P. §1008(a).)
Whether
“new” facts alleged are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CCP §1008(b)
is a question confided to the sound discretion of the trial court, with which
the appellate court will not interfere absent an obvious showing of abuse. (Graham
v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 971.)
 

Discussion
          Moving Defendants’ motion for
reconsideration is denied because Moving Defendants failed to identify and new
or different law or facts that are applicable under C.C.P. §1008 or any legal
authority supporting the premise that a Court’s later ruling on a separate
motion for summary judgment constitutes new or different law or facts under
C.C.P. §1008.  (See Gilberd v.
AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500 [noting that “a court acts in
excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based
upon ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law,’” and rejecting argument
that the trial court’s alleged misinterpretation of law in its initial decision
satisfies that requirement].)  
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants’ motion for reconsideration is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
