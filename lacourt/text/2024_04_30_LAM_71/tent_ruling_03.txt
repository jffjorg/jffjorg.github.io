[1] The Court notes that this hearing is on April 30,
2024, and Moving Defendants’ request to reconsider a ruling on the future date
of August 4, 2024, is an impossibility and construed as an error based
on Moving Defendants’ later request to modify this Court’s April 4,
2024, Ruling.  Moving Defendants are
encouraged to proofread their papers before filing.


[2] Demurrers to Plaintiff’s 13th (Burglary) and 14th
(Grand Theft) causes of action were previously sustained without leave to
amend.  (10/12/22 Minute Order, pg. 3.)
