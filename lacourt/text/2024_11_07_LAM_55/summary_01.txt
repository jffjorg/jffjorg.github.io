And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Linda J. Maultsby, did not oppose the demurrer. The defendants, Elkins Family Revocable Trust of 2002 and Lawrence C. Henig D.D.S. Inc., argued that they are improper parties to the action and that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for fraud or breach of contract.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to plead with specificity the facts necessary to support her claims for fraud and breach of contract. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for negligence because the defendants did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care and because the economic loss rule bars such a claim.

The judge granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of documents recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County and previous rulings of this Court. The judge also sustained the demurrer as to the Elkins Trust because a trust is not a proper party to litigation, and the plaintiff failed to plead any allegations of wrongdoing against the trust.

The judge concluded that the defendants' demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the plaintiff's claims are dismissed.
