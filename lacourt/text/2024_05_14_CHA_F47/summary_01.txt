Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the joinder of Golden State Health Centers, Inc. to the demurrer and motion to strike. The demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff, Melvin Rosales, has 30 days to amend the original complaint. The motion to strike is placed off calendar as moot. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to plead the necessary specific facts to support the statutory based claims, including the claims for wrongful death, violations of the Elder Abuse Act, and violations of Health & Safety Code 1430(b). The plaintiff also failed to plead sufficient facts to show a causal connection between the conduct allegedly committed by the defendants and the death of the decedent.
