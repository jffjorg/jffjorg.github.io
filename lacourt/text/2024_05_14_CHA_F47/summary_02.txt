And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The motion for a protective order filed by Food 4 Less, the defendant, is denied. Food 4 Less sought to limit the scope of discovery sought by the plaintiff, Lorena Dominguez, in her Amended Special Interrogatories to information/evidence that proves or disproves the elements of the causes of action pled in the complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to justify the 97 specially prepared interrogatories in this case. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, which was not supported by authority in the opposition.
