SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Lorena Dominguez’s
(Plaintiff) claim that she was injured when she slipped and fell on lettuce
and/or water on the floor of a Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less (Food
4 Less) grocery store on 9/1/21.  On
8/9/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Food 4 Less and Sergio Pulido, a
Food 4 Less employee she interacted with on the date of the incident, for: (1)
Negligence and (2) Premises Liability which includes allegations of willful
failure to warn.  On 9/7/23, Food 4 Less
filed and served its answer to the complaint.
 
On 9/25/23, Plaintiff electronically served a first set
of discovery which included 100 Special Interrogatories.  (Dawood Decl. ¶4).  After meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff
withdrew her first set of discovery.  (Id.
¶5).  On 11/9/23, Plaintiff served her
Amended Special Interrogatories, Set 1, which include 97 special
interrogatories.  (Id. ¶6, Ex.B).
 
On 11/17/23, Food 4 Less sent a meet and confer letter
regarding the amended discovery asking Plaintiff to withdraw and/or limit the
discovery by 12/1/23.  (Dawood Decl. ¶7,
Ex.C).  Despite follow-ups, Food 4 Less
never received a response to the meet and confer efforts regarding the Amended
Special Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Id.
¶¶8-9).
On 12/12/23, Food 4 Less filed and served the instant
motion seeking a protective order: (1) limiting or restricting the scope of
discovery sought by Plaintiff in her Amended Special Interrogatories to
information/evidence that proves or disproves the elements of the causes of
action pled in Plaintiff’s Complaint, pursuant to CCP 2017.020; and/or (2)
limiting or restricting the frequency/extent/number of interrogatories Plaintiff
may utilize, pursuant to CCP 2030.090(a) and 2019.030; and (3) by this motion, Food
4 Less challenges Plaintiff’s declaration of necessity used to justify more
than 35 interrogatories under CCP 2030.050, pursuant to CCP 2030.090(b)(2), and
requests an order or ruling that, contrary to Plaintiff’s declaration, the
number of special interrogatories is unwarranted.  Additionally, Food 4 Less requests an order
imposing sanctions jointly on Plaintiff and her counsel of record, Ruben
Vardanyan of Vardanyan Law Firm, in the amount of $1,435.00.
 
On 4/8/23, Plaintiff filed and served an “Opposition to
Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less’s Motions for Protective Orders”
which lists 5/16/24 as the only hearing date despite the fact that three
separate motions for protective orders are on calendar for 5/14/24, 5/15/24 and
5/16/24.  On 5/7/24, Food 4 Less filed
and served a reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The scope of discovery is broad.  CCP 2017.010 provides: 
 
“Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or
of any other party to the action. Discovery may be obtained of the identity and
location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of
the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any
document, electronically stored information, tangible
thing, or land or other property.”
 
However, if the Court determines the burden, expense, or
intrusiveness of discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the
information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, the Court
must limit the scope of discovery.  See
CCP 2017.020. 
 
The party seeking a protective order has the burden to
show “good cause” by presenting specific facts and admissible evidence
establishing “undue burden,” etc. for the relief sought.  Fairmont Insurance Company (2000) 22
C4th 245, 255;  Goodman (1967) 253
CA2d 807, 819-820 .
 
With regard to Special Interrogatories, a party is
limited to propounding 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant
to the subject matter of the action.  CCP
2030.030(a)(1).  However, a party may
propound more than 35 special interrogatories if the greater number is
warranted because of: (1) the complexity or the quantity of the existing and
potential issues in the particular case; (2) the financial burden on a party
entailed in conducting the discovery by oral deposition; and/or (3) the
expedience of using this method of discovery to provide to the responding party
the opportunity to conduct an inquiry, investigation, or search of files or
records to supply the information sought and a declaration supporting the
foregoing is served with the discovery. 
CCP 2030.040(a); CCP 2030.050.  If
the responding party seeks a protective order on the ground that the number of specially
prepared interrogatories is unwarranted, the propounding party has the burden
of justifying the number of interrogatories. 
CCP 2030.040(b).  
 
As noted above, Food 4 Less seeks to: (1) limit or
restrict the scope of discovery sought by Plaintiff in her Amended Special
Interrogatories to information/evidence that proves or disproves the elements
of the causes of action pled in Plaintiff’s Complaint, pursuant to CCP
2017.020; and/or (2) limit or restrict the frequency/extent/number of
interrogatories Plaintiff may utilize, pursuant to CCP 2030.090(a) and 2019.030.  Additionally, Food 4 Less challenges
Plaintiff’s declaration of necessity used to justify more than 35
interrogatories under CCP 2030.050, pursuant to CCP 2030.090(b)(2), and
requests an order or ruling that, contrary to Plaintiff’s declaration, the
number of special interrogatories is unwarranted.  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has made a sufficient
showing to justify the 97 specially prepared interrogatories in this case that
concerns allegations of negligence and failure to warn.  Even if some of the interrogatories overlap,
Plaintiff has not served thousands of duplicative interrogatories causing undue
burden.  See People v. Sarpas
(2014) 225 CA4th 1539, 1552-1553 (protective order upheld limiting set of over
5,300 duplicative interrogatories).  Similarly,
the Court finds that the interrogatories are relevant to the issues in this
case as they may provide, or lead to the discovery of information, necessary to
prove the elements of Plaintiff’s claims. 

 
Food 4 Less has failed to establish that the discovery is
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative. 
CCP 2019.030(a)(1).  While Food 4
Less may find other methods of discovery more convenient for Food 4 Less, less burdensome
and/or less expensive, it has failed to establish that such other methods of
discovery are obtainable for Plaintiff (i.e., it may be too expensive for
Plaintiff to depose all of the individuals necessary to obtain the information
sought in the interrogatories).  Id.  Similarly, Food 4 Less has not shown that it
would be unduly burdensome or expensive to respond to the subject
interrogatories under the circumstances. 
CCP 2019.030(a)(2). 
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.  Plaintiff cites no authority for the request
in the opposition.  Additionally, as
noted above, Plaintiff filed one opposition in response to three separate
motions set for hearings on three separate days with only one hearing date
listed.  Also, the declaration submitted
in support of the opposition does not allocate how much time was spent with
regard to each motion.  (See Vardanyan
Decl. ¶5).  As such, the Court cannot
determine how much of the $3,000.00 in sanctions requested could properly be
allocated to opposing the instant motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. 
Food 4 Less is ordered to provide responses to the Special
Interrogatories within 30 days. 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel is advised that in the  future separate oppositions to separate
motions are required.  Failure to properly
oppose motions in the future may result in opposition arguments not being
considered.
