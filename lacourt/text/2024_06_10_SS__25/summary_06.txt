And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling grants the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by the Plaintiffs' Counsel. The court is satisfied with the counsel's reasons for seeking to be relieved, including the client's uncooperative behavior and the counsel's inability to carry out their duties effectively. The court finds that granting the motion will not cause prejudice to the Plaintiffs, as they have sufficient time to obtain new representation if they choose. The court sets a status conference to discuss the Plaintiffs' legal representation on August 1, 2024. The moving party is ordered to give notice and attach a copy of the court's tentative ruling as an exhibit to the notice."
