And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The court finds that the Notice of Motion is defective and does not comply with the rules of court. The court also finds that Plaintiff is improperly relying on deemed admissions to seek judgment on the pleadings. The court notes that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not the appropriate vehicle for Plaintiff to seek judgment based on deemed admissions. Instead, Plaintiff should file a motion for summary judgment. The court will not grant Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings and will instead allow Plaintiff to file a motion for summary judgment.
