The complaint alleges that on or about December 26, 2020, Plaintiff was lawfully  travelling on Watseka Ave. at or near the vicinity of Washington Blvd. in  Culver City, CA, when Defendant negligently maneuvered his parked vehicle out  from the curb lane and directly cut into Plaintiff’s travel lane.                  On May 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion for  Terminating and Monetary Sanctions. No opposition has been filed.                      II.Legal Standard   “The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery  sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate  sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174  Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the  dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the  interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)  “[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher  sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.)  Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and  the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” (Ibid.) A trial court has broad discretion to impose  discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the  imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)  124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a  party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure  must be willful. (Ibid.)      “A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made  lightly.” (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.)  A trial court’s order to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if  it “was arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.” (Id. at 702.)   “[W]here a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the  evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” (Id. at p. 702.) Trial courts have properly imposed  terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more  discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th  377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s lack of  compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party prejudice.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 989.)                   III.Discussion  Defendant moves for terminating and monetary  sanctions against Plaintiff, dismissing the complaint, based on Plaintiff’s  failure to comply with the court’s April 10, 2024 order to respond to discovery  and pay sanctions.  The  Court, “after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after  opportunity for hearing, may impose” a terminating sanction dismissing the  action against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery  process. (C.C.P. §2023.030(d)(3).) Misuses of the discovery process include  failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery and  disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (C.C.P. §2023.010(d) and (g).)   However, Defendant did not give proper notice to Plaintiff.  The notice of motion states that the hearing is set for 2024. Therefore,  the motion is denied so that Defendant could give Plaintiff proper notice.                   IV.Conclusion & Order    For the foregoing reasons, the Motion  for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.On the Court's own motion, the 06/14/2024 Trial is continued to 08/12/2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Parties must comply with the trial requirements as set forth
