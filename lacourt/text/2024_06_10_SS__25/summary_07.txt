And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions without prejudice. The motion was filed by the defendant, Zhanarbek Sapakov, against the plaintiff, Anastacio To Vasquez, for failure to comply with a court order to respond to discovery and pay sanctions. The court notes that the defendant did not give proper notice to the plaintiff, and therefore the motion is denied. The court orders the defendant to give proper notice and attach a copy of the tentative ruling as an exhibit to said notice. The court also continues the trial to August 12, 2024, and orders the parties to comply with the court's Third Amended Standing Order for Limited Civil Cases.
