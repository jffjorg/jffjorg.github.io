And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to amend a judgment and a request for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Mountain Recovery, LLC, is seeking to add three non-party corporate entities as alter ego judgment debtors and to prevent the defendants from dissipating their assets. The defendants, including Alexander Everest, Julianne Everest, and Kenneth Carter, argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over them due to defective service of process. The judge finds that the Entities made a general appearance in the case and that the court has personal jurisdiction over them despite the defective service.

The judge grants the motion to amend the judgment and adds the three Entities as alter ego judgment debtors. The judge also grants the preliminary injunction against the Entities, but dissolves the temporary restraining order as to Julianne and Kenneth Carter due to lack of jurisdiction.

The judge finds that the Entities, including Atlantic Holiday, LLC, 1499 Alva Lane LLC, and 7th Par Holdings LLC, are alter egos of Alexander and Julianne Everest, and that they have been using the Entities' assets as their own personal assets. The judge also finds that the Entities have been commingling their funds and using the Entities' bank accounts as their own personal accounts.
