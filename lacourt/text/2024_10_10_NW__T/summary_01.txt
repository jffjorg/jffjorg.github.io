And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is requesting a hearing date for Michael Pallamary's ex parte application, which cannot be handled on short notice due to the court's busy schedule and ongoing trial until the end of October. The earliest possible hearing date is October 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The judge is concerned about the ongoing trial being continued due to the parties' lack of readiness and is setting a firm date for the trial to resume on December 2, 2024. No further continuances will be allowed, and a Final Status Conference is scheduled for November 21, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
