And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel filed by the plaintiff, HOMAYOUN, against the defendant, BMW. The court orders BMW to provide a verified code compliant response to the requests for production of documents within 10 days. The court finds that BMW's previous responses were not code compliant and subject to frivolous objections. The court reminds BMW that it must follow a three-step process when responding to discovery requests: (1) state whether it has the documents requested in its possession, custody, or control; (2) identify who has the documents if they do not exist or are not in BMW's possession; or (3) identify all documents it has if they exist. The court also orders BMW to provide a code compliant privilege log and strikes all objections in its prior response as not allowed under the code. The court assesses monetary sanctions against BMW in the amount of $3,160.00 payable by November 10, 2024, for discovery abuse without substantial justification.
