The court is in trial until the end of October and cannot handle this matter on short notice.  It needs to be set for a hearing with an opportunity to be heard.  The court's calendar is very busy so the earliest it could be set is 10/31/2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Opposition and reply per Code. It is concerning to the court, and a waste of time, to continually continue the trial because the parties are not ready.  The court is currently engaged in trial and cannot try this case until December.  The court will continue the trial to December 2 at 9:30 and the court will keep the calendar clear as a FIRM DATE. The FSC will be on 11/21/2024 at 8:30 a.m. No additional continuances will be allowed.
