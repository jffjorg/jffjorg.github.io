```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike and/or bar representation of Dennis P. Block & Associates due to failure to file a statement of information, loss of corporate standing, and invalidity of all actions after July 31, 2024. The plaintiff had argued that the law firm failed to file a statement of information with the California Secretary of State, and therefore its attorneys are not legally permitted to represent clients in this matter. However, the court found that there was no proof of service attached to the motion, and no evidence that the defendant was given notice of the hearing. Additionally, the plaintiff had previously filed a notice of appeal, which automatically stays the action. Therefore, the court denied the motion.
