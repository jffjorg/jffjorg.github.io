Here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Faisad alhusseini's motion to quash service of summons. The court found that plaintiff CLOVER PRIVATE CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES (LEVERED) II, LP has fully complied with the requirements for substituted service under California law. The court credits the process server's declaration that he attempted to serve Faisad alhusseini at his residential address, the 2773 address, on multiple occasions and that a co-tenant, Abdul Kareem, accepted the summons and complaint on behalf of Faisad alhusseini. The court also credits Kroll's conclusion that the 2773 address is Faisad alhusseini's residential address. The court concludes that Faisad alhusseini was validly served and that the motion to quash service of summons is denied.
