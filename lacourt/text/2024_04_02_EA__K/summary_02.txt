And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion and is confused as to why it has not been withdrawn. The plaintiff attached the wrong Master Labor Agreement (MLA) to their complaint and motion, but the correct MLA was obtained from the defendants and attached to their opposition. The defendants argue that Article III of the Short Form Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) excludes the SCCA MLA provisions on grievance procedures and work stoppages from incorporation. The plaintiff agrees that the wrong MLA was attached, but claims it was an inadvertent mistake and that they could have obtained the correct electronic version of the MLA from the defendants in discovery. The judge is unclear about why the motion has not been withdrawn and is seeking further information.
