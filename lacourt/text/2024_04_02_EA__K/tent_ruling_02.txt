[1]              Defendants contend, in opposition,
that Plaintiff failed to attach the correct MLA and that Article III of the
Short Form CBA expressly excluded the SCCA MLA provisions on grievance
procedures and work stoppages from incorporation [see below]. Plaintiff,
in reply, agrees that the wrong MLA was attached to the SAC. (Reply, 2:2-12
[“Plaintiff first wishes to address the attaching of the incorrect Master Labor
Agreement (‘MLA’) to its complaint and motion, which was done inadvertently and
through no fault of Plaintiff. Plaintiff was given the MLA with the Southern
California Contractors Association by Joe Pacheco in a small booklet form,
not in electronic format, which was impossible to attach to its Second Amended
Complaint (‘SAC’) in this action. (Reply Declaration of Richard Moore, ‘Moore
Dec.’, ¶2.) Plaintiff could have obtained the correct electronic version of
the MLA from defendants in discovery in this case, but as defendants have
attached it to their opposition it is now in evidence. Along with the Short-form
Collective Bargaining Agreement (‘CBA’) that Plaintiff previously attached to
its SAC and motion, and which defendants also attach to their opposition, these
two documents establish the existence of the contract between the parties
that defendants claim in their opposition Plaintiff has not established”]
[emphasis added].) It is unclear to the court why the instant motion has not
been withdrawn.
