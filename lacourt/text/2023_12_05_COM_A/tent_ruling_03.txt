22CMCV00275 Mariana Jimenez
 Martinez v. Montebello Auto Group, LLC, et al. 
Tuesday, December 5, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.
TENTATIVE ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
      The complaint alleges that Defendant, General
Motors, Inc. (“GM”), issued a written warranty for a 2019 Chevrolet Suburban purchased
by Plaintiff. The vehicle suffered from electrical and transmission defects
that Defendant failed to repair within a reasonable number of attempts in
violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiff alleges one
cause of action against Chevrolet of Montebello for negligent repair. 
      While GM opposed the motion, the parties
filed a joint statement on November 20, 2023, stating that the parties reached
an agreement whereby Plaintiff would withdraw the motion if Defendant produced
documents responsive to Requests 37-41 by December 4, 2023. The requests relate
to documents that explain Defendant’s internal symptom and component codes used
in its diagnostic process. In the joint statement, Defendant asks for a short
continuance of the hearing “to allow Plaintiff time for review and subsequent
withdrawal of her motion.” (Joint Stmt. 11/20/23.)
      As the parties appear
to have resolved this issue, the Court continues the hearing to January 11,
 2023,  at
8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Plaintiff is ordered to provide
written notice five court days before the hearing to indicate whether the
motion is withdrawn.
