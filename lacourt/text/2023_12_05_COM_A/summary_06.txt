And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Rangpur, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Orlando Garcia, alleges that the sales counter at Jack's Jug Liquor was too high and paths of travel were too narrow, violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act. However, the Defendant argues that the service of summons and complaint was improper because the Plaintiff did not serve the Defendant's authorized agent for service of process. The Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion to quash, and the court finds that the service was not properly accomplished. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the court lacks jurisdiction over the Defendant.
