[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
      Petitioner,
Javier
 Zenteno, filed this Petition on August 23, 2023, for an Order for
Change of Name to Ivan Aguilar Huesco to keep his
 documents in order and to have the same last name as his children.  Petitioner is over the age of 18. The Court
continued the hearing on this petition from October 31, 2023, because the
Probation Department was unable to complete its assessment without some form of
identification or fingerprinting. The Court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner
complied with the Court’s order to provide information to the Probation
Department.
      Accordingly,
the court continues the hearing to January 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with the instructions
provided in the Court’s order of October 31, 2023.
