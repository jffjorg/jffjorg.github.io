And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to set aside the settlement agreement. The plaintiff argues that the settlement was conditioned upon the defendant using its best efforts to expedite the approval process, but the delay in receiving the settlement funds has been unreasonable. The defendant argues that the delay is due to a restructuring of the settlement approval process, which has caused the delay. The Judge finds that there is no evidence of fraud, breach, or other circumstances that would warrant setting aside the settlement agreement. The plaintiff's motion is denied.
