[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANT
PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADING 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The verified, first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges that
Defendant, Romona King (“King”), forged Plaintiff’s signature on a quitclaim
deed purporting to transfer Plaintiff’s 50 percent interest in real property to
Defendant, leaving Defendant as the sole owner of the property. Plaintiff alleges
claims for (1) forgery, (2) cancellation of instrument, (3) quiet title, (4)
slander of title, (5) fraudulent concealment, (6) theft, (7) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and (8) declaratory and injunctive relief.         
      Plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleading on grounds the
Defendant’s second amended answer fails to state sufficient facts to constitute
a defense to the FAC. Defense counsel previously agreed to strike several
defective affirmative defenses but refuses to sign a stipulation. Defendant did
not file an opposition by November 20, 2023 (nine court days before the
hearing). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 subd. (b).) 
II.   LEGAL STANDARDS
      A
party can move for judgment on the pleadings on grounds the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(B)). The motion performs the same function as a general
demurrer and attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by
matters subject to judicial notice. (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064). For the purposes of this motion, all properly alleged
material facts are deemed true. (Fire
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.)
      The sufficiency of an answer depends on
the complaint to which it purports to answer. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) Therefore, the answer does not stand
alone; rather it is read with reference to the facts alleged in plaintiff’s
complaint. The pleading must “minimally advise the opposing party of the nature
of the defense even if defective as conclusory.” (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 385.) 
      The critical inquiry when a plaintiff
demurs to an answer is whether the answer raises a defense to plaintiff’s
stated cause of action. (Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of
Santa Rosa (1978) 86
Cal.App.3d 873, 880.) The
demurrer raises the objection that the answer does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a defense. (Id.) 
The answer to a complaint must include any statement of any new matter
constituting a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.430(b)(2).)
      “New matter” refers to “something relied
on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff. [Citation.] Thus,
where matters are not responsive to essential allegations of the complaint,
they must be raised in the answer as “new matter.” (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community
College Dist. (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546.)
Thus, “new matter” is “any ground urged in avoidance of the complaint, i.e.,
some independent reason why plaintiff should be barred from recovery, even if
everything alleged in the complaint was true.” (Walsh at 1546.) 
      The answer is liberally construed with a
view to substantial justice between the parties. The answer should make clear
what issues the adverse parties must meet such that when taken in connection
with the complaint, “no reasonable person could be in any doubt about the
issues to be met.” (Hoelzle v. Fresno County (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 478, 483.)
IV.  DISCUSSION
      Defense
counsel agreed to dismiss the following affirmative defenses: 1st (statute
of limitations); 2nd (laches); 3rd (third party conduct);
5th (failure to state a cause of action); 7th (waiver); 9th
(unclean hands); and 17th (reservation of rights). (Decl.
of Danielle Little, Ex. B, .pdf p. 9.) Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to these affirmative defenses. 
      The
motion is granted as to the remaining affirmative defenses at issue because
while they raise new matter, the allegations are conclusory and are unsupported
by any facts. (Quantification
Settlement Agreement Cases (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 758, 812–813 ["Affirmative
defenses must not be pled as ‘terse legal conclusions,’ but ‘rather ... as
facts averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which
constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint.’"].)
V.     
CONCLUSION
      Based
on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED as to all defenses at issue: 1st
(statute of limitations),  2nd
(laches),  3rd (third party
conduct), 4th (intentional tort/criminal act as superseding cause),
5th (failure to state a cause of action), 6th (unjust
enrichment, 7th (waiver); 8th (equitable estoppel), 9th
(unclean hands), 12th (offset), 13th (fraud), 14th
(standing), 15th (intervening or superseding cause), and 17th
(reservation of rights).
