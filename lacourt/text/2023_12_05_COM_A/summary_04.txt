And here is the English-text summary:

The judge rules that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Lauren Sims, alleges damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault while she was an elementary school student. The defendant argues that the legislation, AB 218, which revived childhood sexual abuse claims and eliminated the requirement for a government claim, is an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The judge finds that the legislation serves a public purpose, which is to provide compensation to victims of childhood sexual abuse. The judge also finds that the legislation did not create new liability for past negligence, but rather revived previously barred claims. The demurrer is overruled and the defendant is ordered to answer within 10 days.
