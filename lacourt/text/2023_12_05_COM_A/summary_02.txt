And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleading. The plaintiff, Tabitha Patton, alleges that the defendant, Romona King, forged her signature on a quitclaim deed, leaving King as the sole owner of the property. The plaintiff's verified, first amended complaint alleges eight claims, including forgery, cancellation of instrument, quiet title, slander of title, fraudulent concealment, theft, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory and injunctive relief.

The defendant's second amended answer fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a defense, and defense counsel has agreed to dismiss several affirmative defenses. The judge has ruled that the motion is granted as to all defenses at issue, finding that the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and that the allegations are conclusory and unsupported by any facts. The judge has liberally construed the answer with a view to substantial justice between the parties and has found that the answer does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 431.430(b)(2).
