And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on Javier Zenteno's petition for a change of name from Javier Zenteno to Ivan Aguilar Huesco. The petition was filed on August 23, 2023, and the hearing was previously continued on October 31, 2023, due to the Probation Department's inability to complete its assessment without identification or fingerprinting. However, the Court's file does not reflect that Petitioner complied with the Court's order to provide information to the Probation Department. As a result, the hearing is continued to January 12, 2024, and Petitioner is ordered to comply with the instructions provided in the Court's order of October 31, 2023.
