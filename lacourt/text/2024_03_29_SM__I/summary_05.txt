And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has reviewed the objections and is inclined to overrule them. The main objection is that the court's comments regarding the legality or appropriateness of the charitable contribution are not relevant. The court disagrees, as it must determine whether Rav-Noy should recover the $1 million aspect of the higher purchase price, which was reduced by the amount of the charitable contribution. Rav-Noy contends he is entitled to recover the $1 million, while Illulian disagrees. The court concludes that there was consideration for the charitable contribution, as the price of the property was reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the contribution. The court also concludes that Rav-Noy did not deduct the contribution from his taxes and that he got the benefit of the form of the payment, so he must bear the burden as well. The remaining objections are also overruled, and the proposed statement of decision is now final.
