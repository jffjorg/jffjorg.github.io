Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the ex parte application to continue the trial and discovery cut-off. The plaintiff had argued that they timely propounded key discovery to the defense, but the defense ignored it, and the motions to compel will not be heard in time to obtain the discovery to be incorporated into the opposition to the defendant's pending MSJ. The judge is skeptical that the purported discovery will yield any evidence that will be material to the motion. The case is now over two years old, and the trial was continued on May 16, 2023. The judge notes that plaintiff has known for almost a year when the trial would be and that the court is disinclined to continue trials based on an argument that discovery is not yet done or that the parties are not yet ready. The judge suggests that plaintiff could seek to advance the hearing dates for the discovery motions to allow responses to be served in time to incorporate them into the opposition or make a motion under CCP section 437c(h) to continue the MSJ.
