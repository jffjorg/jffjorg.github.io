 Case Number:  23SMCV01463    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  I The parties ought to be able to foresee this order.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.  Verified responses without objections are to
be served within 15 calendar days. 
Sanctions of $3240, inclusive of costs are AWARDED against the opposing
parties, payable within 30 days. 
Thankfully, these seem to be the last of the calendared discovery motions.
 
The court also notes that discovery responses need only be
served; they need not be filed with the court.
