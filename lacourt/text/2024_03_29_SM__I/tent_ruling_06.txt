 Case Number:  SC123657    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  I The court will hear from the defense.  The court recalls the motion practice leading
to the ongoing duty of disclosure.  The
court specifically ordered that manufacturers be disclosed on an ongoing
basis.  And when it became clear that the
names that were given were stale, the court seems to recall inquiring about
that but being told that these were all that there were.  If, in fact, there are additional
manufacturers, the court is extremely concerned.  However, the defense has not been heard on
this subject.  The court will inquire
briefly of the defense today, but more likely will need to set a hearing.  With the trial a scant two weeks away, there
is some concern over the effect this will have on the trial.  If it means that the trial cannot go forward
because of misconduct by the defense, the court will need to consider the
appropriate sanction, which could be anything from a continuance of the trial
with a monetary sanction to an evidentiary sanction to an issue sanction to a
terminating sanction.  All would be on
the table.  That said, though, it could
also be that this is a tempest in a teapot and that in fact the defense has
complied fully with the court’s orders, in which case the trial will go forward
as planned.
 
As to the substitution of cross complainant, the court will
hear from the defense.  
 
If needed the court will continue this hearing to allow the
defense to file papers.  The matter is
serious enough that if the defense wants a chance to be heard and to file
papers, it ought to be given that opportunity.
