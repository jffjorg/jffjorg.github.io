And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to serve defendants by publication and service on the Secretary of State. The Judge doubts that there are truly exigent circumstances for ex parte service, but is allowing the service by publication to assure actual knowledge of the lawsuit. The motion is granted, and Rontal Development LLC may serve the other defendants by publication, in addition to sending courtesy copies by certified mail. The Judge will also inquire about the relationship between the individual and other defendants. The goal is to allow defendants to appear and the case to go forward.
