And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge addresses two main issues: the ongoing duty of disclosure of manufacturers and the substitution of cross complainant. The Judge is concerned that the defense may not have complied with the court's orders regarding manufacturer disclosure, as the names provided were stale. The Judge plans to inquire briefly of the defense and may need to set a hearing to resolve the issue. If the defense has not complied with the court's orders, the Judge may consider a range of sanctions, including a continuance, evidentiary sanctions, or a terminating sanction. However, if the defense has complied fully, the trial will proceed as planned.
