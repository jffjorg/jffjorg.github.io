And here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Petitioner John Doe's Motion for Stay of Administrative Action. Petitioner seeks to dismiss Respondents' administrative action as time-barred and without jurisdiction. The court has found that Petitioner has not shown the likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the case at trial. Specifically, Petitioner has stated that he has at least a colorable claim that Respondents are taking administrative disciplinary action against him based on a complaint brought by another high school student long after the time for submitting such complaints had expired. However, the court has not found that there will be irreparable harm if the stay is denied, as the administrative complaint has not proceeded to its final stages and Petitioner can proceed with a writ after the final administrative order.
