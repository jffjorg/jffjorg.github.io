The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legibly written. If the name meets these criteria, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition has been granted, but the proposed decree cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
