And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition and set a hearing date for September 9, 2024. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
