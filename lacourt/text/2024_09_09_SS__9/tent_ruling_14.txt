 Case Number:  24STCP02161    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  9  
The petition is CONTINUED to October
28, 2024 at 9:30 am.  No proof of
publication has been filed.  Petitioner
must file proof of publication no later than one week before the continued
hearing date.  Failure to do so will
result in denial and dismissal of the petition without prejudice.  
 
In addition, the mandatory name change
criminal history assessment form has not been processed either because
Petitioner has failed to complete and file a request for a name change criminal
history assessment or because the Name Change Clerk needs more time to complete
such a form. 
 
If Petitioner has failed to complete
the name change criminal history assessment form, Petitioner must contact the
Name Change Clerk in the Clerk’s Office and request that the criminal history
assessment form be completed before the continued hearing date.  Otherwise, the instant petition will be
denied without prejudice.
 
Accordingly, the hearing on this
matter is continued to October 28, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. 

 
The Name Change Clerk is ordered to
run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
