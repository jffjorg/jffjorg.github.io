And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Petitioner (the applicant) seeking to change their name. The judge orders Petitioner to review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
