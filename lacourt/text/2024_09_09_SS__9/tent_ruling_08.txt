 Case Number:  24STCP01521    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  9 On July 15, 2024, the Court continued
the instant petition because Petitioner had active outstanding warrants.  The Court ordered Petitioner to file proof
that Petitioner has cleared the outstanding warrant two weeks before the
continued hearing date.  However,
Petitioner failed to do so.  Further, the
Court has already continued the hearing once to allow Petitioner additional
time to file proof of publication, but Petitioner has nonetheless failed to
file proof of publication.  
Accordingly, the petition is denied
without prejudice.
