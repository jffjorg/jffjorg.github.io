And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for a name change. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, the Petitioner does not need to attend the hearing. However, if the name is not satisfactory, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge has granted the petition, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
