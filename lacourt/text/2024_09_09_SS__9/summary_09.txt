And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a default hearing for a name change petition. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not correct, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
