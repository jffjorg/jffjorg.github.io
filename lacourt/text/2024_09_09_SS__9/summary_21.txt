And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to change name, but has also set certain conditions. The petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not accurate, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge has also noted that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
