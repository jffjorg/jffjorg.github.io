And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a petition for a name change. The judge grants the petition, but with one condition: the petitioner must ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the new name meets these requirements, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and it cannot be amended without a new petition.
