And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
