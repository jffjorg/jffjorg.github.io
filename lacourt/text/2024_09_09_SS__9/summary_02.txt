And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the name change petition, but with certain conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
