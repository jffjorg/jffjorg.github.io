The judge has granted the petition to change name and has set a hearing date for September 9, 2024. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
