And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where a petition has been filed to determine the parentage of a petitioner. However, the petitioner has failed to provide a birth certificate or similar document, which is necessary for the court to determine parentage. As a result, the petition is being continued to October 28, 2024, and the petitioner is required to refile the birth certificate at least one week before the continued hearing date. Additionally, the petitioner has failed to provide proof of publication, which is also required. The court has given the petitioner an ultimatum: they must provide proof of publication no later than one week before the continued hearing date, or the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The court clerk has been ordered to give notice of the continued hearing date.
