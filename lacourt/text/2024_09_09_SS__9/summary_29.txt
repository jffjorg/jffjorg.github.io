And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the petition to change name. However, the Judge requires the Petitioner to review and confirm the new name on the proposed decree to ensure it is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is correct and legible, the Petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. But if the new name is not correctly written or spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
