And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition for name change.
