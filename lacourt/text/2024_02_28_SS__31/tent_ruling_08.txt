 Case Number:  23STCV12059    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  ELIO VALLECILLO RIVERA,¿  Plaintiff(s),¿¿ vs.¿  ¿LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, ET AL.,¿  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 23STCV12059  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  February 28, 2024  I.  Motion to Compel Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority ("LACMTA”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, on plaintiff Elio Vallecillo Rivera (“Plaintiff”) on August 30, 2023. After receiving no response, defense counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting verified responses to the discovery, without objections. Plaintiff’s counsel responded that they would serve responses by November 3, 2023. However, on November 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel advised that they were unable to reach Plaintiff and that they would provide responses no later than November 10, 2023.  Plaintiff has not served responses to date. LACMTA therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before February 14, 2024; the motion is unopposed. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, LACMTA’s unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to LACMTA’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days of this Order (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b).)   II. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). LACMTA seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,000 for the motion.     A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)         LACMTA is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion, and 1 hour to appear at the hearing, at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $500 in attorney’s fees.  Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to LACMTA, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $500, within fifteen (15) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 27th day of February 2024      Hon.
