And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted Plaintiff Honor Farrens' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC seeks to substitute defendants, add causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and negligence per se. The court finds that the motion complies with court rules and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The court also finds that the delay in presenting the amendment has not prejudiced any party. The judge orders Plaintiff to file a separate copy of the proposed FAC within 10 days of the date of this order. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
