And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's third request for default judgment against the defendant, Shlomo Keshet, for $100,000 in general damages. The plaintiff has failed to provide admissible prima facie evidence of damages, despite the court's prior instructions. The plaintiff has also failed to provide authenticated medical records and her own declaration, and her counsel has failed to show cause for failure to comply with the court's prior orders. The court has imposed monetary sanctions of $1,000 against the plaintiff's counsel and has ordered the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. If the next application for default judgment suffers from the same defects, the court will dismiss the action.
