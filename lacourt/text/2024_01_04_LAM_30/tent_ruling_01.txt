Rivas, et. al.
vs. Kia America, Inc, et. al.,
Case No. 23STCV17263
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief from
Waiver of Objections
 
Plaintiffs Ada Isabel Rivas and
Alba Cristina Mejia (collectively, Plaintiffs) move for relief from their
waiver of objections to discovery served by Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant). The motion is denied.
 
Parties that fail to serve timely
responses to discovery requests waive any objections to those requests. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.) The
Court, on motion, may relieve a party from waiver, if a subsequent response was
served in substantial compliance, and the failure to timely serve a response
was the result of a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a)(1); 2031.300, subd.(a)(1). 2033.280, subd. (a).) The
standard for “mistake, inadvertence or excusable
neglect” for relief of waiver of objections is the same as under Code Civ.
Proc. § 473. (City of Fresno v. Superior
Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467.)
 
On August 30, 2023, Defendant
served on Plaintiffs the Requests for Production (Set One), Requests for
Admission (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Form
Interrogatories (Set One). (Lee Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs did not provide
responses by the deadline on October 3, 2023. (Lee Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs’
counsel states that the lack of responses was due to a calendaring error that
mistakenly set the deadline as November 3, 2023. Plaintiffs’ counsel learned of
the error on October 5, 2023, after being notified by defense counsel that the
responses were due. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) 
Plaintiffs served responses to the discovery on October 5, 2023, and
served supplemental responses on October 13, 2023. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.)
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
responses to the discovery are not in “substantial compliance.” The Court
agrees. Plaintiffs’ responses each improperly assert “General Objections” that
are purportedly incorporated into each individual request or interrogatory.
(Lee Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 3 [13, 106].) This is not a proper form of objection. A
party to whom an interrogatory, request for production, or request for
admission has been served must respond separately to each request. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.210, subd. (a); 2031.210, subd. (a); 2033.210, subd. (a).) 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs responded
to a number of Defendant’s Special Interrogatories only by referring to
Plaintiffs’ document production. (Lee Decl., Ex. 3 [110.) This is also
improper. Answers to interrogatories “shall be as complete and straightforward
as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (a).) An answering party may refer to documents in
response to an interrogatory only where “the answer to an interrogatory would
necessitate the preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract, audit, or
summary of or from the documents of the party to whom the interrogatory is
directed, and if the burden or expense of preparing or making it would be
substantially the same for the party propounding the interrogatory as for the
responding party.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.230.) Plaintiffs have not shown that
this is the case here. Because Plaintiffs’ responses are not in substantial
compliance with the discovery statutes, the motion is denied.
