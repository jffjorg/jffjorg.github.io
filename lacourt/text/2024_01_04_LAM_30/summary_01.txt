Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for relief from waiver of objections to discovery requests served by the Defendant. The Plaintiffs failed to respond to the discovery requests by the deadline, citing a calendaring error. Although they served responses and supplemental responses later, the Court finds that the responses are not in substantial compliance with the discovery statutes. The Court agrees with the Defendant that the Plaintiffs' responses improperly assert general objections and fail to provide complete and straightforward answers to interrogatories.
