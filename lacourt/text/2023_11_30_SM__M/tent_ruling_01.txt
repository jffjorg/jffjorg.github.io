MOTION:                  Motion
to Vacate Judgment

BACKGROUND
 
This is a sister state judgment action arising from a
judgment issued in the Western District of North Carolina against Defendant. The
underlying case regards the nationally reported “ZeekRewards” Ponzi scheme.
Agus is a “Net Winner Class Member.” The judgment against her comprises the net
winnings from the scheme that were fraudulently transferred to her. Plaintiff
is the assignee of the judgment in the underlying action.
 
On April 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an application for
entry of judgment on the sister state judgment. The Clerk granted the
application and issued the judgment.
 
Legal
Standard
 
To enforce a
foreign “sister state” judgment in California, the judgment creditor must register
the judgment as a California judgment in accordance with the Sister State
Money-Judgments Act or by bringing an action to establish the judgment in
California. (CCP § 1913; Conseco Marketing, LLC v. IFA & Ins. Services,
Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831, 838.) SSMJA provides expeditious and
economical registration procedure for enforcing sister state money judgments. (Id.)
The sister state judgment may be filed with a California court, and a judgment may
immediately entered thereon subject generally to a 30-day stay after service of
notice of entry on the judgment debtor. (Id., see CCP § 1710.45(d).) 
 
A sister state judgment may be vacated on any ground
which would be a defense to an action in California on the sister state
judgment. (CCP § 1710.40(a).) This motion must be made within 30 days after
service of notice of entry of judgment pursuant to Section 1710.30. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
In response to Defendant Leah
Agus’s motion to vacate, and the Court’s concerns regarding the validity of the
judgment (see 28 USC § 1963), Plaintiff Nationwide Judgment Recovery, Inc.
requests leave to file an independent action based on the judgment at common
law. The Court agrees that leave to amend is proper. (CCP §§
473(a)(1), 576; see Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469 [the Court has the discretion to grant with
without claimant’s compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting
leave to amend].)
 
Accordingly,
the motion to vacate is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to file a First Amended
Complaint within 10 days.
