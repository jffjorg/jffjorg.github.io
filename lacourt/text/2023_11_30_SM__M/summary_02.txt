Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to discovery requests, specifically the special interrogatories, requests for admissions, requests for production, and form interrogatories. The defendant failed to provide verifications for some of these responses, rendering them untimely and incomplete. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The judge grants the motion to compel responses to the special interrogatories, requests for production, and form interrogatories, but denies the motion to compel responses to the requests for admissions without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,980.00, inclusive of costs, to be paid within 30 days. The judge finds that the defendant's unwillingness to participate in discovery justifies the imposition of sanctions, but notes that the defense counsel's efforts to obtain the defendant's cooperation are sufficient to excuse any blame.
