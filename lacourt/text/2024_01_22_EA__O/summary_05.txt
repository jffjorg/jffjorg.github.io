```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint and the motion to strike Plaintiff's Complaint. The court finds that the demurrer as to the 6th COA is moot and strikes it. The court sustains the demurrer as to the 8th COA for Conversion. The court grants the motion to strike attorney fees without leave to amend.

The court finds that Plaintiff's Complaint is a sham pleading, as it contradicts the prior allegations and attempts to avoid defects set forth in the prior complaint. The court also finds that Palomares Escrow, Inc. has not exercised control over the funds, as Truist Bank has the money.

The court denies Plaintiff's attempt to recover attorney fees under the "tort of another" doctrine, as Palomares Escrow, Inc. is not a third party and the doctrine does not apply to the situation where a plaintiff has been damaged by the joint negligence of codefendants.

The court will consider Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint at the hearing.
