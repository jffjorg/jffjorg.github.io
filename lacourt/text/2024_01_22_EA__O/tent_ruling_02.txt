[1] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural background of the case will only discuss
pertinent filings to this demurrer and motion to strike. 
 


[2] Eva is Noah’s
biological great-grandmother. AC is Noah’s biological sister, who is currently
five years old. EC is Noah’s biological brother and is currently ten years old.
RC’s, who is three years old, was Noah’s unborn sibling at the time of his
death. They will collectively be referred to as the “Minor Plaintiffs.” 
 


[3] Hathaway is a mental
health and welfare agency that provides behavioral services to dependent
minors. The County and Hathaway have a contract wherein Hathaway promises to
provide psychological counseling and family support services for consumers
referred by the County. (Id. ¶33.)

Brief p. 9 for list of websites. 
            


[5] To the extent
certain authorities and analysis are omitted from this tentative (i.e., legal
standard or requirements for filing suit against a government entity), the
court directs the parties to the court’s two previous tentative rulings.  
 


[6] Upon a review of the
complete testimony and governing law, the court now determines that the testimony
of CSW Ms. Hernandez Aviles fails to establish that a mandatory duty. (See
Supp. Brief p.12 [“Q: Eva Hernandez should have been notified that DCFS had
applied to remove him from the parents' home. Correct? . . . THE WITNESS: In
normal circumstances, yes. I don't know what the circumstances were at that
time for the case. I wasn't the worker. I only knew just somewhat of what was
going on.”].) Thus, the testimony is insufficient to establish a mandatory duty
because Aviles is not a County representative, she merely stated her opinion, and
she did not have personal knowledge to testify on the matter.  


[7] Though Plaintiffs’
burden to plead a specific mandatory duty, Plaintiffs have made no citation to
any procedure manual, no internal policy, nor any rules and regulations,
despite the information being matters of public record. 


[8] And perhaps to add
allegations, leave to amend can be used to add allegations about whether Eva
made any requests to have custody of Noah. 
 


[9] Even if so, according to the policy on what happens
“[a]fter The Court Signs the Removal Order,” “Not
executing a removal order should be the exception,” meaning a CSW was to remove
Noah from his parents’ custody. (https://policy.dcfs.lacounty.gov/Policy?id=5868#:~:text=A%20CSW%20may%20enter%20a; https://policy.dcfs.lacounty.gov/Policy?id=5868#Section_After_The_Court_Signs_the_Removal_Order.) 
 


[10] On a demurrer, the issue is the sufficiency of
the pleading, not the truth of the facts alleged.  Thus, no matter
how unlikely or improbable, the allegations made must be accepted as true for
the purpose of ruling on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corporation v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)
