[1] Defendant does not
assert which specific subsection of CCP section 430.10 subdivisions it brings
forth the demurrer on (i.e., subdivision (e) failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action or subdivision (f) for uncertainty. As the
basis of the demurrer is predicated upon both inconsistent facts and insufficient
facts (e.g., Demurrer p. 11:9-10 [“The allegations as to the [COAs] are
still scant.”].) Thus, for purposes of the demurrer, the court will presume
both subsections are at issue. 
 


[2] Admittedly, though
the court did not rule on its merits, reading the original complaint, the court
was uncertain as to why Palomares is being sued for intentional
misrepresentation when a hacker hacked Ms. Black’s account. 
 


[3] Motions to strike
exist in part to strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) Engaging in sham pleading amounts to a pleading not
in conformity with proper pleadings practices.
