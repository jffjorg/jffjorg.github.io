[1] Though a trial court's ruling on a motion for reconsideration
is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard (NYT, infra, 135
Cal.App.4th at p. 212), the trial court lacks jurisdiction to grant the
requested relief should CCP section 1008’s prerequisites not be satisfied. (See
Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.Ap.4th 1494, 1502 [“Having concluded that section 1008 was the exclusive
avenue for the relief requested and that respondent did not meet the
jurisdictional prerequisites for relief under that statute, we find that the
trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by granting the motion for
reconsideration.”].) 
 


[2] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural background only provides the pertinent
filings. 


[3] Perhaps most
indicative of RKA’s fatal motion is its reliance on an incorrect standard of
what constitutes “new” evidence. While the reconsideration motion itself does
not reference law (aside from reciting CCP section 1008), RKA’s opposition to
Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions cites to Rains v. Sup. Ct. (1984) 150
Cal.App.3d 933. (RKA Opp. to Motion for Sanctions p. 8.) The Rains court determined that the “different facts” alleged in
the proposed pleading sufficed as the “new or different facts” required under
CCP section 1008. (Id. at p. 944.) However, in 1992, the Legislature
amended CCP section 1008, which tightened the requirements of the statute. (See
Garcia, infra, 68 Cal.App.4th at pp. 688-690 [discussion of
Legislature’s intent and cases interpreting the new amendment].)  
 


[4] Counsel Llaurado’s declaration does
not comply with some of the mandatory requirements of CCP section 1008 as it
does not (i) provide the name of the Judge before whom the GFS motion was made
nor (ii) the date of the GFS motion ruling. 
 


[5] As the motion for
sanctions requires an understanding of the motion for reconsideration, the
court will begin its discussion with RKA’s motion. 
 


[6] See Schep v.
Capital One, N.A. (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1331, 1338; see also In re
Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1306 [“[T]he trial judge stated at the outset that ‘[w]hen I
ruled on this case in July[,] I completely missed the most important point. At
that time the parties were not seriously contesting whether the real estate
broker had asked to have the listing delayed. Now that I realize the true
situation, [Kay's] somewhat ‘oblique’ statement in her declaration does make
sense.’ . . . So, if the court clearly made a mistake in interpreting what the
parties were contending at an earlier hearing, the injustice can be fixed.”].) 
 


[7] Mr. Le’s 9/30/21 email confirms Mr.
Khatri’s attendance to the 9/29/21 Zoom call. (Motion, Ex. 7, p. 41 of 46 of
PDF.) 
 


[8] As observed by
Khatri in opposition, the only evidence that RKA presents are emails that Mr.
Tao wrote or received; the emails are not bate-stamped, indicating that they
came from RKA’s own files as opposed to a document produced post-GFS
hearing from another party. If anything, these emails should have been provided
by RKA in response to Plaintiffs’ July 2023 document request. (Khatri
Opp. p. 12:21-27.) With that, RKA’s contention in Reply that it had an ethical
obligation to this court to correct any conflicting information presented
to the court (Reply to Khatri Opp. pp. 8-9) is disingenuous considering RKA’s
withholding of discovery. 
 


[9] Generally, new
arguments may not be raised in reply. (See e.g., Reichardt v. Hoffman (1997)
52 Cal.App.4th 754, 764.) 
 


[10] Tied to this
argument is RKA’s contention that Khatri somehow filed an improper sur-Reply in
its GFS Reply. Not so. A moving party is
entitled “to file responsive counterdeclarations to negate the lack of good
faith asserted by the non-settling contesting party.” (Khatri Opp. p. 14,
citing City of Grand Terrace v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d
1251, 1262.) And should RKA have needed more time to respond to Khatri’s GFS
Reply sur-declaration, it could have requested a continuance, but did not. (Id.
at p. 1265 [“We have determined that it
would be appropriate for the objecting non-settlor to move for a continuance of
the hearing, if necessary, for the purpose of gathering facts, which could
include further formal discovery, to support its statutory burden of proof as
to all Tech-Bilt factors non-settlors placed in issue in
order that the matter can be fully and fairly litigated.”].)
