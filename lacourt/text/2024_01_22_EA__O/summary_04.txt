Significant Statements:
  - "Having concluded that section 1008 was the exclusive avenue for the relief requested and that respondent did not meet the jurisdictional prerequisites for relief under that statute, we find that the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by granting the motion for reconsideration." (Gilberd v. AC Transit)
  - "The trial judge stated at the outset that ‘[w]hen I ruled on this case in July[,] I completely missed the most important point. At that time the parties were not seriously contesting whether the real estate broker had asked to have the listing delayed. Now that I realize the true situation, [Kay's] somewhat ‘oblique’ statement in her declaration does make sense.’" (In re Marriage of Barthold)

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses RKA's motion for reconsideration. The Judge finds that RKA's motion relies on an incorrect standard of what constitutes "new" evidence, citing to Rains v. Sup. Ct. (1984). The Judge also notes that RKA's opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for sanctions fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of CCP section 1008. The Judge further finds that RKA's contention that Khatri filed an improper sur-Reply in its GFS Reply is without merit. The Judge concludes that RKA's motion for reconsideration should be denied due to lack of jurisdiction and failure to meet the prerequisites of CCP section 1008.
