Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving the County and Eva, the biological great-grandmother of a dependent minor named Noah. The Judge has reviewed the pleadings and testimony, and has determined that the testimony of a child welfare social worker, Ms. Hernandez Aviles, is insufficient to establish a mandatory duty to notify Eva of the removal order. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiffs have failed to cite any procedure manual, internal policy, or rules and regulations to support their claims. As a result, the Judge has tentatively ruled to demur to the complaint and strike certain allegations. The Judge has invited the parties to file a response to the tentative ruling.
