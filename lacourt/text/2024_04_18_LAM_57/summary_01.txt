The Court also tentatively decides to grant Defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories 23, 25, 28, and 30. The Court will hear arguments from Plaintiff's counsel at the hearing today. The Court concludes that Defendant's failure to comply with Section 2031.280(a) identification requirement does not authorize a motion to compel compliance, and that Defendant's motion under Section 2031.280 is denied. The Court also concludes that Defendant's motion under Section 2031.320, which allows for a motion to compel compliance with Section 2031.280(a), is possible. Finally, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is not entitled to an order imposing sanctions against Defendant for filing the Section 2031.280 motion."
