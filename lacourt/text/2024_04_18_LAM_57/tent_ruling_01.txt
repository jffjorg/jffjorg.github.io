  Case Number:  22STCV09756    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant's Motion to Compel Compliance With Section 2031.280Defendant
Pedram Mansouri moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Barry Shy to comply
with section 2031.280(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure in connection with
Shy’s  production of documents in
response to Mansouri’s  first set of Requests
for Production of Documents (“RFPs”).   Section 2031.280(a) provides that “[a]ny documents or category of documents produced in response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be identified
with the specific request number to which the documents respond.” (See Pollock
v. Superior Court (Schuster) (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1348, 1352
[“Section 2031.280 prescribes the form in which items must be produced.  As newly amended, it requires that a document
be identified with the specific request number to which it pertains . . .
.”].  According to Mansouri, Shy’s
production of documents failed to comply with that requirement.
 
Mansouri’s motion is made under Section 2031.280(a) itself.  The problem is that Section 2031.280(a) does
not authorize motions to compel compliance with that section.  (The Pollock case, cited above, does
not state otherwise.)   Accordingly, the
Court lacks statutory authority to grant relief on Mansouri’s motion and the
motion must be denied.  Correspondingly,
Mansouri’s request in the motion for the imposition of sanctions against Shy is
denied as well.
 
In his reply brief, Mansouri concedes that Section 20231.280(a) does
not itself authorize motions to compel compliance with that provision.  He argues, however, that motions to compel
compliance with Section 2031.280(a) can be brought under Section 2031.320,
which provides that “if a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing or sampling under . . . Section 2031.280 thereafter fails to
permit the inspect, copying, testing or sampling in accordance with that party’s
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  Mansouri appears to be
correct.  A failure to comply with
Section 2031.280(a)’s identification requirement arguably is a failure to
permit proper inspection of documents that were provided.  The hitch for Mansouri is that he did not move
under Section 2031.320 to compel compliance with Section 2031.280.  He moved under Section 2031.280 to compel
compliance with Section 2031.280.  Again,
there is no authorization in Section 2031.280 for such a motion.
 
It also would appear that Mansouri could have moved under
Section 2031.310 to compel Shy to provide further responses to the RFPs based
on the proposition that Shy’s statement of compliance with the RFPs was
incomplete in that Shy failed to comply with Section 2031.280(a)’s identification
requirement.  But Mansouri did not move
under Section 2031.310.  In fact, his memorandum
in support of the motion disclaims reliance on Section 2031.310, even though
the motion and memorandum are accompanied by a “separate statement,” which is
required for Section 2031.310 motions to compel further responses. 
 Shy argues that he is entitled an order imposing sanctions
against Mansouri for filing the Section 2031.280 motion. The Court disagrees.  Even though Mansouri moved under the wrong provision,
the motion could have been avoided had Shy furnished the identification required
by Section 2031.280.  The Court also has
concluded that Mansouri did meet and confer with Shy about the identification
requirement before the filing motion and so sanctions cannot be awarded based
on a failure to meet and confer.Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories 23, 25, 28, and 30The Court's tentative decision is to grant the Defendant's motion and require Plaintiff to provide further responses to the interrogatories in question.  In reaching that tentative determination, the Court was persuaded by the arguments in Defendant's reply brief in support of the motion.  At the hearing today, the Court will ask Plaintiff's counsel to address those arguments.   The Court also has tentatively determined that sanctions against Plaintiff are not warranted.
