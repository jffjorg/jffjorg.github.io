English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is a decision by the judge in a case between 1340 Broadway, LLC (the plaintiff) and Sunrise NPL, LLC (the defendant). The plaintiff has moved to expunge a lis pendens (a notice of pending litigation) recorded by the defendant against certain properties in Los Angeles. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of any of its claims related to those properties as a result of a settlement agreement between the defendant's predecessor and Cross-Defendant Easy Financial, LLC. The judge agrees with the defendant and denies the plaintiff's motion to expunge the lis pendens. The judge believes that the plaintiff cannot claim that the lis pendens should be expunged by dint of the settlement agreement, but then distance itself from what Easy Financial has urged as to where disputes over the scope of the settlement agreement should be resolved â€“ namely, in New York, not here in this Court.
