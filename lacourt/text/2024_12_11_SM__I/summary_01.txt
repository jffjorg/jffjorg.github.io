And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff to relieve him from the orders granting summary judgment or adjudication against him. The plaintiff's counsel claims that he was unable to competently represent his client due to a devastating mental illness, and has filed declarations confessing to gross malpractice. The judge notes that while counsel's illness was a significant factor, the court is not bound to set aside the orders granting summary judgment or adjudication, but rather has discretion to do so.

The judge is concerned about the lack of opposition papers and the fact that the motion was not filed until almost a month after the declarations were filed. However, the judge is willing to grant the motion, but only if the plaintiff's counsel attaches the opposition papers and explains the basis for the opposition. The judge warns that if the motion is not re-filed within 5 court days, the prior orders will stand.

The judge also notes that the defense may be entitled to a monetary sanction to compensate them for the legal expenses incurred due to the plaintiff's neglect. Finally, the judge will hold the plaintiff's summary judgment motion in abeyance pending resolution of this issue.
