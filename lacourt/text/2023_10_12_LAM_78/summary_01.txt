And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. Plaintiff Nicole Jackson's motion to set aside the dismissal is denied. Defendant Wal Mart Inc.'s motion to strike is also denied. However, Defendant's motion for a prefiling order is granted. The Court orders Defendant to file a proposed form VL-100 within three days after the date of this order. The Court sets a nonappearance review date of the form VL-100 for October 19, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. Defendant must provide notice and file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.

The Court's reasoning is that Plaintiff's statement of disqualification was not properly served on the judge, so Judge Draper's striking the filing was not untimely. Additionally, the Court finds that a prefiling order is necessary because Plaintiff has failed to comply with orders in this case and has a history of litigation.
