Sanctions in the amount of $860 are imposed against Defendant Raheel Lakhany. Sanctions are due within 10 days after the date of this order,Moving party to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for breach of contract and open book account arising from a breach of contract which took place in February 2022. Plaintiff Skyrun Crafts Co., Ltd. and Defendants ST&Company LLC (“ST&Company”) and Raheel Lakhany entered into an agreement in November 2015 wherein Plaintiff would provide goods to Defendants and Defendants would pay for the goods upon the cost provided on each invoice. Plaintiff agreed to provide goods to Defendants on credit and expected Defendants to pay for those goods later. In February 2022, Defendants refused to pay for products that had already been shipped and goods provided on credit. Defendants now owe Plaintiff $136,209.10.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed its Complaint alleging two causes of action for breach of contract and open book account.On February 14, 2023, Defendants answered.On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to deem the requests for admissions (“RFAs”) propounded on Defendant Raheel Lakhany admitted.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves for orders deeming the RFAs propounded on Defendant Raheel Lakhany admitted.Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b), “if a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response,” the propounding “party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Monetary sanctions are mandatory against a party, attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Here, Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that he propounded RFAs on Raheel Lakhany on April 24, 2023. (Ma Decl., ¶4.) On June 28, 2023, counsel sent a letter to Raheel Lakhany inquiring after the late responses. (Id., ¶5.) As of the date of the filing of this motion, Raheel Lakhany has not responded to Plaintiff’s RFAs. (Id., ¶6.) Plaintiff seeks $1,660 in sanctions for 4 hours of attorney time at a rate of $400 plus filing fees. (Id., ¶7.) Because Raheel Lakhany failed to provide any response to Plaintiff’s RFAs, the request is granted. The genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s motion are admitted.  Sanctions are mandatory here because Raheel Lakhany failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s RFAs. However, Plaintiff’s demand is excessive given that the motion is unopposed and nearly identical to an earlier filed motion. The Court awards $860 for two hours of attorney time and filing fees.DATED: October 12, 2023 ____________________________ Hon. Jill FeeneyJudge of the Superior Court
