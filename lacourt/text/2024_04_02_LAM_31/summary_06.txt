And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Rhonda Gibson to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Bronson Avenue Properties, LLC. The demurrer argues that the complaint is barred by claim preclusion due to a prior unlawful detainer action. However, the judge has ruled that the prior action did not involve identical issues and did not conclude a final judgment against Defendant. Therefore, the judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered Defendant to file and serve her answer to the complaint within 10 days. The judge has also granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of the prior litigation and the judgment entered in that action.
