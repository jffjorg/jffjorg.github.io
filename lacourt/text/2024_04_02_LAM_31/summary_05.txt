And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a dispute between Wineman and Fuller and Steakhaus. The dispute revolves around the applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the doctrine of equitable estoppel to an agreement between the parties. The judge finds that the FAA applies to the agreement, citing a Supreme Court case that broadly defines "commerce" to include employment contracts. The judge also notes that the doctrine of equitable estoppel would apply under both New York and California law, as the grounds for invoking the doctrine are the same in both jurisdictions. The judge's ruling is subject to change after further consideration and oral argument.
