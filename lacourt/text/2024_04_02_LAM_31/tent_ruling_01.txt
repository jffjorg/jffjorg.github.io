MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Joshua Driskell, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Fred
Goldstein
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This is a legal malpractice action.  Plaintiff, Fred Goldstein, a self-represented
litigant,[1]
alleges that he retained Defendants, Joshua Driskell, Primuth Driskell &
Terzian LLP, and Lagerlof LLP, in November 2018 to represent Plaintiff in the
underlying probate action filed as 18STPB11264 in the County of Los Angeles.  
 
            On August 3,
2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in pro per against Defendants.  Thereafter, Plaintiff filed the Third Amended
Complaint (TAC) on July 26, 2023.  The
TAC, which is the operative pleading, alleges causes of action for (1) Legal
Malpractice/Negligence, (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duties, (3) Breach of the
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and (4) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress
 
On May 9, 2023, Defendants filed these motions to compel
Plaintiff to provide responses to the First Set of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents.  Defendants seek sanctions against Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against
Defendants.[2]  
 
Defendants filed replies.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
If
a party to whom interrogatories and inspection demands are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).)  A party moving to compel discovery responses under
these statutory provisions is not required to meet and
confer prior to filing the motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko)
(citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted
time’”).)   
Monetary Sanctions¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without
limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or
opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿If sanctions are sought, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity
of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction
requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the
facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary
sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿If the court finds that a party
has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendants are entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to
provide responses to the at-issue discovery. 
It is undisputed Defendants properly served the discovery requests on
Plaintiff on February 7, 2023.  Plaintiff
admits he has not served any responses. 
(See Opp., p. 15:1-3.)  Accordingly,
Plaintiff has waived all objections to the discovery requests.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the motions should be denied because Defendants
did not meet and confer in good faith. 
However, there is no requirement that a party meet and confer prior to
filing a motion seeking initial responses to discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 411 (citing
Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted
time’”).)  Plaintiff also cites inapposite Local Rules from the
Superior Court for the County of Orange and standing orders from different
departments in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, which have nothing to do with
motions to compel initial.  The discovery
requests have been outstanding for over a year.[3]  Plaintiff must provide objection-free
responses to the request.  
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendants request sanctions against Plaintiff.  The court is cognizant that Plaintiff suffers
from a medical condition.  However,
Plaintiff does not show that his condition prevented him from responding to
Defendants’ discovery requests for more than a year.  Given that the court has granted these
motions, and in light of Plaintiff’s medical condition, the court imposes sanctions
at a reduced rate against Plaintiff in the sum of $680, consisting of two hours
at defense counsel’s hourly rate and $180 in filing fees.
 
 IV.
      CONCLUSION
            
The motions are GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-free, verified responses to
Defendants’ First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production of Documents.
 
Defendants’ request for sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions in the
sum of $680 to Defendants, by and through their counsel.
 
Discovery responses are to be provided, and sanctions are to
be paid within 30 days of this order. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
Defendants to give notice.
