[1] While the court is cognizant that
Plaintiff is self-represented, the court must still apply the Civil
Discovery Rules as the court would with any other litigant.  (See,
e.g., Nwosu v. Uba¿(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1247,
[self-represented¿litigants¿are “ ‘treated¿like any other party and [are]
entitled to the¿same, but no greater consideration than other litigants and
attorneys.’ [Citation.]”].)


[2] Plaintiff filed a sur-reply, which
the Court does not consider in the disposition of this motion.


[3] Plaintiff’s opposition makes
reference to being ill.  However, there
is no indication that Plaintiff is presently ill or that he cannot provide
responses due to illness.  Indeed, he
indicates in his opposition that he has “responded” to the requests but has
simply not served those responses.  (See
Opp., p 15:1-3.)
