And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff, David Aguilera, in his lemon law action against General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff had filed a motion to compel the defendant's further responses to form interrogatories, set one, alleging that the defendant's responses were incomplete and not code-compliant.

The court found that the motion was timely and that the defendant's objections to the interrogatories were not well-taken. The court also found that the defendant's responses were incomplete and did not provide the information required by the interrogatories.

As a result, the court granted the motion and ordered the defendant to provide further, verified responses to the interrogatories, Nos. 12.1 and 15.1, within 30 days of the order. The court also ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the order, unless waived.
