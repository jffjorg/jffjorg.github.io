CASE NO.:                 23STCV24999
 





















 
DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Rhonda Gibson
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Bronson
Avenue Properties, LLC
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
According to the complaint, Plaintiff, Bronson Avenue
Properties, LLC, agreed to an Airbnb rental to Defendant, Rhonda Gibson, based
on misrepresentations that Defendant would be actually occupying and residing
in the rental unit.  However, Defendant
deposited over $26,000 for a 240-night stay with the intent of moving her son
Mikhail Quarles (“Quarles”), and his family into the rental unit in Defendant’s
stead.  Defendant intended that this
“bait and switch” would result in her son receiving a “free” rental unit where
no rent would be paid beginning on the 241st night and make eviction
of Quarles and his family difficult.    
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendant alleging causes of action for (1) Fraud – Intentional
Misrepresentation, (2) Fraud – Concealment, (3) Promissory Fraud, (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation (5) Breach of Contract, and (6) Breach of the Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing. 
 
On January 12, 2024, Defendant[1]
filed this demurrer to the Complaint. 
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant has not replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect
to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general
or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America v.
Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.       JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant requests judicial notice of (1) The Complaint filed
on September 26, 2022 in Bronson Avenue Properties, LLC., v. Mikhail Quarles
and Rhonda Gibson, LASC Case No. 22STUD06108, (Request for Judicial Notice
(RJN) 1); and(2) The Judgment entered on July 20, 2023 in Bronson Avenue
Properties, LLC., v. Mikhail Quarles and Rhonda Gibson, LASC Case No.
22STUD06108 (RJN 2).
 
            The
unopposed request is GRANTED.  (Evid.
Code, § 452, subd. (d).)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION 
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)¿ Here, Defendant has not made a showing of meeting and
conferring in person, by telephone, or by video conference prior to filing this
demurrer.  However, “[a] determination by the court that the meet and
confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)  Accordingly, the court exercises its
discretion to consider Defendant’s demurrer.¿ 
 
B.    
Analysis 
 
            Defendant
argues the Complaint is barred by claim preclusion. 
 
“Res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final
judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents
relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same
parties or parties in privity with them.  A predictable doctrine of res
judicata benefits both the parties and the courts because it seeks to curtail
multiple litigation causing vexation and expense to the parties and wasted
effort and expense in judicial administration.” (Consumer Advocacy Group,
Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp.¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, 683 (cleaned up).)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
“A prior judgment is not¿res¿judicata¿on a subsequent action
unless three¿elements¿are satisfied:¿‘(1) the issues decided in the prior
adjudication are identical with those presented in the later action; (2) there
was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action; and (3) the party
against whom the plea is raised was a party or in privity with a party to
the prior adjudication. [Citation.]”  (Id. at pp. 685-86.)¿ “To
prevent piecemeal litigation, the doctrine of res judicata also applies to bar
a second suit arising out of the same factual situation involving matters which
were relevant and within the same scope of the first action, which thus could
have been raised in the first suit. [Citation.]”  (Duffy v. City of
Long Beach (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1257-58.)  
 
            Defendant’s
argument is not well-taken.  Here, the
prior litigation Bronson Avenue Properties, LLC., v. Mikhail Quarles and
Rhonda Gibson, LASC Case No. 22STUD06108 (the “Prior Litigation”) did not
involve identical issues and did not conclude a final judgment against
Defendant.  (See RJN 1 and 2.)  The Prior Litigation was an unlawful detainer
action that concluded in a stipulated judgment in favor of Quarles against
Plaintiff.  Defendant was a party of the Prior
Litigation but a judgment was not entered against her.  
 
            Moreover,
“[g[iven the narrow scope of issues that may be litigated in a summary unlawful
detainer proceeding, “claim preclusion” effect from an unlawful detainer
judgment is relatively uncommon. [See Vella v. Hudgins, supra, 20 C3d at
257, 142 CR at 417; Struiksma v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (2021) 66
CA5th 546, 554-555, 280 CR3d 881, 886-887; Gombiner v. Swartz (2008) 167
CA4th 1365, 1371, 85 CR3d 83, 89].” 
(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group
2023) ¶ 9.410.)  Some of those issues
which may be subject to claim preclusion include (1) successive actions for
back-due rent (Lekse v. Municipal Court (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 188, 194);
(2) civil rights claim premised on retaliatory eviction (Lovely v. Laliberte
(1st Cir. 1974) 498 F.2d 1261); (3) wrongful eviction (Needelman v.
DeWolf Realty Co. Inc. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 750, 753-756).  (See Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide
Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶¶ 9.411, 9:412, 9:412.1, 9:412.2.)  Plaintiff could not have raised these fraud
and breach of contract claims in the Prior Litigation.  Indeed, “[w] hen, after commencement of a UD, possession ceases to be an
issue, the landlord may amend the complaint to seek damages not cognizable in
an unlawful detainer (Civ.C. § 1952.3—suit becomes a nonsummary general civil
action; see ¶ 7:448 ff.). Absent such amendment, the commencement of an
unlawful detainer does not affect the landlord's right to bring a separate
action for contractual damages not recoverable in the UD (but no damages
shall be recovered in the subsequent action for any detriment for which a claim
for damages was made and determined on the merits in the previous action).
[Civ.C. § 1952(b); see Hong Sang Market, Inc. v. Peng (2018) 20 CA5th
474, 497, 229 CR3d 99, 116—UD judgment awarding back-due rent did not preclude
landlord from seeking additional back-due rent in civil action].”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide
Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 9.416.1.)  Plaintiff’s Complaint is not barred by res
judicata.  Defendant’s demurrer lacks
merit.
 
V.        CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
Defendant is ordered to file and
serve her Answer to the Complaint within 10 days of this order.  
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
