```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Shari Edwards. The court found that the defendant's unilateral notice of deposition dates was improper and that the parties failed to meet and confer before filing the motion. The court also denied the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Nathan Johnson, as the body of the moving papers did not address that deposition and the parties do not appear to have a genuine dispute regarding the deposition. The court conditioned its ruling on the payment of $60 in filing fees within 10 days of the order.
