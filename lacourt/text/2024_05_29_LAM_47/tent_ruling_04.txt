TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney

DISCUSSION:
 
Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for
Defendant Washington Motors, LLC, moves to be relieved as counsel.
 
Procedural Violations
 
Moving counsel did not file the Notice of Motion on
Mandatory Form MC-051, did not file the accompanying declaration on Mandatory
Form MC-052, and did not file a proposed order at all. Those papers which were
filed were served on all parties via mail on May 2, 2024, but there is no
confirmation that the address is current, or, if not, why no more current
address could be located. These multiple procedural violations, by themselves,
are sufficient justification to deny the motion. However, even if the Court
addressed the motion on its merits, Moving Counsel has not stated a valid basis
to permit withdrawal. 
 
Substantive Basis for Withdrawal
 
Moving Counsel seeks to withdraw on the basis that
Washington Motors, LLC “has been terminated and no longer exists,” and because
there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, Moving Counsel brings this motion just over a month
before trial and seeks to withdraw on a basis that is legally invalid. As
to the first ground, the cancellation of the LLC does not mean it cannot be
sued in this action.  Under California law, a limited liability company
that has filed a certificate of cancellation continues to exist indefinitely
“for the purpose of winding up its affairs, prosecuting and defending actions
by or against it in order to collect and discharge obligations, disposing of
and conveying its property, and collecting and dividing its assets.” (Corp.
Code § 17707.06 (a).) The “termination” of Washington Motors is therefore of no
consequence, as it may still sue or be sued, and thus must be represented by
counsel as a corporate entity. Permitting withdrawal at this juncture would
therefore work undue prejudice both to the client, who would be left on the eve
of trial without representation, and to Plaintiff, as the Court would be forced
to continue trial to provide Defendant an opportunity to retain substitute
counsel. 
 
Further,
although the papers contend that the basis of the motion is that the
representation is resulting in an unreasonable financial burden because Moving
Counsel is no longer being paid, that is likely an argument for a breach of the
representation agreement, rather than a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship as stated in the Notice of Motion, and so the Court refuses to
consider that argument. Even if considered a basis for withdrawal under some
circumstances, this rationale is not sufficient for withdrawal so close to
trial because of the prejudice that would result. 
 
The
Court therefore finds that the Moving Counsel has not demonstrated that the
Court should permit withdrawal on the bases set forth in the Notice of Motion. 
 
This is the second time that Moving Counsel has sought to
be relieved without complying with the procedural requirements for such a
motion, notwithstanding the substantive basis to deny the motion in this
context. These requirements are mandatory, and the Court’s previous
ruling set out what is expected of Moving Counsel if they seek withdrawal. Moving
Counsel is admonished to comply with all procedural requirements on any future
motion of this nature. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
Accordingly, Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for Defendant
Washington Motors, LLC’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
