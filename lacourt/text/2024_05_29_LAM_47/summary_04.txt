Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for counsel to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed by Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for Defendant Washington Motors, LLC. The Court denied the motion, citing procedural violations in filing the Notice of Motion and failure to comply with mandatory requirements. The Court also found that the basis for withdrawal was invalid, as Washington Motors, LLC, may still be sued or sued, and therefore counsel must continue to represent the entity. The Court denied the motion, finding that the request for withdrawal was not justified, and that the attorney-client relationship had not broken down.
