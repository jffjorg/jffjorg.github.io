  - "The purposes of attorney fee provisions, indemnity provisions, and assumption of risk provisions all differ: an attorney fee provision governs disputes between the parties; an indemnity provision applies when a third party, not the parties themselves, sues one of the parties; and an assumption of risk provision involves one party acknowledging and accepting the inherent risks of an activity or service, thereby limiting the liability of the provider for those risks."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant City of Long Beach's motion to award costs and attorney's fees in the amount of $54,708.06 and $329,208.75, respectively. The judge found that the indemnification and assumption of risk provisions in the Lime user agreement do not provide for the award of attorney fees in an action between the parties, and that the provisions are not titled as attorney fee provisions. The judge also noted that the language used in the provisions is typical for indemnity agreements and assumption of risk provisions, and does not contain any language that is typical of an attorney's fee provision in a lawsuit between the parties. Therefore, the judge denied Defendant's motion to award costs and attorney's fees.
