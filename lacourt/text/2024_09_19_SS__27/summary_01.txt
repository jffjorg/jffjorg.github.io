And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from dismissal due to excusable neglect. On April 30, 2024, the plaintiff's counsel did not appear at the hearing due to technological issues, despite having arranged for coverage. The court continued the hearing to June 26, 2024, but neither the plaintiff nor counsel appeared, leading to the dismissal of the action without prejudice. The plaintiff now moves the court for mandatory relief from the dismissal, citing excusable neglect and regrettable miscommunication within the team. The court finds that the mandatory relief provision of Section 473, subdivision (b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure applies, as the neglect led to the court's dismissal of the case and the motion was filed within six months of the dismissal. The court grants the motion and sets a non-appearance case review for [undetermined date].
