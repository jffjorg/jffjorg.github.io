And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel. The plaintiff failed to appear at two scheduled independent medical examinations (IMEs) and incurred late cancellation fees of $1,500 each time. Despite multiple attempts to communicate with the plaintiff's counsel, the defendant was unable to reschedule the IMEs and was forced to incur additional fees. The plaintiff's counsel also failed to respond to the defendant's meet-and-confer efforts, which further supports the imposition of sanctions. The judge finds that the cancellation fees are reasonable and common for a doctor to charge for a no-show or last-minute cancellation. The judge orders sanctions in the amount of $3,960, which includes $3,000 for the cancellation fees and $960 for the defendant's attorney's fees.
