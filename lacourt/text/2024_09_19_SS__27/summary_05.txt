And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel initial discovery responses and requests for sanctions. The defendants served special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and form interrogatories on the plaintiff on January 25, 2024, and the plaintiff failed to provide responses prior to the statutory deadline of February 24, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff did not provide any opposition or documentation indicating that the discovery responses were served prior to the hearing. Therefore, the court ordered the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the defendants' discovery requests without objections within 20 days.

Additionally, the court imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $1,500, payable to the defendants within 20 days. The court reduced the sanctions from the requested amount of $810 per motion due to the simplicity and duplicity of the issues and the lack of objections. The parties are advised to submit their objections or intentions to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on September 19, 2024.
