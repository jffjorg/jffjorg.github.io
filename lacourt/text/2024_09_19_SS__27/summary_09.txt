And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (Perch Restaurant, et al.) is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's (Alejandra Quintero) third cause of action for product liability is dismissed.

The court's decision is based on the fact that the defendants are not within the stream of commerce for the original product, and the plaintiff has failed to allege facts that the newly reconstructed product was put into the stream of commerce. The court has previously ruled that the defendants are not liable for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff under California's strict products liability precedents.

The plaintiff has had ample opportunity to comply with the pleading standards, but has failed to do so. The court has not found any facts that would suggest that further amendments could cure the defect.
