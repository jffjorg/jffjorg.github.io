Summary:

The judge has granted the City of Los Angeles's motion for summary judgment, finding that the sidewalk displacement that caused Plaintiff Marilyn Gottesman's trip-and-fall accident is trivial as a matter of law. The court considered the size of the defect, which measured 1 ¼ inches at its highest point, and concluded that it is not dangerous. Additionally, the court found that there were no aggravating factors, such as obstructions, poor lighting, or defects in the sidewalk surface. The court applied the two-part test for determining whether a sidewalk defect is trivial, considering the size of the defect and any additional factors. The court concluded that the displacement did not pose a substantial risk of injury and therefore is trivial.
