BACKGROUND This  is a consolidated action to quiet title. Plaintiffs Tony To Chong Loo, Cui Ping  Loo, Danny Weising Loo, and William Loo allege that Zixi Li acted in concert  with others to use the Loos’ names to forge, present, and notarize false powers  of attorney and deeds of trust in order to obtain loans. On  October 2, 2019, the Loos, with the exception of William Loo, filed a complaint  alleging the following causes of action against Li, LC Equity Group (LC  Equity), Ress Financial Corporation (Ress Financial), First American Title  Company (First American), Weishi Xie, Agnes N. Nwapa-Jourdan, all persons known  and unknown, and Does 1-25: (1) declaratory relief, (2) cancellation of  instruments, (3) slander of title, (4) quiet title, and (5) unjust enrichment.  Subsequently, the following Defendants were added to the action: Sunwest Trust  FBO David W. Free (Free Trust); Steven Goldenberg; Michael J. Tannenbaum;  Oxnard Street, LLC (Oxnard Street); ZVI Gutentag and Michael Gutentag, Trustees  of the Gutentag Family Trust (Gutentag Trust); Sunwest Trust FBO Joseph Davis  (Davis Trust); Eyal Gutentag and Diane Gutentag, Trustees of the Gutentag  Revocable Trust, Dated June 4, 2019 (2019 Gutentag Trust); The Bernard  Rothschild Pension Plan, by and through Bernard Rothschild and James Bernard  Rothshild as Trustees (Rothschild Pension Plan); Summit Capital LLC (Summit),  and CDG Investments, LLC (CDG). On  December 5, 2019, Tannenbaum filed a cross-complaint against Li, Xie, and Roes  1-20, alleging causes of action for (1) indemnity, (2) contribution, (3)  intentional misrepresentation, (4) concealment, and (5) negligence of a notary  public. On the same day, the Davis Trust, Goldenberg, the 2019 Gutentag Trust,  the Free Trust, the Gutentag Trust, Oxnard Street, CDG, and LC Equity filed a  cross-complaint against the same defendants and alleging the same causes of  action. On  October 2, 2019, William Loo filed a  verified complaint alleging the following causes of action against Li, M. Zha,  Nwapa-Jourdan, Summit, the Rothschild Pension Plan, JMR Investments (JMR), Does  1-25, and all persons unknown, alleging the following causes of action: (1)  declaratory relief, (2) cancellation of instruments, (3) slander of title, (4)  quiet title, and (5) unjust enrichment. On December 5, 2019, Summit and the Rothschild  Pension Plan filed a cross-complaint against Li, Zha, and Roes 1-20 for (1)  indemnity, (2) contribution, (3) fraud by intentional misrepresentation, (4)  fraud by concealment, and (5) negligence of a notary public. On June 7, 2023, the separate actions by the Loos  and William Loo were consolidated into the present action. On May 23, 2024, the Court entered a judgment in  favor of the Loos against Xie, Zha, Li, and Nwapa-Jourdan. On June 3, 2024, the Loos  filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for June 28, 2024. ANALYSIS Plaintiffs move the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs against  Xie, Zha, Li, and Nwapa-Jourdan. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS  their motion. Legal  Standard “Except  as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and  mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the  agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or  proceedings are entitled to their costs . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract which specifically provides for attorney  fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement is entitled to reasonable  attorney fees in addition to other costs. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).) The court, upon notice and  motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an  element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees. (Civ. Code, § 1717,  subd. (a), (b).) “The  amount to be awarded to a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound  discretion of the trial judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway  Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the  reasonableness of an attorney fees award, the court considers “the nature,  difficulty, intricacy and importance of the litigation, the amount involved,  the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts, his or her learning,  age and experience, and the time consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.) Discussion In this case,  the Loos seek an award of attorney fees in the amount of $298,048.25. The Court  first finds they are entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party in this  action for slander of title. (See Sumner Hill Homeowners’ Assn., Inc. v. Rio  Mesa Holdings, LLC (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 999, 1030.) The requested  attorney fees are split between two attorneys. The first attorney, Stephen E.  Ensberg, Esq., requests $155,673.25 at an hourly rate of $325. (Ensberg Decl.,  ¶ 4, 8.) The second attorney, Christopher D. Lee, Esq., requests $141,375.00 at  an hourly rate of $390. (Lee Decl., ¶ 9-10.) Each attorney provides their  education and experience. (Ensberg Decl., ¶ 6-7; Lee Decl., ¶ 10.) They also  each provide billing statements for their requested fees. (Ensberg Decl., Ex.  A; Lee Decl., Ex. C.) Upon review of this information, the court finds the  amount requested to be reasonable, although the Court notes the sum of their  requested attorney fees is $297,048.25, not $298,048.25. The  Loos also requested the award of $126,518.62 in costs, to which Defendants failed  to file a timely objection or make a request to tax costs.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ costs are also  granted. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Plaintiffs’  motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $297,048.25 in attorney fees and $126,518.62  in costs.
