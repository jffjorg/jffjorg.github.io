 Case Number:  22SMCV00802    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  I The court issued its FSC order on December 29, 2022.  The trial has been continued once.  To date, the court has received no FSC
materials.  The court assumes that is
because the parties have settled the case. 
If so, the court will vacate the trial date and set an OSC re: Dismissal
(Settlement) for about 90 days in the future. 
 
If, on the other hand, the parties have not settled, the
court will have to discuss the appropriate response and sanctions to the
parties’ mutual failure to follow the court’s order.  The trial date, however, is VACATED because
the parties are plainly not ready for trial.
