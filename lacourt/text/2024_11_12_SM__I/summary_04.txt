And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case that was set for trial on November 12, 2024. Despite issuing a formal settlement conference (FSC) order on September 19, 2024, the court has received no materials from the parties. The judge assumes that the parties may have settled the case, and if so, will vacate the trial date and schedule a new hearing to confirm the settlement. If the parties have not settled, the judge will consider imposing sanctions for their failure to follow the court's order. In any case, the judge is vacating the trial date due to the parties' lack of readiness. The judge notes that they had warned the parties of the potential problem with providing FSC materials, but it appears that they have not had sufficient time to deal with them.
