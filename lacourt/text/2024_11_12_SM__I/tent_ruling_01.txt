  Case Number:  20SMCV01275    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the request to continue the
trial.  The reason given is that a party
has moved out of the country and supposedly needs notice before trial.  The court finds that to be unconvincing.  The case has been set for trial for a very
long time and continued twice both times to allow the parties to complete
discovery and complete mediation.  The
initial FSC order was given on April 9, 2021. 
Unless the move came this week, there is no reason for the unduly late
notice or for the matter not being ready for trial.
 
That said, the case is obviously not ready for trial, so the
trial date will have to be vacated.  The
court will set a TSC.  The question is
when the new trial date ought to be and the amount of sanctions to be imposed
for the parties’ mutual decision to ignore the court’s order.  If there is another case that is ready to go,
the court will view this as not as troubling as it could have been, more by
luck than skill.  But if there is no
other case ready to go, the court will view this as the parties not acting
diligently or in conformance with orders and the sanction against the parties
and counsel will be appropriate to that view because it will have a negative
impact on the court’s calendar and on the ability of other cases to get to
trial.  As to the next trial date, the
court cannot guarantee the date—it could well not be until June or July 2026.
The court will also discuss whether to extend the discovery cut offs.  Of course, the parties may agree to take
discovery; the question is whether the court will enforce any such agreement.
