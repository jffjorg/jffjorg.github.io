And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has received a request to continue the trial, citing that a party has moved out of the country and needs notice before trial. The judge finds this reason unconvincing, as the case has been set for trial for a long time and has been continued twice already to allow for discovery and mediation. The court notes that the initial FSC order was given on April 9, 2021, and that there is no reason for the unduly late notice or for the matter not being ready for trial. The court will vacate the trial date and set a new one, but cannot guarantee the date, which may be as late as June or July 2026. The court will also discuss whether to extend the discovery cut-offs. The parties' failure to act diligently and follow court orders may result in sanctions, which could impact the court's calendar and the ability of other cases to get to trial.
