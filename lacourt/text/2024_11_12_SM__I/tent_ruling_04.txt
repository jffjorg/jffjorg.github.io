 Case Number:  24SMCV03015    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  I The court issued its FSC order on September 19, 2024 in this
UD case.  To date, the court has received
no FSC materials.  The court assumes that
is because the parties have settled the case. 
If so, the court will vacate the trial date and set an OSC re: Dismissal
(Settlement) for about 90 days in the future.
 
If, on the other hand, the parties have not settled, the
court will have to discuss the appropriate response to the parties’ mutual
failure to follow the court’s order, including sanctions.  The trial date, however, is VACATED because
the parties are plainly not ready for trial. 
The court recognizes that the parties have not had long to deal with the
FSC materials, but the court warned of that problem when the matter was set for
trial.
