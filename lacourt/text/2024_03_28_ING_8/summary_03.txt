- "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
- "Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders."

Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, Joseph Peyman Fahr, DDS. The motion seeks terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Maricel Pitcher, in favor of the defendant, dismissing with prejudice the case and staying further proceedings until the plaintiff complies with the court's orders. The judge has requested that the plaintiff's counsel, Stanley D. Bowman, Esq., address several questions at oral argument, including the authenticity of the discovery responses and the proof of payment of monetary sanctions. The judge is considering imposing terminating sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders and the lack of evidence that the defendant has received the corrected discovery responses.
