And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Laurence Ring, to be relieved as attorney of record for Plaintiff George Ajrab. The motion was filed on March 13, 2024, and served on Plaintiff by mail. Ring has been actively attempting to sell his law practice and retire, and has advised Plaintiff to either settle or seek new representation. However, Plaintiff has refused both options. The Court finds that the withdrawal of Ring as attorney of record will not cause an injustice or undue delay in proceedings, and therefore grants the motion. The order will be signed at the hearing, and a copy of the signed order must be served on Plaintiff and all parties that have appeared in the case.
