And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file a first amended complaint without prejudice. The motion was denied because the proposed amendment was not in proper form and failed to comply with the California Rules of Court. The amendment adds a new defendant and cause of action, and the delay in filing the amendment has compressed the time for the defendant to investigate, conduct discovery, and prepare to respond to the new allegations. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to provide a sufficient explanation for the delay in filing the amendment. The ruling is tentative and may be subject to change before the final decision is made.
