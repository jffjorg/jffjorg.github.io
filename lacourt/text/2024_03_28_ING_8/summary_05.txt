Summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing on March 28, 2024. The case involves Steven Barker, the plaintiff, and Geico General Insurance Company, the defendant. The plaintiff filed a Petition to Compel Underinsured Motorist Action for Damages and served discovery requests on the defendant, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission. The defendant failed to respond to these requests, prompting the plaintiff to file motions to compel responses. The defendant's current counsel submitted a declaration with verified responses, which the court has deemed sufficient. As a result, the motions to compel initial responses are mooted, and the motion to deem requests for admission as admitted is also mooted. The court is inclined to continue the hearing on the request for sanctions, allowing the parties to negotiate a fair and reasonable amount.
