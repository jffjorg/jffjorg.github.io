A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
On
July 20, 2021, Plaintiff, Maricel Pitcher (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant, Joseph Fahr, DDS (“Fahr”), Beautiful Smile Dental Center,
and DOES 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges a cause of action for: Dental
Malpractice. 
 
The
moving papers assert that on November 15, 2023, Judge Jaskol heard Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Five, and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set Five, and Requests for Sanctions. In
that order, Judge Jaskol noted that on April 28, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s
motions to compel further discovery responses, and ordered Plaintiff to serve
further discovery responses and pay Defendant $2,600 in sanctions by May 26,
2022. However, on July 6, 2022, Judge Jaskol found that Plaintiff had not fully
complied with Court’s April 28, 2022 order, and subsequently ordered Plaintiff
to provide verified responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 12 and 14 and
code-compliant responses to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 11 by
July 21, 2022. In addition, Judge Jaskol ordered Plaintiff and her counsel to
pay Defendant $2,510 in sanctions by August 6, 2022, but denied Defendant’s
request for terminating sanctions. 
 
On
September 29, 2023, Judge Jaskol again found that Plaintiff had not complied
with the Court’s April 28, 2022 order to pay Defendant $2,600 in sanctions by
May 26, 2022 and had not shown good cause or substantial justification for the
failure to pay these amounts. Judge Jaskol further granted Defendant’s request
to impose additional sanctions to penalize Plaintiff for disobeying this
Court’s April 28, 2022 order and ordered Plaintiff to pay the Court $500 in
sanctions by October 30, 2023. 
 
            In Judge Jaskol’s November 15, 2023
order, the Court again granted Defendant’s motion to compel further responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set Five for Requests Nos. 76 and 77 as well as
Request for Production of Documents, Set Five and ordered Plaintiff to provide
further verified code-complaint responses to RFP Nos. 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68,
69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89,
90, 91, 92, 93, and 94 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested by December 18, 2023. Further, Judge
Jaskol granted Defendant’s Request for Sanctions against Plaintiff and her
counsel in the amount of $1,870. However, Defendant contends that Defense
counsel and Plaintiff’s counsel had a follow up discussion on November 16,
2023, and then a follow up correspondence on November 29, 2023, and then again
on January 4, 2024. Despite these follow-up communications, Defendant asserts
that none of the responses Plaintiff was ordered to serve in the November 15,
2023 Order have been served on Defendant, nor the monetary sanctions as of the
date of the filing of the motion. 
 
            The case was reassigned by the PI
Hub Court to Inglewood Department 8 on February 27, 2024, with the case then
set for trial a month later, on March 28, 2024. 
Department 8 briefly postponed the trial in light of the pending
discovery and sanctions motion.  
 
            As such, Defendant Fahr now files a
Motion for Terminating Sanctions seeking the following orders: 
 
1.      A
terminating sanction in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff MARICEL
PITCHER, dismissing with prejudice the Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
21STCV26659 as to all parties and all Causes of Action. Alternatively, a
terminating sanction in the form of an order staying further proceedings until
Plaintiff has complied with the Court’s 11/15/2023 Orders; 
2.      An
issue sanction deeming established the following facts: a) Defendant did not
breach the standard of care in treating Plaintiff; b) Defendant did not cause
or exacerbate any injury or damage to Plaintiff; and c) Plaintiff did not
suffer any damages as a result of any act or omission by Defendant.
Alternatively, an issue sanction prohibiting Plaintiff from supporting her
claims that: a) Defendant breached the standard of care in treating Plaintiff;
b) Defendant caused or exacerbated injury or damage to Plaintiff; and c)
Plaintiff suffered damages as a result of any act or omission by Defendant; 
3.      An
evidentiary sanction precluding Plaintiff from introducing evidence on the
issues of standard of care, duty, breach, causation, and damages; and 
4.      A
monetary sanction against Plaintiff and her attorney of record, Stanley D.
Bowman, Esq., in the amount of $2,790.
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
On February 1, 2024,
Defendant Fahr filed a Motion for Terminating Sanctions. On February 14, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an opposition brief. On February 20, 2024, Defendant Fahr filed
a reply brief. 
 
 
¿II. ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
 If a party fails to comply
with a court order compelling discovery responses or attendance at a
deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating
sanctions. Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (h) (depositions); § 2030.290,
subd. (c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300, subd. (c) (demands for production of
documents); § 2033.290, subd. (e) (requests for admission). Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to
any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process .
. .” Section 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. .
.”  
  
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390
[citation omitted].)    
    
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders.” (Id., citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal. App.
4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes].)  
 
Discussion
 
            Here, Defendant argues that good
cause exists for terminating sanctions because Plaintiff has failed to comply
with a court order, and this is not the first time this issue has occurred,
despite numerous occasions of monetary sanctions. 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff contends
that after receiving Defendant’s meet and confer letter and prior to the
hearing scheduled for November 15, 2023, Plaintiff corrected her responses to
the production of documents 67, 68, and 71-73 to include the language that
“Plaintiff made a reasonable inquiry” and serve them on defendant’s counsel on
September 28, 2023. Plaintiff also asserts that at the November 15, 2023
hearing, Plaintiff’s attorney informed the court that the production of
documents had already been corrected and sent to defendant’s counsel, and that
Defendant’s counsel admitted receiving the additional responses from Plaintiff,
but claimed the responses were the exact same as the precious responses without
the additional language. In response, Plaintiff contends that the Court ordered
that Plaintiff again send the responses and documents to defendant’s counsel.
Plaintiff contends that on November 28, 2023, a flash drive with the documents
being produced and the Plaintiff’s responses to the requests for production of
documents, set 5 was sent to defendant’s counsel. Further, Plaintiff asserts
that her counsel and defendant’s counsel have had communications since the
November 2023 hearing, but that it was not until Plaintiff received Defendant’s
current motion that Plaintiff had knowledge that defendant maintains he did not
receive the responses and documents sent by Plaintiff in November 2023. 
 
            As noted in Defendant’s reply brief,
it is impossible for Plaintiff to have complied with a court order to produce
documents if the documents were never sent. Plaintiff argues that said
documents “can be available” to this Court for inspection, however, they were
not provided by Plaintiff in or attached to the opposing papers. The Court
takes issue with the numerous outstanding sanctions previously ordered by this
Court as far back as April 28, 2022. Because this case was recently transferred
to this Court, and this Court has not previously ruled on this discovery motion
(unlike the extensive rulings from Judge Jaskol), this Court needs more
information before deciding what path to take going forward.  Because the documents in question were not
provided to this Court, or proven to be delivered to Defendant, the Court is in
a quandary between knowing if there are willful misuses or the discovery
process, sloppiness in substantiation that certain things were done or not done
on certain dates, or a simple miscommunication between counsel.
 
For
oral argument on this motion, the Court will require Mr. Bowman to address the following:
 
1.     
Did Mr. Bowman, as
counsel or record, sign the discovery responses?
2.     
Did Mr. Bowman, as
counsel of record, have the responsive documents sequentially numbered by Bates
stamp, digital equivalent of Bates stamping, or some other method?
3.     
Explain why the responsive
documents with a proof of service were not attached to the Opposition, given the
severity of sanctions sought?  
4.     
Why were the discovery
responses and the production of documents not served on defense counsel by
email?  
5.     
Is there a proof of
service for the November 2023 production of documents?
6.     
Does the verified written
response to the RFP specify, by Bates number or otherwise, which documents are
responsive to which Request? 
7.     
What proof of payment of the
monetary sanctions can counsel of record provide here?
8.      Should the Court vacate or continue the trial date until full compliance
with Judge Jaskol’s prior orders can be established?
