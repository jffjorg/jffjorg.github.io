  Case Number:  23PSCV02838    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Vons’
MOTION TO STRIKE PUNITIVE DAMAGES is MOOT as a FAC was filed. 
 
Background
 
This is a wrongful death case. Plaintiffs CLAUDIA JIMENEZ,
and JUAN CARLOS JIMENEZ, as individuals, and as heirs and
successors-in-interest of BRIAN SCOTT JIMINEZ allege the following against
Defendants ALBERTSONS COMPANIES, INC., a California corporation; ALBERTSONS
COMPANIES, INC., a California corporation doing business as VONS; WEISER
SECURITY SERVICES, INC. (“Weiser”), a corporation; SECURITY GUARD, an
individual; LUIS ALBERTO BANUELOS (“Banuelos”), an individual; MARIA ELENA
GONZALES (“Gonzales”),[1]
an individual: On December 1, 2022, a Vons security guard led a car chase
pursuit after Banuelos after Banuelos allegedly stole alcohol from Vons. In the
pursuit, Banuelos drove through a red light, violently smashing into the driver
side of Brian Jimenez, who later died from blunt force trauma. 
 
On September 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit.
 
On October 20, 2023, Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc.
(erroneously named and sued as "Albertsons Companies, Inc., a California
corporation; Albertsons Companies, Inc., a California corporation doing
business as VONS") (hereinafter "Vons") filed a motion to strike
punitive damages. 
 
On December 1, 2023, Defendant Weiser filed its answer and a
cross-complaint against Banuelos and Gonzalez for: 1.    
Equitable/Implied Indemnity 2.    
Comparative Fault and 3.    
Declaratory Relief
 
On January 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint (FAC) asserting COAs for: 
 
1.    
Wrongful Death and
2.    
Negligent Hiring/Supervision
 
Discussion
 
As a FAC was filed, meaning the FAC now serves as the
operative complaint, the motion to strike punitive damages from the original
complaint is MOOT. 
 
That said, the court notes that the FAC is largely similar
to the original complaint, and both do not contain specific facts that
Vons acted with oppression, fraud or malice. Additionally, the motion
indicates that Plaintiffs have not responded to meet and confer efforts. Should
Defendant Vons file a subsequent motion to strike punitive damages from the
FAC, the court requires Plaintiffs to meet and confer. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is moot.
