And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to strike punitive damages filed by defendant Vons. The court finds that the motion is moot due to the filing of the first amended complaint (FAC), which serves as the operative complaint. The FAC is largely similar to the original complaint and does not contain specific facts that Vons acted with oppression, fraud or malice. The court notes that plaintiffs have not responded to meet and confer efforts and requires them to do so if defendant Vons files a subsequent motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC.
