And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to sever the second cause of action from the complaint. The defendants, Parvin Yadegar and Kambiz Yadegar, individually and as trustee of the Yadegar K. Trust, had requested the court to sever the second cause of action, which relates to a motor vehicle accident, from the complaint. The plaintiff, Michael Lavian, does not oppose the motion and stipulates that he would not seek damages against the defendants for the motor vehicle accident. The judge finds that severance is proper because the two causes of action relate to unrelated events with unrelated parties, and that trying the two causes of action together would cause confusion and unnecessary time and expense. The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
