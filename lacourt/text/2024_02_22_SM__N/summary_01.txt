And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Jonathan Bolerjack's motion to enforce a settlement agreement and dismiss the entire action with prejudice. The motion was filed by Defendant in relation to a written settlement agreement with Plaintiff Mac Anderson. The Court lacks a basis to enforce the purported settlement due to several reasons. Firstly, the proposed settlement terms sent to Plaintiff's counsel by defense counsel do not include a provision for the Court to retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. Secondly, there is no evidence that Plaintiff authorized his attorney to bind him to a settlement agreement. Thirdly, the email response from Plaintiff's counsel does not constitute an electronic signature to the agreement. Finally, there is no signed copy of the settlement agreement provided. As a result, the Court denies Defendant's motion.
