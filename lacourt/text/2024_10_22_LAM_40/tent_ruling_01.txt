I. Background
A. Pleadings
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC)
against Defendants Khowsrow Benji, Anna Benji, and DOES 1 through 100,
inclusive. The FAC asserts twenty-one (21) causes of action against all Defendants
concerning FEHA violations, assault, battery, Labor Code violations, and
wrongful termination. 
This action involves Plaintiff’s
employment with the Defendants around December 22, 2020, until May 3, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges she worked as the Defendants’ housekeeper before she was
constructively terminated. Plaintiff alleges Mr. Benji consistently sexually
harassed, assaulted, and battered her.
On February 26, 2024, Mr. Benji
filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff for the following causes of action:
1) Negligence; 2) Assault; 3) Battery; 4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and 5) Physical Elder Abuse.
B. Relevant Procedural History
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel compliance with the Court’s April 22, 2024, Order and for
sanctions. The Court heard the motion and awarded sanctions against Defendants
and Defendants counsel in the amount of $2,627.50. (Minute Order, July 25, 2024.)
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion for an order enforcing the Court’s April 22, 2024, Order and for
sanctions. The Court heard the motion and awarded sanctions against Defendants
and Defendants counsel in the amount of $1,940.00. (Minute Order, September 26,
2024.)
 
C. Motion Before the Court
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for (1) an order enforcing the Court’s July 25, 2024
Order to pay sanctions of $2,627.50, (2) $1,500.00 in sanctions against
Defendants and Defendants counsel pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5,
and (3) $1,687.50 in sanctions against Defendants and Defendants counsel
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030. 
            The
Defendants did not file an opposition. 
            On October
11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply to her unopposed motion.   
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
177.5 provides that “A judicial officer shall have the power to impose
reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500),
notwithstanding any other provision of law, payable to the court, for any
violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or
substantial justification. This power shall not apply to advocacy of counsel
before the court. For the purposes of this section, the term “person” includes
a witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or both. Sanctions pursuant to
this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party’s
moving or responding papers; or on the court’s own motion, after notice and
opportunity to be heard. An order imposing sanctions shall be in writing and
shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.”
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 permits California courts to impose issue or evidence sanctions for
discovery misuses, which are defined by section 2023.010 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. (See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 288 [The court’s inherent power to curb abuses and
promote fair process extends to the preclusion of evidence].) 
B. Analysis
The Court's July 25, 2024 Minute
Order directed the Defendants to pay sanctions of $2,627.50 to Plaintiff's
counsel within 30 days. (Minute Order, July 25, 2024.) However, Plaintiff asserts
that, to date, Defendants have yet to do so. (Barahmand Decl. ¶ 8.) 
Plaintiff also requests monetary
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 177.5 and 2023.030 (Notice of
Motion). 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions in the total amount of
$1,687.50. Plaintiff’s request is based upon counsel’s rate of $375.00/hour for
4.5 total hours of work as follows: (1) 2.0 hours in pursuit of this matter,
including drafting the instant motion (2) 1.5 hours to prepare a reply, (3) 1.0
hour to appear at the hearing, and (4) $65.00 for the cost of bringing forth
this motion. (Barahmand Decl. ¶¶ 9-12.)
This amount is reasonable, and as
the caption specifically requests $1,687.50, the Court will award that amount
in sanctions.
The Court declines to impose
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 177.5, as the discovery
sanctions are specifically tailored to discovery disputes, but that section would
provide an additional basis on which to award sanctions.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Defendants and their counsel are jointly and severally ordered to pay a total
of $4,315.00, which includes: (1) $2,627.50 as mandated by the Court's July 25,
2024 Order, and (2) $1,687.50 in sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030. 
III. Conclusion
            Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiff Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s Motion for an Order Compelling Compliance
with the Court’s July 25, 2024 Order and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. 
            Defendants and their counsel are
jointly and severally ordered to pay $4,315.00 within 30 days to Plaintiff’s
counsel.
