And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiff, Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio, seeking to compel compliance with a previous court order and requesting sanctions against the defendants, Khowsrow Benji and Anna Benji, and their counsel. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the court's July 25, 2024 order to pay sanctions of $2,627.50. The plaintiff is seeking an additional $1,500.00 in sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5 and $1,687.50 in sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030.

The judge grants the motion and orders the defendants and their counsel to pay a total of $4,315.00, which includes the original $2,627.50 in sanctions and the additional $1,687.50 in sanctions. The judge declines to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, as the discovery sanctions are specifically tailored to discovery disputes, but notes that this section would provide an additional basis on which to award sanctions.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's allegations of sexual harassment and assault by the defendant Khowsrow Benji, and the defendants' failure to comply with the court's previous order. The plaintiff's employment with the defendants from December 22, 2020, to May 3, 2023, is also relevant to the case.
