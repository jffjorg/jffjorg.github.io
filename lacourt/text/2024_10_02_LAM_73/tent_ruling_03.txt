DEFENDANT JACOB PERLER’S motion FOR
RELIEF FROM ENTRY OF DEFAULT (filed on 08/14/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Jacob
Perler’s motion for relief from entry of default is CONTINUED to October 29,
2024. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff Primarket, LLC
filed this action against Defendants RN Wellness, LLC (“RN”) and Jacob Perler
(“Perler”). 
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following causes of action:
1.     
Breach of Contract;
2.     
False Designation of Origin;
3.     
Trafficking of Counterfeit Goods;
4.     
Violation of California Business and Professions Code section
17200 et seq.;
5.     
Intentional Misrepresentation;
6.     
Negligent Misrepresentation; and
7.     
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability.
 
The FAC alleges the following. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant RN is a merchant and wholesaler of personal protective equipment
(“PPE”) and COVID-19 testing kits. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Perler
is the sole member and/or manager of RN and responsible for RN. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants purchased, promoted, distributed, advertised, sold
and/or offered to sell counterfeit COVID-19 testing kits. 
 
On August 8, 2024, the Court denied Defendants RN Wellness,
LLC and Jacob Perler’s motions for relief from entry of default.
 
On
August 14, 2024, Defendant Jacob Perler filed a renewed Motion for relief from
entry of default, arguing:
·      
Defendant requests that the court set aside the default entered by
Plaintiff and grant leave to file a responsive pleading. Defendant attaches an
Answer to the instant Motion.
·      
Defendant brings this motion for relief from default on the
grounds that mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) has resulted in a default being
entered.
 
II.
DISCUSSION
 
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that it appears Plaintiff failed to
correctly file its Opposition to Defendant Perler’s motion. The document that
Plaintiff filed on September 18, 2024 as the Opposition is actually Plaintiff’s
Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Scott Greene. Therefore, the Court
continues the motion to allow Plaintiff to correctly file its Opposition. 
 
III. DISPOSITION

Defendant
Jacob Perler’s motion for relief from entry of default is CONTINUED to October
29, 2024.
