And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Jacob Perler's motion for relief from entry of default is continued to October 29, 2024. The motion was filed on August 14, 2024, after the court had previously denied the defendants' motions for relief from entry of default on August 8, 2024. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to correctly file its opposition to the motion, and therefore continues the motion to allow the plaintiff to correct the error.
