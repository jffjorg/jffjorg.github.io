I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Yedam, Inc. (“Yedam") and Eun
Kyung Choi (“Choi") brought this breach of loyalty and unfair business
practices action against Daniel N. Lee (“Lee") and Jin Sook Lee (together,
“the Lees"), and DM Cosmetics, Inc. (“DM Cosmetics"). 
 
On March 15, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) asserting 5 causes of action for: (1) Breach of Duty of Loyalty; (2) Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (3) Negligent Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage; (4) Unfair Business Practices; and (5) Declaratory
Relief.
 
The FAC alleges the following. Yedam imports and purchases
products including candles and scented oils that are sold at various retail
locations such as department stores in South Korea. (FAC, ¶ 9.) On or about February 2017 Defendant Daniel Lee
began working for Yedam in South Korea. (FAC, ¶
10.) In his capacity as an employee, Defendant Daniel Lee was significantly
involved in dealing with: a) manufacturers that produced candles, scented oils
or related products; b) the manufacturers’ decision makers and the purchase
terms such as price; c) the buyers at the department stores in Korea that
purchased such products from Yedam; d) the buyers’ decision makers and the
purchase terms such as price; and e) the retail locations in both the United
States of America and South Korea where such items were sold at. (FAC, ¶ 22.) Notwithstanding his duty of loyalty,
Defendant Daniel Lee, in conjunction with his wife Defendant Angela Lee, have
misused Yedam’s proprietary information in order to enrich themselves
financially. (FAC, ¶ 24). Defendants’ actions
have caused Buyers for Department Stores in South Korea to cease purchasing
products from Plaintiff Yedam and/or have caused the closure of retail
locations in South Korea. (FAC, ¶ 26).
 
The Lees and DM Cosmetics, Inc. (“Cross-Complainants" or
“Defendants”) cross-complained against Yedam, Choi, Olive House LLC, and Lamis
Tania, LLC (“Cross-Defendants"). On August 10, 2023, Cross-Complainants
filed their third amended cross-complaint (“TACC”) asserting 8 causes of action
against Cross-Defendants: (1) Breach of Oral Contract I; (2) Breach of Oral
Contract II; (3) Breach of Oral Contract III; (4) Breach of Oral Contract IV;
(5) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets; (6) Trademark Infringement; (7) Unfair
Competition in Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq. and
California Trademark Law; and (8) Declaratory Relief.
 
The TACC alleges the following. Prior to 2017,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Choi owned Yedam. (TACC, ¶
11.) Yedam was experiencing serious financial problems. (Ibid.) In
February of 2017, Choi approached Defendant/Cross-Complainant Lee asking for
help. (Id., ¶ 12.) Choi proposed Lee
serve as Yedam’s general manager, whereby Lee would oversee the Korean market
and Choi would oversee the Chinese market. (Ibid.) In exchange, Lee
would be paid a $10,000 per month salary. (Ibid.) In addition, Choi
would give Lee 49% ownership of Yedam if Lee could help Yedam “overcome [its]
financial hardship and become profitable." (Ibid.) Lee agreed and
moved from the US to Korea to serve as Yedam’s general manager. (Id., ¶ 13.) To help Yedam solve its financial issues, Lee
loaned Yedam $70,000.00 in operating capital. (Id., ¶ 14.) Choi promised that the $70,000.00 would be
paid back when Yedam become profitable, along with 7% interest per annum from
April 1, 2017. (Id., ¶ 12.) Lee
successfully managed Yedam thereafter, and Yedam went from net losses in 2016
and 2017 to net profits of over a million dollars per year by the end of 2019.
(Id., ¶ 15.) However, in July of 2019,
Yedam faced supply chain issues when the “Milk House Candle" company in
the United States refused to renew its exclusive distribution contract with
Yedam. (Id., ¶ 16.) In response, the
Lees created a new brand of merchandise named “Dani Mackenzie" under DM
Cosmetics, Inc. (Id., ¶ 17.) The Lees
trademarked Dani Mackenzie in the United States in May of 2020. (Id., ¶ 18.) Around that same time, Choi proposed that
Yedam purchase Dani Mackenzie merchandise from DM Cosmetics in exchange for
Yedam having the right to use the Dani Mackenzie name. (Id., ¶ 19.) Choi told the Lees that there was no need to
have a written licensing and distribution agreement because Choi would transfer
49% of Yedam’s ownership interest to Lee by the end of December 2020. (Id.,
¶ 20.)
 
Dani Mackenzie became highly popular in Korea, and Yedam’s sales
and profit soared to the point that Yedam was valued at over $50 million. (Id.,
¶ 22.) On December 20, 2020, Lee demanded that
Choi transfer 49% of Yedam to him. (Id., ¶
23.) Lee also demanded that Choi and Yedam repay the $70,000 operating capital
loan with 7% interest from April 1, 2017. (Ibid.) However, Choi
terminated Lee from Yedam shortly thereafter and refused to convey the 49%
ownership share. (Id., ¶ 25.) Further,
Choi and Yedam stopped purchasing Dani Mackenzie merchandise from DM Cosmetics
and started using other suppliers to manufacture products bearing the Dani
Mackenzie trade name. (Id., ¶ 28.) On
March 18, 2021 and April 14, 2021, Cross-Complainants demanded that
Cross-Defendants cease and desist manufacturing, supplying and/or selling
products under the Dani Mackenzie name. (Id., ¶
32.) 
 
On June 17, 2024, Cross-Complainants/Defendant DM Cosmetics filed the
instant Motion to Compel Further Answers to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
propounded on Cross-Defendant Eun Kyung Choi aka Grace Choi, arguing: 
·      
Defendants
move to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3,
50.4, 50.5, 50.6. 
·      
Plaintiff Choi provided inadequate, evasive and frivolous
responses and objections 
·      
Defendants requests
that the Court award monetary sanctions against Choi and her attorney of record
in the sum of $2,700.00.
Plaintiffs filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
In the Court’s ruling on 5/17/24, the
Court found that the term “incident” was unclear in the Form Interrogatories
that were propounded by Defendant Daniel Lee on Cross-Defendant Choi
o   Similarly here, further response is not warranted to Nos.
12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2 because the term
“incident” is unclear
·      
Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 concerns
denial of “material” allegations. it is unclear as to what are the “material” allegations. Defendants also
failed to provide a trade secret designation
·      
Plaintiffs have further supplemented
Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6
·      
Sanctions should be awarded to
Plaintiffs in the amount of $6,682.50
 
DM Cosmetics filed a reply
arguing:
·      
The term incident is not vague and ambiguous
·      
Plaintiffs fail to provide a basis for
failure to respond to Rog No. 15.1. Plaintiffs have identified a trade secret.
·      
Plaintiffs have not further supplemented
Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6. Plaintiff further supplemented
the Form Interrogatories that were propounded by Defendant Daniel Lee on
Cross-Defendant Choi, but did not supplement Form Interrogatories presently at
issue that were propounded by DM Cosmetics. 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
“Any party
may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action
written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”¿ CCP § 2030.010(a).¿
“Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response.”¿ CCP § 2030.260(a).¿ 
¿ 
“The party to
whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath
separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of the
party's option to produce writings. (3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.”¿ CCP § 2030.210(a).¿ “If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”¿ CCP §
2030.220(c).¿ 
¿ 
“On receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(a).¿ “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(b).¿ In addition, a separate statement is required.¿
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1345(a)(2).¿ 
¿ 
“Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(c).¿“[T]he time limitations set forth
in section 2030 and section 2034, subdivision (a) [are] mandatory and [when]
not met, the trial court's order is in excess of its jurisdiction.”¿(Vidal
Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)
 
a.       Interrogatory
Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5,
12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2
 
Form
Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5,
12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, and 14.2 seek information regarding the “Incident,” which is
defined as “The circumstances and events surrounding the alleged accident,
injury, or other occurrence or breach of contract giving rise to this action or
proceeding.” (Park Decl., Exh. 1, p. 1.) 
 
Choi objects
on the grounds that the interrogatories are vague and ambiguous as to the term
“Incident.” 
 
The Court
agrees that the interrogatories are vague and ambiguous, as it is unclear what
the “Incident” or occurrence
giving rise to this action refers to. The TACC references multiple oral
contracts and there appears to be multiple occurrences that gave rise to this
action. Without more context as to the information Plaintiff seeks, the Court
is unable to fashion a definition for “Incident.” 
 
Thus, DM Cosmetic’s motion to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5,
12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, and 14.2 is DENIED.
 
b.      Interrogatory
Nos. 15.1
 
DM Cosmetics argues
that further responses to Form Interrogatories No. 15.1, Set One, must be
compelled. Request No. 15.1 requests the following:  
 
“Identify
each denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in
your pleadings and for each: 
(a) state all
facts upon which you base the denial or special or affirmative defense; 
(b) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
those facts; and 
(c) identify
all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your denial or special or
affirmative defense, and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the
PERSON who has each DOCUMENT.”
 
Plaintiffs responded “Objection. Vague and ambiguous as to the
term INCIDENT. Overbroad, oppressive and unduly burdensome.”
 
Here, the Court finds further response is warranted. The term
incident is not included in this Interrogatory. Plaintiffs have not shown that
this interrogatory is overbroad, oppressive or unduly burdensome. “If an
interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent
possible.” CCP Section 2030.220(b).
 
Accordingly, DM Cosmetic’s motion to compel further response to Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1 is GRANTED.
 
c.       Interrogatory
Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6
 
Form Interrogatory
Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6 reference “agreements alleged in the
pleadings.” 
 
Choi
responded to these Form Interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, by stating “Objection.
Overbroad, oppressive and unduly burdensome. Duplicative. Asked and answered.”
 
The Court
finds further response is warranted. Choi asserts these interrogatories have
been asked and answered. However, DM Cosmetics asserts that even if this
interrogatory has been propounded by another Defendant, it has not been
previously asked by the propounding party DM Cosmetics. Therefore, Choi fails
to show that this interrogatory is duplicative. Choi also fails to show that
these interrogatories are overbroad, oppressive or unduly burdensome. The
information sought related to the alleged oral agreements is relevant to
Defendants’ claims. 
 
Based on the foregoing, DM Cosmetic’s motion to compel further
responses to form interrogatory nos. 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6 is GRANTED.
 
B.     
Sanctions
 
The court may impose sanctions against any party for engaging in conduct
constituting a “misuse of the discovery process.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030
(a).)¿Misuse of the discovery process includes “failing to respond or submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010 (d).) 
 
Defendants
request that the Court award monetary sanctions against Choi and her attorney
of record in the sum of $2,700.00. In
opposition, Choi requests sanctions of $6,682.50 on grounds that Defendants
brought this motion without substantial justification.¿ 
 
Here, Defendants’ motion is granted and denied in part. The
Court does not exercise its discretion to impose sanctions.
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Defendant DM Cosmetics, Inc.’s
request to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory, Set One, is granted
and denied in part. Further responses to Form
Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5,
12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, and 14.2 is DENIED. Further responses to Form
Interrogatory Nos. 15.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, and 50.6 is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff Choi shall serve supplemental responses within 30 days
of the Court’s order.
 
Sanctions are denied.
