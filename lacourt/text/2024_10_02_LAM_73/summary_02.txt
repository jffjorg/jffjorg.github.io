And here is the summary in English text:

The Honorable Judge Rolf Treu has issued a tentative ruling in the case COVARRUBIAS v. CHRISTINA PYO, M.D., et al. (23STCV01696). The case involves a negligence claim brought by Plaintiff Ayden Rafael Covarrubias, a minor, against several defendants, including a medical doctor and medical centers. The Plaintiff alleges that the defendants' negligence during his labor and delivery caused him to suffer permanent injuries, including brain damage and developmental delays.

The Plaintiff had previously filed an application for James L. Mitchell to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of the Plaintiff. However, the application was terminated due to non-payment of renewal fees. The Plaintiff has now filed a motion to reinstate James L. Mitchell's pro hac vice admission, which has been granted.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 9.40(d), which sets out the requirements for an application to be admitted pro hac vice. The Plaintiff's application has provided all of the required information, and no opposition was filed. Therefore, the motion to reinstate James L. Mitchell's pro hac vice admission is granted.
