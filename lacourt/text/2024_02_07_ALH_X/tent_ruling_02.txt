BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Gina
Lizano’s (“Plaintiff”) slip-and-fall claim. Plaintiff alleges that on March 21,
2021, she tripped and fell at a Starbucks located at 4000 Market Place Dr. 1A,
Monterey Park, California 91775. Plaintiff filed this complaint on March 21,
2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            
MPRP’s motions for an order compelling Plaintiff to
provide discovery responses are GRANTED.
 
            Starbucks’s
motions for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide discovery responses are
GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions totaling $630 to MPRP and $690 to
Starbucks. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            MPRP
and Starbucks separately move for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
responses to their requests for the production of documents, form
interrogatories, and special interrogatories. 
 
            MPRP
provides that it served its discovery requests on Plaintiff on August 29, 2023.
(D’Andrea Decl. ¶ 6.) MPRP provides that discovery
responses were due on October 2, 2023. (Id. ¶ 8.) MPRP provides that it
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel but received no response.
(Id. ¶¶ 9-10.) MPRP provides it has not received any discovery
responses. (Id. ¶ 15.)
 
            Starbucks provides it served its discovery requests on
September 25, 2023. (Baxter Decl. ¶ 4.) Starbucks provides that it attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel but never received any discovery
responses. (Id. ¶¶ 5-8.) 
 
            Both MPRP and Starbucks have demonstrated that they
served discovery requests on Plaintiff, but Plaintiff failed to provide any
responses. MPRP and Starbucks motions for an order compelling Plaintiff to
provide discovery responses are granted. 
 
            MPRP’s
motion for sanctions is granted for three hours – one hour for each motion – at
a rate of $190 (D’Andrea Decl. ¶ 16) plus a $60 filing fee for a total of $630. Starbucks motion
for sanctions is granted for three hours at a rate of $210 plus a $60 filing
fee for a total of $690. The sanctions are ordered against Plaintiff’s counsel.

 
CONCLUSION
 
MPRP’s motions for an order compelling Plaintiff to
provide discovery responses are GRANTED.
 
            Starbucks’s
motions for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide discovery responses are
GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions totaling $630 to MPRP and $690 to
Starbucks. 
 
            Plaintiffs
are ordered to produce code compliant verified responses without objections
within 20 days’ notice of this ruling.
