And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendants, US Longton, Inc. and Ji Li, were served with a summons by substituted service at 2799 S. Native Avenue, Rowland Heights, California, but they argue that the service was improper. The plaintiff, Zix, Inc., contends that the defendants were properly served, but the judge finds that the defendants have raised sufficient grounds to set aside the default and default judgment. The judge notes that the defendants have demonstrated that the service of summons did not result in actual notice and that this motion is made within the time set by statute.
