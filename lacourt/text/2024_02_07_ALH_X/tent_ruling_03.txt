BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises out of Plaintiff
Zix, Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) claim for quiet title for four
properties located at 314 E. Mission Road, #A-D, San Gabriel, CA 91776, APN:
5368-019-046, 5368-019-047, 5368-019-048 and 5368-019-049 (“Subject
Properties”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on April 13, 2023, alleging four
causes of action for (1) quiet title, (2) fraud, (3) partition, and (4)
declaratory relief.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendants’
motions to set aside default and default judgment are GRANTED.
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
move to set aside the entry of default and default judgment. On June 27, 2023,
default was entered against both Defendants. On November 15, 2023, a default
judgment prove-up hearing was held. On December 4, 2023, this court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff. Defendants filed their motions to set aside
default and judgment on January 3, 2024. Defendants’ motions were continued to
comply with the statutory requirements for the hearing date. 
 
            The
issue is whether Defendants have raised sufficient grounds to set aside the
default and default judgment.
 
            “A party may move
to set aside a void judgment under section 473, subdivision (d).
‘A default judgment is void if the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the
parties.’ [Citation.] A default judgment entered against a defendant who was not
served in the manner prescribed by statute is void. [Citation.] ‘Under section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a
default judgment which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due
to improper service.’ ” (First American Title Ins. Co. v. Banerjee (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 37, 42.) 
 
            “Section 415.20, subdivisions (a) and (b) authorize
substitute service in lieu of personal delivery. ‘If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, ... a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the
summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode,
usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States
Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of
the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service
post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the
contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the
complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at
the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. Service of a
summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.’ (§ 415.20, subd. (b).)” (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371-72.) 
 
            Plaintiff
filed two proofs of service that stated that Defendants were served by
substituted service at 2799 S. Native Avenue, Rowland Heights, California 91748
on May 5, 2023. The proofs of service state that the documents were left with a
John Doe occupant in his 60s who refused to provide his name. The process
server provides he previously attempted to serve Defendants at the location on
May 2 and 3 of 2023. Initially, in support of his argument that service was
improper, Plaintiff merely contended that he did not live at the Rowland
Heights address because his ex-girlfriend’s mom lived there so he stayed at an
alternative residence. (Ji Decl. ¶ 2.) In opposition, Plaintiff contends that Li did in fact reside
at 2799 S. Native Avenue, evinced by the fact that Li owned the property
located at 2799 S. Native Avenue and listed that address when attempting to
refinance the loan for the Subject Properties. (Yang Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
            In his supplemental brief, Defendants provides two
declarations. The first is from Changcai Liu, a caretaker who resides at the Native
Avenue address. Liu provides that he does not recall speaking with anyone who
appeared at the residence on May 5, 2023, the date when substituted service was
ostensibly effectuated. (Liu Decl. ¶ 4.) He also says he never received any
legal documents on May 5, 2023, nor did he receive any legal documents during
2023. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) Defendants also submit the declaration of Agustin
Flores, gardener for the property, who provides that he was working at the
residence at the time of purported service and did not receive any legal
documents. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.)
 
            Even with the supplemental declarations, Defendants have
not established that service was defective so as to render the default and
default judgment void.
 
            However, Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 provides:
“When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party
in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered
against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of
motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the
action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable
time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry
of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service
on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been
entered.”
 
            Defendants
have demonstrated that the service of summons did not result in actual notice
and this motion is made within the time set by statute. Defendants’ motions to
aside default and default judgment are granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendants’
motions to set aside default and default judgment are GRANTED.
