RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to his request for the production of documents. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Dave Barela
(“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Kiko Jia Liu (“Defendant”) engaged in
fraudulent conduct regarding a stock transfer agreement entered into by
Plaintiff’s assignor. Plaintiff filed this complaint on October 28, 2022. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
             Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to his
requests for the production of documents is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling further responses to his requests for the
production of documents. Plaintiff provides he served his requests for the
production of documents on “April 4, 2008”. (Barela Decl. ¶ 2.) However, it appears that requests for production of
documents were served on August 7, 2023. (Id. ¶ 2, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff
provides that Defendant served deficient responses on October 6, 2023. (Id. ¶
3, Exhibit B.) Plaintiff filed this motion on November 27, 2023, and served the
motion and notice of motion on November 22, 2023. 
 
            Plaintiff
contends that the motion was timely. However, that is not the case. Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c), “[u]nless notice of this
motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.” 
 
Because the responses were served October
6, 2023, the deadline to file the instant motion was November 20, 2023.
Plaintiff did not serve the notice of motion until 2 days after the 45-day
window. Plaintiff also does not provide that the parties agreed in writing to
extend the deadline. Thus, under the statute, Plaintiff has waived his right to
compel further responses.
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his requests for the production of
documents is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his requests for the production of
documents is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to provide notice.
