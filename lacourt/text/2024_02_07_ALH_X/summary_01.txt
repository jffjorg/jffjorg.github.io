And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his requests for production of documents. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant provided deficient responses to his requests, but the judge found that the plaintiff waived his right to compel further responses due to the untimely filing of the motion. The plaintiff's motion was filed two days after the 45-day deadline specified in the Code of Civil Procedure, and the parties did not agree in writing to extend the deadline. Therefore, the judge ruled that the plaintiff's motion is denied.
