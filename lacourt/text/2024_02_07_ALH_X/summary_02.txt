And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton in the case of Gina Lizano v. Starbucks Corporation, et al. The case involves a slip-and-fall claim by Plaintiff Gina Lizano, who alleges that she tripped and fell at a Starbucks location in Monterey Park, California on March 21, 2021. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on March 21, 2023. MPRP, TRACT 3, LLC and Starbucks Corporation separately moved for an order compelling the Plaintiff to provide discovery responses, including responses to requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The Plaintiff failed to respond to these requests, and both MPRP and Starbucks demonstrated that they attempted to meet and confer with the Plaintiff's counsel but received no response. The Court granted both motions, ordering the Plaintiff to provide discovery responses within 20 days. Additionally, the Court imposed sanctions on the Plaintiff's counsel totaling $630 for MPRP and $690 for Starbucks.
