The Court
considered the moving papers filed.  The

BACKGROUND
            This case arises from a complaint filed by Plaintiff against Defendant
Eve M. Aron (“Defendant”) on December 9, 2022, alleging claims for breach of
contract, common counts, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, accounting and
recovery of dishonored checks arising from an agreement in which Plaintiff
purportedly agreed to lend money to Defendant, who in turn, allegedly agreed to
use the funds to buy and resell horses for profit.
 
On June 24, 2024 and June 28, 2024, the Court
granted all five (5) of Plaintiff’s discovery motions due to Defendant’s
failure to serve any responses or oppose the motions.  Pursuant to the Minute Orders, Defendant had
twenty (20) days from the date of the Order to provide responses, without
objection, to Plaintiffs Request for Production of Documents (Set One), and
Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One).  Concerning the Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and the Motion to Deem Genuineness of Documents Admitted,
the Court further granted both motions. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel caused Notices of Ruling for each
of the five (5) discovery motion Orders to be served on June 28, 2024.  (Declaration of Richard B. Rudolph, ¶ 8.)  The Notices of Ruling were likewise filed
with the Court.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that he has not received
any communication from the Defendant, including discovery responses as required
by the Court’s June 24, 2024 and June 28, 2024 orders. (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
On July 31,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions
(or in the Alternative for Issue and Evidentiary Sanctions) and Monetary Sanctions
in the Amount of $2,560.00 (the “Motion”). 
The Motion is unopposed.
 


 
DISCUSSION
 
Code
of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(d) authorizes the Court to impose terminating
sanctions due to a party’s misuse of the discovery process.  “A trial court must be cautious when imposing
a terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party’s fundamental
right to trial, thus implicating due process rights.”  (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal. App. 4th 566, 604, review denied
(July 27, 2016).)  “A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.”  (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 262, 279–80, as modified on
denial of reh’g (May 4, 2005).) “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
 
It
is well established that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is
curative, not punitive.  (Welgoss v.
End (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 982, 992; Caryl Richards, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 300, 303-304.) 
Generally, the discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of dismissal.  (Doppe, supra.)  “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.”  (Lopez, supra.)  A terminating sanction is a draconian remedy,
and it is appropriate only when less severe alternatives will not vindicate the
court’s authority and the purpose of the subject discovery.  (Rail Services of America v. State Com.
Ins. Fund (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 323, 332; New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1423.)
 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s Motion is based on five (5) separate discovery
motions.  Moreover, trial is less than
three weeks from the hearing date on the motion and is unopposed.  At this point, the Court exercises its
discretion to impose the more severe sanction, as to do otherwise would prevent
Plaintiff from being able to prove the allegations in the case. A review of the
case file also indicates that Defendant has not responded in any capacity in
court proceedings since the filed Answer. 
Considering that no attempt at further responding to the case has been
made, the Court finds that the standard has been met for ultimate terminating
sanctions.  
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED and the matter terminated.  Plaintiff is to prepare a form of Proposed Judgment
and lodge and serve the same within twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
