  CASE NO.:  22STCV18851
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: November 5, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
On October 7, 2024, David H. Pierce & Associates
PC, counsel of record for Plaintiff Dana Urick (“Plaintiff”), filed the instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”), seeking to withdraw as counsel
for Plaintiff.  The Motion is unopposed.
 
The case has not been set for trial, as the matter
has been referred to judicial reference pursuant to the parties’ agreement. 
 
In connection with the Motion, David Pierce declares
that there is “an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship.”  (Declaration in Support
of Motion.)
 
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)
 
The Court finds that the Motion sets forth an adequate
basis for withdrawal, and the procedural requirements under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362 has been satisfied.  
 
The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the
motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 5th day of November 2024
