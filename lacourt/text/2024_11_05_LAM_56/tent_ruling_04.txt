RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving

BACKGROUND
             On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff brought this
action against Defendants CALIBER AEROSPACE, LLC and EMPLOYER SOLUTIONS
STAFFING GROUP II, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”) for civil penalties under
the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code §§ 2698 et
seq. (“PAGA”) stemming from Defendants’ alleged violations of the Labor
Code.  Upon joint stipulation seeking
leave of court to file Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which was
granted, Plaintiff filed the operative FAC asserting the following causes of
action: 1) Violation of Labor Code §§ 204, 246, 510, 1194, 1198 (Failure to Pay
All Wages); 2) Violation of Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512 (Failure to Provide Meal
Periods); 3) Violation of Labor Code § 226.7 (Failure to Provide Rest Periods);
4) Violation of Labor Code § 226, (Failure to Keep Accurate Itemized Wage
Statements); 5) Violation of Labor Code §§ 201-203 (Failure to Pay Wages Upon
Termination of Employment); 6) Violation of Labor Code § 2802 (Failure to
Reimburse for Necessary Expenditures); 7) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code §
17200, et seq. (Unfair Business Practices); and 8) Violation of the
Private Attorneys General Act, Labor Code sections 2698, et seq.
 
On
July 26, 2024, the Court certified the subject class for purposes of settlement
and granted Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of class and PAGA
settlement.
 
Plaintiff
now moves for final approval of the class action settlement.
 

Class Action Certification

Plaintiff
seeks certification of the class for settlement purposes.
 
The Court previously certified the proposed
class for the purposes of settlement consisting of “current and former
non-exempt employees of Defendant Caliber Aerospace, LLC and all current and
former non-exempt employees of Defendant Employer Solutions Staffing Group II,
LLC placed at Caliber Aerospace, LLC within the State of California during the
Class Period.”  The Court finds the
certified class continues to meet all requirements under CCP section 382, as
previously found in the July 26, 2024 Minute Order.
 

Approval of Settlement

California
Rules of Court, rule 3.769(g) provides that the court must conduct an inquiry
into the fairness of a proposed class action settlement prior to final
approval.  The trial court has broad powers
to determine whether a proposed settlement is fair.  (Mallick
v. Superior Court (1979) 89 Cal. App. 3d 434, 438.)  The standard for approval of class
settlements in California is that the settlement be fair, reasonable, and
adequate for class members overall.  (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.
App. 4th 1794, 1801.)
 
To
determine the fairness of a settlement, the court must consider certain
factors, as set forth in Wershba v. Apple
Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 244-45 (Wershba), disapproved on other grounds as stated in Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware, Inc. (2018)
4 Cal.5th 260, 270).  “[A] presumption of
fairness exists where:  (1) the
settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and
discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently;
(3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small.”  (Id. at p. 245.)  “[T]he test is not the maximum amount
plaintiffs might have obtained at trial on the complaint but, rather, whether
the settlement is reasonable under all of the circumstances.”  (Id.
at p. 250; see also City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp. (2d
Cir. 1974) 495 F.2d 448, 455 (City of
Detroit) [stating that a proposed settlement that amounts to a fraction of
the potential recovery does not in itself render the proposed settlement
grossly inadequate].)  
 
In
making this determination, the court considers all relevant factors, including
“the strength of [the] plaintiffs’ case, the risk, expense, complexity and
likely duration of further litigation, the risk of maintaining class action
status through trial, the amount offered in settlement, the extent of discovery
completed and the stage of the proceedings, the experience and views of
counsel, the presence of a governmental participant, and the reaction of the
class members to the proposed settlement.’” 
(Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail,
Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128 (Kullar).)  The recovery should represent a “reasonable
compromise, given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being
released, discounted by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and
collect on those claims by pursuing the litigation.”  (Id. at
p. 129.)  Nevertheless, the strength of
the case on the merits for the plaintiff is the most important factor, balanced
against the amount offered in settlement. 
(Id. at p. 130.)
 
In
granting the preliminary approval of the class settlement, the Court has
already considered and determined that many of the factors establish that the
settlement is fair.  With respect to
factors that the Court could not determine at the time of the preliminary
approval, Plaintiff indicates that Settlement Administrator, Phoenix Class
Action Administration Solutions (“Phoenix”), sent individual Notices to 78
Class Members on August 23, 2024.  (Declaration
of Mayra Gonzalez [“Gonzalez Decl.”], ¶¶ 3-5.) Of the Notices that were mailed,
0 were returned after mailing. (Gonzalez Decl., ¶ 6.)  No Class Members requested to be excluded from
the Settlement, and no Class Members objected or disputed Workweeks in writing.
 (Gonzalez Decl., ¶¶ 8-10.)  The Court previously approved contents of the
settlement notice packet and method of notice. 
 
Considering
all the factors discussed above, the Court finds Plaintiff has established that
the settlement is fair, adequate, and reached in arms-length bargaining.  The
proposed settlement was reached through a mediation session with Michael Young,
Esq., “a highly experienced and well-regarded mediator for wage and hour class
action litigation”, during which “the Parties discussed at length the burdens
and risks of continuing with the litigation as well as the merits of the claims
and defenses.” (Declaration of Lilit Tunyan Decl., ¶ 7.)  In connection with the mediation, the parties
engaged in substantial discovery and investigation, including, inter alia, “the
exchange of informal data and discoverable information in preparation for the
settlement negotiations.  The Parties
have analyzed payroll and other data pertaining to Plaintiff and the Class
during the relevant Settlement Period, including but not limited to the numbers
of former and current members of the Class, average workweeks, sample size time
and pay records and average rate of hourly pay, wage and hour policies.” (Id.
¶ 5.)  The settlement was therefore
reached through arm’s-length bargaining with sufficient investigation to allow
counsel and the Court to act intelligently.
 
With
respect to the PAGA allocation, the Court finds the allocation complies with
Labor Code section 2699(i), which requires 75 percent of the amount to be paid
to the LWDA and 25 percent of the amount to be paid to the aggrieved employees.

 
Given
the lack of objections, the Court finds that it is appropriate to approve the
settlement.
 

Enhancement Award

Plaintiff
seeks an enhancement award in the amount of $10,000.00 for serving as the class
representative.  Plaintiff has submitted
a declaration attesting to why he should be entitled to this enhancement
award.  (Clark v. American Residential Services LLC (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
785, 806.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s
declaration is sufficient to justify the reasonableness of such an award and
thus approves the award.
 

Attorney’s Fees

The
award of attorney’s fees is made by the court at the fairness hearing using the
lodestar method with a multiplier, if appropriate.  (Ketchum
III v. Moses (2000) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132-36.)  Despite any agreement by the parties to the
contrary, the court has an independent responsibility to review the attorney’s
fee provision of the settlement agreement and award an amount that it
determines to be reasonable.  (Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone
Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. … The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration
of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market
value for the legal services provided.” 
(PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal citations omitted].)  The primary factor for determining the
fairness of fees is “whether the fees bear a reasonable relationship to the
value of the attorneys’ work.”  (Robbins v.
Alibrandi (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 438, 451.)  Courts have adopted a practice of
cross-checking the lodestar against the value of the class recovery because the
award is then “anchored” in the time spent by counsel.  (Lealao v. Beneficial California, Inc. (2000)
82 Cal.App.4th 19, 45.)  
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $36,666.67, representing one-third
of the gross settlement amount of $110,000. 
Counsel has set forth her experience in labor and employment law, including class and representative actions.  (Tunyan Decl. ISO Prelim. Approval, ¶¶ 20-26.)  Counsel has indicated that actual lodestar
incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel is approximately $79,095.00 to date (and
estimated to be $81,845.00 when all is done), and that her office spent
approximately 144.7 hours litigating this case and expects to spend
approximately 5 more hours appearing at the hearing of this Motion, working
with the administrator to process the Settlement, and preparing final accounting
filings after distribution of the Settlement. 
(Tunyan Decl. ISO Final Approval, ¶¶ 31-32.)  Counsel who worked on this case charged
hourly rates of $550 (Lilit Tunyan) and $450 (Artur Tunyan).  (Id.,
¶ 31.)  Based on this, the Court finds
the requested $36,666.67 in attorney’s fees is reasonable and proper in this
case after accounting for the time spent, counsel’s experience, and the results
achieved by this litigation.
 

Litigation Costs

 
Plaintiff
requests litigation costs in the amount of $13,064.24.  Plaintiff’s counsel has sufficiently
justified these costs.  (Tunyan Decl. ISO
Final Approval, ¶ 34, Exh. 2.)  The Court
thus finds the requested costs are reasonable.
 

Settlement Administration Costs

Plaintiff
requests settlement administration costs in the amount of $6,500.  Plaintiff has provided a declaration from the
Case Manager at Phoenix, Mayra Gonzalez, justifying these costs.  (Gonzalez Decl., ¶ 18, Ehx. B.)  The Court thus finds the requested amount for
settlement administration costs is reasonable.
 
Based
on the foregoing, the motion for final approval of class action settlement is GRANTED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
