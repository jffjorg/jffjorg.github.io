And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Plaintiff Roie Maor against Defendant Eve M. Aron. The motion is unopposed. The Judge has considered the moving papers and finds that the Defendant has failed to serve any responses or oppose Plaintiff's discovery motions, despite being granted multiple extensions by the Court. The Judge notes that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is curative, not punitive, and that the Court must be cautious when imposing terminating sanctions. The Judge finds that the Defendant's conduct is willful and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. Therefore, the Judge grants the Motion for Terminating Sanctions and terminates the case.
