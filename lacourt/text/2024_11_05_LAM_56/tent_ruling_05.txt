PETITION TO CONFIRM CONTRACTUAL
  ARBITRATION AWARD AS JUDGMENT

Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Petitioner
MARIO CASTANEDA (“Petitioner”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Respondent
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES (“Respondent”)
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises from Petitioner’s claim for
entitlement to explosive detail bonus pay that was withheld from him by
Respondent.  The matter was submitted to
arbitration pursuant to the arbitration process provided in the effective
Memorandum of Understanding between Respondent and the Professional Peace
Officers Association (“PPOA”), Petitioner’s designated bargaining unit labor
representative.  
 
            The underlying arbitration was
conducted on September 15, 2022 and on December 8, 2022.  The arbitration concluded with a final award
(the “Award”) issued on May 15, 2023, which stated the following:
 
1.   The
PPOA proved by a preponderance of evidence that Sgt. Mario Castaneda is entitled
to Explosive Detail Bonus Pay under Article 7, Section 3 of the MOU.
2.   Sgt.
Mario Castaneda is awarded Explosive Detail Bonus Pay from May 11, 2018 to
January 1, 2022, less the one (1) year of authorized injury leave from official
duty: May 4, 2020 to May 16, 2021. 
3.   
The PPOA’s formal grievance on behalf of Sgt. Mario Castaneda is hereby
sustained.
 
(Attachment 8(c)
to the Petition, p. 20.)
 
Petitioner
now comes before the Court seeking to confirm the Award by filing the instant
Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award (the “Petition”).  
 
DISCUSSION
Service of the Petition and
Notice of Hearing
“A petition under this title shall be heard in a
summary way in the manner and upon the notice provided by law for the making
and hearing of motions, except that not less than 10 days’ notice of the date
set for the hearing on the petition shall be given.”  (CCP, § 1290.2.)  “A petition to confirm an award shall be
served and filed not later than four years after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date
of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”  (CCP, § 1288.)
 
CCP section 1290.4(a) requires the Petition and
Notice of Hearing to be served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the
arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall
be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be made in the manner provided
by law for the service of summons in an action.”  (CCP § 1290.4(a), (b).) 
 
Here, the Petition was filed on April 12, 2024, was
served on Respondent on April 15, 2024, and Respondent returned an
acknowledgment of receipt on April 17, 2024.  (Exhibit E to Notice of Hearing: Proof of
Service of Summons; Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt).  A Notice of Hearing was filed on October 18, 2024
along with a proof of service indicating that service of the notice of hearing
was made upon Respondent by electronic service on the same day, which is more
than the required 10 days’ notice prior to the hearing.  (CCP, § 1290.2.)  
 
Thus, Respondent’s objection to the timeliness of
the notice of hearing is unfounded.  The
Court finds that the filing and service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
was timely.  
 
Confirmation of Arbitration Award
An
arbitration award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court
and judgment is entered.  (CCP § 1287.6; Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d
836, 840.)  A party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition at
least 10 days, but no more than four years after the award is served.  (CCP, §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
 
On
the merits, the court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or
vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding. 
(CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners
Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
809, 818.)  CCP section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
a)    
Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.
b)   
Set
forth the names of the arbitrators.
c)    
Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.
(CCP, § 1285.4.) 
 
Here,
first, the Petition does attach as Attachment 4(c) the contract between the
parties which includes an arbitration provision.  The agreement is signed by the PPOA, Petitioner’s
designated bargaining agent, and Respondent. 
Second, the Petition states that Claude D. Ames was the arbitrator for
this matter.  Third, the Petition
attaches as Exhibit 8(c) the written award and opinion of the arbitrator. 
 
Where, as here,
the petition to confirm an arbitration award is timely filed, complies with the
procedural requirements of CCP section 1285.4, and more than 100 days have
passed since service of the award without the filing of a response or petition
to vacate or correct the award, the Court shall confirm the award.  (CCP, § 1286 (“If a petition or response under
this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as
made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance
with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates
the award or dismisses the proceeding.”); Eternity Investments, Inc. v.
Brown (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 (“Under the plain language of the
CAA, the trial court had no alternative but to confirm the award as made.”).) 
                                         
Respondent
contends, however, that the Award issued on May 15, 2023 should not be
confirmed since, as worded, the Award does not expressly provide for any
interest payment.  
 
Petitioner
contends, that on September 29, 2023, Respondent provided Petitioner with the bonus
backpay in the amount of $66,841.04.  Respondent,
however, failed to provide interest on this bonus backpay payment despite Petitioner’s
formal grievance requesting back payment with interest” and the Award’s explicit
language indicating that the “…formal grievance on behalf of Sgt. Mario
Castaneda is hereby sustained.”  Upon Respondent’s
assertion that the Award did not provide interest payment, counsel for Petitioner
reached out to the arbitrator to seek clarification on whether he intended to
include interest payments in the Award.  (Exh.
A to Notice of Hearing.)  Subsequently,
on October 23, 2023, the Arbitrator communicated to all parties that Petitioner’s
“…request seeking clarification of Sgt. Castaneda’s entitlement to interest on
his Explosive Detail Bonus back pay is not a correction of the Arbitrator’s
award,” and that, “The Arbitrator’s intent remains to include interest in Sgt.
Castaneda’s Explosive Detail Bonus payment for his unjust denial.”  (Id.)     
 
            Accordingly, in light of the clarification
provided by the arbitrator, the Award is confirmed, including interest, as stated
by the Arbitrator.  The fact that
Respondent has already paid the bonus backpay does not bar confirmation of the
Award.  The losing party cannot
prevent entry of judgment by paying whatever amount has been awarded.  (Pacific Law Group: USA v. Gibson
(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580 [“all arbitration awards, including defense
awards which have been satisfied, are subject to confirmation”].)
 
Prejudgment Interest
Additionally,
Petitioner requests prejudgment interest, at the rate of 7% per year.  The applicable statutory rate for prejudgment
interest against a state or local government entity is 7% as a matter of law.  (Cal. Const. art. XV, § 1; Gov. Code § 970.1.)
 
As
noted by the Court in Pierotti v. Torian (2000)
81 Cal.App.4th 17:
 
In
Britz, Inc. v. Alfa–Laval Food &
Dairy Co. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1085 (Britz),
the court held that a successful party to arbitration is entitled to
post-award, pre-judgment interest under Civil Code section 3287, subdivision
(a). The Britz court held that a
successful party to an arbitration is entitled to “recover damages certain”
within the meaning of section 3287, subdivision (a) on the date the arbitrator
renders his award. (Id. at p. 1106.)
The court noted that “[t]he arbitration award itself result[s] in a new and
fixed liability [citation]. Regardless of the individual elements that
comprised that liability, respondents were entitled to payment of the fixed sum
upon issuance of the award. [¶].... Although the interest was pre-‘judicial
judgment,’ it was post-‘contractual judgment.’ Any result that denied
respondents this post-award interest would punish them for using arbitration
instead of the court system to resolve their dispute with appellants.” (Id. at p. 1107.)
 
Britz controls this
case. The court erred when it failed to award post-award, pre-judgment interest
under Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a). (Pierotti v. Torian (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 27.) 
 
Petitioner
has calculated the interest owed as accruing at the approximate rates of
$4,678.87 per year; $389.91 per month; and $12.82 per day.  Petitioner has calculated the relevant
prejudgment interest to be $6,938.19 based on the daily rate of approximately
$12.82 per day from May 15, 2023 (date of Award) through November 5, 2024 (date
of hearing on Petition).  (Declaration of
Christopher Morse.)  Petitioner is
entitled to prejudgment interest as calculated.
 


 
Costs
CCP
Section 1293.2 provides that: “The court shall award costs upon any judicial
proceeding under this title…”  “Unless
the arbitrator’s award or the parties’ arbitration agreement negates the enforceability
of section 1293.2, a court must award costs incurred in postarbitration
judicial proceedings to confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitration award.”  (Storm v. Standard Fire Ins. Co. (2020)
52 Cal. App. 5th 636, 648, citing Carole Ring & Associates v. Nicastro
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260–261; Marcus & Millichap Real Estate
Investment Brokerage Co. v. Woodman Investment Group (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
508, 513 [award of costs pursuant to § 1293.2 is “mandatory”].)
 
            Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled
to post-arbitration costs.  Counsel for
petitioner declares that in this case, costs of suit are approximately $576.54.  (Declaration of Christopher Morse.)
 
Attorneys’ Fees
“Except
as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and
mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the
agreement, express or implied, of the parties.” 
 (CCP, § 1021.)
 
Here,
Petitioner has not stated sufficient basis for entitlement to attorneys’ fees.  The Court declines to award attorneys’ fees
as a sanction because Petitioner has not met the statutory requirements to receive
attorneys’ fees as a sanction.  (CCP, §
128.5(f)(1)(A).)  The request is also
improper under CCP section 1021.5 as this action does not enforce an important
right affecting the public interest.  
 
RULING
Based
on all the foregoing, the Petition is GRANTED in part.  Judgment shall be entered in the principal
sum of $14,366.05, together with prejudgment interest of $6,938.19, plus costs
of suit of $576.54, for a total judgment of $21,880.78.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
