And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of non-party Capstone Partners Group, Inc. to quash the deposition subpoena served by Plaintiff Leticia Vasquez. The subpoena seeks Capstone's bank records from Wells Fargo Bank, which Capstone argues are confidential and protected by privacy rights. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not established a compelling need for the records, and that they are not relevant to the present action alleging violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act. The judge notes that the essential elements for a Bane Act violation revolve around interference with the exercise of a plaintiff's constitutional right through threats or intimidation, and that Capstone's bank records have no connection to the present action.
