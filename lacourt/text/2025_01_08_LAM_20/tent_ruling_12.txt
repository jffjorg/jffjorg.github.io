 On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff Corinne Cascante filed the operative Complaint against Defendant DY JON, LLC for (1) violation of LAMC § 151.04/151.10, (2) declaratory relief, (3) breach of implied warranty of habitability, and (4) negligence. Defendant DY JON, LLC now seeks to strike the Complaint’s references to punitive damages and “personal attacks”.  Motions to strike are used to challenge defects in the pleadings not subject to demurrer.  Any party may move to strike the whole or any part of a pleading within the time allotted to respond to the pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435(b)(1).)  The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the Court is required to take judicial notice.  (Id. § 437(a).)  The Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading, and strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id. § 436.)  An “irrelevant” matter includes any “demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.”  (Id. § 431.10(b)(3), (c); see also Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1036-1042.)Punitive damages are available when the plaintiff establishes oppression, fraud, or malice by clear and convincing evidence.  (Civ. Code § 3294(a).)  Malice means “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1).)  In this context, despicable conduct is conduct considered “so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.”  (Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715, internal quotation marks omitted.)  Oppression means “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”  (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).)  Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”  (Id. § 3294(c)(3).)“[M]alice does not require actual intent to harm. (Id. at p. 895, 157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854.) Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences. (Id. at pp. 895–896, 157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854.) Malice may be proved either expressly through direct evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws inferences.”  (Angie M. v. Superior Ct. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228.)The Motion is denied as to punitive damages because Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to indicate malice with regard to Defendant’s intentional failure to do repairs at the subject premises.  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 21-23, 45; Smith v. David (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 101, 112.)  On the other hand, the Motion is granted as tothe following portions of paragraph 1: “has a fancy law office overlooking a golf course and” and “Dayan’s professional persona is very Hollywood – fake!”;the following portion of paragraph 8: “Based upon information and belief, Dayan actually resides at a new residence purchased earlier this year for around $4,400,000(!) described in part on the website Redfin as, ‘[a] Luxurious Contemporary Masterpiece built on one of the most sought-after streets in Beverly Grove! Situated behind privacy gates & immaculate landscaping, enter this home via an oversized oak door that swivels into the exceptionally open & bright grand open floor plan. This stunning & sophisticated home….’ Based on Dayan’s treatment of his tenant Ms. Cascante, apparently what is good for the goose is sadly not good enough for the gander”;the following portion of paragraph 9: “Apparently, Dayan is not really that busy in his legal practice because he supposedly has time to be the sole manager and supervisor (and everything else) related to the Wooster Property. Or, what seems more likely”;the following portion of paragraph 26: “lords of the slum”;the following portion of paragraph 46: “On the one hand, Dayan huddles in the warmth of his Westside multi-million dollar home and probably enjoys movies on Netflix. In the meantime, on the other hand”;the following portion of paragraph 48: “Dayan is not a first-time landlord and as an attorney, he knows better and should be held to a higher ethical and moral standard whether directly or through the defendant LLC.” The above references are stricken as irrelevant and improper.  The Motion is granted in part as set forth herein.  Leave to amend is denied.Moving party to give notice.
