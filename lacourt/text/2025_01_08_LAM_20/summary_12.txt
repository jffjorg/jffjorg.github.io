Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to strike references to punitive damages and "personal attacks" from the plaintiff's complaint. The motion is denied as to the claim for punitive damages, as the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to indicate malice with regard to the defendant's intentional failure to do repairs at the subject premises.

However, the judge grants the motion to strike certain portions of the complaint that are deemed irrelevant and improper. These include references to the defendant's luxurious lifestyle, his treatment of the plaintiff, and his alleged lack of busy-ness in his legal practice. The judge strikes these references as they are not relevant to the case and are intended to make personal attacks on the defendant rather than to advance the plaintiff's claims.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
