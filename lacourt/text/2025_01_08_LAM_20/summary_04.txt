And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, in which the plaintiffs (Ava Stone, Camile Cabale, David Benetiz, Rhonda St. John, and Steven Bicknel) are suing the defendants (Arlene Katzman, Rishelle Maman, Eric Maman, Linda Maman) for allegedly violating zoning laws and engaging in unfair business practices. The plaintiffs had filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC), but the defendants demurred, arguing that the SAC was uncertain and failed to state sufficient facts. The court has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the SAC is deemed abandoned and the defendants do not have to respond to it. The court has also denied the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. The case will move forward with the defendants' demurrer sustained.
