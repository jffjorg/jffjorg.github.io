And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the motion to set aside default and default judgment filed by defendant Karen Bagdoyan, et al. The defendant claims lack of notice and asserts that identity thieves used his name. However, the court has previously denied a similar motion due to the defendant's inability to reconcile a letter identifying the served address as his place of business with his claim of no affiliation with the address. The defendant has not provided reliable evidence to support his new claims and has failed to attach the proposed answer and supporting documents to his motion. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to set aside default and default judgment.
