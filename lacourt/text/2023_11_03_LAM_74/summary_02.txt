And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant and the motion to strike filed by the defendant. The plaintiff, Mary J. Pinnere, alleges that the defendant, Rio Hondo Healthcare, Inc., committed elder abuse, negligence, and wrongful death.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges elder abuse (neglect), because the complaint does not state facts sufficient to support a cause of action. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges elder abuse (financial), because the complaint does not specifically allege what the defendant did wrong.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike paragraphs 59-87 and 101-120 of the complaint, which allege elder abuse, because the demurrer was sustained and these allegations are no longer relevant.

The judge has given the defendant 20 days leave to amend the demurrer and has ordered the defendant to give notice.
