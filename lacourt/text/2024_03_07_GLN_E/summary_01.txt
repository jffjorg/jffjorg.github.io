And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will hear argument on the motion for attorney's fees and costs. The petitioners, Traci Ann Curtis-De Rago, Margarita Hirapetian, Roubina Malayan, Edgardo P. Rosales, and Nazly Bim, are seeking an award of $149,948.751 in attorneys' fees and $1,087.45 in costs. The motion is unopposed, and the Court is unclear if the parties intend for the motion to be taken off calendar as moot if the Court signs the proposed stipulation. The Court is inclined to grant the motion, but will hear from the parties at the hearing. The Court also wants the parties to address how the stipulation, if signed, affects the prior Notice of Judgment or Order.
