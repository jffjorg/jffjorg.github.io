Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to the Plaintiffs' Requests for Production and for monetary sanctions. The Plaintiffs, Danitza Maravilla Torres and Andres Morales Rios, move the Court for an order compelling further responses to their Requests for Production numbers 45-46 and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,610.00 against Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C.

The Court finds that the motion is timely and that Defendant provided supplemental responses to the instant RFPs on February 20, 2024, and verifications to its supplemental responses on February 23, 2024. Therefore, the motion to compel further responses is denied as moot as to compelling further responses. However, the motion is not denied as moot as to the issue of sanctions, as Defendant provided supplemental responses only after the Plaintiffs had filed the instant motion.

The Court will hear argument as to sanctions. The Plaintiffs request an award of monetary sanctions against FCA and its counsel of record, Ongaro P.C, in the amount of $2,610.00, which includes legal fees incurred in preparing for and attending the scheduled hearing on this matter.
