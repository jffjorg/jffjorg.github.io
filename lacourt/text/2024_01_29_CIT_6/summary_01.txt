And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' request for entry of default judgment against the defendants, Cardona Realty, Emporium Financial Group, and Tulio Cardona, without prejudice. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to submit a complete default judgment package, as required by the California Rules of Court, and did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. Specifically, the judge noted that the plaintiffs did not authenticate or lay the foundation for the contract evidencing the underlying $17,000.00 payment, and that the proposed judgment listed the total amount as $17,000.00, but included an open-ended request for general damages. The judge also commented that the plaintiffs did not serve the Statement of Damages on the defendants before entry of default, and that the statement was of no benefit in this case. The judge gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to resubmit their default judgment package prior to the hearing.
