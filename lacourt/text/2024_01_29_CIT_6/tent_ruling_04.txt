   [1] Defendant is  alleged to be two separate entities in the SAC, i.e., Sistine Manor, Inc. and Springville  Residential Care for the Elderly. (SAC, ¶¶ 3-4.) However, Defendant’s  prior filings and the instant demurrer and motion to strike show that it is  only one entity, as the name “Springville Residential Care for the Elderly” is  only a dba of Sistine Manor, Inc.   [2] Plaintiff  also attempted to file a Third Amended Complaint on January 16, 2024, but it  was rejected by the clerk’s office because Plaintiff did not have leave of the  Court to do so. (Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing (1/18/24).)
