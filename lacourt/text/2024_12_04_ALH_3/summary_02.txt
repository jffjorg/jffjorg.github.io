And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Henry Huang and Powastar, Inc. against Junyi Zhou, Xiaoyan Chen, and others. The defendants had served Form Interrogatories (Set One) on the plaintiffs, but no responses were received. The defendants then filed a motion to compel the plaintiffs' responses, which the plaintiffs opposed. However, the plaintiffs ultimately served their responses after the motion was filed, making the motion to compel moot. The judge has denied the motion to compel and granted the request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $461.65. The judge has ordered the sanctions to be paid within 20 days of the date of the order.
