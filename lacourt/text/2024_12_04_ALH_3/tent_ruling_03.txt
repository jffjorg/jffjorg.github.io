I.      INTRODUCTION
AND BACKGROUND
Petitioner Mic-Bry8, LLC (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval
of a proposed transfer of structured settlement payments. A direct or indirect
transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not effective unless the
transfer has been approved by a court order finding the following:¿
(1)   The transfer is in the best interest of the payee,
considering the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.
 
(2)   The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to
seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either
received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to
receive the advice.
 
(3)   The transferee has complied with the notification
requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has
provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and
the transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.
 
(4)   The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or
the order of any court or other government authority.
 
(5)   The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
10136.
 
(6)   The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the
payee’s right to cancel the transfer agreement.
 
 
(Ins. Code, §§ 10137, 10139.5.)¿ 
As a result of a personal injury
settlement, Payee Elizabeth Gomez  (“Payee”)
became entitled to certain structured settlement payments. Payee and Petitioner
have entered into a transfer agreement, under which Payee is to sell $42,500,
consisting of two lump sum payments of $5,000 and $37,500, due on November 24,
2025 and November 24, 2029, respectively, in exchange for a purchase price of $18,620.
(First Amended Petition, Ex. B ) The discounted present value of the amount being sold
is $34,021.43,
calculated by applying a 4.8 % discount rate used by the Internal
Revenue Service to value annuities in probate proceedings. (Ibid.) If
Payee did not sell the right to receive structured settlement payments but
instead borrowed the net amount of $18,620
and paid that loan back in installments with each of the payments they are now
selling, the equivalent interest rate would be 20.1%
per year. (Ibid.)
All of this information has been
disclosed to Payee by way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance
Code § 10136, as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Ibid.) In this disclosure
form, Payee was also advised in writing to seek independent professional
advice, both legal and financial. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2).) Payee
chose not to seek an independent professional’s advice and understands the
terms of the transfer agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2), (a)(5); First
Amended Petition, Ex. D; Gomez Decl., ¶ 11.)
Payee also understands and does not wish to exercise their right to cancel the
transfer agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Gomez Decl., ¶ 10(h).)
In addition, the transfer agreement does not contravene any applicable statute
or order of any court or other governmental authority. (Ins. Code §
10139.5(a)(4).) 
II.     REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS 
         Not less than 20 days prior to the
scheduled hearing on any petition for approval of a transfer of structured
settlement payment rights under this article, the transferee shall file with
the court and serve on all interested parties a notice of the proposed transfer
and the petition for its authorization, and shall include the following with
that notice: 
(A)
A copy of the transferee's current petition and any other prior petition,
whether approved or withdrawn, that was filed with the court in accordance with
paragraph (6) of subdivision (c).
 
(B)
A copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).
 
(C)
A listing of each of the payee's dependents, together with each dependent's
age.
 
(D)
A copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136.
 
(E)
A copy of the annuity contract, if available.
 
(F)
A copy of any qualified assignment agreement, if available.
 
(G)
A copy of the underlying structured settlement agreement, if available.
 
(Ins. Code, § 10139..5, subd. (f)(2).) 
Copies of the proposed transfer
agreement, disclosure form, and list of Payee’s dependents are attached to the First
Amended Petition. The Declaration of Lucia Sanchez, filed concurrently with the
First Amended Petition, includes a copy of the annuity contract and the
qualified assignment and release agreement. (Declaration of Lucia Sanchez, Exs.
A-B.) A copy of the underlying settlement agreement could not be obtained.
(Sanchez Decl., ¶ 1(b)(iv).) 
III.    INFORMATION
ABOUT PAYEE
Payee has provided all of the
information required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c). Payee is 24
years old. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(c)(1); Gomez Decl. ¶ 4).
Payee resides at 1216 W. 98th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90044. (Ibid.)
Payee is single and does not have minor children. (Ins. Code, §§ 10139.5(c)(2)-(c)(3);Gomez
 Decl., ¶ 4.)¿ Payee has no child support obligations. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(c)(5); Gomez Decl., ¶ 4.) Payee currently works part-time as a
tattoo artist earning approximately $2,083 per month. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(c)(4); Gomez Decl., ¶ 4.) She is actively looking for an additional
full-time job in retail and does not rely on the money from her structured
settlement payment rights for her day-to-day living expenses. (Gomez Decl., ¶
4.) Payee has previously assigned a portion of her structured settlement rights
in May 2024 and used the funds to purchase the home she lives in. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(c)(6); Gomez Decl., ¶ 8.) 
In addition, in compliance with
Insurance Code § 1039.5(b), Payee indicates the purpose of the transfer and
their financial and economic situation. (Gomez
Decl., ¶ 6.) Payee states that the funds will be pooled with
her partner’s funds to put a down payment on a rental property in Atlanta,
Georgia, which will be a secondary source of income. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 6.) The
expected income will be $2,500 to $3,000 per month. (Ibid.) 
III.    CONCLUSION
Given the foregoing, the Court finds
that the transfer is fair, reasonable and in the best interest of Payee. (Ins.
Code § 10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1)-(15).) Accordingly, the petition for approval
of structured settlement payments is GRANTED.
