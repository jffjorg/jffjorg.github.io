[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.

December
   4, 2024



 
Larry A.
 Rothstein seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 Vision Construction Group, Inc. on grounds that there has
 been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal
should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) The
Court notes that trial in this matter is scheduled for March 10, 2025, and finds
that no prejudice will result from granting this motion. 
As noted in the Court’s previous minute
order dated November 13, 2024, no proposed order on Judicial Council Form
MC-053 was included with the moving papers. Therefore, the hearing was
continued so that defense counsel could file a proposed order. On November 26,
2024, a proposed order was indeed filed, but it was not on Judicial Council
Form MC-053, which is adopted for mandatory use pursuant to CRC 3.1362(e).  
Accordingly, the hearing on this motion
to be relieved is CONTINUED once more to December 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. so
that defense counsel has an additional opportunity to submit a proposed order
on the correct mandatory form. The proposed order must be completed and filed
with the court no later than 5 court days before the date of the next hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 4th
day of December, 2024
