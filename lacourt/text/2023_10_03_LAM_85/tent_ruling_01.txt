  Case Number:  22STLC07372    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  85 
Thomas Tarbutton v. State
Bar of California, 22STLC07372

Tentative decision on motion
for reconsideration: denied after reconsideration



 
            Thomas
Tarbutton (“Tarbutton”) moves for reconsideration of the court’s order dated
August 1, 2023 sustaining without leave to amend Defendant State Bar of
California’s (“State Bar”) demurrer to the Complaint.  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition (no reply was
filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Complaint
            Plaintiff
Tarbutton filed the verified Complaint on October 26, 2022, alleging causes of
action for declaratory judgment under CCP section 1060 and negligence as a
basis for injunctive relief.  Compl., ¶1.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
The Complaint alleges that the acts of negligence at issue
violated Tarbutton’s rights, including but not limited to, those that accrue
under the California Public Records Act (“CPRA”).  Compl., ¶2. 

 
            a.
Document Request
            On
May 3, 2020, Tarbutton mailed a request to the State Bar for materials and information
on the actions of former attorney Patrick Lee Lund (“Lund”) from 2010 to his
disbarment in 2014.  Compl., ¶13, Ex. 1,
p. 15.  
            Lund
had paid $130,500 as restitution to a party from whom he had misappropriated
funds, which led to his disbarment.  Compl.,
¶¶ 24-25, Ex. 1, pp. 15, 18.  Tarbutton
had previously transferred assets to Lund for assignment to a limited liability
company managed by Lund.  Compl., ¶27, Ex.
1, p. 15.  The funds belonged to
Tarbutton’s former investors and now his alleged victims in his criminal
case.  Compl., ¶28, Ex. 1, p. 15.  
            Because
Tarbutton’s investors did not receive all their money, Tarbutton suspects that Lund
used the money to pay State Bar-ordered restitution to his client.  Compl., ¶¶ 29, 31, Ex. 1, p. 15.  If so, Tarbutton was held criminally
accountable and punished for the loss of the investors because of Lund’s
misappropriation of Tarbutton’s investor money. 
Compl., ¶33, Ex. 1, p. 18.  While
not exculpatory for Tarbutton, this fact could help his pending post-conviction
habeas petition and establish that he is a victim of Lund’s misconduct.  Compl., ¶¶ 14, 34, Ex. 1, pp. 15-16.  
            Tarbutton
therefore requested from the State Bar all information about the source of the
funds Lund used to pay State Bar-ordered restitution to his client and all attempts
by the State Bar to source such payments. 
Compl., ¶35, Ex. 1, pp. 15, 20. 
 
            b.
Response
            On
May 27, 2020, the State Bar responded to Tarbutton’s record request.  Compl., ¶36, Ex. 3, p. 24.  It categorized Tarbutton’s request as a CPRA request
and invoked the exemption under then-Government Code[1] section
6254(f) for investigatory files compiled by a state agency for licensing
purposes.  Compl., ¶37, Ex. 3, p.
24.  The State Bar also invoked Business
and Professions Code (“Bus. & Prof. Code”) section 6086.1(b), which exempts
disciplinary investigations from disclosure under the CPRA or any other state
law.  Compl., ¶37, Ex. 3, p. 24.  The State Bar did not deny it had such
documents in its possession or that they would be material to Tarbutton’s case.  Compl., ¶38.
             On June 8, 2020, Tarbutton replied that the State
Bar had misapplied the relevant statutes. 
Compl., ¶¶ 39-40, Ex. 4.  Its
response excluded a portion of section 6254(f) that mandates release of
otherwise exempt documents to a victim of the incident.  Compl., ¶41, Ex. 4.  Tarbutton was a collateral victim because
some of the funds Lund used to pay restitution were misappropriated from Tarbutton’s
transferred asset base.  Compl., ¶41, Ex.
4.  
            Tarbutton
also objected to the State Bar’s treatment of the request as a CPRA
request.  Compl., ¶41, Ex. 4.  While the CPRA was one method of discovery, Tarbutton’s
letter did not limit the authority under which he sought the documents.  Compl., Ex. 4.  The use of the Bus. & Prof. Code in this
context ignores his rights under the United States Constitution and federal law
to due process and equal protection.  Compl.,
Ex. 4.  Bus. & Prof. Code section
6001.1 states that when the protection of the public is inconsistent with other
interests sought to be promoted, the protection of the public shall be
paramount.  Compl., Ex. 4.  
            On
June 23, 2020, the State Bar responded, relying on the same CPRA and Bus. &
Prof. Code exemptions.  Compl., ¶¶ 47-48,
Ex. 5.  Even if the record request was
not made under the CPRA, Bus. & Prof. Code section 6086.1(b) applied.  Compl., ¶48, Ex. 5.  The State Bar added that under Bus. &
Prof. Code section 6086.5, the State Bar court is not subject to the CPRA, but rather
the court rules and laws applicable to records of the judiciary.  Compl., ¶48, Ex. 5.  
 
            c.
Theory of Negligence
            As
a public agency, the State Bar is subject to the CPRA.  Compl., ¶55. 
Tarbutton submitted written requests for documents that would be
probative of his assertion that he is a victim of the incidents in
question.  Compl., ¶57.  The State Bar does not deny that he is a
victim or that it has the subject documents. 
Compl., ¶58.  When read in their
entirety, the CPRA exemptions cited by the State Bar favor production of the documents.  Compl., ¶¶ 59, 62.  Because Tarbutton is a victim of the
incident, he has the right to obtain the requested records.  Compl., ¶61.
            The
State Bar has breached its obligations under the CPRA and State Bar Act, which
obligate it to protect Tarbutton from licensees’ misconduct and to disclose
information to him as a victim thereof. 
Compl., ¶60.  The State Bar willfully
inflicted injury by denying equal protection in the enjoyment of personal
rights under the California and United States Constitutions.  Compl., ¶63.
 
            d.
Prayer for Relief
            Tarbutton
seeks (1) declaratory judgment that he has a right to timely disclosure of all associated
documentation (Compl., ¶65); (2) judgment that declares and defines the State
Bar’s obligations under the State Bar Act and CPRA (Compl., ¶66); (3) judgment
that the State Bar’s actions have violated Tarbutton’s rights (Compl., ¶67);
(4) an injunction compelling the State Bar to arrange for the immediate release
of information to Tarbutton about the amount and sources of funds Lund used to
pay restitution and the dates of such payments (Compl., ¶68); (5) an injunction
compelling the State Bar to release information that details the dates,
amounts, and sources of any payments made by or on behalf of Lund after
September 2010 for fines, penalties, damages, errors, omissions and/or any
compensation relating to any misconduct Lund committed during his course of
practice (Compl., ¶69); (6) an injunction that requires the State Bar to
release all correspondence by and between the Orange County District Attorney’s
Office and the State Bar as to Lund, regardless of the date and time of such
writings (Compl., ¶70); (7) attorney’s fees and costs (Compl., ¶71); and (8) all
further relief and remedy that the court finds just and proper (Compl., ¶72).
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
December 29, 2022, Tarbutton served the State Bar with the Complaint and
Summons by mail.  On January 19, 2023,
the State Bar signed an Acknowledgement of Receipt.
            On
April 24, 2023, Department 26 (Hon. Mark Windham) vacated the State Bar’s
demurrer and the case was reassigned to this court.
            On
August 1, 2023, this court sustained the State Bar’s demurrer to the Complaint
without leave to amend.
 
            B. Applicable
Law 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) (“section 1008(a)”) provides for
reconsideration of court orders.  Section
1008(a)’s motion to reconsider is broad in scope and allows any party affected
by the order to seek reconsideration and modification, amendment or vacation of
prior orders.  Relief under section
1008(a) is strictly limited; motions to reconsider must be brought within 10
days of service of written notice of the original order.  
            A
motion for reconsideration constitutes the exclusive means for a party seeking
modification, amendment or revocation of an order.  Morite of Calif. v. Superior Court,
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485, 490.  To be
entitled to reconsideration, a party must show (1) new or different facts, and
(2) a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence earlier.  Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp., (“Kalivas”)
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1160-61.  The
requirement of satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence earlier can only be described as a strict requirement of
diligence.  Garcia v. Hejmadi (“Garcia”)
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.  A motion
for reconsideration cannot be granted on the ground that the court misapplied
the law in its initial ruling.  Gilberd
v. AC Transit (“Gilberd”) (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.  A mistake based on ignorance of law is not a
proper basis for reconsideration.  Pazderka
v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 670.  
            Relief
under CCP section 1008(a) is strictly limited. 
A motion to reconsider must be brought within ten days of service of
written notice of the original order.  Kalivas,
supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 1160.  
 
            C. Statement
of Facts
            After the State Bar
filed its demurrer, Tarbutton filed an opposition and also a response to the
State Bar’s reply.  Tarbutton Decl.,
¶1.  On Jule 17, 2023, this court issued
a tentative ruling, amended on July 26, 2023. 
Tarbutton Decl., ¶2.  On August 1,
2023, Tarbutton filed an opposition to the tentative ruling.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶3.  
            At the August 1,
2023 hearing, the court abandoned the factual and legal basis of its tentative
ruling.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶4.  It sustained the demurrer and dismissed the
action based on allegations and legal conclusions that were new to
Tarbutton.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶4.  He did not have an opportunity to prepare and
raise relevant arguments and authorities to refute these sudden
conclusions.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶5.  This motion for reconsideration reflects the arguments
Tarbutton would have made if he had an opportunity to prepare a response.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶6.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Tarbutton moves for
reconsideration of the court’s August 1, 2023 decision under section
1008(a).  Procedurally, he argues the
court did not give him a proper opportunity to respond to its tentative ruling
because it relied on a different argument at the hearing.  Mot. at 2, 5-6.  As to the merits, he argues that case law
establishes that the government as a whole shares in due process obligations
and a writ of mandate is the proper procedure to compel a constitutional obligation.  Mot. at 3-4. 

 
            1. Timeliness
            A motion to
reconsider must be filed within ten days of service of written notice of the
original order.  Kalivas, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at
1160.  The court sustained the demurrer on August 1, 2023.  Tarbutton filed this motion on August 11,
2023.  The motion is timely.
 
            2. Request to
Reconsider
            To be entitled to reconsideration, a
party must show (1) new or different facts, and (2) a satisfactory explanation
for failing to produce such evidence earlier. 
Kalivas, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 1160-61.  The requirement of satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be described as a
strict requirement of diligence.  Garcia,
supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at 690.  A
motion for reconsideration cannot be granted on the ground that the court
misapplied the law in its initial ruling. 
Gilberd, supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at 1500.  
            Tarbutton argued his
case more often than he was allowed by law. 
As the opposing party, he was entitled to file an opposition nine court
days before the hearing.  CCP §1005(b).  Tarbutton did so.  However, he also filed an unauthorized
sur-reply to the State Bar’s reply and an opposition to the court’s tentative
ruling without legal authority or leave of court.  See Tarbutton Decl., ¶3.  
Despite these facts, Tarbutton correctly
notes that the court’s tentative was based in part that Tarbutton is a
convicted inmate.  Tarbutton explained at
the August 1, 2023 hearing that he is a defendant with pending criminal cases.  Tarbutton Decl., ¶4.  This affected the court’s analysis because a
convicted felon’s remedy is through habeas procedure and a criminal defendant’s
remedies lie in discovery from the pending criminal case.  The court explained as much.
Tarbutton now argues that this change
in the court’s position at the hearing entitles him to reconsideration.  Although Tarbutton has not shown any new
facts or circumstances beyond those known at the hearing, the court will
reconsider so that Tarbutton has a full opportunity to address the court’s
points.
 
            3. Merits
            Tarbutton does
not present any new or different facts.  He
argues that the State Bar has a duty under Brady v Maryland (“Brady”)
(1963) 373 U.S. 83, 87, to disclose to him, as a criminal defendant, any material,
favorable evidence relevant to either his guilt or punishment.  Mot. at 3. 
As part of this Brady obligation, the government has an
affirmative duty to disclose documents even when possessed by other government
agencies not directly responsible for the prosecution.  Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, (“Penn”)
(1987) 480 U.S. 39, 57-58.  
            The court ruled at the August 1
hearing that this argument is untenable. 
Acknowledging that Tarbutton is a criminal defendant with Brady
rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, he must assert
those rights in his criminal case.  His
due process right under Brady does not impose an obligation on a California
agency to produce records in a separate CPRA case.  Tarbutton has provided no authority to show
that he can enforce his Brady rights through a records request to a
state agency.
            The only new
authority Tarbutton cites is In re Jenkins, (“Jenkins”) (2023) 14
Cal.5th 493, 507, which he contends holds that the government as a whole has
the duty to comply with Brady.  Mot.
at 3.  
Jenkins was an appeal from the denial of a
habeas petition by a defendant convicted of voluntary manslaughter based the
prosecution’s suppression of Brady information about the victim and
witness.  14 Cal.5th at 497.  The Attorney General argued that there can be
no ongoing Brady violation in a habeas petition once a petitioner files
a habeas petition claiming a Brady violation suppressing that
very evidence.  Id. at 511.  The California Supreme Court held
that the Attorney General has a Brady and ethical duty to disclose the evidence
supporting the Brady claim in circumstances where the petitioner claims
that the trial prosecutor suppressed Brady information but had insufficiently
shown the violation and the Attorney General has actual or constructive
possession of the evidence.  Id.
at 512.  
Jenkins does not aid
Tarbutton.  Aside from the fact that it is
a post-conviction habeas case, not a direct appeal from a criminal case, it does
not relate to a California agency’s disclosure obligations in a civil case.  The nature of the case in which Brady
duties are raised is important, and Tarbutton shows no Brady duty for
the State Bar to produce records in a CPRA case.  As the State Bar’s opposition argues, a
court’s reference to “the government” in discussing Brady obligations is
the special obligations of a prosecutor and its agents.  IAR Sys Software, Inc. v. Superior Court,
(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 503 517 (private party was not party of
prosecution team for purposes of Brady). 
Opp. at 3.  The State Bar is not
part of the prosecution team against Tarbutton. 
His remedy is to subpoena the State Bar records in his pending criminal
case.
            Tarbutton also fails
to present any new argument or evidence to suggest that a different ruling is
required under statutory law.  The CPRA
exempts records of investigation from disclosure, including those at issue.  Govt. Code §7923.600)(a).  For Tarbutton’s negligence claim, Bus.
& Prof. Code section 6086.1(b) expressly provides that all
State Bar disciplinary investigations are confidential until formal charges are
filed, and that all investigations are confidential until a formal proceeding
is instituted.  Lund proceeded by
stipulation and no formal charge was filed and no formal proceeding
occurred.  Therefore, as this court held
on August 1, 2023, the State Bar investigation of Lund remains
confidential.  Opp. at 5.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The motion for
reconsideration is granted, and after reconsideration the motion is denied.
