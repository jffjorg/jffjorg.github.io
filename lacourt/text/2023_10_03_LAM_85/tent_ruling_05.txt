 Case Number:  23STLC03941    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  85 
Sierra Credit Corporation
v. Guadelupe Ramos, 23STLC03941
 
 
Tentative decision on application
for writ of possession: granted
 



            
            Plaintiff
Sierra Credit Corporation (“Sierra”) seeks a writ of possession against
Defendant Guadelupe Ramos (“Ramos”) to recover a 2008 Toyota Tundra, Vehicle
Identification Number 5TFRU54128X010933 (the “Vehicle”).   
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Sierra commenced this proceeding on June 12, 2023 against Defendant Ramos alleging (1)
claim and delivery and (2) money on a contract.  The Complaint alleges as follows.
            On
October 29, 2019, Ramos entered into a written
Contract (“Contract”) in which seller Best Deal Motors (“Seller”) sold him the
Vehicle.  Ramos agreed to make timely
payments of all amounts that fell due under the Contract.  Seller then assigned its rights under the
Contract to Sierra.  Sierra has been the
legal owner of the Vehicle at all relevant times.  The Contract gives Sierra the right to take and have immediate
possession of the Vehicle after default.  
            Ramos
breached the Contract on November 29, 2021 for failure to pay the $204.50 that
became due.  He has since failed to make the
regular monthly payments of $451.07 due thereafter.  The balance due and owing is $10,811.07.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have failed. 
            Sierra
seeks (1) recovery
of the Vehicle, or value thereof if recovery cannot be had; (2) a pretrial writ
of possession for the Vehicle; (2) a temporary restraining order enjoining Ramos
from concealing or transferring possession of the Vehicle; (4) $10,811.07
plus reasonable collection expenses, less proceeds from Sierra’s resale of the Vehicle; (5) interest on the Contract; and (6) attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
July 5, 2023, Sierra served Ramos with the Complaint, Summons, and moving
papers by substitute service, effective July 15, 2023.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the
requirement of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for
issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP §515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On October 29, 2019, Ramos and Seller
entered into a written Contract for purchase of the Vehicle.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Ramos was required to make 54 monthly
payments of $341.65 beginning November 29, 2019.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  In the event of default for failure to pay, Seller
had the right to assess a 5% late charge if ten days have passed since a
payment’s due date, accelerate the amount owed, and repossess the Vehicle.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  
            The
bottom of the Contract shows that Seller assigned its interest in the Contract
to Sierra.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Lien and Title Information Report
reflects Sierra’s lien on the Vehicle. 
Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  
            Ramos
breached the Contract on November 29, 2021 when he failed to pay $204.50.  Alonso Decl., ¶5.  He has failed to make the regular monthly
payments of $451.07 due thereafter.  Alonso
Decl., ¶5.  As of June 12, 2023, the balance
due and owing is $10,811.07.  Alonso Decl.,
¶5.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle
have failed.  Alonso Decl., ¶7.  
            The
Kelley Blue Book as of June 12, 2023 lists the Vehicle wholesale value as $10,629
and retail value as $13,388.  Alonso Decl.,
¶6, Ex. C.  
            The
Contract lists Ramos’s address as 131 E. 1st Street, San Dimas, CA 91773, and Sierra
believes the Vehicle is currently there. 
Alonso Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Sierra applies for a writ of possession for
the Vehicle against Defendant Ramos.
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Contract required Ramos to make 54 monthly payments of $341.65 for the
Vehicle.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Any late payment would incur a 5% late charge
and entitle Seller to accelerate the amount owed and repossess the
Vehicle.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Seller then assigned its interest under the
Contract to Sierra.  Alonso Decl., ¶4,
Ex. A.  A Lien and Title Information Report
reflects Sierra’s interest in the Vehicle.  Alonso Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same).  All documentary evidence,
including contracts and canceled checks, must be presented in admissible form,
and admissibility as non-hearsay evidence or exception to the hearsay rule,
such as the business records exception.  Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp., (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
937, 944; Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v. Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D.
Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178, 1182.  
            Sierra
presents conclusory evidence that the balance due and owing is $10,811.07.  Alonso Decl., ¶5.  Sierra fails to support this conclusion with
a payment history or calculation that this is the amount owed.  It also fails to explain how Ramos failed to make
regular monthly payments of $451.07 when the Contract provides for $341.65
installments plus a 5% late fee.  Alonso
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Ex. A.  As Ramos has not
opposed, this defect is waived.  
 
            2.
Undertaking
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  The Vehicle’s retail value is estimated to be
$13,388.  Alonso Decl., ¶6, Ex. C.  The balance Ramos owes is $10,811.07.  Alonso Decl., ¶5.  The defendant’s interest is the difference
between the amount owed and the retail value, or $13,388 - $10,811.07= $2,576.93.  The undertaking for this writ of possession
is $2,576.93 x 2 = $5,153.86.
 
            3.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
Contract shows Ramos’s address as 131 E. 1st Street, San Dimas, CA 91773.  Alonso Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  This is the probable location of the Vehicle,
and Sierra has justified a writ to enter a private residence at this address.  
 
            4.
Turnover Order
            The
court may issue a turnover order directing the defendant to transfer possession
of the property to the plaintiff (See
Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must
notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt
of court.  CCP §512.070.  The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of
a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff with a less
expensive means of obtaining possession. 
See Edwards, supra,
230 Cal.App.3d at 178.  
            Sierra
requests a turnover order compelling Ramos to transfer possession of the
Vehicle.  Mem. at 1.  The request for a turnover order is granted.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for writ of possession is granted. 
No writ of possession will issue until Sierra posts a $5,153.86
undertaking.  Ramos may prevent Sierra
from recoverying possession of the Vehicle by filing a redelivery undertaking
in the amount of $5,153.86.  see
CCP §515.020.  The levying officer may
enter 131 E. 1st Street, San Dimas, CA 91773 and any public or commercial
address to recover the Vehicle.
            Sierra
has not filed a proposed order for writ of possession and must do so within two
court days of this hearing on the proper Judicial Council form or it will be
waived.
