Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's decision to sustain the defendant's demurrer and dismiss the action. The plaintiff, Thomas Tarbutton, sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendant, the State Bar of California, had failed to disclose records related to a lawyer's misconduct. The court found that the records were exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act and that Tarbutton's remedy was to subpoena the records in his pending criminal case. The court also held that Tarbutton's Brady rights, which require the government to disclose material evidence, did not apply in this case.
