 Case Number:  23STCV13341    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  85 
Shino Jin v. Jie Yan, 
23STCV13341
 
Tentative decision on Corporations
Code section 709 Complaint: denied



 
 
            Pursuant
to Corporation Code section 709 (“section 709”), Plaintiff Shino Jin (“Shino”) seeks
to invalidate the October 25, 2021 shareholder vote of Starbridge Group Corp.
(“Starbridge Group”) that occurred after a stock transfer between Defendant Jie
Yan (“Yan”) and Shengjing Lu (“Lu”), and also to confirm that Shino is the
majority shareholder of Starbridge Group.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Shino filed the Complaint against Defendant Yan on June 9, 2023, alleging a section
709 claim for determination of the validity of an October 25, 2021 shareholder
vote appointing Yan as the sole director of Starbridge Group.  The unverified Complaint alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
            Starbridge
Group has a substantial interest in the Ontario Airport Hotel and Conference
Center (“Ontario Hotel” or “Hotel”), a large hotel in Ontario, California.  Shino is Starbridge Group’s majority
shareholder with an 86.2% ownership.  Yan
asserts that she is Starbridge Group’s sole owner.
 
            a.
The Ontario Hotel Purchase
            In
2012, the
owners of Ontario Hotel ran into financial problems and Wells
Fargo scheduled a foreclosure sale. 
Shino and her husband Jianhua Jin (“Jianhua”) recruited Lu, who is a
relative, to inspect the Hotel and finance the purchase if he chose to do so.  
            Jianhua
formed Starbridge
Investment, LLC (“Starbridge LLC”) to acquire title to the Ontario Hotel.  The three members of Starbridge LLC are Starbridge
Group, Morgan Holding Group, Inc. (“Morgan”), and Lancer Solution Corp
(“Lancer”).  Of the three members, Starbridge
Group alone funded the purchase of the Ontario Hotel in exchange for a 60% interest in Starbridge LLC.  Starbridge Group’s ownership would be
based on the respective capital contributions of its owners.  Morgan and Lancer would each have a 20% interest
in Starbridge
LLC.
            On November 2,
2012, Shino created the investment company, American Asset Management
Group Inc. (“AAMG”).  AAMG then wired
$10.9 million to Starbridge LLC.  On
December 27, 2012, Shino used Velocity Investment Group, Inc. (“Velocity”) to contribute
another $3,999,970.  In total, Shino contributed $14,899,970 for
the purchase of Starbridge LLC.  Lu only
contributed $5,999,993 to Starbridge LLC, but he said that he could repay Shino’s
$14,899,970 contribution over time.  Therefore,
documentation was prepared listing Lu as the sole owner of Starbridge
Group.
 
            b.
The Starbridge Group Shareholder Agreement
            In
late 2013, Lu told Shino that he could not fund the entire purchase of the
Ontario Hotel.  On December 2, 2013, Shino
and Lu entered into a shareholder agreement (“Shareholder Agreement”) whereby Shino would
own 70% of the shares of Starbridge Group and Lu would own 30%.  Stock certificates for these interests were
not issued.  
            As the majority
shareholder under the Shareholder Agreement, Shino would have the right to
unilaterally appoint any officer of Starbridge Group.  Shino appointed Jianhua to Starbridge
Group’s officer positions.
 
            c. Reduction
in Lu’s Interest 
            Pursuant
to the Shareholder Agreement, either Starbridge Group shareholder could seek a return of capital in
exchange for a proportional reduction of that shareholder’s interest.  If the shareholders ever were required to contribute
additional capital to cover operations of the Ontario Hotel, the Shareholder
Agreement divided those costs in proportion to each shareholder’s share of Starbridge
Group.  No transfer of shares could occur
without consent from the other shareholder, and that shareholder would have a
right of first refusal.
On
August 25, 2014, Shino agreed to accommodate Lu’s request for a $3 million
return of capital.  To process the return,
Starbridge LLC passed a resolution on August 26, 2014 to return $3 million in
capital to Starbridge Group.  Starbridge
Group then wired this money to Lu.  This return
halved Lu’s 30% ownership interest in Starbridge Group to 15%.
            Between 2016
and 2023, Shino and her backers contributed an additional $2.6 million to Starbridge
Group via Starbridge LLC and Lu did not contribute anything.  This further reduced Lu’s ownership interest in
Starbridge Group to 13.2%.
 
            d. Yan’s Attempted
Overthrow
            Yan now asserts
that Lu sold her 100% of Starbridge Group on October 11, 2021.  She also asserts that on October 25, 3021 she
used this supposed 100% interest to vote herself as the sole director of Starbridge
Group.
            Any
understanding that Lu ever held 100% of Starbridge Group assumed that Lu would
contribute 100% of Starbridge Group’s capital. 
He did not do so and only held a 13.2% interest.  In any case, a sale from Lu to Yan would have
violated the Shareholder Agreement because Lu never offered the shares to Shino
per her right of first refusal.
            Shino held an 86.5%
interest in Starbridge Group as of the purported election on October 25,
2021.  She did not vote to elect Yan to
any position in Starbridge Group, let alone as the sole director.
            The timing of
Yan’s actions is detrimental to ongoing efforts to rebrand the Ontario Hotel
from a Hilton to a Crowne Plaza, which would improve its value.  Shino seeks an expedited hearing on the
validity of Yan’s purported election as director of Starbridge Group, an order
that permanently removes her as director, general damages, prejudgment
interest, and attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
June 13, 2023, Department 12 (Hon. Barbara Meiers) transferred the case to
Department 1 (Hon. Michelle Williams Court) for reassignment.  On June 14, 2023, Department 1 reassigned the
case to this department.
            On
June 16, 2023, Shino served Yan with the Complaint and Summons by substitute
service, effective June 26, 2023.
            On
June 23, 2023, Yan filed and served a brief and supporting papers in connection
with a trial setting conference set for June 27, 2023.  At the conference, the court ruled that it
would treat Yan’s papers as a motion to stay the section 709 proceeding pending
an arbitration between the parties in another case.  On July 25, 2023, the court denied Shino’s ex
parte application to file a sur-reply to Yan’s motion to stay this
proceeding pending arbitration.
            On
August 8, 2023, the court denied Yan’s motion to stay this proceeding pending
arbitration.
            
            B.
Governing Law
            Upon
the filing of an action by any shareholder or by any person who claims to have
been denied the right to vote, the superior court of the proper county shall
try and determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director
of any domestic corporation.  §709(a).
            Upon
the filing of the complaint, and before any further proceedings are had, the
court shall enter an order fixing a date for the hearing, which shall be within
five days unless for good cause shown a later date is fixed.  §709(b). 
The order shall also require notice of the date for the hearing and a
copy of the complaint to be served upon the corporation and upon the person
whose purported election or appointment is questioned and upon any person
(other than the plaintiff) whom the plaintiff alleges to have been elected or
appointed, in the manner in which a summons is required to be served, or, if
the court so directs, by registered mail; and the court may make such further
requirements as to notice as appear to be proper under the circumstances.  §709(b).

a new election to be held or appointment to be made, may determine the
validity, effectiveness and construction of voting agreements and voting
trusts, the validity of the issuance of shares and the right of persons to vote
and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.  §709(c).

            b.
Initial Investments
            In
2011, Jianhua became interested in investing in U.S. real estate.  Jianhua Decl., ¶6.  In 2012, he learned the Ontario Hotel was for
sale and used Velocity as his agent to purchase it.  Jianhua Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.  
            Jianhua
and his wife Shino determined that they needed $18.5 million to buy the Ontario
Hotel out of foreclosure.  Shino Decl.,
¶4.  Shino, Jianhua, and Lu reached an
agreement in which Lu agreed to cover all $20 million of the capitalization
costs, conditioning his investment on his in-person determination that he liked
the Hotel.  Shino Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Lu agreed to provide $6 million until he saw
and approved the Hotel.  Shino Decl., ¶5.  
Shino formed AAMG to provide her share of the funding.  Shino Decl., ¶5.  She is its CEO and sole shareholder, and AAMG
has never received funding from Lu.  Shino
Decl., ¶5.  
            On
December 6, 2012, Jianhua formed Starbridge LLC to hold title to the Ontario
Hotel.  Jianhua Decl., ¶9.  AAMG paid $10.9 million into Starbridge LLC,
while Lu paid slightly under $6 million. 
Shino Decl., ¶6; Jianhua Decl., ¶9. 

The purchase of the Ontario Hotel closed on December 27,
2012 for a price of $18.5 million. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶10.  Starbridge
LLC paid $14.5 million of this price, and Jianhua wired the remaining $4
million into the escrow on Velocity’s behalf. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶10.  With the
seller’s approval, Velocity assigned the right to purchase the Hotel to Starbridge
LLC and title was held in Starbridge LLC’s name.  Jianhua Decl., ¶10.
            In
March 2013, Starbridge Group was founded to fund the Ontario Hotel’s purchase
and operations.  Shino Decl., ¶7; Jianhua
Decl., ¶11.  While AAMG had put up most
of the money, it was understood that Lu would buy Shino out consistent with his
promise to fully fund Starbridge Group’s capitalization.  Shino Decl., ¶7.
            Sometime
in 2013, Lancer and Morgan were also founded as Starbridge LLC members.  Jianhua Decl., ¶11.  Jianhua owns Morgan, and his niece Mingling
Chen owns Lancer.  Jianhua Decl., ¶11.  Shino appointed Jianhua and Morgan to manage
Starbridge LLC and the Ontario Hotel. 
Shino Decl., ¶12; Jianhua Decl., ¶11. 
Jianhua has managed the Hotel ever since.  Jianhua Decl., ¶24.  
 
            c.
The Shareholder Agreement
            In
October 2013, Lu visited the Ontario Hotel and liked it.  Shino Decl., ¶8. He agreed to honor his
commitment to repay Shino’s share of the purchase funding by wire shortly
thereafter.  Shino Decl., ¶8.  While Lu was in California, documents were
drawn up and signed to reflect this affirmation.  Jianhau Decl., ¶12.  This included a Property Rights Affirmation
Agreement (“Affirmation Agreement”) dated October 30, 2013, which reflected
Lu’s intent to honor his commitment to repay the purchase price.  Jianhua Decl., ¶12.  
On November 2013, Lu announced he could not repay the money
owed.  Jianhua Decl., ¶12; Shino Decl., ¶9.  At the time, the capitalization split of the
purchase price was roughly 70% Shino, 30% Lu. 
Shino Decl., ¶9.  While Lu’s refusal
was disappointing, it was easy to adjust the business deal to reflect
reality.  Shino Decl., ¶9.  They agreed to split Starbridge Group’s
ownership accordingly, with 70% valued at $14 million to AAMG and 30% valued at
$6 million to Lu through his company, Starry Palace Limited (“Starry”).  Shino Decl., ¶9.  An attorney in China drew up the Shareholder
Agreement which Lu signed in December 2013. Shino Decl., ¶9, Ex. A.  
The Shareholder Agreement sets forth the $14 million/$6
million ownership of Starbridge Group by Shino and Starry.  Ex. A. 
The Shareholder Agreement provides that if either shareholder fails to
invest additional funds when needed based on ownership percentage or asks for a
return of a portion of his or her investment, their shares would be recalculated
to reflect each party’s investment.  Ex.
A.  According to economic analyst Alan
Goedde (“Goedde”), this is consistent with the typical practice where capital
contributions correspond to equity interests. 
Goedde Decl., ¶¶ 4, 10, Ex. 1.  
            The
Shareholder Agreement further provides that neither shareholder could dispose
of any shares or sell any substantial interest in AAMG or Starry to a third
party except with the consent of all shareholders or otherwise in compliance
with the Shareholder Agreement.  Ex.
A.  Any other transfer would have no
effect.  Ex. A.  If either shareholder wished to transfer such
shares or interest to a third party, including another shareholder, the seller
must give notice of the price and terms of the transfer to the other shareholder.  Ex. A. 
The other shareholder could then acquire the relevant shares from the
selling shareholder on the same terms as the offer within three days of receipt
of notice.  Ex. A.  The Shareholder Agreement supersedes any
prior written or verbal agreement between the parties.  Shino Decl., ¶9, Ex. A.
 
            d.
Reduction of Lu’s Ownership Interest
            In
2014, Lu requested the return of $3 million of his investment in the Ontario
Hotel.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13; Shino Decl.,
¶10.  This required money to go from
Starbridge LLC to Starbridge Group and then to Lu.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13.  Because Starbridge LLC’s operating agreement
did not expressly authorize the return of an investment, on August 22, 2014, Jianhua
executed a Starbridge LLC resolution authorizing the return.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13, Ex. C.  On August 25, 2014, Shino and Lu signed Starbridge
Group meeting minutes authorizing the return. 
Shino Decl., ¶10, Ex. B.
Jianhua wired the $3 million return out of Starbridge LLC’s
account the next day.  Jianhua Decl.,
¶14, Ex. E.  He also executed a
Starbridge LLC resolution that reduced Starbridge Group’s shareholding therein
from 60% to 45.67%, increased Lancer’s holding from 30% to 40.75%, and
increased Morgan’s holding from 10% to 13.58%. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶14, Ex. D.
According to Goedde, this return of capital reduced Lu’s (Starry’s)
share of Starbridge Group from 30% to 15%.  Goedde Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.  This also increased Shino’s (AAMG’s) share
from 70% to 85%.  Goedde Decl., ¶22, Ex.
3.  
From 2016 through April 2023, Shino and persons and entities
related to her put more than $2.5 million of additional funding into the
Hotel.  Shino Decl., ¶11.  Lu has never invested any additional funds in
the Hotel.  Shino Decl., ¶11.  According to Goedde, Shino’s additional
funding reduced Lu’s share in Starbridge Group by 1.8% to 13.2%.  Goedde Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.
On November 17, 2021, Yan asked Lu in “WeChat” text messages
about Shino’s assertions that $3 million had been returned to Lu reducing his
ownership in Starbridge Group.  Sargent
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3, p. 6561.  Lu admitted that
he received $3 million but stated that it was not for selling shares.  Sargent Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3, p. 6565.  
 
            e.
Hotel Operation
            On
January 14, 2016, Jianhua and Shino signed personal guaranties for a licensing
agreement with InterContinental Hotels Group (“IHG License”) by which the Hotel
would be able to use the Crowne Plaza name. 
Shino Decl., ¶13; Jianhua Decl., ¶16, Ex. F.  To finance the renovations required by the IHG
License, Jianhua and Shino signed personal guaranties for a $15 million
construction loan from Cathay Bank to Starbridge LLC.  Shino Decl., ¶13; Jianhua Decl., ¶17.  Shino only signed her guaranty because she
believed she was Starbridge Group’s majority shareholder.  Shino Decl., ¶13; Jianhua Decl., ¶17.  
            Through
this litigation, Jianhua has discovered that some of the documents he signed
and submitted for the IHG License and the Cathay Bank loan include incorrect
statements about Starbridge Group’s interest in Starbridge LLC and Lu’s
interest in Starbridge Group.  Jianhua
Decl., ¶18.  Jianhua’s English skills are
limited, and he relied on other to translate the documents for him.  Jianhua Decl., ¶18.  He also paid less attention to the ownership provisions
of the documents because all Starbridge LLC owners at the time were trusted
extended family members.  Jianhua Decl.,
¶18.  On June 21, 2023, Jianhua provided
Cathay Bank with corrected documents for the Cathay Bank loan in his capacity
as Starbridge LLC’s CEO.  Jianhua Decl.,
¶19, Ex. G.  
            The
Ontario Hotel’s occupancy rate and revenue increased every year from 2014 to
2019, after which the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶24; Sargent Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  As of June 15, 2021, Easley & Associates appraised
the value of the Ontario Hotel as $22 million “as is” and between $30.5 and $34.9
million for the prospective fee simple market value upon stabilization.  Sargent Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  As of July 28, 2021, the outstanding
principal on the two notes underlying the Cathay Bank loan is $5,695,673.31 and
$1,820,283.59.  Sargent Decl., ¶5, Ex. 4.  After subtracting the outstanding loan
balance from the as-is value, the net equity of the Ontario Hotel was over $14
million.  Ackerman Decl., ¶17. 
            In
March 2021, Shino and Lu signed a corporate resolution for Starbridge Group,
the Authorizing Resolutions of the Sole Director and the Stockholder of
Starbridge Group Corp (“2021 Authorizing Resolution”).  Shino Decl., ¶15.
 
            f.
Lu’s Purchase Attempts
            Yan
testified that Ray Cai first referred her to Bo Chen in August 2021, but Yan did
not think that Ray Cai had known Bo Chen for long before that date.  Sergent Decl, ¶3, Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 27-28.  
Bo Chen then referred Lu to Yan.  Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), p. 28).  Bo Chen told Yan that Lu owned the Ontario
Hotel and was interested in selling it.  Ex.
2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 28-29, 158.  Lu never
provided Yan payment records, communications, or other proof of his capital
contributions to the Ontario Hotel.  Ex.
2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 37, 39, 41-42.
            Yan
is a member and CEO of USA BAK Manufacturing (“USA BAK”).  Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), p. 68; Sargent Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6.  Mingzhe Li, a USA BAK owner, made an
offer for the Ontario Hotel.  Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.),
pp. 68, 159).  In September 2021, Lu and USA
BAK executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“BAK Sale Agreement”) whereby BAK agreed
to pay $20 million for the Ontario Hotel, which the recitals said Lu
owned.  Sargent Decl., ¶6, Ex. 5.  
            In
her deposition, escrow officer Lyla Damiani (“Lyla”) confirmed that she learned
about the Cathay Bank loan in March 2019. 
Sargent Decl., ¶8, Ex. 7 (Lyla Depo.), p. 38.  She found the operating agreement odd because
it was signed by only Jianhua.  In her
experience, operating agreements are signed by all members.  Ex. 7 (Lyla Depo.), p. 39.  She also could not tell the outstanding
balance from the face of the deed of trust. 
Ex. 7 (Lyla Depo.), p. 39.  
            The
Hotel purchase under the BAK Sale Agreement did not close.  Lyla testified that she could not verify if
Lu had the authority to sell the Ontario Hotel. 
Ex. 7, (Lyla Depo.), p. 45.  Yan testified
that Lyla told her that Jianhua failed to send necessary documentation on Lu’s
behalf.  Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), pp.
161-62.  Lu told Yan he kept asking
Jianhua to send that paperwork to no avail. 
Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 162-63.  
            On
October 11, 2021, Lu and Yan executed a Stock Purchase Agreement in which Lu
sold Yan Starry’s shares in Starbridge Group for $2 million.  Sargent Decl., ¶9, Ex. 8.  Shino never consented to this purchase.  Shino Decl., ¶17.  
According to Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) Ackerman,
Yan did not perform due diligence before entering into the Stock Purchase
Agreement.  She did not know the
outstanding balance of Starbridge LLC’s $15 million construction loan and did
not review any financial information for the Hotel.  Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 2, 17, Ex. 1. Yan did not
ask about the profitability of the Ontario Hotel or its tax returns until
November 17, 2021, when she did so on WeChat. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶17, n.14; Sargent Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3, pp. 60-61.  
According to Ackerman, the $2 million purchase price was far
below the market value of Starry’s shares. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6, 28, Ex. 1. 
Because the as-is value of the Ontario Hotel was $22 million and the
actual debt from the Cathay Bank loan was about $7.5 million, the net equity in
the Ontario Hotel was over $14 million. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶17.  Starbridge
Group’s 60% interest was therefore valued at about $8,690,426, and the $2
million purchase price is less than 25% of this value.  Ackerman Decl., ¶17.  Such a steep discount is an indication that
the transaction was not arm length and an indicator of fraud.  Ackerman Decl., ¶18.  
            An
addendum to the Stock Purchase Agreement required Yan to wire the $2 million
payment to Fu Bang, which Chuan Dong owns, for the purchase of Starry’s stock
in Starbridge Group.  Sargent Decl., ¶9,
Ex. 8.  Yan explained that wiring to
China is “kind of difficult” and Yu has an associate with Fu Bang.  Sergent Decl., Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), p.
127.  Accordingly, Lu asked Yan to wire
$2 million to Fu Bang.  Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.),
p. 62.  
On October 12, 2021, Fu Bang recorded a deed of trust (“DOT”)
in Mingzhe Li’s favor as trustee and beneficiary for a parcel of property to
secure payment of a $2 million note with interest.  RJN Ex. O. 

            On
October 14, 2021, Li submitted a $2 million wire transfer to Fu Bang.  Sargent Decl., ¶10, Ex. 9.  Lu confirmed receipt of the $2 million, but Yan
did not know what happened to the money. 
Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 62-64, 128.
            Fu
Bang’s bank statements show it received $2 million on October 15, 2021, and distributed
$1,906,100 within one week.  Sargent
Decl., ¶12, Ex. 11.  The bank statements
show that $726,100 to WWL and $1,000,000 to Yan’s husband’s ex-wife, Lishan
Huang (“Huang”).  Ackerman Decl., ¶28,
Exs. 4-6.  Ackerman opined that a
transaction that returns parties to substantially the same economic position from
they started is an indication of fraud. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶30.
            Mingzhe
Li testified that he lent Yan $2 million for the Starbridge Group shares that
she bought from Lu.  Sargent Decl., ¶11,
Ex. 10 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), pp. 55-56.  There
were no documents for the loan because he trusts Yan, who is his partner.  Ex. 10 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 54-55).  At Yan’s request, Mingzhe Li loaned $2
million, and Fu Ban received it.  Ex. 10
(Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 78).  This was
done at Lu’s request in case Jianhua did not cooperate with the transfer of
shares.  Ex.10 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p.
79.  Fu Bang recorded the DOT to secure
the loan.  Ex. 10 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p.
79.  Fu Bang did not repay the loan.  Ex. 10 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 79).  
Ackerman opined that the DOT is evidence that the $2 million
was a loan from Mingzhe Li to Fu Bang, not proceeds from the sale of
stock.  Ackerman Decl., ¶31.

The Consequences of Yan’s Purported Stock Purchase
            On
October 15, 2021, Yan and Lu signed an action by unanimous consent of Starbridge
Group’s shareholders authorizing the transfer of Starry’s shares in Starbridge
Group from Lu to Yan.  Sargent Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 8.  The action also elected Yan as Starbridge
Group’s only director, CEO, CFO, Vice President, and Secretary.  Sargent Decl., ¶7, Ex. 8.  
Also on October 15, 2021, Lu called for a meeting on October
25, 2021 to remove Morgan as Starbridge Group’s proxy and elect Yi Pan (“Pan”)
as manager.  Sargent Decl., ¶7, Ex.
8.  
Shino never received notice of this shareholder
meeting.  Shino Decl., ¶17.  Shino has sole authority over the appointment
of a Starbridge Group director, and she never appointed Yan.  Shino Decl., ¶17.  
                         
            2. Yan’s Evidence
            a.
Relationship of the Parties
Jianhua and Lu are remote relatives, although not by blood. Holder Decl., Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.),
p. 72.  Lu is considered family
under Fujian traditions.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.),
p. 72.  
Rongji Chen[4] (“Rongji”)
is Jianhua’s relative; Jianhua’s cousin’s husband is Rongji’s wife’s
brother.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 61.  Rongji’s family invests in real estate in
China.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 61.
Lu was arrested in China in early 2022 and cannot leave
China or receive contact from anyone other than his attorney in the U.S.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶19; Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p.
73-74.  The same is true for Rongji and Bo
Chen’s brother, Chen Chi Mo.  Bo Chen
Decl., ¶19; Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 74-75. 
This detention is not imprisonment, but it makes both Lu and Rongji unavailable
to communicate or act as witnesses.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶19.
            Bo
Chen is a friend of Jianhua and has known him for over 20 years, including in
China before he came to the U.S.  Bo Chen
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6, 16.  She also has known Rongji
for four to five years, and they have worked together on business transactions.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶3.  Rondji is an older man with a long career as
a wealthy and well-respected businessman in China, and formerly a practicing
doctor.   Bo Chen Decl., ¶3.  By reputation, Rondji was the richest man in
Fujian Province, China.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶3.
 
b. Character Evidence
            At
the time of Lee, Yan entrusted Ray Cai to appropriately handle
legal disputes concerning his conduct as part of the business.  Yan Decl., ¶13.  No one has tried to enforce the default
judgment against Yan, and she denies any of the wrongdoing alleged in the
complaint.  Yan Decl., ¶13.  
            A
complaint filed on April 10, 2019 accused Jianhua of wage theft and pervasive
sexual harassment at a karaoke bar he owned. 
Holder Decl., ¶28, Ex. 42.  A
separate complaint in September 2019 accused him of fraud in a real estate
transaction.  Holder Decl., ¶29.  The case has been compelled to
arbitration.  Holder Decl., ¶29.
 
            c.
The Hotel Financing
AAMG’s bank records show that $8.5 million was wired into
its account from Asia on December 11 and 12, 2012.  Holder Decl., ¶27, Ex. 39.  Another $2.5 million was wired in on December
14, 2012.  Another $4.1 million for the
Hotel purchase came from an account labeled “Pt. VicValuta.”  Ex. 39. 

Starbridge LLC’s account shows $7 million from AAMG on
December 13,2012, $3.5 million from AAMG on December 20, 2012, and $6 million
from a Pt. VicValuta account as well as a Skylight Holdings Limited
account.  Holder Decl., ¶27, Ex. 41. Shino
has asserted in her Complaint that money from Pt. VicValuta Skylight Holdings came
from Lu.  Holder Decl., ¶27.
Jianhua testified that when he looked at the Ontario Hotel, he
had about $20 million account to invest. 
Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 30-31. 
Th money was in a China bank account, but he could not remember the
bank’s name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp.
31.  It was his money, but in his wife’s
name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 31. Shino
testified that the money used to buy the Hotel was hers: she “earned those
monies.”  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), p.
56.  
Jianhua formed AAMG in November 2012 to invest in business
deals in the U.S., but it has had no deals outside of the Ontario Hotel.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 60.  AAMG has never had any revenue or assets, and
it has never filed a tax return.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua
Depo.), p. 61.  It only exists to
represent Shino’s investments.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua
Depo.), p. 61.  
            Jianhua
testified that the $10.9 million AAMG used to purchase the Ontario Hotel had
only been in AAMG’s account for a few days. 
Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 56; Holder Decl., Ex. 39.  Shino wired the money into the AAMG account
from multiple accounts in China.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua
Depo.), pp. 56-57.  He did not think he
had the bank documents showing the source from China because the Chinese
bankers kept those documents, only held them for three years, and the accounts
are now closed.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp.
56-57.  Shino testified that she could
not find records for the source of funds because employees and office locations
have changed several times in the last 11 years.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), p. 57.  
Around June 2021, Rongji reached out to Bo Chen through
another person to help sell the Ontario Hotel. 
Bo Chen Decl., ¶2.  Rongji told Bo
Chen that he financed the purchase of the Ontario Hotel in 2012 and that he had
Lu take title thereof on his behalf.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶4.  Because both Rongji and Lu
lived in China, they agreed to have Jianhua facilitate the purchase in exchange
for 10% of the profits.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶4.  This is a common practice for
wealthy individuals in China, but it relies on a great deal of trust.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶4.  Rongjii was upset because he had invested the
money almost ten years earlier and Jianhua had not sent Rongji any profits.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶5.  Rongji no longer wanted to own the Ontario
Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶5.  He wanted Bo Chen’s assistance because she
was in the U.S. and knew Jianhua.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶6.
Bo Chen has reason to doubt that Jianhua and Shino provided
the money to purchase the Ontario Hotel. 
Bo Chen Decl., ¶16.  When they
were in China, Jianhua was working in education training and his wife was
teaching Japanese.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶16.  He complained about failed
businesses and shut-down projects.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶16.  When Jianhua came to
the U.S., he had limited means, lived in a modest home, and met clients in
fancy hotels to create a nicer impression. Bo Chen Decl., ¶18.  At an unstated date, he became interested in Bo
Chen’s $50 million project called Dos Lagos.  
Bo Chen Decl., ¶17.  Jianhua said
he could only afford to invest $100,000. 
Bo Chen Decl., ¶17.  Shortly after
he made the investment, Jianhua asked for its return.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶17. 
Jianhua has been solely responsible for running the
operations of both Starbridge LLC and Starbridge Group since their creation,
though he has delegated some of the duties. 
Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 103. 
Shino testified that she does not know the specifics of the Starbridge
LLC, the Ontario Hotel, or any other American company, and has left their
management to Jianhua.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.),
pp. 31, 34-36.
 
            d.
Entity Formation
            On
October 30, 2013, Jianhua as Director of Black King Global Investment Group
(“Black King”), and Lu as Starry’s Director, executed the Affirmation Agreement.  Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex. 18.  The Affirmation Agreement stated that
Starbridge LLC had been formed by Black King’s wholly owned subsidiary Morgan,
Starry’s wholly owned subsidiary Starbridge Group, and Lancer.   Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex. 18.  Of the three members, Starbridge Group alone
funded the purchase of the Ontario Hotel in exchange for a 60% interest in
Starbridge LLC.  Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex.
18.  Lancer owned a 30% interest in
Starbridge LLC, and Morgan owned a 10% interest.  Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex. 18.  The Affirmation Agreement does not mention a
promise by Starry or Lu to repay Shino (or Jianhau) $10 million for purchase of
the Ontario Hotel.  Holder Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 18.  
            Also
on October 30, 2013, Lu and Jianhua signed a Corporate Resolution of Starbridge
Group which consisted of three resolutions. 
Holder Decl., ¶11, Ex. 19.  The
second resolution affirmed that Lu owned 100% of Starry, which in turn owned
100% of Starbridge Group.  Holder Decl.,
¶11, Ex. 19.  Jianhua testified that this
resolution is authentic.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.),
pp. 123-24.
            Jianhua
also testified that a 2013 stock certificate showing that Starry holds 1,000
shares of Starbridge Group is authentic. 
Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 110; Holder Decl., Ex. 11.  Jianhua nonetheless testified that Starbridge
Group has 25,000 shares.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.),
p. 110.  
Starbridge Group’s tax return for December 2012 to September
2013 identifies Starry as the owner of 100% of its voting stock.   Holder Decl., Ex. 13.  Starbridge Group’s 2013 Articles of
Incorporation filed with the State of Nevada only authorize the issuance of
1,000 shares.  Holder Decl., Ex. 7.  In a June 21, 2023 closing certificate for the
Cathay Bank loan, Jianhua on behalf of Starbridge Group confirmed that its the
Articles of Incorporation have not changed. 
Holder Decl., Ex. 8.  Filings with
the Nevada Secretary of State also confirm only 1000 shares were issued through
September 12, 2023.  Holder Decl., Ex.
14.[5]
Starbridge Group’s filings with the California Secretary of
State list Jianhua for all officer positions. 
Holder Decl., Exs. 4-6.  The
company’s filings with the Nevada Secretary of State listed Jianhua for all
officer positions until October 27, 2021, when Yan was listed for all officer
positions.  Holder Decl., Ex. 3.  The company’s March 3, 2022 filing reverted every
officer position to Jianhua.  Holder
Decl., Ex. 3.  Shino has never been listed
as an officer, and the Nevada filings only show her as a director beginning March
3, 2022.  Holder Decl., ¶4(e), Ex. 3.
            Starbridge
LLC’s K-1 from 2014 to 2022 lists Starbridge Group as the member manager, with
Morgan and Lancer as limited or domestic partners.  Holder Decl., ¶24, Ex. 35.  Until 2020, the K-1s also showed that Starbridge
Group held 60% of Starbridge LLC.  Holder
Decl., ¶24, Ex. 35.
 
e. Jianhua’s Financial Incentive
            On
November 27, 2012 AAMG and Velocity executed an Agreement to Assign Agreement
of Purchase and Sale in which Velocity assigned to AAMG its right to purchase the
Ontario Hotel for $18.5 million, with a $100,000 commission to Jianhua, an
$850,000 commission to China International Education Group Co. Limited (“China
International”), and a $250,000 commission to Fujian Morgan Network Technology
Co. (“Fujian”).  Holder Decl., ¶20, Ex.
31.  
Shino confirmed that she and Jianhua own both Fujian and
China International.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.),
pp 63-65.  AAMG and Velocity also
executed a Commission, Confidentiality, and Non-Disclosure Agreement whereby
Morgan would receive a $150,000 commission once the sale of the Ontario Hotel
to “Starbridge” closed.  Holder Decl.,
¶21, Ex. 32.  
            On
March 29, 2013, Morgan, Starbridge Group, and Lancer signed a Member Management
Services Agreement.  Holder Decl., ¶22,
Ex. 33.  As Hotel manager, Morgan would be
paid $30,000 per month to manage Starbridge LLC with a 3% increase
annually.  Holder Decl., ¶22, Ex.
33.  
            A
company named “Mr. J” has provided the Ontario Hotel’s food and beverages since
2015 or 2016.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 195.  Shino owns Mr. J.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 195.  Platinum Coast Management (“Platinum”), which
Jianhua and Meng Zhang (“Zhang”) once co-owned, has always managed the Ontario
Hotel for 3% of the gross revenue.  Ex. 1
(Jianhua Depo.), pp. 190-91. Jianhua’s annual salary from Platinum is less than
$100,000.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 193.
 
            f.
The Crowne Plaza License and Cathay Bank Construction Loan       
In 2016, Jianhua had the Ontario Hotel’s general manager
negotiate the IHG License for use of the Crowne Plaza name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 164-66; Holder
Decl., ¶12, Ex. 20.  The IHG License
asked Jianhua to list the equity interests in Starbridge LLC.  Holder Decl., ¶12, Ex. 20.  He identified Starbridge Group as 60% owner
of Starbridge LLC, Starry as 100% owner of the Starbridge Group, and Lu as 100%
owner of Starry.  Holder Decl., ¶ 12, Ex.
20.  
            In
2019, the law firm of Cox, Castle & Nicholson (“Cox”) represented Jianhua
when he secured the Cathay Bank loan for Starbridge LLC and signed a personal
guaranty.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 134;
Holder Decl., ¶13, Exs. 21, 22.  On March
13, 2019, Cox sent Cathay Bank and Jianhua closing certificates.  Holder Decl., ¶13, Ex. 25.  One of these was a “Certificate of Secretary”
Jianhua signed on March 14, 2019, effective as of March 1, 2013, for the
adoption of the attached Authorizing Resolution of the Sole Director and the
Sole Stockholder of Starbridge Group Corp (“2019 Authorizing Resolution”).  Holder Decl., ¶13, Ex. 24.  The 2019 Authorizing Resolution amended the
bylaws to reflect Starbridge Group as a Nevada corporation and not a California
corporation.  Holder Decl., ¶13, Ex.
24.  Its signature page lists Lu as
Starbridge Group’s sole director and Starry as its sole stockholder, and Lu
signed both as an individual and on Starry’s behalf.  Holder Decl., ¶13, Ex. 24.  
            Also
on March 14, 2019, Jianhua signed a Closing Certificate for Starbridge
LLC.  Holder Decl., ¶23, Ex. 34.  The document certified to Cathay Bank that Jianhua
was the manager of Starbridge Group, which in turn manages Starbridge LLC.  Holder Decl., ¶23, Ex. 34.  It also affirmed that the Starbridge LLC’s
December 10, 2012 operating agreement (“2012 Operating Agreement”) remained in
full effect.  Holder Decl., ¶23, Ex. 34.  
            On
April 8, 2021 and March 1, 2023, Jianhua signed modifications to the Cathay Bank
loan on Starbridge Group’s behalf in his capacity as Starbridge LLC’s
manager.  Holder Decl., ¶25, Exs. 36-37.   
 
            g.
Yan’s Purchase of Starry’s Stock 
            In
late 2021, while Ray Cai and Yan were still married, Bo Chen approached Ray Cai
to see if anyone he knew would be interested in purchasing the Ontario
Hotel.  Yan Decl., ¶3.  Because Yan’s business associate Mingzhe Li
was looking for commercial real estate opportunities, Ray Cai and Yan introduced Mingzhe
Li to Bo Chen.  Yan Decl., ¶3.  After some negotiation, the parties prepared
the BAK Sale Agreement in September 2021. 
Yan Decl., ¶3; Mingzhe Li Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  
            In
October 2021, Rongji wanted Bo Chen to talk to Jianhua in person.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶9.  She met with Jianjua and told him that Rongji
wanted to sell the Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶9.  Jianhua called Rongji and Lu with Bo
Chen present and confirmed that Rongji wanted to sell the Ontario Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶9.  Rongji asked Jianhua to cooperate with Bo
Chen to facilitate the sale.  Bo Chen
Decl., ¶9.
Bo Chen and Jianhua met twice more to arrange the sale.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  During these meetings, Jianhua stated that he
owned 40% of the Ontario Hotel and that Rongji owned 60%.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  He also said Rongji had used various wires out
of Hong Kong and elsewhere to transmit the funds for the purchase.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  Jianhua got upset and refused to answer when Bo
Chen asked if he provided any of the funding himself.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  
During a third conversation, Bo Chen asked Jianhua why he was
trying to block the sale of a hotel he did not own.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  Jianhua did not respond and the two have not
spoken since.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.   Bo Chen reported to Rongji that Jianhua had
cut off communication and was refusing to cooperate in the sale.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶11.  Rongji said he would have Lu contact
Jianhua.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶11. 
            The
escrow company could not confirm whether Lu had the ability to sell the Ontario
Hotel on his own, and it could not get Jianhua to cooperate as manager and minority
interest holder.  Yan Decl., ¶3.  Th escrow company eventually canceled the
transaction.  Yan Decl., ¶3.  
            Lu
then suggested that Yan buy Lu’s shares in Starbridge Group.  Yan Decl., ¶4.  Lu represented that Starbridge Group owned
60% of Starbridge LLC, that Lu’s company Starry owned all of Starbridge Group,
and that Starbridge Group owned the Ontario Hotel.  Yan Decl., ¶4.  Yan already had a copy of the 2012 Operating
Agreement from the aborted BAK Sale Agreement transaction.  Yan Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Lu then sent Yan a copy of the Affirmation Agreement
and the October 30, 2013 Starbridge Group resolution via
WeChat.  Yan Decl., ¶4, Exs. 2-3.  These documents were consistent with Lu’s
assertions.  Yan Decl., ¶4.
            Yan
knew that if she had bought the Ontario Hotel directly, a portion of the $20
million purchase price would have been used to pay the outstanding balance on
the Cathay Loan before the difference went to Lu.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  This would not happen if she just bought the
Starbridge Group shares.  Yan Decl.,
¶6.  Yan did not know the current value
of the Cathay Bank loan, only that the initial principal was $15 million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  The difference between the BAK Sale
Agreement’s $20 million purchase price and this $15 million loan was $5
million, so Starbridge Group’s 60% interest in Starbridge LLC was worth $3
million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  Yan managed to negotiate Lu down to $2
million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  She did the deal based on what she knew,
knowing that Lu was motivated to sell. 
Yan Decl., ¶6.
            Rongji
and Lu told Bo Chen that they wanted to receive the funds as soon as possible
in Chinese currency.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶12.  Bo Chen had only just met Yan and
Mingzhe Li, and they did not know Rongji or Lu. 
Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  Rongji and Lu
asked Bo Chen to provide security so that Mingzhe Li not lose his $2 million
investment.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  They wanted her to receive the payment so
that she could send it to them in a way that they would receive an equivalent
amount of funds in Chinese currency.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶12.  At the same time,
Mingzhe Li would receive the security of a DOT on one of Bo Chen’s husband’s Fu
Bang properties.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶12.  Bo Chen agreed to assist the
parties in this manner.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶12.            
On October 11, 2021, Yan and Lu signed the Stock Purchase
Agreement to buy Starry’s 1000 shares in Starbridge Group in front of a notary
during a videoconference.  Yan Decl., ¶5,
Ex. 4.  Mingzhe Li agreed to lend Yan $2
million to finance her purchase of the Starbridge Group shares held by Starry.  Mingzhe Li Decl., ¶3; Yan Decl., ¶7.  On Yan’s instructions, Mingzhe Li wired this
payment to the Fu Bang bank account specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement
and the addendum thereto.  Mingzhe Li Decl., ¶3; Yan Decl., ¶7, Ex.
4; Bo Chen Decl., ¶13, Ex. 1.  
            Bo Chen received instructions from
Rongji and Lu on how to wire the money from Fu Bang.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶13.  This included orders to wire $1 million to
Huang, who is a man and not Ray Cai’s ex-wife as Shino asserts.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶14, Exs. 1-2; Yan Decl., ¶9.  Other than Huang, Bo Chen exercised discretion
to determine which people or entities could facilitate the request from Lu and Rongji
to get Chinese currency.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶15.  She confirmed through various phone
calls that the money had been wired in a way that achieved this goal.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶15.  Bo Chen informed Yan that Lu received the
money.  Yan Decl., ¶8.   
            None
of the $2 million was returned to Yan. 
Yan Decl., ¶10.  Yan has a
connection with WWL’s owner, WeiWei Li, but so does Bo Chen through her
mother.  Yan Decl., ¶10.  Yan possibly may have suggested using WWL to
get Chinese currency back to Lu.  Yan
Decl., ¶10.  If so, her earlier testimony
that she did not know what happened to the money after Fu Bang received it
would be partly mistaken.  Yan Decl.,
¶10.  In any case, the money sent to WWL
was routed to Lu in China, not to Yan. 
Yan Decl., ¶10.  
            Although
Jin and Ackerman have tried to argue that the Fu Bang DOT reflect that the $2
million was a loan, that is not correct. 
Yan Decl., ¶11.  The transaction
with Lu was risky, and enforcing a claim against someone who lives in China
would be difficult.  Yan Decl., ¶11.  Bo Chen vouched for Lu and his associate, so Mingzhe
Li and Yan agreed to secure the payment with the Fu Bang DOT to ensure the
investment would not be lost.  Yan Decl.,
¶11.  Bo Chen agreed, stating that she
had complete faith in Rongji.  Yan Decl.,
¶11.
            This
was not a circular transaction.  Mingzhe
Li Decl., ¶4.  Mingzhe Li, Yan, those
they work with, and those who work on their behalf never saw the $2 million
they paid pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.  Mingzhe Li Decl., ¶4; Yan Decl., ¶8.  
            In
a declaration dated December 26, 2021, Lu stated that Starry was the sole
shareholder in Starbridge Group until October 2021, when it liquidated its
shares.  Holder Decl., ¶31, Ex. 45.
 
            h.
The October 2021 Meeting
            On
October 15, 2021, Anthony Damiani (“Anthony”) served by hand notice of an
October 25, 2021 special meeting of Starbridge LLC members to confirm that
removal and to vote Pan as the new Starbridge LLC manager.  Anthony Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  He also served notice of Starbridge’s
revocation of its appointment of Morgan as its proxy, effective that day.  Anthony Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  Anthony tried to serve Jianhua his home; Jianhua’s
son Kaisei Jin (“Kaisei”) signed the proof of service.  Anthony Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  
            Jianhua’s
December 13, 2021 declaration admitted that his son Kaisei told him about the
served documents when he came home that night. 
Holder Decl., ¶17, Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl., ¶¶ 27-28.)  However, Jianhua testified that he did not
recall that he ever received notice of an upcoming Starbridge LLC meeting in
October 2021.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 167.  When asked if his son Kaisei ever told him that
someone had delivered a notice in Jianhua’s absence, Jianhua replied that
Kaisei was a minor and only knew how to play videogames.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 167-68.  Shino testified that she only learned about
the notice a few days before her deposition, and Kaisei never told her what the
delivered documents were.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.),
p. 133.
 
i. Starbridge Lawsuit Evidence
            On
November 4, 2021, Yan filed Starbridge LLC, et al. v. Jianhua Jin et al.,
21STLC07974 (“Starbridge Lawsuit”) against Jianhua on behalf of Starbridge LLC
and Starbridge Group.  Holder Decl., ¶19,
Ex. 30.  Yan attached the October 25,
2021 meeting minutes to show that she had purchased Starbridge Group shares
from Starry and was now the Director, President, and CEO.  Ex. 30, Ex. D.  Those minutes also showed the vote to remove
Morgan as Starbridge LLC’s manager, and the Starbridge Lawsuit sought a declaration
that Morgan was no longer a member.  Ex.
30, Ex. D.  
            In
November and December 2021, Yan sought a preliminary injunction in the
Starbridge Lawsuit enjoining Morgan from acting as Starbridge LLC’s manager.  Holder Decl., Exs. 28-29.  Jianhua opposed based on arguments that (1)
Starbridge Group no longer had a 60% interest in Starbridge LLC, and (2)
Starbridge Group was relying on the wrong Starbridge LLC operating
agreement.  Holder Decl., Ex. 29.  
Jianhua’s declaration in opposition presented a Starbridge
LLC operating agreement signed on March 2, 2013 (“2013 Operating
Agreement”).  Holder Decl., Ex. 28
(Jianhua Decl.), ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. 1.  He
asserted that the 2013 Operating Agreement, not the 2012 Operating Agreement,
governs Starbridge LLC.   Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl.,) ¶¶ 8-9.  The Affirmation Agreement prohibited the sale
of the Ontario Hotel without the unanimous approval and signatures of all Starbridge
LLC members, and Morgan and Lancer never approved such a sale.  Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl.), ¶¶ 11-13.  Jianhua also stated that Morgan had always
served as Starbridge LLC’s manager overseeing operations of the Ontario
Hotel.  Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl.), ¶14.  When the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Ontario
Hotel to incur operational losses, Lu refused to contribute additional capital
or pay for its share of the losses.  Ex.
28 (Jianhua Decl.), ¶¶ 17-18.  
            Jianhua
asserted that, on August 25, 2014, Lu agreed to release 14.33% of Starbridge
Group's equity in Starbridge LLC in exchange for a $3 million withdrawal.  Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl.), ¶23.  This reduced Starbridge Group's share from
60% to 45.67%.  Ex. 28 (Jianhua Decl.),
¶23.   Starbridge LLC’s members passed a
resolution to that effect on August 26, 2014. 
Ex. (Jianhua Decl.), ¶24.   
            On
April 6, 2022, the parties in the Starbridge Lawsuit entered an Arbitration
Submission Agreement in which they submitted to binding arbitration every
dispute between those parties that was or could have been asserted in the
lawsuit.  Yan Decl., ¶12, Ex. 5.  Yan signed on behalf of Starbridge
Group.  Yan Decl., ¶12, Ex. 5.  No one disputed whether Yan had the authority
to do so or argued that Shino was the rightful owner of Starbridge Group.  Yan Decl., ¶12.  
 
j. Post-Starbridge Lawsuit Amendments
             On June 21, 2023, Jianhua signed a new Closing
Certificate for Starbridge LLC.  Holder
Decl., ¶26, Ex. 38.  It identified the 2013
Operating Agreement as the effective operating agreement.  Holder Decl., ¶28, Ex. 38.  
            On
June 27, 2023, Jianhua sent Cathay Bank a Certificate of Secretary dated March
15, 2021, attached to a 2021 Authorizing Resolution.  Holder Decl., ¶16, Exs. 9, 27.  Unlike the 2019 Authorizing Resolution, the
2021 Authorizing Resolution listed Shino as Starbridge Group’s sole director
and majority shareholder and still listed Starry as a stockholder.  Holder Decl., ¶16, Ex. 27.  
 
k. Forged Signatures
            Jianhua
and Shino testified that they have never forged Lu’s signature, cut and pasted
his signature, or instructed anyone else to do so.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 113, 115-16; Ex. 2
(Shino Depo.), pp. 67-68.  
Yan retained Chrisman, a handwriting expert who has
testified in over 175 cases, to analyze Lu’s signature on the Starbridge
Group’s 2021 Authorizing Resolution, August 2014 minutes, and December 2013
Shareholder Agreement.  Chrisman Decl.,
¶¶ 2-3, 7, Exs. A-B.  Chrisman does not
know Chinese and did not personally witness Lu sign any documents.  Chrisman Decl., ¶14.  Yan’s counsel provided 14 known documents
that Lu purportedly signed for comparison. 
Chrisman Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8, 14, Ex. 3. 
Chrisman acknowledged these documents lack finer details that would make
the comparison more definitive.  Chrisman
Decl., ¶15.
            Chrisman
opined that the differences between the known signature samples and the questioned
signatures on the 2021 Authorizing Resolution and December 2013 Shareholder
Agreement are significant enough to provide a strong probability that Lu did
not sign those two documents.  Chrisman
Decl., ¶¶ 17(ii)-(viii), Ex. E.  The
signature on the August 2014 minutes is identical to the 2019 Authorizing
Resolution.  Chrisman Decl., ¶¶ 8, 17(i),
Exs. C, E.  This raises the possibility that
the questioned signature was transferred from the known signature or visa
versa, or both signatures are transfers from a third, unknown document.  Chrisman Decl., ¶4(b).
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            In
the opinion of Hotel management employee Mona Zhang (“Zhang”), Yan is a
habitual liar.  Zhang Decl., ¶8.  
 
a. The BAK Sale Agreement
            After
Lu and Yan signed the BAK Sale Agreement, Lyla asked First American Title for a
copy of the 2012 Operating Agreement so she could verify the signature.  Wilson Decl., Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 36.  First American Title provided a link to a
recorded DOT securing a loan.  Ex. 20 (Lyla
Depo.), p. 38.  Lyla became concerned
when she saw the signatures on the DOT did not match those on the BAK Sale
Agreement.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), pp.
38-39.
            When
Lyla received the 2012 Operating Agreement, she only saw Jianhua’s
signature.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), at p. 39.  This was unusual because operating agreements
are signed by all members of a company instead of just one.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 39.  The 2012 Operating Agreement also required
that all members execute any purchase agreement to facilitate the transaction.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 41.  Lyla informed USA BAK she could not process
the BAK Sale Agreement.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.),
p. 41.  This did not mean Lu lacked the
authority to sell the Ontario Hotel.  Ex.
20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 60.  The 2012
Operating Agreement confirmed that he owned 60%, which would give him that
right.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 60.  Lyla just could not confirm if Jianhua also
needed to sign the BAK Sale Agreement, based on the fact that he alone signed the
2012 Operating Agreement.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.),
p. 61.  Lyla had also heard that there
were other issues unknown to her.  Ex. 20
(Lyla Depo.), p. 61.  She decided she did
not want to proceed with the transaction and cancelled it.  Ex. 20 (Lyla Depo.), p. 61.  
 
            b.
The Starbridge Group Stock Purchase Agreement
            During
Mingzhe Li’s deposition, counsel for Shino showed him the Fu Bang DOT.  Wilson Decl., Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), at
pp. 81-82.  Mingzhe Li started to say that
“Yan lent Fu Bang money” and corrected himself. 
Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 83. 
He explained that Yan purchased Lu’s shares of the Ontario Hotel.  Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 83.  Mingzhe Li loaned $2 million to Fu Bang,
which it received.  Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.),
p. 83.  Lu asked for this out of concerns
that Jianhua would not cooperate with attempts to turn Starbridge Group shares
over to Yan.  Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.),
p. 83.  Fu Bang has not repaid the $2
million.  Ex. 21 (Mingzhe Li Depo.), p. 83.  
 
            c.
Rongji’s Family
            Pakshu
Chan (“Pakshu”) is Ronghi’s son.  Pakshu
Decl., ¶2. His family is related to Lu. 
Pakshu Decl., ¶2.  Pakshu was Starbridge
Group’s first president.  Pakshu Decl., ¶1.  He is also related to Jianhua.  Pakshu Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  
 
            d.
The October 2021 Meeting 
            On
October 15, 2021, Shino was in China.  Ex.
23 (Shino Depo.), p. 131.  During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government prohibited foreigners like her from
exiting and reentering the country.  Ex.
23 (Shino Depo.), p.131.  Because
Jianhua’s mother lives in China and was 83 years old at the time, Shino stayed
with her for three years.  Ex. 23 (Shino Depo.),
p.131.  
 
            e.
Kuhn’s Handwriting Analysis
            Handwriting
expert Kurt Kuhn, with 38 years as a document examiner, declared that Asian
characters are more akin to symbols than letters.  Kuhn Decl., ¶6.  In forensic document examination, an examiner
must exercise caution in rendering opinions on foreign language material unless
the examiner is intimately familiar with the language at issue.  Kuhn Decl., ¶6.
            The
questioned signatures on the three documents are machine reproductions that did
provide sufficient detail to conduct examinations and render reliable
opinions.   Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  The signature on the 2021 Authorizing
Resolution was likely written by the same person as the known writing
samples.  Kuhn Decl., ¶11. Kuhn could not
form an opinion as to the August 2014 minutes. 
Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  He agreed with
Chrisman that the signature was identical to K-10.  Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  His findings on the December 2013 Shareholder
Agreement were inconclusive because he had only three known contemporaneous writing
samples.  Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  
            Chrisman
discussed inconsistencies but not the level of agreement or variation among the
known samples or between the subject documents and known samples.  Kuhn Decl., ¶13.  Variation in an individual’s signature is
natural and can depend on the circumstances at the time of the writing.  Kuhn Decl., ¶13.  
            Chrisman’s
opinion cited the pen pressure changes in signatures.  Kuhn Decl., ¶14.  These can depend on the writing instrument
used at the time, like ballpoint pen versus oil-based technology.  Kuhn Decl., ¶14.  Inkjet machine reproductions also do not
permit reliable evaluation of the changes in pen pressure.  Kuhn Decl., ¶14.  
 
            D.
Analysis
Pursuant to section 709, Plaintiff Shino moves to invalidate
the October 25, 2021 Starbridge Group shareholder vote and to confirm herself as
the majority shareholder of Starbridge Group.
This is the third time the court has addressed who controls
Starbridge Group.  In the Starbridge
Lawsuit, the court addressed Yan’s motion for a mandatory preliminary
injunction compelling removal of Morgan as manager of Starbridge LLC.  The motion turned on whether the 2012
Operating Agreement or the 2013 Operating Agreement for Starbridge LLC was in
effect.  The court concluded that someone
was not telling the truth, the matter was not free from doubt, that more
evidence would be required at trial, and declined to issue a preliminary
injunction removing Morgan as manager.
In this lawsuit, the court addressed Yan’s motion to stay
the instant hearing in favor of the parties’ arbitration.  The court declined to do so, noting that the
evaluation of credibility will be an important matter in deciding who owns
Starbridge Group.  Detailed declarations
with supporting evidence should demonstrate credibility and the court authorized
the parties to make use of the discovery obtained in the arbitration of the
Starbridge Lawsuit.
Now, the court is tasked with deciding who owns Starbridge
Group for the purpose of determining the validity of the vote at the October
25, 2021 shareholder meeting.[6]  The parties have provided detailed documentary
evidence and numerous declarations, although the declarations are still lacking
in some detail.[7]  
 
1. Jianhau Is
the Driving Force for Shino’s Controlling Ownership of Starbridge Group
As a threshold matter, Jianhau, not Shino, is the moving
force for the Jins’ argument that Shino has controlling ownership of Starbridge
Group and the Ontario Hotel.  Jianhau
testified that he located the Hotel, he made the purchase arrangements, he
created Starbridge LLC, Starbridge Group, AAMG, and Morgan, and he has managed
the Hotel since acquisition.  Shino testified
that she did not know the specifics of the management of Starbridge LLC, the Ontario
Hotel, or any related company, and that she left their management to her
husband.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), pp. 31,
34-36.  He also testified that the $10
million in purchase money was his money, but in his wife’s name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 31.  
When Jianhau received with notice of the October 25, 2021
LLC meeting, he apparently never told his wife. 
The meeting agenda was hand-delivered to the Jins’ family home on
October 15, 2021, and handed to their son. 
Jianhau admitted in his December 13, 2021 declaration that the notice
was given to his son, Kaisei, who then gave it to him that night when he got
home.  Holder
Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. 28 at ¶¶ 27, 28.  Shino testified
that she was never told about the notice, and only learned of it recently.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), pp. 133-35.   Opp. at
11-12.
Finally, Jianhau did not initially defend the Starbridge
Lawsuit on the basis that Shino controlled Starbridge Group.  Holder
Decl., Ex. 29.   Instead, he contended that Starbridge Group no
longer had a 60% interest in Starbridge LLC, and that Starbridge Group was
relying on the wrong operating agreement for the LLC without mentioning Shino’s
ownership.  Id.  
Although it is clear that Jianhau is the decision-maker for
the Jins and the claim in this section 709 lawsuit, the documents he relies on are
in Shino’s name, and she testified that she put up the $10 million to buy the
Hotel.  Ex. 2, (Shino Depo.), p. 56.  To avoid confusion, the court will proceed as
if Shino claims to be the owner.
 
2. Lu Paid for the Ontario Hotel With Rongji’s
Money  
The best way to tackle the ownership issue is to follow the
money.  Shino’s argument is that Jianhua learned
the Ontario Hotel was for sale in 2012 and used Velocity as his agent to
purchase it.  Jianhua Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.  He and Shino determined that they needed
$18.5 million to buy the Ontario Hotel out of foreclosure.  Shino Decl., ¶4.  Shino, Jianhua, and Lu reached an agreement that
Lu would cover all $20 million of the capitalization costs, conditioned on his in-person
visit.  Shino Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Until he saw and approved the Hotel, he
agreed to provide $6 million.  Shino
Decl., ¶5.  
The purchase of the Ontario Hotel closed on December 27,
2012, for a price of $18.5 million. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶10.  AAMG paid
$10.9 million into Starbridge LLC, while Lu paid slightly under $6
million.  Shino Decl., ¶6; Jianhua Decl.,
¶9.  While AAMG put up most of the money,
it was understood that Lu would buy Shino out consistent with his promise to
fully fund Starbridge Group’s capitalization. 
Shino Decl., ¶7.  
There is strong reason to disbelieve that Shino (or Jianhua)
put up $10.9 million.  First, there is
nothing in their backgrounds to suggest they had the wherewithal to do so.  In Japan, Jianhau worked at a Japanese
language school.  Jianhau Decl., ¶4.  In China, he worked in education.  Jianhau Decl., ¶4.  Shino assisted Jianhau in his
education-related businesses operating secondary schools in Fujian
province.  Shino Decl., ¶3.  Jianhua was working in education training and
his wife was teaching Japanese.  Bo Chen
Decl., ¶16.  He complained about failed
businesses and shut-down projects.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶16.  
When Jianhua came to the U.S., he had limited means, lived
in a modest home, and met clients in fancy hotels to create a nicer impression.
Bo Chen Decl., ¶18.  He became interested
in a $50 million Bo Chen project called Dos Lagos.   Bo Chen Decl., ¶17.  Jianhua said he could only afford to invest
$100,000.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶17.  Shortly after he made the investment, Jianhua
asked for its return.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶17.  The Hotel was Jianhua’s first deal
in the U.S.  If he or Shino had access to
$10.9 million, it did not come from their employment or any U.S. deal. 
Of course, one or both of Jianhua and Shino could have inherited
the money or had family members with access to this amount.  Yet, neither so testified.  Jianhua only vaguely testified that he had
about $20 million account to invest.  Ex.
1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 30-31.  Th money
was in a China bank account, but he could not remember the bank’s name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 31.  It was his money, but in his wife’s
name.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 31. Shino
disagreed, testifying that the money used to buy the Hotel was hers  -- she “earned those monies.”  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), p. 56.  
Their version also is flatly contradicted by Bo Chen.   Around June 2021, Rongji reached out to Bo
Chen through another person to help sell the Ontario Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶2.  Rongji told Bo Chen that he financed the
purchase of the Ontario Hotel in 2012 and had Lu take title thereof on his
behalf.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶4.  Because both Rongji and Lu lived in China,
they agreed to have Jianhua facilitate the purchase in exchange for 10% of the
profits.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶4. [8]  This is a common practice for wealthy
individuals in China, but it relies on a great deal of trust.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶4.  Rongjii was upset because he had invested the
money almost ten years earlier and Jianhua had not sent Rongji any profits. Bo
Chen Decl., ¶5.  Rongji no longer wanted
to own the Ontario Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶5.  Rongji wanted Bo Chen’s assistance
because she was in the U.S., and she knew Jianhua.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶6.
In October 2021, Rongji wanted Bo Chen to talk to Jianhua in
person.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶9.  She met with Jianjua and told him that Rongji
wanted to sell the Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶9.  Jianhua called Rongji and Lu with Bo
Chen present and confirmed that Rongji wanted to sell the Ontario Hotel.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶9.  He asked Jianhua to cooperate with Bo Chen to
facilitate the sale.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶9.
Bo Chen and Jianhua met twice more to arrange the sale.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  During these meetings, Jianhua stated that
he owned 40% of the Ontario Hotel and that Rongji owned 60%.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  He also said Rongji used various wires out
of Hong Kong and elsewhere to transmit the funds for the purchase.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.  Jianhua got upset and refused to answer when Bo
Chen asked if he provided any of the funding himself.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶10.[9]  
Bo Chen’s statements are strong evidence that Rongji funded the
Hotel’s purchase.  Shino completely fails
to impeach Bo Chen’s statements, which clearly show that Shino did not finance
the purchase of the Hotel.
Shino further did not document the source of the funds for
the Hotel’s purchase.  As Yan argues
(Opp. at 16), AAMG was just an empty shell with no other business operations,
assets, revenues, or tax returns.  Ex. 1 (Jianhau Depo.), pp. 60-61; Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), pp. 52-53.  The initial $10.9 million AAMG used to purchase
the Ontario Hotel was only in AAMG’s account for a few days.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 56; Holder Decl.,
Ex. 39.  AAMG’s bank records show that
$8.5 million was wired into its account from Asia on December 11 and 12,
2012.  Holder Decl., ¶27, Ex. 39.  Another $2.5 million was wired in on December
14, 2012.  Another $4.1 million came from
an account labeled “Pt. VicValuta.” 
Holder Decl., Ex. 39.[10]  
Where did this money come from?  AAMG Jianhau testified that Shino wired the
money into the AAMG account from multiple accounts in China.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 56-57.   Neither
Jianhua nor Shino had any source documents to show where this money came from.  See Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 56-57; Ex.
2 (Shino Depo.), p. 57.  Shino’s declaration
does not provide any detail, only vaguely stating that she “made arrangements
to provide the majority of the funding”. 
In her testimony, Shino stated that she “earned it.”  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), p. 56.
It is true that there also are no bank records showing that Rongji
or Lu provided all the purchase funds.  But
there are reasons to believe that is what happened.  First, Bo Chen says that Rongji was the
source.  She stated that Rondji is an
older man with a long career as a wealthy and well-respected businessman in
China, and formerly a practicing doctor.  
Bo Chen Decl., ¶3.  By reputation,
Rondji was the richest man in Fujian Province, China.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶3.  Thus, he appears capable of funding the
purchase.  Second, Shino has admitted
that the $6 million from Pt. VicValuta Skylight Holdings came from Lu.  Holder Decl., ¶27.  Therefore, Lu (or Rondji) had the wherewithal
to provide at least that much money.  There
is no such evidence for Shino and Jianhua. 
Third, unlike Shino and Jianhua, Rongji and Lu are detained in China and
have little to no ability to communicate or provide records.  This fact helps explain why they could not
provide source documents.  Again, no such
explanation exists for Shino.
Neither Jianhua nor Shino funded the $18.5 million Hotel
purchase.  Rather, Lu did so, probably
with Rongji’s money.
 
3. The Attack on Yan’s Purchase
Shino attacks the sale of Starry stock from Lu to Yan as a
phony transaction.  According to
Ackerman, Yan failed to perform due diligence despite red flags associated with
the sale.  Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 19-22.
Ackerman also opined that the $2 million purchase price was
far below the market value of Starry’s shares. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6, 28, Ex. 1. 
Because the as-is price of Ontario Hotel was $22 million and the actual
debt from the Cathay Bank loan was about $7.5 million, the net equity in the
Ontario Hotel was over $14 million. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶17.  Starbridge
Group’s 60% interest was therefore valued at about $8,690,426, and a $2 million
purchase price is less than 25% of this value. 
Ackerman Decl., ¶17.  Such a steep
discount is an indication that the transaction is not arm’s length and an indicator
of fraud.  Ackerman Decl., ¶18.  
Ackerman further opined that the $2 million payment was a
loan from Mingzhe Li to Fu Bang, not purchase money for Starry’s stock.  Ackerman Decl., ¶31.  The sale documents specify that payment is to
be made to Fu Bang, not Lu directly.  Fu
Bang is owned by Bo Chen and her husband. 
RJN Exs. A, B, F, G; Sargent Decl., Ex. 2 (Yan Depo.), p. 127
(admitting that Bo Chen’s husband owns Fu Bang). 
The payment was made by Mingzhe Li, who had just a month earlier been
prepared to buy the Hotel for $20 million. 
The $2 million payment Mingzhe Li made to Fu Bang to pay Lu for his
shares was secured by the DOT Fu Bang executed for Mingzhe Li only three days
beforehand.  Thus, it appears that the $2
million was not a payment at all, but a loan to Fu Bang secured by a DOT.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
Shino further relies on the fact that the $2 million was not
directly distributed to Lu.  Fu Bang’s
bank statements show it received $2 million on October 15, 2021, and distributed
$1,906,100 within a week later.  Sargent
Decl., ¶12, Ex. 11.  The bank statements
show that $726,100 to WWL and $1,000,000 to Yan’s husband’s ex-wife,
Huang.  Ackerman Decl., ¶28, Exs.
4-6.  It was dispersed among various
people and entities all connected with Yan, and at least $726,000 of the
payment went to WWL which Yan testified she partly owns. This company uses the
same address as Mingzhe Li.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 11-12.
            Ackerman
concluded that the $2 million payment was a fraudulent transaction that went
back into the pockets of Yan and her associates.  Ackerman Decl., ¶¶ 11, 30.  Shino concludes that this cannot form valid
consideration for her purchase of Starry’s shares.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
            The
court agrees that Yan’s $2 million purchase for Starbridge Group stock is odd,
particularly in light of an aborted sale of the Hotel for $20 million just a
month earlier.  The court also agrees
that Yan’s lack of due diligence, the use of Fu Bang to receive payment, and
the dispersal of funds to persons and entities other than Lu raises concern
about the transaction.
            Nonetheless,
Lu submitted two declarations in the Starbridge Lawsuit attesting that he sold his
interest in Starbridge Group in October 2021. 
Holder Decl., Ex. 44, ¶1; Ex. 45, ¶2. 
This is dispositive of Shino’s argument. 
She has no standing to contend that Yan’s purchase lacked consideration
where Lu accepted it.
            Moreover,
Yan adequately rebuts Shino’s position.  As
a preliminary matter, Ackerman has some of his facts wrong.  Bo Chen does not own Fu Bang, her husband
does.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  Huang, who received $1 million of the $2
million payment, is a man and not Ray Cai’s ex-wife as Shino asserts.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶14, Exs. 1-2; Yan Decl., ¶9.  
            Yan
did some due diligence, albeit minimal.  Lu
represented that Starbridge Group owned 60% of Starbridge LLC, Lu’s company
Starry owned all of Starbridge Group, and Starbridge Group owned the Ontario
Hotel.  Yan Decl., ¶4.  Yan already had a copy of the 2012 Operating
Agreement from before the BAK Sale Agreement. 
Yan Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Lu then
sent Yan a copy of the Affirmation and the October 30, 2013 Starbridge
Group resolution via WeChat.  Yan Decl., ¶4,
Exs. 2-3.  She found these documents were
consistent with Lu’s assertions.  Yan
Decl., ¶4.
            Yan
explains the $2 million purchase price as follows.  She knew that if she had bought the Ontario
Hotel directly, a portion of the $20 million purchase price would have gone to
pay the outstanding balance on the Cathay Loan before the difference went to
Lu.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  This would not happen if she just bought the
Starbridge Group shares.  Yan Decl.,
¶6.  Yan did not know the current value
of the Cathay Bank loan, only that the initial principal was $15 million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  The difference between the BAK Sale
Agreement’s $20 million purchase price and this $15 million was $5 million, so
Starbridge Group’s 60% interest in Starbridge LLC was worth $3 million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  Yan managed to negotiate Lu down to $2
million.  Yan Decl., ¶6.  She did the deal based on what she knew,
knowing that Lu was motivated to sell. 
Yan Decl., ¶6.
On October 11, 2021, Yan and Lu signed the Stock Purchase
Agreement to buy Starry’s 1000 shares in Starbridge Group in front of a notary
during a videoconference.  Yan Decl., ¶5,
Ex. 4.  The agreement was signed
by Lu in front of Yan, and notarized.  Yan Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 4.  
As for payment, Rongji and Lu told Bo Chen that they wanted to
receive the funds as soon as possible in Chinese currency.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  Bo Chen had only just met Yan and Mingzhe Li.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  Lu and Rongji wanted Bo Chen to provide
security so that Mingzhe Li not lose his $2 million investment.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶12.  They wanted her to receive the payment so
that she could send it to them in a way that they would receive an equivalent
amount of funds in Chinese currency.  Bo
Chen Decl., ¶12.  At the same time,
Mingzhe Li would receive the security of a DOT on one of Bo Chen’s husband’s Fu
Bang properties.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶12.  Bo Chen agreed to assist the
parties in this manner.  Bo Chen Decl.,
¶12.        
This is odd.  Why would Lu
and Rongji care if Mingzhe Li was protected? 
It seems more likely that Mingzhe Li would ask for the protection of a
DOT.  In any event, it appears that Bo
Chen, who trusted Rongji, was willing to act as middleman and expose her
husband’s company, Fu Bang, to the loss of a real property through foreclosure
on the DOT if the $2 million payment were lost. 

            Bo
Chen received instructions from Rongji and Lu on how to wire the money from Fu
Bang.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶13.  This included orders to wire $1 million to
Huang, who is a man in China and not affiliated with Yan.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶14, Exs. 1-2; Yan Decl., ¶9.  Other than Huang, Bo Chen exercised
discretion to determine which people or entities could facilitate the request
from Lu and Rongji to get Chinese currency. 
Bo Chen Decl., ¶15.  Yan has a
connection with WWL’s owner, WeiWei Li, but so does Bo Chen through her
mother.  Yan Decl., ¶10.  Bo Chen confirmed through various phone calls
that the money had been wired in a way that achieved this goal.  Bo Chen Decl., ¶15.  Bo Chen informed Yan that Lu received the
money.  Yan Decl., ¶8.   
 As Yan argues (Opp.
at 17-18), Lu sold his interest in Starbridge Group to her in October
2021.  Holder
Decl., Ex. 44, ¶1; Ex. 45, ¶2. Ackerman’s second-guessing that the
price should have been higher is irrelevant. 
This was not a circular deal because none of the $2 million was returned to Yan.  Yan Decl., ¶10.  While the reason for wiring portions of the
payment to Hwang and other recipients are unclear, Lu has not complained.  Bo Chen received confirmation the money
was received by Lu.  Chen Decl., ¶¶ 13-15.  The arrangement was unorthodox but not a
fraud.[11]
4. Jianhau’s and Shino’s Motive
to Sign Personal Guaranties
Shino points out that Jianhua has actively managed the Hotel since 2012,
including navigating it through the COVID-19 pandemic. Jianhua Decl., ¶ 24;
Shino Decl. ¶ 12.  In March 2019, Jianhua
and Shino personally guaranteed a $15 million construction loan to renovate the
Hotel up to brand standards for affiliation as a Crowne Plaza.  Jianhua Decl., ¶¶ 15-17; Shino Decl., ¶13. A
third-party appraisal for the loan in 2021 found the Hotel in good condition
and well run, with “no material deferred maintenance” and that the furnishings
“appear to be of good quality.”  Sargent Decl. Ex. 1, p. 149. The appraised
value of the Hotel was $22 million as-is, and between $30.5 million to $34.9
million once the re-branding is complete.  Ex. 1, p. 25.  Other than 2019 and 2020, when COVID hit,
the occupancy rate and revenue per available room had been increasing year over
year since 2014.  Ex. 1, p. 167.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 7.
Jianhua’s conduct underscores his and Shino’s majority interest and
managerial status.  In contrast, Lu behaved
as a minority shareholder in Starbridge Group.  Not only had he invested less capital, but he
was also a passive investor with little involvement with the day-to-day
operations or finances of the Hotel.  Shino has invested millions into the Hotel and
Jianhau has invested more than a decade in managing it.  Both guaranteed the construction loan from
Cathay Bank, putting themselves personally at financial risk. Jianhua Decl., ¶
17; Shino Decl., ¶ 13. Their pre-dispute conduct supports Plaintiff Jin’s claim
to have a majority stake in Starbridge Group. Shino Decl., ¶ 13 (“I would not
have provided guarantees in the Hotel if I were not the majority
shareholder.”).  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
Shino’s argument that she and her husband have invested time
and money into the Hotel and want it to succeed is equally consistent with a
manager who holds a minority interest in the Hotel and who receives managerial
and other income from it.  
On November 27, 2012 AAMG and Velocity executed an Agreement
to Assign Agreement of Purchase and Sale. 
Holder Decl., ¶20, Ex. 31.  Pursuant
to this agreement, Velocity assigned its rights to AAMG to purchase the Ontario
Hotel with a $100,000 commission to Jianhua, an $850,000 commission to China
International Education Group Co. Limited (“China International”), and a
$250,000 commission to Fujian Morgan Network Technology Co. (“Fujian”).  Holder Decl., ¶20, Ex. 31.  Shino and Jianhua own both Fujian and China
International.  Ex. 2 (Shino Depo.), pp
63-65.  AAMG and Velocity also executed a
Commission, Confidentiality, and Non-Disclosure Agreement whereby Morgan would
receive a $150,000 commission once the sale of the Ontario Hotel to “Starbridge”
closed.  Holder Decl., ¶21, Ex. 32.  
            Morgan,
Starbridge Group, and Lancer also signed a Member Management Services Agreement
in which Morgan would be paid $30,000 per month to manage Starbridge LLC at
first, with a 3% increase annually. 
Holder Decl., ¶22, Ex. 33.  Finally,
Mr. J has provided the Ontario Hotel’s food and beverages since 2015 or
2016.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), at 195.  Shino owns Mr. J.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p. 195.  Platinum, formerly co-owned by Jianhua, has
always managed the Ontario Hotel for 3% of the gross revenue and Jianhua’s
annual salary from Platinum is less than $100,000.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), p.190-91, 193.
            Thus,
Jianhua had every reason to help the Hotel succeed without majority ownership,
including personal guaranties for the IHG License by which the Hotel would
obtain the Crowne Plaza name (Shino Decl., ¶13; Jianhua Decl., ¶16, Ex. F), and
for a $15 million Cathay Bank loan to Starbridge LLC to renovate the Hotel.  Shino Decl., ¶13; Jianhua Decl., ¶17.

Document Inconsistencies
a. The 2013 Affirmation Agreement, Stock Certificate,
and Starbridge Group Resolution
Yan posits (Opp. at 16) that, if the Jins really contributed
over 2/3 of the capital to Starbridge Group, why did Jianhau state in four
early documents—the 2013 Starbridge Group stock certificate showing that Starry
holds 1,000 shares of Starbridge Group, the 2013 Affirmation Agreement, the October
30, 2013 Starbridge Group resolution, and the 2014 Starbridge Group tax return—that
Starry was the 100% owner?  Holder Decl., Exs. 11, 13, 18, 19.  Jianhua testified that both the Starbridge
Group resolution and 2013 stock certificate are authentic.  Ex. 1 (Jianhua Depo.), pp. 110, 123-24.[12]  Additionally, Starbridge Group’s tax return
for December 2012 to September 2013 identifies Starry as the owner of 100% of
its voting stock.   Holder Decl., Ex.
13.  
The Affirmation Agreement expressly states that Starbridge
Group alone funded the purchase of the Ontario Hotel in exchange for a 60%
interest in Starbridge LLC.  Holder
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 18.  It adds that Lancer
owns a 30% interest in Starbridge LLC, and Morgan owns a 10% interest.  Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex. 18. 
Jianhua states that the Affirmation Agreement was intended
to affirm Lu’s agreement to repay the $10 million Shino had paid towards the Hotel
purchase.  Jianhua Decl., ¶12.  Yet, that is not what the Affirmation Agreement
states.  It does not mention a promise by
either Starry or Lu to repay Shino or Jianhau $10 million for the purchase of the
Ontario Hotel.  Holder Decl., ¶10, Ex.
18.  Instead, it states without any
qualification that Starry is the 100% owner of Starbridge Group and that Lu owns
Starry.  Ex.
18.  It also recites deal terms for
Morgan’s best efforts to obtain a construction loan, Lancer’s duty to obtain
EB-5 marketing, and return of capital, as well as terms concerning a
single-family home in Las Vegas, but nothing about repayment of $10 million to
Shino.  Ex. 18, pp. 1-3.
Shino argues that, in November 2013 -- a month after the
Affirmation Agreement, the Starbridge Group stock certificate, and the Starbridge
Group resolution -- Lu announced that he could not repay the money he owed Shino.  Jianhua Decl., ¶12; Shino Decl., ¶9.  At the time, the capitalization split of the
purchase price was roughly 70% Shino, 30% Lu. 
Shino Decl., ¶9.  According to
Shino, while Lu’s refusal was disappointing, it was easy to adjust the business
deal to reflect reality.  Shino Decl.,
¶9.  They agreed to split Starbridge
Group’s ownership with 70% valued at $14 million to AAMG and 30% valued at $6
million to Starry.  Shino Decl., ¶9.  An attorney in China drew up the Shareholder
Agreement which Lu signed in December 2013.  Shino Decl., ¶9, Ex. A.  
            According
to Shino, Lu then requested a return of $3 million of his investment in the
Hotel in 2014.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13; Shino
Decl., ¶10.[13]  This return required money to go from
Starbridge LLC to Starbridge Group and then to Starry.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13.  Because Starbridge LLC’s operating agreement
did not expressly authorize an investment return, Jianhua executed a Starbridge
LLC resolution authorizing the return on August 22, 2014.  Jianhua Decl., ¶13, Ex. C.  On August 25, 2014, Shino and Lu signed Starbridge
Group meeting minutes authorizing the return. 
Shino Decl., ¶10, Ex. B.  Jianhua
wired the $3 million return out of Starbridge LLC’s account the next day.  Jianhua Decl., ¶14, Ex. E.  On August 26, 2014, he executed a Starbridge
LLC resolution that reduced Starbridge Group’s shareholding in Starbridge LLC
from 60% to 45.67%, increased Lancer’s holding from 30% to 40.75%, and
increased Morgan’s holding from 10% to 13.58%. 
Jianhua Decl., ¶14, Ex. D.
This explanation does not make sense.  When Lu received a return of $3 million of
his investment in 2014, Shino had a controlling 70% interest in Starbridge
Group.  If Lu’s interest was supposed to be
reduced, the reduction should have been in his (Starry’s) ownership interest in
Starbridge Group, not a reduction of Shino’s own interest in Starbridge LLC.  Why would Shino agree to reduce Starbridge
Group’s interest in Starbridge LLC from a 60% majority position to a 45%
minority position just because Lu received a $3 million return?  Since Starbridge LLC paid the $3 million,
there may also have been an adjustment required between Starbridge Group,
Morgan, and Lancer, but not one that affected Shino’s ownership.  If Shino actually put up $10 million, her explanation
of the adjustment based on the $3 million return of capital to Lu does not make
sense.[14]
Yan points to other inconsistencies.  In January 2015, Jianhua signed the IHG
License agreement to obtain the Crowne Plaza brand, representing that Starry
was the 100% shareholder of Starbridge Group and that Lu was the 100%
shareholder of Starry.  Holder Decl., Ex. 20, p. 5186.  On March 14, 2019, in connection with the $15
million Cathay Bank loan, Jianhua submitted an “Authorizing Resolution of the
Sole Director and the Sole Stockholder of Starbridge Group Corp.”  Holder Decl., Ex.
24.  The resolution identified Lu as the
“Sole Director” and Starry as the “Sole Stockholder.”  Ex. 24, p. 4104.  Jianhau
certified as the Secretary of Starbridge Group that this resolution was “duly
adopted” by the Sole Director and Sole Shareholder on March 14, 2019, effective
as of March 1, 2013. Ex. 24, p. 4122.  Opp.
at 10.[15]
Shino acknowledges that Jianhau made these inconsistent
representations about Starbridge Group’s ownership.  Jianhau notes that some pre-date the
Shareholder Agreement and were made in anticipation of the initial arrangement
that Lu was supposed to fully fund the purchase of the Hotel in 2012.
Jianhua Decl., ¶12. Those that post-date the Shareholder Agreement, even in
documents signed by Jianhua—a non-native English speaker who relied on others
to assist him (Jianhua Decl, ¶¶ 18-19) —do not invalidate or novate Starbridge
Group’s Shareholder Agreement between Shino and Lu. They are simply mistakes,
and not relevant to the issue of actual ownership of Starbridge Group’s shares.
 Pet. Op. Br. at 2-3.
Yan does not accept Jianhau’s contention that he relied on
others due to his limited English and the court does not either.  See Opp. at 11.  Jianhau was represented by Cox for the Cathay
Loan in 2019.  Cox could not have
obtained the information for the resolution other than from Jianhau or his
agents.  He signed a certification that the
authorization was correct and personally guaranteed the Cathay Bank loan.  He cannot rely on a language barrier to rebut
the truth of these representations.
 
b. Genuineness of Documents
Shino argues that the December 2013 Shareholder Agreement between
herself and Lu specifies their respective interests on Dec. 2, 2013 as 70% to Shino’s
company, AAMG, and 30% to Lu’s Starry. Shino Decl., ¶9, Ex. A, art. 1.  The Shareholder Agreement requires Lu to
obtain Shino’s consent for any sale of shares and grants her a right of first
refusal.  See Ex. A, arts. 2, 5, §3.
Transfers made in violation of the agreement “ha[ve] no effect.” Ex. A, art. 5.
 Further, a return of capital, or a
failure to maintain the listed ownership percentage, will result in a
recalculation of an owner’s percentage interest.  Ex. A, art. 1, §§9-10.  The Shareholder Agreement supersedes any
prior agreement between the parties.  Ex.
A, Art. 10, §4.  As a result, Lu’s stock
transfer violates the Shareholder Agreement. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 1-2, 4, 12-13.  
Shino’s entire position is dependent upon the authenticity
of Lu’s signature on the Shareholder Agreement and the August 25, 2014
Starbridge Group meeting minutes, as well as the authenticity of the August 22,
2013 and August 26, 2014 Starbridge LLC resolutions signed only by
Jianhau.  If they are not genuine, then
the ownership percentages, sale restrictions, and return of capital provisions
have no relevance.  The documents are not
genuine.
Yan’s presents evidence that Lu’s signature on the
Shareholder Agreement is a forgery.  Chrisman
opined that the differences between the known signature samples and the questioned
signatures on the Shareholder Agreement are significant enough to provide a
strong probability that Lu did not sign it. 
Chrisman Decl., ¶¶ 17(ii)-(viii), Ex. E. 
She opined that the differences between the known signature samples and
the questioned signatures on the 2021 Authorizing Resolution are significant
enough to provide a strong probability that Lu did not sign it.  Chrisman Decl., ¶¶ 17(ii)-(viii), Ex. E.  Finally, Chrisman opined that Lu’s signature
on the August 25, 2014 Starbridge Group meeting minutes is identical to the
2019 Authorizing Resolution.  Chrisman
Decl., ¶¶ 8, 17(i), Exs. C, E.  This
raises the possibility that the questioned signature was transferred from the
known signature or vice versa, or both signatures are transfers from a third,
unknown document.  Chrisman Decl., ¶4(b).

Shino’s expert Kuhn could not form an opinion as to the August
25, 2014 minutes, but he agreed with Chrisman that the signature is identical
to K-10.  Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  Thus, he implicitly agreed that the
questioned signature on the minutes could have been transferred.  He found the Shareholder Agreement signature
comparison inconclusive because he had only three known contemporaneous writing
samples.  Kuhn Decl., ¶11.  He finally opined that the signature on the March
15, 2021 Authorizing Resolution was probably prepared by the same person who
signed the known document samples.  Kuhn
Decl., ¶11.  This is Kuhn’s only serious
contradiction with  Chrisman’s opinion
but fails to explain the circumstantial evidence that the 2021 Authorizing
Resolution was recently created.  See n.
14 ante.
There are other reasons to believe that Yan and Chrisman are
correct.   As Yan points out (Opp. at
14-16), Jianhau has made inconsistent statements in his testimony and
declarations.  
Jianhau stated in his December 2021 declaration that
Starbridge Group’s interest in Starbridge LLC had been reduced from 60% to 45%
in 2014.  Holder
Decl., Ex. 28, ¶¶ 23, 24.  But he
certified to Cathay Bank in 2019 that Starbridge Group’s voting interest had
increased from 60% to 100% in 2018.  Holder
Decl., Ex. 34, p. RESPS 4090.  Likewise,
the K-1s filed by Starbridge LLC through 2020 show that Starbridge Group has a
60% interest in Starbridge LLC.  Ex. 35.  
Jianhau stated in his December 2021 declaration that a March
2013 operating agreement controlled Starbridge LLC.  Ex. 28, ¶¶ 8, 9.  But he certified to Cathay Bank in 2019 that Starbridge
LLC’s 2012 Operating Agreement, as amended on March 14, 2019, was in full force
and effect.  Ex. 34
p. RESPS 4014-16.  No mention was made of
the 2013 Operating Agreement.  
Jianhau stated in his December 2021 declaration that Morgan is
the manager of Starbridge LLC, and that it had been from inception.  Ex. 28, ¶14. 
Yet, the 2019 submission to Cathay Bank reflects an amendment that Starbridge
Group is the new manager of Starbridge LLC. 
Ex. 34 p.  RESPS 4091. 
Starbridge LLC’s K-1’s back to 2014 also show Starbridge Group as the
manager.  Ex. 35. Jianhau has signed numerous loan
modification agreements with Cathay Bank, both before and after his December
2021 declaration, and he signed all of them on behalf of Starbridge Group as
the manager of Starbridge LLC.  Exs. 36, 37.[16]
The documents relied on by Shino -- the Shareholder
Agreement, the August 25, 2014 Starbridge Group meeting minutes, and the August
22, 2013 and August 26, 2014 Starbridge LLC resolutions – are not genuine.  
 
E. Conclusion
Jianhua has actively managed the Hotel since 2013, including
navigating it through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He and his wife also personally guaranteed a $15 million construction
loan to renovate the Hotel up to brand standards for affiliation as a Crowne
Plaza.  In contrast, Lu and Rongji were
passive owners who were uninvolved in the Hotel’s operation.  Thus, Jianhua may reasonably feel that it is
his Hotel.  
But it is not.  Lu and
Rongji funded the purchase, and Lu was the sole owner of Starbridge Group and
60% owner of Starbridge LLC and the Hotel until he sold his interest to Yan.  Jianhua took advantage of the absence of Lu
and Rongji to concoct fictitious documentation that Shino owns the vast
percentage of Starbridge Group.  This was
false.  Yan is the 100% owner of
Starbridge Group and Shino had no right to vote at the October 2021 meeting.  
Shino’s section 709 claim is denied.  Yan’s counsel is ordered to prepare a
proposed judgment, serve it on Shino’s counsel for approval as to form, wait
ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are
objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration
stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for November 7,
2023 at 1:30 p.m.
