## English Summary

The judge is considering a case where Shino and Yan are disputing ownership of Starbridge LLC.  Shino alleges that Yan fraudulently obtained ownership. Yan defends her ownership and argues that Shino's claims are baseless.

The judge has ruled on several evidentiary matters and motions, overruling some objections and granting motions to strike certain arguments. The judge finds Jianhua, who appears to be associated with Shino, to have engaged in suspicious activities related to the case, including manipulating documents and potentially forging signatures. 

The judge notes inconsistencies in Jianhua's actions and statements, particularly concerning the authorized shares of Starbridge Group. The judge also finds the timing of recent filings by Jianhua related to the authorized shares to be suspicious.

Ultimately, the judge will decide the case based on the evidence presented by both sides and the applicable law.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Shino's request for judicial notice of various documents and filings. The judge has ruled on the parties' written evidentiary objections, overruling some and sustaining others. The court has stricken Shino's discussion of the 2012 and 2013 Operating Agreements of Starbridge LLC, which were raised for the first time in reply.

The judge finds that Yan's purchase of all 1,000 shares in Starbridge Group is relevant to the case. The court notes that Jianhua attempted to increase Starbridge Group's authorization to issue stock, but this was done in a way that was ineffective under Nevada law.

The judge also finds that Yan's claims about Jianhua's actions are not helpful. The court notes that Jianhua attempted to paper over the 2019 authorization by sending Cathay Bank a new version of the same document, which suggests that no new Yu signature was obtained for the 2021 authorization.

Finally, the judge finds that the Certificate of Amendment filed with the Nevada Secretary of State is relevant to the case, as it increases Starbridge Group's authorization to issue 20,000 shares. The court notes that this fact suggests that Jianhua attempted to increase Starbridge Group's authorization in a way that was ineffective under Nevada law.

```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Shino's request for judicial notice of various documents, including judgments and complaints from other cases. The judge has also ruled on the parties' written evidentiary objections, overruling some and sustaining others. The judge has found that certain statements made by Jianhua and Yan are admissible as party admissions or authorized admissions. The judge has also found that certain evidence, including WeChat texts between Yan and Lu, is admissible to show the bona fides of Yan's purchase from Lu. The judge has rejected Shino's argument that the 2012 and 2013 Operating Agreements of Starbridge LLC are relevant to the case, as they were raised for the first time in reply. The judge has also found that Yan's argument that Jianhua's attempt to increase Starbridge Group's authorization to issue stock is a sham is persuasive. The judge has concluded that the reduction of Starbridge Group's interest in Starbridge LLC makes no sense and that the court need not subscribe to Yan's theory that the reduction was invented by the Jins to avoid the preliminary injunction in the Starbridge Lawsuit. Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the court is skeptical of Shino's arguments and is inclined to believe that Jianhua and Yan have engaged in questionable behavior.
