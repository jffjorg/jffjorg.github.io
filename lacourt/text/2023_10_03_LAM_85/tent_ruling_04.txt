[2] The
court has ruled on the parties’ written evidentiary objections, which were sometimes
overruled pursuant to Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. East Bay Union of
Machinists, Local 1304, Seelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, (1964) 227
Cal.App.2d 675, 712 (court may overruled objection if any portion of objected
to material is admissible).  The parties’
objections to of expert declarations of William R. Ackerman (“Ackerman”), Alan
G. Goedde (“Goedde”), and Beth Chrisman (“Chrisman”) were overruled on the
ground that the evidence is foundational facts assumed by the expert for his or
her opinion which must be independently proved by other evidence.  See Evid. Code §802; People v.
Sanchez, (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 670-71.
Yan’s motion to strike the Serafin declaration is granted.  The motion is denied for the Pakshu Chan and Mona
Zhang declarations (although almost all the objections to these declarations
were sustained).  The motion to strike is
granted for the reply’s argument about the 2012 and 2013 Starbridge LLC
operating agreements.  See Reply
at 2-3.  New evidence/issues raised for
the first time in a reply brief are not properly presented to a trial court and
may be disregarded.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc.,
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.


[3]
Exhibit 6 does not contain this evidence.


[4] He
is referred to in the evidence as both “Longji” and “Rongji”.  


[5] During
the pendency of this lawsuit, on September 12, 2023, Shino filed a Certificate
of Amendment in Nevada that amended the class of Starbridge Group stock to
include 20,000 shares.  Holder Decl., ¶9,
Ex. 15.  She attached a corporate
resolution that authorized the corporation to issue 20,000 shares of common
stock, with signatures from Shino and Jianhua dated January 10, 2023.  Ex. 15. 



[6]
The 2012 and 2013 Operating Agreements of Starbridge LLC are not in issue in
this case; the court has stricken Shino’s discussion of these battling
agreements because it was raised for the first time in reply.


[7] Hotel
employee Zhang states that Yan is a habitual liar.  Zhang Decl., ¶8.  Shino argues that Yan and her co-conspirators
have left a trail of outstanding default judgments against them for fraud. See
RJN Exs. A, C, D.  Pet. Op. Br. at
12.  Yan responds that these cases have
nothing to do with this dispute.  Yan
Decl., ¶13.  She also argues that Jianhua
has plenty to answer for himself as he was sued for wage theft and pervasive
sexual harassment at a karaoke bar he owned (Holder
Decl., ¶28, Ex. 42), and sued or fraud in a real estate transaction.  Holder
Decl., ¶ 29, Ex. 43.  Opp. at 18, n.
8.  The court does not find these
character assassinations to be helpful.


[8]
Rongji’s statements to Bo Chen that he funded the Hotel purchase is hearsay and
has been received only to explain Bo Chen’s course of action.  Evid. Code §1250.


[9]
Jianhua’s statements to Bo Chen are party admissions/authorized
admissions.  Evid. Code §§ 1220, 1222.


[10] When
the funds were transferred into Starbridge LLC’s account, $7 million came from
AAMG on December 13, 2012, $3.5 million came from AAMG on December 20, 2012,
and $6 million from a Pt. VicValuta account as well as a Skylight Holdings
Limited account.  Holder Decl., ¶27, Ex.
41.


[11] Shino
points to WeChat texts between Yan and Yu after Jianhau presented evidence of Yu’s
$3 million capital return for the preliminary injunction hearing in the
Starbridge Lawsuit.  On November 17,
2021, Defendant Yan (her English name is Charlene) texted Lu for an
explanation. Sargent Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 6561, 6565, 6543-45, 6567-71, 6573-76.  Lu admitted to Yan that he received the $3
million as a return of investment and denied that it adjusted his share ratio.  Ex. 3, p. 6569. Although Yan requested evidence,
Lu did not provide it.  Ex. 3, p. 6543; Ex.
2 (Yan Depo.), pp. 37, 39, 41. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 5-6.  If anything,
these texts show the bona fides of Yan’s purchase from Lu.


[12]
Yan adds that a recent action by Jianhua to increase Starbridge Group’s
authorization to issue stock is a sham.  Starbridge
Group is a Nevada corporation.  Holder Decl., ¶4.  Nevada law is clear that corporations must
state “the number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue” in their
articles of incorporation.  Nev. Rev. Stat. §78.035.  To modify the number of issued shares, the
corporation must file with the Secretary of State either a “Certificate of
Amendment” or a “Certificate of Change.” 
Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 78.390,
78.209.  Any purported change in the
number of shares is ineffective absent agreement of the board of directors and
a certificate filed with the state.  See
Nev. Rev. Stat.  §§ 78.209, 78.380, 78.390.  Yet, Starbridge Group’s Articles of
Incorporation, signed by Jianhua in 2013, recite that the corporation is only authorized
to issue 1,000 shares.  Holder Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  The 2013 stock certificate shows that Starry
holds these 1000 shares.   In a recent June 2023 submission to Cathay Bank,
Jianhua confirmed that Starbridge Group’s Articles of Incorporation remained
operative and unchanged.  Holder Decl, ¶¶ 5, Exs. 8, 9.  Opp. at 7. 

Yan contends that this fact is “devastating” to Shino’s case, because Yan
purchased all 1,000 shares in Starbridge Group. 
Yan Decl., ¶5, Ex. 4.  Apparently, the Jins just realized this
problem because, on September 12, 2023, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with
the Nevada Secretary of State reciting that Starbridge Group now has 20,000
shares.  Holder
Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 15.  The Certificate of
Amendment attaches a copy of a Corporate Resolution for Starbridge Group, dated
January 10, 2023, stating that the company is authorized to issue 20,000
shares.  Id.  Yan argues that the new filing and supporting
resolution are clearly a sham.  Opp. at
7-8.


[13] Yan
asked Lu in their WeChat text messages about Shino’s assertions that $3 million
had been returned to Lu reducing his ownership in Starbridge Group.  Sargent Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3, p. 6561.  Lu admitted to the receipt of $3 million but
stated that it was not for selling shares. 
Sargent Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3, p. 65.  


[14] Yan
submits that the purported reduction of Starbridge Group’s interest to 45% was
invented by the Jins to avoid the preliminary injunction in the Starbridge
Lawsuit, which relied on Starbridge Group having a majority position in Starbridge
LLC.  Opp. at 14, n. 6.  The court need not subscribe to this theory
to conclude that the reduction of Starbridge Group’s interest in Starbridge LLC
makes no sense.


[15] Yan
argues that Jianhua attempted to paper over the 2019 authorization by sending
Cathay Bank a new version of the same document dated March 15, 2021, this time
signed by Shino as “Majority Shareholder” and by Lu as “Stockholder”.   Holder Decl., ¶16, Ex. 27.  The 2021 authorization reflects the same Cox
document identification and version number as the 2019 document.  This means that Jianhua simply took the
document and changed its contents.  Compare Holder Decl., Ex. 24 and Ex.
27 (both referring to 104557551v1).  
This fact suggests that no new Yu signature was obtained for
the 2021 authorization, which is supported by Chrisman’s opinion that there is
a strong probability that Lu’s signature on the document was forged.  Chrisman
Decl., ¶¶ 4, 17, Ex. E.  Opp. at 10.


[16]
Yan finds this troubling because her primary claim in the Starbridge Lawsuit
was to oust Morgan as the manager and yet Morgan already had been removed as
manager.  Yan contends that Jianhau willfully
hid this key fact from the court.  Yan also
notes that, as with the 2019 Authorizing Resolution stating that Starry was the
sole shareholder in Starbridge Group, Jianhua tried to paper the admissions in his
certifications to Cathay Bank, characterizing them as mistakes and submitting
new certifications to Cathay Bank stating that the 2013 Operating Agreement
controlled in 2019 and that Morgan was always the manager.  Ex. 38. 
Opp. at 15-16.
