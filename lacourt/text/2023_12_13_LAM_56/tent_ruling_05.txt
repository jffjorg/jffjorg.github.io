  CASE NO.: 22STCV27147
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO DEEM
  REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
 
Date: 
  December 13, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Century Towers Association (“Moving Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of the Fair Employment
and Housing Act (“FEHA”); (4) violation of Civil Code section 789.3; (5) breach
of quiet enjoyment; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7)
negligence; and (8) malicious prosecution—wrongful use of civil proceeding.
 
Moving
Defendant filed a motion for an order deeming its Requests for Admissions, Set
Three (the “RFAs”) served on Plaintiff to be admitted (the “Motion”).  The Motion also seeks monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $1,361.65.   
 
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 2033.280, subdivision (a), where requests for admission are
propounded on a party and that party fails to serve a timely response, that
party waives any objection to the requests. 
(CCP § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.  (CCP §
2033.280, subd. (b).)  The court must
grant a motion to have admission requests deemed admitted where responses have
not been served prior to the hearing, or, if such responses were served, they
were not in substantial compliance with CCP section 2033.220.  (CCP
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
Moving
Defendant served the RFAs on Plaintiff on July 7, 2023.  (Declaration of Marlin Y. Gillespie
(“Gillespie Decl.”) ¶ 3, Exhibit A.)  As
of the filing of the motion, Plaintiff had not responded to the RFAs.  (See Gillespie Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  
 
As
it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  The Court orders Plaintiff to provide
verified, complete, and code-compliant responses, without objection, to Moving
Defendant’s RFAs within 20 days of the date of this order.
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Moving Defendant requests $1,361.65 in sanctions in
connection with the Motion.  This amount
represents: (1) three hours preparing the moving papers at an hourly rate of
$260 per hour; (2) an anticipated two hours preparing reply papers and
attending the hearing; and (3) filing fees in the amount of $61.65.  (Gillespie Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.)  
 
The
Court exercises its discretion and GRANTS Moving Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions in the reasonable amount of $841.50, which represents three
hours preparing the Motion at a rate of $260 per hour and $61.65 in filing
fees.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt
Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.) 
Plaintiff and counsel are ordered to pay this amount within 20 days of
the date of this order.  
 
 
 
             Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
