Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by COPA, LLC, the defendant. The plaintiff, FOUNTAIN AVENUE TOWNLOFTS, INC., alleges that COPA, LLC oversaw the development and construction of a condominium development (the Property) and that numerous defects in the construction have caused damages. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations (Civil Code section 941) since the Notice of Completion was filed more than 10 years before the complaint was filed. The Court finds that the defendant has not carried its burden to demonstrate that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations and therefore denies the motion.
