Time: 8:30 a.m.

MOVING PARTY: Defendant 91 Enterprise, LLC (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The Court has considered the moving and opposition papers.  No reply papers were filed.  Any reply papers were required to have been
filed and served at least five court days before the hearing under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
employment relationship.  The currently
operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) failure to pay
minimum wage; (2) failure to pay overtime compensation; (3) failure to pay
wages for missed rest periods; (4) failure to pay wages when due; (5) failure
to provide accurate and itemized wage statements; and (6) violation of the
Unfair Competition Law.  
 
            On
September 14, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to deem Requests for
Admissions (“RFAs”) that were propounded on Plaintiff admitted (the
“Motion”).  The Motion also requests
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel for Plaintiff’s failure to
submit timely responses to the RFPs.  
             
DISCUSSION
Under CCP section
2033.280, subdivision (a), where requests for admission are propounded on a
party and that party fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any
objection to the requests.  (CCP §
2033.280, subd. (a).)  The requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.  (CCP § 2033.280,
subd. (b).)  The court must grant a
motion to have admission requests deemed admitted where responses have not been
served prior to the hearing, or, if such responses were served, they were not
in substantial compliance with CCP section 2033.220.  (CCP
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion.  (Id.;
see Stover v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th
19, 31-32.)  Unverified responses are
tantamount to no responses at all.  (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
 
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendant provides evidence that it
propounded the RFAs on July 31, 2023. 
(Declaration of Benjamin Davidson (“Davidson Decl.”) ¶ 3, Exhibit
1.)  On the day the responses were due,
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel requested that the deadline be extended
through September 6, 2023, which Moving Defendant confirmed.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 5-8,
Exhibit 2.)  On September 6, 2023, Moving
Defendant confirmed Plaintiff’s counsel’s request to further extend the
deadline to submit responses until September 8, 2023 due to illness.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶ 9, Exhibit
2.)  At the end of the business day on
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email stating that she tested
positive for the COVID-19 virus and requested an extension through September
12, 2023.  (See Davidson Decl.,
Exhibit 3.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel
responded that a third extension would not be granted.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, Exhibit
4.)  
 
In support of the opposition (the “Opposition”), Plaintiff provides
evidence that responses to the RFAs were provided on September 19, 2023, and
that amended responses were provided on November 30, 2023.  (Declaration of Charmaine L. Huntting
("Huntting Decl.") ¶¶ 9, 13, Exhibits 3, 6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel went to the emergency
room to obtain medical care for her illness on September 10, 2023, and was too
sick to work on September 12 through September 13, 2023.  (Huntting Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6.)  
 
As it is undisputed that
Plaintiff served RFA responses by the time of the hearing, the Motion is
MOOT.  In addition, the Court declines to
impose monetary sanctions.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
