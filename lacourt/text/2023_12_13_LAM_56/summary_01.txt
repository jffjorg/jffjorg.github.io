And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to permit pretrial financial discovery in a case between Lou Ayuso, the plaintiff, and ITT Aerospace Controls LLC, Electrofilm Manufacturing Company LLC, ITT Inc., and Hugo Larios, the defendants. The plaintiff is seeking punitive damages for alleged employment-related violations under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a substantial probability of prevailing on its punitive damages claims. The judge noted that the plaintiff's argument that a prior determination of triable issues of material fact is equivalent to a showing of substantial probability is unpersuasive. The judge's ruling is based on California Civil Code sections 3295 and 3294, which regulate pretrial discovery and punitive damages, respectively. The judge has ordered the parties to submit their arguments on the tentative ruling and has set a hearing date for December 13, 2023.
