And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to deem Requests for Admissions ("RFAs") admitted and to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff. The defendant, 91 Enterprise, LLC, filed the motion on September 14, 2023, and the plaintiff, Lavi Ben Hamo, filed an opposition. The court finds that the plaintiff served responses to the RFAs by the time of the hearing, making the motion moot. Additionally, the court declines to impose monetary sanctions. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") section 2033.280, which requires the court to grant a motion to deem RFAs admitted where responses have not been served prior to the hearing. The court also cites Stover v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19 and Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632 in support of its decision.
