[1] Petitioner cites an order from K8 Investor Holdings,
LLC v. City of Baldwin Park, et al., Case Number 23-2428-KK-PVCs denying Julia
Sylva’s anti-SLAPP motion.  That case
involved different claims, specifically negligence, intentional interference
with contractual and prospective economic relationships, fraud, and declaratory
relief.  Moreover, it appears that Sylva
engaged in different conduct in that case. 
Therefore, this order is not beneficial to Petitioner.
