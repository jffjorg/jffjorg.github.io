Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has not made a tentative ruling on the petition. The case involves an officer-involved shooting where two LAPD officers, Christian Williams and Jorge Trejo, used lethal force against a suspect, Ruiz, who was holding a 15-inch knife and had a self-inflicted laceration to his throat. The suspect died as a result of the shooting.

The judge notes that the case is complex and that there are conflicting opinions about whether the officers used excessive force. The judge acknowledges that the officers did not discuss a tactical plan before arriving on the scene and did not consider less-than-lethal responses to Ruiz. However, the judge also notes that the officers were confronted with a mentally ill suspect who was acting irrationally and that the situation was fluid and dynamic.

The judge will consider the evidence presented and will make a final ruling on the petition, which will determine whether the officers' use of force was appropriate and whether they followed department policy.
