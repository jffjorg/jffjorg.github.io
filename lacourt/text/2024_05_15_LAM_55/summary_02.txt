Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has overruled the demurrers filed by the Mandelbaum Defendants and denied their motions to strike. The judge found that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) sufficiently alleges each claim, including elder abuse, negligence, willful misconduct, and wrongful death. The FAC alleges that each Mandelbaum Defendant is a caregiver and custodian, which is sufficient to support the claims. The judge also found that the FAC adequately pleads special damages, including medical expenses. The judge declined to strike certain allegedly conclusory allegations, finding that the full context of the pleadings contains sufficient facts to support the conclusions. The judge set the case for trial and ordered the parties to file their answers within 20 days.
