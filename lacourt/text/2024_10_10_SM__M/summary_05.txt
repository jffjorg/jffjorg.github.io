And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to strike the punitive damages claim in the cross-complaint. The cross-complaint alleges that the defendant, Ahmed Altuwaijri, engaged in intentional or malicious conduct by failing to repair plumbing issues in the property, rendering it uninhabitable. However, the judge finds that the cross-complaint fails to allege sufficient facts showing despicable or intentional conduct required to recover punitive damages. The judge orders the cross-complainant to file an amended cross-complaint within 20 days to provide specific facts to support the punitive damages claim.
