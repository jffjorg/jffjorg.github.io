MOTION:                  Motion to be Relieved 
HEARING
DATE:   10/10/2024

 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may order that an
attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or
final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice
from one to the other. (CCP § 284(2).) The attorney seeking to withdraw must
take “reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights
of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for
employment of other counsel.” (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, 3-700(A)(2). See,
e.g., Vann v. Shilleh (1975) [holding withdrawal prejudicial where
attorney withdraw from the representation of defendant on the Friday before
trial began the following Monday].) “The determination whether to grant or deny
a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1128, 1133.)  
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (CRC 3.1362(a),
(c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties
that have appeared in the case.” (CRC, 3.1362(d).) When a client is
served by mail, the attorney’s declaration must indicate that the client’s
address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.)
If the attorney is unable to confirm the client’s current address, the
declaration must state the reasonable efforts made within the last 30 days to
obtain the client’s current address. (Id.) 
 
Additionally, the declaration “must
state in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney client relationship why” a motion is brought instead of filing a
substitution of attorney. (CRC, 3.1362(c).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Chase P. Nielsen moves to be
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff David McNeary. Counsel submits all
the mandatory forms. Counsel states that an irreparable breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship has occurred. Counsel served his client by email and
text. Counsel has been unable to confirm a more-current address after mailing
the motion papers to the client’s last known address with return receipt
requested, calling/texting the client’s last known phone number, and conducting
online searches. The client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal since
there is no set trial date and no pending dispositive motions. Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED. Counsel must include any hearing dates set at
the instant CMC on the MC-053 order form. The order is effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of the order on the client. Until then,
counsel remains counsel of record.
