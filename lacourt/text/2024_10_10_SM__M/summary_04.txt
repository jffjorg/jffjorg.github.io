Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to seal portions of a reply and a declaration in support of a motion to compel further responses to a special interrogatory. The defendant, Passes Inc., moves to seal the requested portions to protect trade secret information. The judge finds that the parties' protective order requires confidentiality, and that public disclosure of the redacted portions could cause competitive harm to the plaintiff. The judge grants the motion, finding that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest in protecting the trade secret information. The judge requires the defendant to lodge the sealed record with the court and to refrain from filing anything that would disclose the sealed matter.
