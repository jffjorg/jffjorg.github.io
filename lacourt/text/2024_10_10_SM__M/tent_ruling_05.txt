CASE NO.:                   24SMCV01287
MOTION:                  Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   10/10/2024
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
  
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant 807 Huntley LLC
moves to strike the claim for punitive damages alleged in the Cross-Complainant
by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ahmed Altuwaijri. 
 
To recover punitive
damages for malice or oppression, plaintiff must plead facts supporting an
intent to harm or “despicable conduct” carried about with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. (Civ. Code §3294(c).) Despicable
is a powerful term used to describe circumstances that are “base,” “vile,” or
“contemptible.” (Coll. Hosp., supra, 9 Cal.4th 704, 726.) The statute
“plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the plaintiff, “malice”
requires more than a “willful and conscious” disregard of the plaintiffs'
interests. The additional component of “despicable conduct” must be found.” (Ibid.) This
includes only truly egregious behavior. (See, e.g., Angie M. v. Superior
Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1221—1222 [vile, base, or
contemptible conduct found where doctor engaged in sexual intercourse with
minor, plying the minor with drugs and alcohol, and paying the minor to procure
illegal substances for him]; Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 1270, 1280 [finding despicable conduct when a manufacturer “fully
understood that asbestos dust endangered workers, but did not issue warnings to
customers” until much later and using the products in ways that generated
considerable asbestos dust].) 
 
Cross-Complainant alleges that he is the
tenant of the real property commonly known as 807 Huntley Drive, #807, West
Hollywood, California, 90068, which is owned by Cross-Defendant. (CC ¶¶ 1-2.) Courts
have recognized that a tenant may recover punitive damages against a landlord
for wrongful eviction, trespass, invasion of privacy, and intentional
infliction of emotional distress, among other theories. (Spinks v. Equity
Residential Briarwood Apartments, (2009) 171 Cal. App. 4th 1004, 1055.) For
instance, a landlord’s intentional or malicious failure
to repair can support a claim for punitive damages. (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920.) In¿Stoiber,
the plaintiff complained of numerous uninhabitable conditions that she repeatedly
notified the landlord of, that the landlord had actual and full knowledge of
the conditions, but the landlord intentionally made no effort to repair the dangerous
conditions. (Id. 912-913, 920.) The dangerous conditions included a heavy
cockroach infestation, broken interior walls, broken deteriorated flooring on
front porch, falling ceiling, fused¿electrical wiring, lack of proper plumbing
connection to sewage system in bathroom, sewage under bathroom floor, leaking
roof, broken windows, and fire hazard. (Ibid.) Despite the repeated notice,
the defendants knowingly, intentionally and willfully failed to correct the
defective conditions by not even attempting to repair the defects, except on
one occasion where they sent a plumber in response to a complaint regarding the
toilet. (Id.¿at 913, 921.) Furthermore, a nuisance cause of action also
could support a claim for exemplary damages if “intentional”. (Id., at 920.)
 
The
Cross-Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts showing despicable or
intentional conduct required to recover punitive damages. The Cross-Complaint only
provides generalized allegations that during
the tenancy, Cross-Complainant discovered plumbing issues on the Property, including
water leaks and clogged pipes, which rendered the Property untenantable and
uninhabitable. (CC ¶ 5.) Despite notice of the condition, Cross-Defendants allegedly
failed to “promptly” remedy the situation. (Id.) This failure to “promptly”
remedy vague plumbing leaks does not show Cross-Defendant’s intended to harm
Cross-Complainant, or any “despicable” conduct warranting punitive damages. For
example, there are no facts showing the dangerous nature of the plumbing issues,
such that the court may conclude that Cross-Defendant has willfully
and consciously disregarded the tenant’s rights and safety. Indeed, there are no specific facts in support of the
generic allegations of malice (CC ¶ 25)
or of tenant harassment (¶ 27). As such, further facts must be pled to
support the punitive damages claim.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED with leave to amend.  Cross-Complainant has 20 days to file any
amended cross-complaint.
