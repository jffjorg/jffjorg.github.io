And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Richard A. Rodgers, Esq., who represents Defendant Denise Kurtzer in a case brought by the 1239 23rd Street Homeowners Association. The judge found that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred and that Defendant refuses to retain new counsel or sign a substitution form. Despite giving Defendant sufficient time to retain new counsel, Defendant has refused to do so. Counsel has filed a substantive opposition to the motion, which has placed Defendant in a better position and mitigated the potential prejudice. The judge is concerned that Defendant may be prejudiced by the withdrawal of counsel, but this prejudice is caused by Defendant's own conduct. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion, allowing counsel to withdraw as counsel of record.
