MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   10/10/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Automobili Lamborghini America, LLC (“ALA”) moves to compel
responses from Plaintiff Adamyan Akop as to ALA’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Inspection Demand. Defendant also
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,680.00, jointly and severally,
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, Mgdesyan Law Firm.
 
On April 24, 2024, ALA served the subject discovery on Plaintiff,
including the interrogatories and requests for production of documents. (Kim
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) The last day to serve responses was June 12, 2024. (Kim
Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the discovery. (Kim
Decl. ¶ 3.) On July 31, 2024, ALA requested that Plaintiff provide responses to
the subject discovery without objections by August 9, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶ 4, Ex.
B.) To date, Plaintiff has yet to respond. (Id. at ¶ 5) Defendant thereby
demonstrates that Plaintiff failed to serve any responses to the
Interrogatories and Document Requests. Therefore, initial responses are
required.
 
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED. The requests for sanctions are granted in the total
amount of $1,740.00, inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff and counsel of
record. Sanctions are to be paid to Defendant’s counsel of record within 30
days.
