And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Chase P. Nielsen's motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff David McNeary. The motion is granted due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Despite efforts to confirm the client's current address, Nielsen has been unable to do so. Since there is no set trial date and no pending dispositive motions, the withdrawal is unlikely to prejudice the client. The judge notes that the attorney seeking to withdraw must take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's rights, including giving due notice and allowing time for employment of other counsel.
