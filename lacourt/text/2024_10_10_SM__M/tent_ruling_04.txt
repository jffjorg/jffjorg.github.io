Legal
Standard
 
The sealing of trial court records is governed by California Rules of
Court, (“CRC”) rules 2.550 and 2.551. (Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 68.) Pleadings, motions, discovery documents, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties—a
prior court order must be obtained. (CRC, Rule 2.551(a); see H.B. Fuller Co.
v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 888.)
 
To seal a record, the following
requirements are imposed: (1) the party must file a motion or
application for an order sealing the record, which must be accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing; (2) the
party must serve a copy of the motion on all parties who have appeared in the
case; and (3) the party requesting that a record be filed under seal
must lodge it with the court when the motion or application is made unless the
record has previously been lodged. (CRC, Rule 2.551(b).)  
 
The Court must make the following
express factual findings in order to seal records: (1) an overriding interest exists that overcomes the
right of public access to the record; (2) the overriding interest supports
sealing the records; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest. (CRC, Rule 2.550(d).) These findings embody constitutional
requirements for a request to seal court records, protecting the First
Amendment right of public access to civil trials. (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV),
Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)

 
An order sealing the record must
specifically state the facts that support the findings and direct the sealing
of only those pages and documents or, if reasonably practicable, portions of
those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to be placed
under seal, and all other portions must be included in the public
file. (CRC, rule 2.550(e).)  Once sealed, a record can only be unsealed by order of court. (CRC, Rule
2.551(h)(1).) So long as it remains under seal, all parties must refrain from
filing anything not under seal that would disclose the sealed matter. (Id.,
Rule 2.551(c).) If a party files a new document referring to sealed matter, it
must submit an unredacted version of the document under seal and a redacted one
for the public record. (Id., Rule 2.551(b)(5).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant Passes, Inc. moves to
seal portions of Passes’ Reply in Support of Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Special Interrogatory No. 1 and portions of the Wang Declaration in Support of
Passes’ Reply in Support of Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatory No. 1. Specifically, as to the reply, Defendant seeks to seal pages
1:21-22, 3:25-26, 4:1-2, 4:13-15, 4:26-27, 5:17-22, 6:12-15, and Figures 1-4.
As to the declaration in support of the reply, Defendant seeks to seal pages
1:10-11 1:13-15 and Exhibits 2-3.
 
California Civil Code section
3426.5 provides that in an action under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act “a court
shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means,
which may include . . . sealing the records of the action[.]” (Civ. Code §
3426.5.)  Defendant explains that the
cited portions of the reply quote from confidentially marked materials under
the Parties’ protective order. Defense counsel provides a declaration that public
disclosure of the redacted portions could cause competitive harm to
Plaintiffs. (Hurley Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Defendant argues that the redactions are
narrowly tailored, only affecting the portions which quote from the
confidentially marked documents.
 
Defendant demonstrates that Plaintiff
has an overriding interest which overcomes the right of public access to its
trade secret information. There is a substantial probability of prejudice to Plaintiff’s
trade secret interests if the record is not sealed. Moreover, the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive means exist to achieve
the overriding interest, because Defendant has only redacted portions of the
motion which quote from the confidentially marked trade secret documents.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
