And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed two motions to be relieved as counsel off calendar. The motions were filed by attorney Masoud Masjedi on behalf of defendants Alibaba Express, Mediterranean Grill, Inc., and Shamdan Restaurant, Inc. The judge has ruled that the motions fail due to inadequate proof of service. Specifically, the proof of service attached to the notice of motion does not show that the motion was served on the clients at their street addresses, and a declaration in support of the motion was not filed with the court. Additionally, the judge notes that there is no indication that the clients were notified of a hearing date change from November 4 to November 5. The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning it is subject to change after further review and consideration.
