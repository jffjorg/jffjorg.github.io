SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Pedro Corrales Ochoa
and Graciela Jeanette Larios
(Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2017 Cadillac Escalade (the
Vehicle) on 2/26/20.  The Vehicle was manufactured
and/or distributed by Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant).  Plaintiffs contend that during the warranty
period, the Vehicle contained or developed defects, including electrical system
defects which resulted in symptoms affecting drivability and reliability.    Plaintiffs also contend that they have
delivered the Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on numerous occasions
for various defects and none of the repairs performed by Defendant’s authorized
repair facilities permanently repaired the defects.  Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that
Defendant knew about the claimed defects through its internal investigation and
analysis of customer complaints, warranty data, field service reports, recalls
and product evaluations as evidenced by the issuance of Technical Service
Bulletins (TSB).  Further, Plaintiffs
contend that Defendant has failed to adequately compensate them for the Vehicle
despite the ongoing defects which have not been successfully repaired within a
reasonable number of attempts.  
 
On 3/6/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Implied Warranty; and (3) Breach of the
Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.  On 4/6/23,
Defendant answered the complaint.  
 
On 7/10/23, Plaintiffs served Defendant with a Notice of
Deposition for Defendant’s PMK and requests for production of documents with
8/11/23 as the deposition date.  (Yowarski
Decl. ¶16, Ex.3).  Defendant did not
serve any objections to the notice and did not produce a PMK witness.  (Id. ¶17).
 
On 8/16/23, Plaintiffs served an Amended Deposition
Notice of Defendant’s PMK for 8/30/23, accompanied by a meet and confer
letter.  (Yowarski Decl. ¶18, Ex.4).  Again, Defendant did not serve any objections
or produce a witness.  (Id.
¶19).  
 
On 7/30/24, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter titled
“Re: Pending PMK Deposition Notices in GM Cases; CCP 2025.410 OBJECTION.”  (Yowarski Decl. ¶20, Ex.5).  On 7/31/24 and 8/2/24, Plaintiff’s counsel
sent a meet and confer letters regarding the scheduling of upcoming depositions
based on approaching trial dates and the scope of the depositions.  (Id. ¶¶21-22, Ex.6, 7).
 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendant has failed to participate
in the meet and confer efforts regarding the scheduling of the deposition.  (Yowarski Decl. ¶¶23-24).  Therefore, on 10/3/24, Plaintiffs filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order striking Defendant’s objections and
compelling (1) the testimony of Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) to
matters of  examination pertaining to
1-3, 6-24, 26-28, 30, and 33 and (2) responses and production of documents
pursuant to Plaintiffs’ associated Request for Production of Documents, numbers
1-17, at the time  of the PMK deposition.  Defendant has opposed the motion.  A reply, which was due 11/29/24, has not been
filed.  See CCP 1005(b) (reply due
at least 5 court days before the hearing date). 
  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Procedural Defects
 
Plaintiffs have failed to provide clear notice of the
relief requested in this motion.  See
CRC 3.1110(a).  In the first paragraph of
the notice, as noted above, Plaintiffs indicate that they are seeking an order
striking Defendant General Motors LLC’s objections and compelling (1) the
testimony of Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) to matters of  examination pertaining to 1-3, 6-24, 26-28,
30, and 33 and (2) responses and production of documents pursuant to
Plaintiffs’ associated Request for Production of Documents, numbers 1-17, at
the time  of the PMK deposition.  (See Motion, p.2:5-11).  However, at the end of the notice of motion,
Plaintiffs indicate that they are seeking “an order (1) striking Defendant’s
objections and compelling Defendant to produce a PMK for all matters of
examination requested in Plaintiffs’ deposition notice; (2) striking
Defendant’s objections and compelling Defendant to produce the documents
requested in Plaintiffs’ deposition notice; (3) compelling the production of
GM’s PMK and documents within 10 calendar days and (4) imposing sanctions for
Plaintiffs’ remuneration and Defendant’s gamesmanship.”  (See Motion, p.3:11-16).  
 
Additionally, Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to properly
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declaration filed in
support of the motion.  CRC
3.1110(f)(4).  Although bookmarks appear
in the document, they are not linked to the first page of each exhibit as
required.  Counsel for the parties are
warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in
matters being continued so that papers can be re-filed in compliance with the
rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.    
 
Merits
 
CCP 2025.450, the statute on which Plaintiffs base this
motion, at least in part, provides in relevant part: 
 
“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce
the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(emphasis added)
 
Although not dated, both Plaintiffs and Defendants
contend that the first response to the PMK deposition notices served in this
case in July and August of 2023 was a letter/objection sent by Defendant
on 7/30/24.  (See Yowarski
Decl. ¶20, Ex.5; Major Decl. ¶5).  The
Court notes that the correspondence sent by defense counsel to Plaintiff’s
counsel on 5/17/23 could not be in response to the deposition notices served in
this case as the deposition notices were not served until months later in July
and August of 2023.  (See Majors Decl.
¶2).  
 
Since the 7/30/24 letter/objection was sent after the
depositions were noticed to take place in 2023, the letter/objection was untimely
as objections were required to be served at least three calendar days prior to
the date for which the deposition was scheduled.  See CCP 2025.410(a).  Even if the letter/objection was timely
served in relation to the deposition notices in this case, the letter/objection
is defective in that it does not specifically address the categories and/or
document requests in the deposition notices at issue.  Similarly, the separate statements filed in
relation to this motion are defective as they do not set forth the text of each
request/inspection demand, the text of each response/objection and a statement
of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses/answers/production as to each matter in dispute.  See CRC 3.1345(c).  To the extent that Plaintiff contends Defendant
failed to respond to the production requests, a separate statement was not
required.  See CRC 3.1345(b);
(Yowarski Decl. ¶17 and Separate Statement, p.14:9-p.21:24). 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant
failed to appear for the properly noticed deposition pursuant to the notices
served in July and August of 2023 because it did not serve a timely and/or
valid objection.  CCP 2025.450(a).  However, the Court also finds that Plaintiff
failed to adequately meet and confer as required by CCP 2025.450(b)(2) before
filing this motion.  Plaintiffs seemingly
did not contact Defendant after its failure to produce a PMK for deposition in
response to the deposition notices served in July and August of 2023.  (See Yowarski Decl. ¶¶16-19).  Rather, Plaintiffs waited until after
Defendant sent its letter titled “Re: Pending PMK Deposition Notices in GM
Cases; CCP §2025.410 OBJECTIONS” approximately a year later on 7/30/24 to address
Defendant’s failure to produce the PMK witness in response to the notices
served in 2023.  (See Yowarski
Decl. ¶¶20-21).  In response to
Defendant’s 7/30/24 letter/objection, Plaintiff sent correspondence which did
not address the PMK deposition in this case. 
(See Yowarski Decl. ¶¶21-22, Ex.6-7).
 
Since both Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s counsel indicate a
willingness to meet and confer to  resolve this discovery dispute informally, the
parties must make such efforts by specifically addressing the deposition
notices at issue in this case.  (See
Yowarski Decl. ¶23; Major Decl. ¶9).     

 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs have failed to meet
their burden of establishing that they are entitled to the order requested at
this time.  Therefore, the motion is
denied.
