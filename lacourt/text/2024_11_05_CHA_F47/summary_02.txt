And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to compel deposition and production of documents filed by the Plaintiffs. The motion was filed in response to the Defendant's failure to produce a Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) witness and documents in response to deposition notices served in July and August of 2023.

The Judge found that the Defendant failed to serve a timely and/or valid objection to the deposition notices, and therefore, failed to appear for the properly noticed deposition. However, the Judge also found that the Plaintiffs failed to adequately meet and confer as required by CCP 2025.450(b)(2) before filing this motion.

The Judge noted that the Plaintiffs' counsel failed to provide clear notice of the relief requested in the motion and failed to properly electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declaration filed in support of the motion. The Judge also found that the Defendant's letter/objection sent on 7/30/24 was untimely and defective in that it did not specifically address the categories and/or document requests in the deposition notices at issue.

The Judge concluded that the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing that they are entitled to the order requested at this time, and therefore, the motion is denied. The Judge ordered the parties to make efforts to meet and confer to resolve the discovery dispute informally by specifically addressing the deposition notices at issue in this case.
