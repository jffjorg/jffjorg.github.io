Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer to the complaint filed by plaintiff CHUNG BACK against defendant AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint's allegations of breach of implied warranty of merchantability and breach of express warranty.

The court agrees with the demurrer that the complaint fails to adequately allege a cause of action for breach of implied warranty of merchantability. The complaint alleges that the vehicle developed defects and conditions affecting its safety, value, and/or use, but fails to show that the statute of limitations has not expired.

The court also agrees with the demurrer that the complaint fails to adequately allege a cause of action for breach of express warranty. The complaint alleges that the vehicle had defects and was not properly repaired by Honda's designated repair facilities, but fails to specifically plead the terms of the written warranty, including its duration, and attach a copy or plead its legal effect.

The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff 20 days to file an amended complaint that addresses the deficiencies identified in the court's ruling.
