```

The tentative ruling grants in part the defendant's motion to tax costs, taxing $33,254.10 for expert witness fees, $887,081.54 for prejudgment interest, $14,988.25 for transcripts, and $452.11 for postage. The ruling also denies the defendant's motion for a new trial, finding that the jury verdict was not excessive or against the law.
