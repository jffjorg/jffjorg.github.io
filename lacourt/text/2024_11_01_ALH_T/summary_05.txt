And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment to the defendants in a trip and fall case. The case involves a plaintiff who tripped on a sidewalk adjacent to an apartment complex containing the defendants' unit. The defendants argue that they did not owe a duty to maintain the sidewalk because they lacked ownership or control over it. The plaintiff argues that there are disputed facts as to the defendants' ownership and control of the land abutting the sidewalk.

The judge finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that they do not own the property outside of their unit and that they do not maintain the landscaping or perform any construction on the sidewalk. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to show a triable issue may exist with respect to the issue of defendants' ownership of the property outside their unit.

The judge concludes that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment because they have shown that they do not have a duty to maintain the sidewalk and that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge's ruling is based on the undisputed facts and the applicable laws, including California Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(c), California Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(p), and Civil Code § 1714(a).
