And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants TIOH's motion for summary adjudication with respect to the sixth cause of action for duty to defend, but denies it with respect to the remaining causes of action. The case involves a trip and fall incident that occurred on TIOH's property, leased to Charter Communications. TIOH has a lease agreement with Charter that requires Charter to indemnify and defend TIOH against any claims arising out of Charter's use or occupancy of the property. TIOH tendered its defense to Charter, but Charter failed to respond. TIOH argues that Charter has a contractual duty to defend against Plaintiff's claims, while Charter argues that the subrogation waiver in the lease agreement excuses its duty to defend. The Judge finds that the lease agreement requires Charter to indemnify and defend TIOH, and that the subrogation waiver does not abrogate Charter's duty to defend TIOH.
