And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The ruling states that the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant is valid and should be enforced. The judge found that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable, either procedurally or substantively.

The judge noted that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to establish procedural unconscionability, and that the arbitration agreement was presented on a standard form contract that did not deprive the plaintiff of meaningful opportunity to negotiate.

The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate substantive unconscionability, as the arbitration agreement does not create overly harsh or one-sided results. The judge noted that the arbitration agreement allows the parties to choose the arbitration organization and rules, which does not preclude the selection of neutral arbitrators.

The judge ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration and set a post-arbitration status conference for October 7, 2025.
