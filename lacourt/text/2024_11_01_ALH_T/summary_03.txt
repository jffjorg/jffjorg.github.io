And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's expert witnesses. The plaintiff, Odalys Noa, did not designate any expert witnesses after the defendants' demand for exchange of experts, but attests to serving expert designations to the defendants via U.S. mail. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's failure to designate expert witnesses and subsequent conduct are deceptive and fraudulent, and that the plaintiff should be precluded from introducing or mentioning evidence relating to expert witnesses. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to give sufficient statutory notice and that the motion is an attempt to reconsider a legal issue that has previously been considered and resolved. The judge finds that the defendants' motion is not sufficiently supported by evidence and that granting the motion would confer an unfair tactical advantage on the defendants.
