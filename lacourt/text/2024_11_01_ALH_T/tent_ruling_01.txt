  Case Number:  19STCV07450    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Tax CostsMiguel Ernesto Ortega Bautista, An Individual v. Michelle Janice Glaser Weiner, An Individual, et al.Moving Party: Defendant Michelle Janice Glaser-WeinerResponding Party: Plaintiff Miguel Ernesto Ortega BautistaTentative Ruling: GRANT in partBACKGROUND This is a car accident case in which Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging negligence against Defendant. (Declaration of Jennifer L. Russell [“Russell Decl.”] ¶ 2.) Plaintiff’s Section 998 offer was for $600,000. (Hickey Decl. at ¶ 11, Ex. 4.) On August 13, 2024 a jury returned verdict over three (3) times that of $2,045,371.00. (Id.) Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs for $1,001,622.62. After the complaint was filed on March 4, 2019, the parties engaged in written exchange of discovery. (Hickey Decl. at ¶¶ 3, 4.) Within the First Set of Request for Production of Documents (“RFPDs”), Defendant was provided with all of the medical records and medical billing for all treatment through November 2, 2019. On April 2, 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel to provide additional medical records, including medical appointments with Dr. Samimi on January 31, 2020 and March 13, 2020 as well as an April 2, 2020 letter from Dr. Samimi advising that Plaintiff was scheduled to undergo shoulder surgery on April 13, 2020. (Hickey Decl. at ¶ 7, Ex. 2.) Also attached to the email was an MRI report from a February 27, 2020 right shoulder MRI study. (Id.) Contained in the email from Plaintiff’s counsel, a CCP Sect. 998 offer for $600,000 was served as well as a time sensitive settlement demand for $500,000, which was set to expire on Friday, April 10, 2020. On April 14, 2020 (one day after the surgery was originally scheduled), defense counsel wrote a letter requesting a 30-day extension to respond to the 998 offer. (Hickey Decl. at ¶ 9, Ex. 3.) On April 23, 2020 Plaintiff’s counsel emailed defense counsel notifying that there had been a defect in the previous 998 offer, which would be withdrawn. (Id. at ¶ 11, Ex. 4.) Attached to the April 23, 2020 email was a new 998 offer set to expire on May 28, 2020.Plaintiff underwent right shoulder surgery on May 19, 2020. (Hickey Decl. at ¶ 12.) On May 26, 2020 (2 days before the expiration of Plaintiff’s 998 offer to Defendant and a week after Plaintiff’s surgery), Defendant served a §998 in the amount of $125,001. (Id. at ¶ 13, Ex. 5.)MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant objects to the entire memorandum of costs and argues the Court should strike Plaintiff’s entire memorandum of costs unless Plaintiff submits documentation of all costs. Additionally, Defendant argues the Court should tax the following specific costs: • Costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 998: The Court should tax $33,254.10 for expert witness fees (Item No. 8), and $887,081.54 for prejudgment interest (Item No. 16). Plaintiff’s Code of Civil Procedure section 998 offer is invalid. • Item No. 4: The Court should tax $11,239.04 for deposition costs. The depositions of John Weiner and Sarah Glasser Weiner were unnecessary. • Item No. 5: The Court should tax $21,903.76 for service of process fees, because the amount is excessive. • Item No. 9: The Court should tax $14,988.25 for transcripts, unless Plaintiff can show the Court ordered transcripts. • Item No. 12: The Court should tax $10,500.00 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits, because the amount is excessive. • Item No. 16: The Court should tax $1,495.87 for other costs, because they were not reasonably necessary to the litigation. Defendant specifically raises two issues with respect to the Section 998 offer: that it was not in good faith, and that the offer is invalid because it did not attach a release. (Motion to Tax, p. 5.) OPPOSITIONPlaintiff argues that the Section 998 offer was valid and enforceable, that Plaintiff had a substantial basis to reasonably believe his 998 offer was made in good faith, and is entitled to reimbursement of the full amount of each item listed in his verified cost bill. (Opposition, p. 12.)REPLYDefendant argues the Section 998 offer was in bad faith because Defendant lacked sufficient information to assess whether the offer and whether it was reasonable. (Reply, p. 2.) Defendant further argues the Section 998 offer was invalid because it lacked a release.ANALYSISI. Section 998 ValidityA Section 998 offer is not necessarily invalid if it does not attach a release. An offer that requires the offeree to release all claims between the parties in the current action is effective under Section 998 (Auburn Woods I Homeowners Association v. State Farm General Insurance Company (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 717.) However, an overbroad release that extended beyond the scope of the litigation may render an offer invalid. (Ignacio v. Caracciolo (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 81.)The Section 998 Offer here is invalid. K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, is instructive here, as the court held that Section 998 offers were invalid because they required the parties to “execute a settlement and release providing that Plaintiff will satisfy all liens, execute a Civil Code section 1542 waiver, and there will be no admission of liability,” without attaching a settlement and release agreement. (K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, 775.) Specifically, the court found the District's section 998 offer to be invalid because it did not attach the written agreement or describe the terms in any meaningful detail, leaving plaintiffs “to guess at what terms” the might be required. (Id.)  Although K.M. was decided after the subject Section 998 offer was made, is nevertheless instructive in its application of the rule established in Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1131-1132.Here, Plaintiff’s Section 998 offer specifically states: “Upon acceptance of this Offer to Compromise by Defendant, MICHELLE JANICE GLASER WEINER, Plaintiff, MIGUEL ERNESTO ORTEGA BAUTISTA, shall agree to execute a release with a waiver of all costs normally pursuant to C.C.P. 1032, et. seq. and dismiss all Defendants, including Defendant JOHN WEINER.” (Motion to Tax Costs, Exh. C.) Like in K.M., the Section 998 offer by Plaintiff here is rendered invalid not because a mere failure to attach a release, but rather because of its vague description of what the terms of the release entailed.  Specifically, Defendant would necessarily have to guess what all “normally pursuant” costs are included by the release. II. Good Faith“[T]o qualify as a good faith offer, it must be ‘realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case and must merely carry with it some reasonable prospect of acceptance.” (Arno v. Helinet Corp. (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1024 (citations omitted).) [emphasis added] In determining whether a 998 offer was made in good faith, courts must consider if the offer was “within the ‘range of reasonably possible results at trial, considering all of the information the offeror knew or reasonably should have known[,]’” and whether there was sufficient information that the “offeree knew or reasonably should have known, to assess whether the ‘offer [was] a reasonable one’, such that the offeree had a fair opportunity to intelligently evaluate the offer[.]’” (Licudine v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 918, 924-925 (citations omitted).)Here, Plaintiff obtained a verdict higher than the 998 offer of $600,000, establishing a prima facie case that the offer was reasonable and made in good faith, and the offeror is eligible for costs as specified in Sect. 998. (Barber v. Perez (2008) 166 Cal. App. 444, 450; Covert v. FCA USA, LLC (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 821; Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1484; Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 102, 121-124 (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 570, 577); Rouland v. Pacific Specialty Ins. Co. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 280, 289.) Here, a jury returned verdict over three times the value of Plaintiff’s Section 998 offer at $2,045,371, creating a presumption that Plaintiff’s 998 Offer was reasonable and made in good faith. The burden is therefore on Defendant to prove that the 998 offer was made in bad faith. To satisfy this burden, Defendants are required to specifically make a record of particular facts that were missing that were material to the validity of the 998 offer. (Barber, supra, 166 Cal. App. at 450; Arno, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at 1027.)  Here, Defendant contends and the Court agrees that it could not fairly evaluate Plaintiff’s 998 offer because Plaintiff had yet to have his shoulder surgery.  Indeed, Plaintiff’s operative 998 offer was made on April 23, 2020, but Plaintiff’s surgery was not done until May 19, 2020.  While it is true that Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that the surgery was scheduled, the surgery had not been done and the cost of the surgery had yet to be incurred.  At the time the offer was made, Plaintiff had only completed conservative treatment and Dr. Kurzweil opined that no surgery was necessary.  While it is true that Defendant did not request an extension of time to respond to the offer, the Court does find that the timing of the offer, for lack of a better term, was unfair.  Only Plaintiff knew whether he would proceed with the surgery.  Defendant could not fairly incorporate the value of the case until Plaintiff actually did have the surgery. Based on the foregoing, the Court alternatively finds the Section 998 offer to be invalid because it was not made in good faith.   III. Memorandum of CostsCCP Section 1032 provides that a prevailing party may recover their costs. (CCP § 1032.) CCP Section 1033.5(a) itemizes allowable costs; CCP Section 1033.5(b) itemizes costs that are not allowed. Subsection (c) provides that costs shall be necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount, and that items of cost not mentioned in the statute are recoverable in the court’s discretion. “If items on a memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred. [citations.] The burden then shifts to the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 693.) “In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court's first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face. ‘If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show [the costs] to be unnecessary or unreasonable.’ [citation.] (Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007 ) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29.)   “[T]he mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’ to an item, the necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on its face. [citation.] However, ‘[i]f the items appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant [citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’ ” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) The award of expert witness expenses where there is a failure to accept a pretrial 998 offer is discretionary, not automatic. (Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.4th 102, 121-24; Rouland v. Pacific Specialty Ins. Co. (2013) 220 Cal.4th 280, 289.) The expert fee recovery under Code of Civil Procedure §998 is limited to the reasonable fees and the claiming party has the burden to prove reasonableness. (Michelson v. Camp (1999) 72 Cal.4th 955, 974.)a. Expert Witness Fees & Prejudgment InterestBased on the Court’s finding that the Section 998 offer here is invalid, Defendant’s motion is proper with respect to $887,081.54 for prejudgment interest. The Court finds it is appropriate to tax $33,254.10 for expert witness fees (Item No. 8), and $887,081.54 for prejudgment interest (Item No. 16.)b. Deposition CostsIn determining the need for the deposition costs, incurred, the Court must consider the issue “from the pretrial vantage point of a litigant” who does not yet know all of the testimony or issues that will be presented at trial. (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 132.) Plaintiff explains:“As the driver of the vehicle, Plaintiff took Ms. Glasser-Weiner’s deposition and videotaped it. John Weiner was the registered owner of the vehicle that Mrs. Glasser-Weiner was driving at the time of the crash, but the extent of his involvement was not yet fully known to Plaintiff and his deposition was therefore necessary. Id. Finally, Plaintiff attempted to take the deposition of Sarah Glasser-Weiner, Defendant’s daughter, who was a passenger in the vehicle when the crash occurred. Id. The nature and extent of what Sarah Glasser-Weiner was clearly relevant to Plaintiff, particularly when Defendant was contesting liability.” (Opposition, p.17.) The Court is satisfied with Plaintiff's explanation, and finds these costs are recoverable.c. Service of Process FeesPlaintiff seeks $21,903.76 for service of process fees. Defendant argues that amount is excessive because many of the witnesses were served multiple times. The Court finds this argument unavailing, and therefore that Plaintiff may recover. It is well-established that “[t]he amount actually incurred in effecting service of process by a registered process server is specifically recoverable under section 1033.5(a)(4)(B).” (Citizens for Responsible Development v. City of West Hollywood (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 409, 506.)d. Transcript CostsPlaintiff seeks $14,988.25 for transcripts. The Court finds Defendant’s motion is appropriate with respect to this expense. “[T]he fees of the court reporter for the preparation of a daily transcript, used for the trial, are not a proper item of costs unless such transcript has been expressly ordered by the court.” (Walton v. Bank of California, Nat. Assoc. (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 527, 547-548.) The cost of transcripts is not recoverable if the transcripts were not ordered by the Court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(5).) All amounts paid by a party for transcripts not made at public expense “shall be taxed as costs in the case.” (Govt. Code § 69953.)e. Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of ExhibitsPlaintiff seeks $10,500.00 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. The Court finds that Plaintiff may recover for these costs as “reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (Cristler v. Express Messenger Systems, Inc. (2002) 171 Cal.App.4th 72, 90-91.) f. Other CostsPlaintiff seeks $452.11 for postage. Postage fees are not recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(3).)Plaintiff seeks $243.42 for attorney/messenger service. Defendant’s arguments to strike Plaintiff’s $435.00 expense for a DME observer and $365.34 for an audio transcription are unconvincing. The Court exercises its discretion to award these costs.In the opposition, Plaintiff provides sufficient documentation to support the $243.42 messenger service costs. (Hickey Decl. at ¶ 25(e), Ex. 18.)RULINGThe Court thus GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s motion to tax costs with respect to the following: $33,254.10 for expert witness fees (Item No. 8), $14,988.25 for transcripts (Item No 9), $887,081.54 for prejudgment interest (Item No. 16), and $452.11 for postage. The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion with respect to Plaintiff’s remaining costs.Motion for New TrialMiguel Ernesto Ortega Bautista, An Individual v. Michelle Janice Glaser Weiner, An Individual, et al.Moving Party: Defendant Michelle Janice Glaser WeinerResponding Party: Plaintiff Miguel Ernesto Ortega BautistaTentative Ruling: DENYBACKGROUNDThis is an automobile accident case wherein Plaintiff claims personal injuries. This matter went to trial. The jury returned a verdict for: $73,871.00 in past economic damages; $71,500.00 in future economic damages; $900,000.00 in past noneconomic damages; and $1,000,000.00 in future noneconomic damages.MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues the Court should order a new trial because the past and future noneconomic damages are excessive, as Plaintiff was able to return to his pre-accident activities. Defendant also argues a new trial is justified because of errors that took place during the trial that resulted in a miscarriage of justice, including overruling Defendant’s objection to Plaintiff’s special verdict form and sustaining Plaintiff’s objections to photos that Defendant attempted to publish for impeachment. (Motion for New Trial, p. 3.)OPPOSITIONPlaintiff argues that Defendant’s claim that the Court erred in overruling her objection to Plaintiff’s special verdict form is meritless, and moreover that Defendant failed to show any prejudice from the exclusion of improper impeachment photographs. (Opposition, p. 1-4.) REPLYDefendant maintains that the Court erred in overruling Defendant’s objection and sustaining Plaintiff’s objection, and that the jury granted excessive non-economic damages. (Reply, p. 2-3.)ANALYSISI. Evidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff submits five joint objections to the declarations of Juror No. 4 and Juror No. 5, submitted in support of Defendant’s Motion for New Trial. Plaintiff’s objections are overruled. II. Motion for New TrialA motion for new trial is a creature of statute; . . .” (Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co.¿(1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 1194, 1198.) A movant must satisfy Code of Civil Procedure §§ 657 and 659. Under Code of Civil Procedure § 657, a motion for new trial may be granted if there is any:¿[¶] 1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial. [¶] 2. Misconduct of the jury; and whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors. [¶] 3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. [¶] … [¶] 5. Excessive or inadequate damages. [¶] 6. Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law. [¶] 7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.¿¿¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 657.)¿¿¿Granting a new trial is not appropriate in this case, as Defendant fails to show an excessive verdict, that liability was improperly determined, or an error by the Court committed error.With respect to the damages award, Seffert v. Los Angeles Transit Lines (1961) 45 Cal.2d 498, is instructive here, as the Supreme Court notes that “[t]he amount to be awarded is ‘a matter on which there legitimately may be a wide difference of opinion.’” (Seffert at 508.) Seffert emphasizes that verdicts should not be disturbed “unless it is so grossly disproportionate to any reasonable limit of compensation warranted by the facts that it shocks the court’s sense of justice and raises a presumption that it was the result of passion and prejudice.” (Id.) Applying Seffert, the Court finds that the jury verdict does not approach the level of excess under the circumstances in this case to give rise to a presumption of passion or prejudice by the jury. Here, there was credible testimony that Plaintiff would suffer from limitations relating to his injury and may need ongoing medical care for the rest of his life.  Given his age and testimony about how he has moderated several activities because of his injuries, the Court does not find that the award is grossly disproportionate to any reasonable limit or shocks the Court’s sense of justice.  The two juror declarations provided by Defendant do not meaningfully undermine the validity of the jury deliberations in this case. Rather, the declarations acknowledge and establish that there was deliberation on noneconomic damages. However, the declarations do not evidence misconduct in this case.Defendant relies on Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1194 to argue that the Court held that including language from jury instructions on a special verdict form was error. (Motion for New Trial, p. 7–8.) However, Defendant here mischaracterizes the reasoning in Neal. The court in Neal reasoned that “The jury in this case was provided with correct instructions and we see no reason why they had to be repeated in detail in the special verdict form” to support the conclusion that a new trial was not justified by the special verdict form’s lack of substantive instructions where the jury had already been instructed on the relevant law. (Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1199.) Neal does not, however, indicate that special verdict forms must avoid repeating correct legal elements that appeared in prior substantive jury instructions. The Court additionally finds it did not abuse its discretion by sustaining Plaintiff’s objection to Defendant’s photographs. Evidence Code § 352 empowers courts to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will create a substantial danger of undue prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury (People v. Anderson (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 851.) The balancing of evidence under this statute is undertaken on a sliding scale, where the more substantial the probative value of the evidence, the greater the danger of one of the excluding factors must be to warrant exclusion (People v. Castaneda-Prado (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 1260.). The trial court's discretion on the issue of admitting evidence is broad. (Meeks v. Autozone, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 855.) In this case, the Court entertained oral arguments on the issue of whether Defendant’s photographs represented impeachment evidence — and ultimately ruled that they were not impeachment and therefore were inadmissible. (Hickey Decl. at ¶3, Ex.2.) The Court here exercised its discretion to exclude the photographs, as they did not meaningfully contradict prior testimony. Even still, assuming the photographs were erroneously omitted, Defendant here does not establish how the Court’s decision caused prejudice to Defendant beyond harmless error. The Court therefor finds a new trial is not justified in this case.RULINGDefendant’s motion for a new trial is DENIED.
