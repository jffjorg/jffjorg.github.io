Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court sustains the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend, dismissing the claims against the Estate of Lillian Horwitz, deceased, with prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff's amended complaint, filed on February 2, 2023, is time-barred and that the plaintiff failed to timely serve the Estate with the complaint. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims against the Estate do not relate back to the original filing date of the complaint on August 12, 2019. The court concludes that the plaintiff's conduct, including the delay in amending the complaint to name the Estate, is not in accordance with the legislative scheme and that allowing the plaintiff to proceed would be equivalent to endorsing an endless limitations period.
