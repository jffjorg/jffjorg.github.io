The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Moving Defendants, Healthcare Management Associates, Inc. and Mary Aviles, to the third amended complaint of Plaintiff, People of the State of California, ex rel., Allstate Insurance Company. The demurrer was filed on June 26, 2024, and the court has considered the opposition filed by Plaintiff on July 31, 2024, and the reply filed by Moving Defendants on August 8, 2024.

The court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a cause of action against Moving Defendants under the California False Claims Act (CIFPA) and the Unfair Competition Law. The court overrules Moving Defendants' demurrer to Plaintiff's 1st and 2nd causes of action.

The court notes that the demurrer was properly met and conferred, and that the parties were unable to resolve their dispute through meet and confer.
