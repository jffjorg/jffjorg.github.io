[1] The Court notes Defendant’s motion and the Declaration of Kirschen both mistakenly omit the date the RFP was served on Plaintiff; instead of a date, Defendant’s documents read “Error! Reference source not found.”  Defendant is advised to proofread its filings before submitting them to this Court.
