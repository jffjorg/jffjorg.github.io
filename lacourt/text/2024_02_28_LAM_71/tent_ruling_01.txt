  23STCP03931
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 28, 2024

ABP Parcel 8, LLC’s petition to confirm the arbitration award is granted.  Petitioner may separately move for a motion
to grant prejudgment interest, fees, and costs.

Petitioner ABP Parcel 8, LLC (“ABP”) (“Petitioner”)
petitions this Court to confirm the arbitration award.  (Notice of Petition, pg. 1.)
Respondent Marina Pacifica, LLC (“Marina”)
(“Respondent”) cross-petitions this Court to vacate the arbitration award.  (Cross-Petition Vacate, pg. 3.)
 
CRC Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1113(d) provides, “[e]xcept in a
summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages. In a summary judgment or summary adjudication
motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 20 pages. No reply or
closing memorandum may exceed 10 pages. The page limit does not include the
caption page, the notice of motion and motion, exhibits, declarations,
attachments, the table of contents, the table of authorities, or the proof of
service.” 
CRC, Rule 3.1113(e) provides, “[a] party may
apply to the court ex parte but with written notice of the application to the
other parties, at least 24 hours before the memorandum is due, for permission
to file a longer memorandum. The application must state reasons why the
argument cannot be made within the stated limit.” 
CRC, Rule 3.1113(g) provides, “[a] memorandum
that exceeds the page limits of these rules must be filed and considered in the
same manner as a late-filed paper.” 
Petitioner’s and Respondents’ filings greatly exceed
the 15-page maximum stated in CRC, Rule 3.1113(d).  Parties violated CRC,
Rule 3.1113(e) by failing to apply to the court ex parte with written notice of
the application to the other parties, at least 24 hours before the memorandum
is due, for permission to file a longer memorandum stating the reasons why the
argument cannot be made within the stated limit.  The Court, in its
discretion, will consider parties’ briefings up to their applicable page
limits as defined in CRC, Rule 3.1113(d).
 
Background
On or about August 30, 2021, Petitioner and
Respondent entered into a written agreement to arbitrate (“Agreement”).  (Petition ¶4(a).)  Paragraph 6 of the Agreement provides for arbitration
of disputes arising out of the Agreement. 
(Petition ¶¶4(b)-(c), Attachment 4(b).) 
The subject of arbitration is the meaning of ¶25 of two ground leases
between Petitioner, as successor ground lessor, and Respondent, as successor
ground lessee, and affirmative defenses. 
(Petition ¶5.)
Hon.
Elizabeth A. White (ret.) was appointed as arbitrator.  (Petition ¶6.)  The arbitration hearing took place from May
22, 2023, until May 31, 2023, at JAMS, 1925 Century Park E., Suite 1400, Los
Angeles, CA 90067.  (Petition ¶7.)
The
arbitration award (“Award”) was made on October 10, 2023.  (Petition ¶8(a).)  The Award requires Respondent to pay
Petitioner $2,829,433.78.  (Petition ¶8(b)(1).)  The Award also declares the meaning of ¶25 of
the ground leases, rejects Respondent’s affirmative defenses, and provides the
amount of the Award.  (Petition ¶¶8(b)(4),
(c), Attachment 8(c).)  Petitioner
alleges that a signed copy of the Award was actually served on October 10,
2023.  (Petition ¶9(b).)
On
October 25, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant petition requesting this Court
confirm the award and enter judgment according to it.  (Petition ¶10(a).)  Petitioner requests this Court award
Petitioner interest from October 10, 2023, at the statutory rate, award costs
of suit according to proof, and award Petitioner attorney fees incurred in this
action according to proof.  (Petition ¶¶10(d)(1),
(e)(2), (f)(2).)
On
November 3, 2023, Respondent filed its opposition to Petitioner’s petition as
well as a cross-petition to vacate the Award (“Cross-Petition”).  Respondent’s Cross-Petition seeks to vacate
the Award because the award was obtained by corruption, fraud, or other unfair
means; the misconduct of a neutral arbitrator substantially prejudiced
Respondent’s rights; the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority and the Award
cannot be fairly corrected; and the arbitrator unfairly refused to postpone the
hearing or to hear evidence useful to settle the dispute.  (Cross-Petition ¶¶10(c)(1)(a), (c)(1)(c)-(e).)  Further, Respondent does not request a new
arbitration hearing.  (Cross-Petition ¶10(c)(3).)  Cross-Petitioner requests an award for costs
of suit according to proof, attorney fees according to proof, and an order that
should there ever be a further arbitration rehearing, it must proceed before a
new arbitrator and that this Court issue a statement of decision on the instant
Cross-Petition.  (Cross-Petition ¶¶10(e)(2),
(f)(2), (g).)
On
December 15, 2023, Petitioner filed its reply to the Petition and opposition to
the Cross-Petition.  On January 26, 2024,
Respondent filed its reply to the Cross-Petition.
 
Legal Standard
The party seeking
judicial enforcement of a private arbitration award has the burden of proving
the award as well as the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.  (Toal v. Tardif (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
1208, 1223 [holding burden not met by submitting copy of contract with
arbitration provision signed by party’s attorney rather than by party
personally].)
The specific grounds
upon which an arbitrator’s award may be vacated are
set forth in C.C.P.
§1286.2.  Except for such grounds,
arbitration awards are
immune from judicial
review.  (See Moncharsh v. Heily &
Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for judicial review
effectuates the parties’ agreement that the award be final and also reflects
that arbitrators need not follow the law and may base their decisions on “broad
principles of justice and equity . . . paths neither marked nor traceable by
judicial review”].)  Generally, errors of
law committed by the arbitrator are not grounds for challenging the arbitration
award.  (Id. at pg. 11.)  The sufficiency of evidence of the evidence to
support the award is immaterial and courts cannot review the same.  (See Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69
Cal.2d. 686, 691.)  Courts cannot pass
upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning and cannot substitute its
judgment for that of the arbitrator.  (See
Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11.)
          Interpretation of the underlying
contract is ordinarily a question of law for the arbitrator, not the court: “It
is the arbitrator’s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator’s
decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business
overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from
his.”  (United Steelworkers of America
v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp. (1960) 363 US 593, 599.) 
 
Discussion
Petitioner has met
its burden to prove the arbitration award and the existence of the valid
arbitration agreement.  (Petition
¶¶4(a), (c); Attachments 4(b) at ¶6; Petition ¶8(c), Attachment 8c.)
          Respondent’s objections to the
confirmation of the Award are not well taken. 
An award may not be attacked for purported wrong arbitrator determinations
of law, rule, interpretation, evidence, relevance, materiality, credibility,
agreement, etc.  A court may not substitute
whatever determinations it might make for those made by the arbitrator.  (See, e.g., Morris, 69 Cal.2d at
pg. 691; Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11; Heimlich v. Shivji (2019)
7 Cal.5th 350, 370 [“When parties opt for the forum of arbitration they agree
to be bound by the decision of that forum knowing that arbitrators, like
judges, are fallible.”].)  Respondent was
not prevented from putting on its case in arbitration.  (See Heimlich, 7 Cal.5th at 368;
Royal Alliance Associates, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 1092.)  Further, the arbitration comported with the
JAMS Comprehensive rules, which govern the arbitration proceedings.  (Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1413, 1426, 1440 [affirming the primacy of JAMS Comprehensive Rules
and “final” arbitrator authority].)
          Petitioner requests prejudgment
interest, fees, and costs incurred on the cross-petitions before this Court.  The Court is not inclined to grant such fees
on a motion to confirm arbitration award, and in response to the instant
ruling, parties can properly argue and challenge attorneys’ fee requests and
prejudgment interest. 
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s petition to confirm the
arbitration award is granted.  Petitioner
may separately move for a motion to grant prejudgment interest, fees, and
costs.
Respondent’s cross-petition to vacate the
arbitration award is denied.  
Moving Party to give notice.
