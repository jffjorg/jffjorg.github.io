 Case Number:  23STCV13385    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Victor Reyes’s Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint
Plaintiff Victor
Reyes moves for leave to file a first amended complaint.  Courts have discretion to permit an amendment to any
pleading “in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper.” (CCP §
473(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be
exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.) 
Courts exercise their discretion “liberally to permit amendment,” and
“[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in which
denial of leave to amend can be justified.” 
(Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.)
 Permitting plaintiff to file a first amended
complaint serves the interest of justice.
Plaintiff Victor Reyes’s motion for leave to file a first amended
complaint is granted.  Plaintiff shall
file the first amended complaint (attached as Exhibit A to the motion)
forthwith.
