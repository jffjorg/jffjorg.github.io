And here is the English-text summary:

The presiding judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The plaintiffs, Christopher A. Altounian, Margarita Maria Carranza, and Luis H. Carranza, have moved to disqualify attorney Quintin Lucas from representing them in the case. The judge has denied the motion, stating that even if the plaintiffs had valid grounds to disqualify Lucas, he is no longer involved in the proceeding and has already represented the State of California, which was dismissed with prejudice.

The judge has also ordered the dismissal of the action against the sole remaining defendant, Department IHSS. The court has found that the plaintiffs have failed to prosecute the action and have failed to serve the summons on the defendant. The judge has cited the California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure in support of the dismissal.
