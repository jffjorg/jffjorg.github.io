"The court grants plaintiff's motions to compel defendant to respond to document demands and produce documents, to respond to form interrogatories, and for an order establishing the truth of matters specified in requests for admission. The court orders defendant to serve verified responses to document demands and produce all responsive documents within 30 days. The court also orders defendant to pay plaintiff $445 in sanctions. Finally, the court deems admitted the truth of the matters and genuineness of the documents specified in plaintiff's requests for admission, and orders defendant to pay another $445 in sanctions."
