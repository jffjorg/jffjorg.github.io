```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to bifurcate the trial, filed by the defendants Doheny Vidovich Partners and De Anza Properties. The defendants had argued that bifurcating the trial would be beneficial due to the number of witnesses they intended to call, including liability experts and witnesses to attest to damages. However, the Judge found that the defendants failed to provide sufficient facts to support their argument, and that simply relying on the number of witnesses they would call was insufficient to show that bifurcation would promote the convenience of witnesses or judicial economy. The Judge also rejected the defendants' argument that bifurcation would mitigate prejudice, finding that there was no evidence to support this claim. As a result, the motion to bifurcate is denied, and the trial will proceed as scheduled.
