Tentative rulings/MILs
 
Plaintiff's MILS
No oppositions filed

Deny as to reading instructions, grant as to mini opening less than 5 mins. The court does not restrict the amount of time for voir dire except that the time be reasonable.
It depends on whether the plaintiff has received Medi-cal or Medicare for his claimed injuries in which case there would need to be evidence of the amount of those bills and the court would expect a stipulation as to that amount. As to private health insurance, the court will not allow evidence of that.  As to the rates for Medicare or Medi-cal, it depends on what the experts may say and whether those rates may be related to what is reasonable. The court will discuss.
There is no MIL#3.
A. Deny.  The experts are different specialties and may render opinions within their specialty as long as they establish proper foundation for their opinions.
The medical chronology will not be received in evidence (the title to this section refers to a, injury diagram, is this the same as the medical chron.?)
Deny to the extent that medical experts may rely on the records for their opinions but the records themselves and the statements in them cannot be stated because they are or contain hearsay.
Deny to the extent that opposing party's experts have opinions which may refer to those other conditions.
Grant to the extent that there can be no mention at any time about a fall from a horse unless the matter is discussed with the court and evidence in support is provided.
It depends on whether this is relevant to any party's theory of the case. The court will discuss.
It depends, the court will discuss. Did Dr. Sisto admit to the mistake?  Did he state what the source of the information was?
