And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming hearing. The plaintiff has submitted motion in limine (MILs) without opposition from the defendant. The court has made the following rulings:

* The court will allow a mini-opening statement of less than 5 minutes, but does not restrict the amount of time for voir dire, as long as it is reasonable.
* The court will exclude evidence of private health insurance, but will consider evidence of Medi-cal or Medicare reimbursement if relevant to the case.
* The court will not allow the medical chronology to be received as evidence, and will only allow experts to rely on medical records for their opinions, not the records themselves.
* The court will exclude expert opinions that refer to other conditions not relevant to the case.
* The court will allow discussion of a fall from a horse, but only if supported by evidence and discussed with the court first.
* The court will discuss the relevance of expert opinions and the admissibility of evidence.

The court will also discuss the following issues:

* Whether Dr. Sisto admitted to a mistake and what the source of the information was.
* The relevance of the expert opinions to the case.

The court's final ruling will be made after considering the parties' arguments and evidence.
