The court's tentative ruling is on a motion for summary judgment and alternative summary adjudication. The case involves a dispute between Wesley Robbins, the plaintiff, and Stephen Pattillo, Briana Pattillo, and Eric Pattillo, the defendants. The plaintiff alleges 13 causes of action, including civil conspiracy, fraud, and conversion. The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and granted their motion for summary adjudication as to the 6th cause of action. The court found that the defendants had not met their burden to demonstrate the plaintiff's causes of action for civil conspiracy, trespass, and receipt of stolen property. The court also found that the defendants had not shown that the plaintiff's allegations of conversion were without merit. The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and granted their motion for summary adjudication as to the 6th cause of action.
