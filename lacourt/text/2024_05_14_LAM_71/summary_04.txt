And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court denies Hormoz Pourat's motion to continue his motion to set aside default. Hormoz's motion is considered moot because the previous motions to set aside default have been denied and he remains in default. The court also notes that Hormoz's reply does not substantively respond to Moussazadeh's opposition. The court concludes that Hormoz's motion to continue a motion to set aside default is denied as moot."
