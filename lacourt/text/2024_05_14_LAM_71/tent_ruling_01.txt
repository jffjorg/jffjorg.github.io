 Case
  No.:  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 14, 2024



 
Defendants Stephen Pattillo’s, individually and dba
Quality Stamp Show and Orcoexpo, Briana Pattillo’s, and Eric Pattillo’s motion
for summary judgment of pro per
Plaintiff Wesley Robbins’ second amended
complaint is denied.
Defendants Stephen Pattillo’s, individually and dba
Quality Stamp Show and Orcoexpo, Briana Pattillo’s, and Eric Pattillo’s motion
in the alternative for summary adjudication of pro per Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins’ second amended complaint is denied as to the 1st, 7th, and 15th
causes of action and granted as to the 6th cause of action.
 
Defendants
Stephen Pattillo, individually and dba Quality Stamp Show and Orcoexpo (“Stephen”),
Briana Pattillo (“Briana”), and Eric Pattillo (“Eric”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
move for summary judgment of pro per Plaintiff Wesley
Robbins’ (“Wesley”) (“Plaintiff”) 1st (civil conspiracy), 6th (trespass), 7th (conversion), and 15th
(receipt of stolen property) causes
of action in his second amended complaint (“SAC”) on the basis there are
no triable issues of material fact as to Plaintiff’s SAC against Moving
Defendants because Stephen has not conspired against Plaintiff, and none of the
Moving Defendants trespassed onto Plaintiff’s property, conversed Plaintiff’s
property, or received stolen property from Plaintiff, and no evidence has been
set forth any evidence to the contrary. 
(Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §437c.) 

Moving
Defendants move in the alternative for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s 1st
[Issue 1], 6th [Issues 2, 5, & 8], 7th [Issues 3, 6, &
9], and 15th [Issues 4, 7, & 10] causes of action on the basis
there are no material issues of fact. 
(Notice Motion, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Moving
Defendants’ 5/9/24 evidentiary objections to Plaintiff’s Exhibits A-V are
overruled as to Nos. 3, 4, 6, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 22, and sustained as
to Nos. 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 20.
Moving
Defendants’ 5/9/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Wesley Robbins
(“Robbins”) are overruled as to Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 37, 44,
45, 54, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62, and 64, and sustained as to Nos. 23, 32, 33, 34, 36,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 57, 58, 59, 63, 65, 66,
67, 68, and 69.
 
CRC
Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1350(d)(3) provides that citations to the evidence in
support of each material fact must include reference to the exhibit, title,
page, and line numbers.  (CRC, Rule 3.1350(d)(3); see
CRC, Rule 3.1350(h).)  Failure to comply
with the requirements for filing a separate statement may in the trial judge’s
discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denial of the motion.  (C.C.P. §437c(b)(1).)
Plaintiff argues Moving Defendants’ motion should be denied
for its violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) in their Separate Statement because
they moved for summary adjudication.  However,
Moving Defendants’ separate statement substantially complies with CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) because they separate out each issue,
and in the event the Court grants summary adjudication as to each issue, and
each issue is dispositive as to Plaintiff’s allegations against the moving
party, the Court can then grant summary judgment.  Moving Defendants’ separate statement is not
so defective as to render it incomprehensible or unworkable in the context of
deciding a motion for summary judgment in addition to a motion for summary
adjudication.  Therefore, the Court will
consider the instant motion as one for summary judgment and, in the
alternative, summary adjudication.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on January 29,
2021.  Plaintiff filed his first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on January 14, 2022. 
Plaintiff filed the operative SAC on November 14, 2022, alleging
thirteen causes of action: (1) civil conspiracy, (2) fraud (I), (3) tortious interference
(I), (4) defamation, (5) invasion of privacy, (6) trespass, (7) conversion, (8)
tortious interference (II), (9) fraud (II), (10) gross negligence, (11)
appropriation, (12) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), and
(15) receipt of stolen property.[1]
On March 23, 2023, this Court sustained Stephen’s demurrer
to the 2nd, 8th, and 12th causes of action alleged against him without leave to
amend, and overruled Stephen’s demurrer to the 1st, 6th, 7th, and 15th causes
of action.  (3/23/23 Ruling on Submitted
Matter, pgs. 1-2.)  This Court overruled
Eric’s and Briana’s demurrers to the 6th, 7th, and 15th causes of action.  (3/23/23 Ruling on Submitted Matter, pg. 2.)
Moving Defendants filed the instant motion on January 30,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on April
30, 2024.  Moving Defendants filed their
reply on May 9, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
A
motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show
that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
A
motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an alternative to a
motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural respects as a
motion for summary judgment.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(2).)  A party may move
for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action if
that party contends that the cause of action has no merit or to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in Civil Code §3294, or that one or more defendants
either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)  A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.  (C.C.P.
§437c(f)(1).) 
 
Civil Conspiracy (1st COA) [only
against Stephen]
“To
support a conspiracy claim, a plaintiff must allege the following elements:
‘(1) the formation and operation of the conspiracy, (2) wrongful conduct in
furtherance of the conspiracy, and (3) damages arising from the wrongful
conduct.’”  (AREI II Cases
(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1022.)  
“Conspiracy
is not a separate tort, but a form of vicarious liability by which one
defendant can be held liable for the acts of another . . . A conspiracy
requires evidence ‘that each member of the conspiracy acted in concert and came
to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful plan, and that
one or more of them committed an overt act to further it.’”  (IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 630, 652, internal citations omitted.)
“Because
civil conspiracy is so easy to allege, plaintiffs have a weighty burden to
prove it. They must show that each member of the conspiracy acted in concert
and came to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful plan,
and that one or more of them committed an overt act to further it. It is not
enough that the conspiring officers knew of an intended wrongful act, they had
to agree—expressly or tacitly—to achieve it. Unless there is such a meeting of
the minds, ‘the independent acts of two or more wrongdoers do not amount to a
conspiracy.’”  (Choate v. County of Orange (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 312, 333,
internal citations omitted.)
“While
knowledge and intent ‘may be inferred from the nature of the acts done, the
relation of the parties, the interest of the alleged conspirators, and other
circumstances,’ ‘[c]onspiracies cannot be established by suspicions. There must
be some evidence. Mere association does not make a conspiracy. There must be
evidence of some participation or interest in the commission of the offense.’
An inference must flow logically from other facts established in the action.”  (Kidron v. Movie Acquisition
Corp. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1583, internal citations omitted.)
Moving
Defendants argue Plaintiff has not produced any evidence of any agreement
between any of the defendants or that they acted in concert with the
understanding to accomplish an unlawful plan because Stephen has never
conspired to harm Plaintiff.  (Motion
Memo, pg. 11.)
Moving
Defendants failed to submit evidence that negates an element of a cause of
action for conspiracy.  Specifically,
Moving Defendants submitted Stephen’s declaration stating he “never conspired
to harm Plaintiff.”  (Defendants’
Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“D-DSSF”] 14; Decl. of Stephen ¶3.)  However, Stephen’s declaration is a mere
legal conclusion—Stephen does not produce factual evidence demonstrating he did
not enter into or participate in any written or spoken agreement to engage in
any of the underlying alleged intentional torts.  Therefore, Moving Defendants do not shift the
burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action
is denied.
 
Trespass (6th COA)
“‘Trespass
is an unlawful interference with possession of property.’ The elements of
trespass are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or control of the property; (2) the
defendant’s intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto the property; (3)
lack of permission for the entry or acts in excess of permission; (4) harm; and
(5) the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm.  (See CACI
No. 2000.)”  (Ralphs Grocery Co.
v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261-262.)
Moving
Defendants argue Plaintiff cannot demonstrate they engaged in trespass because none
of Moving Defendants have ever been to the US Storage Center in which Plaintiff
maintained Unit C94, nor have they ever entered or been in Unit C94.  (Motion Memo, pg. 12.)
Moving
Defendants submitted evidence that they did not enter into Unit C94 or any
storage unit.  Specifically, Moving
Defendants submitted Stephen’s declaration stating he has never been to the
U.S. Storage Center located at 14680 S. Aviation Boulevard, Hawthorne,
California 90250, he has never entered or been in Unit C94, and he has never
entered or been in any storage unit maintained by Plaintiff.  (D-DSSF 43; Decl. of Stephen ¶¶13-15.)  Moving Defendants submitted Eric’s
declaration stating he has never been to the U.S. Storage Center located at
14680 S. Aviation Boulevard, Hawthorne, California 90250, he has never entered
or been in Unit C94, and he has never entered or been in any storage unit
maintained by Plaintiff.  (D-DSSF 113;
Decl. of Eric ¶¶3-5.)  Moving Defendants
submitted Eric’s verified amended responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”) stating he has never been to US Storage
Centers – South Bay in Hawthorne, CA.  (D-DSSF
113; D-COE, Exh. N at 37:13-14, 47:4.) 
Moving Defendants submitted Briana’s declaration stating she has never
been to the U.S. Storage Center located at 14680 S. Aviation Boulevard,
Hawthorne, California 90250, she has never entered or been in Unit C94, and she
has never entered or been in any storage unit maintained by Plaintiff.  (D-DSSF 170; Decl. of Briana ¶¶3-5.)  Accordingly, Moving Defendants met their
burden to demonstrate Plaintiff’s cause of action against them for trespass
fails as a matter of law, shifting the burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable
issue of material fact.
Plaintiff
failed to meet his burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to
whether Moving Defendants trespassed on Plaintiff’s C94 storage unit.  Plaintiff argues Moving Defendants’ motion
fails to negate the essential factual element of trespass according to jury
instructions that provide a defendant could engage in trespass by causing
another person to enter a plaintiff’s property. 
(Opposition, pg. 15; see CACI
2000.)  However, as alleged in
Plaintiff’s SAC, such a factual element is not relevant because Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Benson Williams II (“Williams”) “entered Unit C94 and permitted
[Stephen], [Briana], [Eric], and Doe[s] to enter Unit C94 – with personal
foreknowledge that Unit C94 was leased to Plaintiff and that Plaintiff used
Unit C94.”  (SAC ¶373.)  Plaintiff’s SAC does not allege
Moving Defendants caused another person to enter Unit
C94.  Plaintiff’s opposition further
argues Moving Defendants fail to address the other essential elements of
trespass beyond entry onto the property and therefore cannot move for summary
adjudication of the cause of action.  (See Opposition, pg. 12.)  Plaintiff’s argument is unavailing because
Moving Defendants only need to demonstrate that as a matter of law, Plaintiff
cannot establish every
essential element of a cause of action for trespass.  Here, the necessary element Moving Defendants
successfully challenged was Plaintiff’s allegation that they entered onto
Plaintiff’s property without his permission.
Plaintiff
failed to meet his burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to
whether Moving Defendants entered onto Plaintiff’s property without
permission.  Specifically, Plaintiff
submitted evidence of Requests for Admission (Set One) (“RFA”) to Defendant
David Cobb (“Cobb”) that this Court deemed admitted on April 3, 2024.  However, the RFAs that have been deemed
admitted do not state that Moving Defendants visited or entered Unit C94, but
rather that Cobb
visited and entered Unit C94.  (Plaintiff’s
Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“P-DSSF”] 43, 113, 170; P-COE Exh. U at
RFA Nos. 84-86.)   Further, RFA Nos. 89
and 90, which have been deemed admitted by Cobb, state that Cobb works for
Stephen and Stephen works for Cobb; these RFAs do not raise a triable issue of
material fact about whether Moving Defendants visited or entered Unit C94
without Plaintiff’s permission.  (P-DSSF
43, 113, 170; P-COE Exh. U at RFA Nos. 89-90.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff fails to meet his burden to raise a triable issue
of material fact.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the 6th cause of action
is granted.
 
Conversion (7th COA)
“Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements
of a conversion are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of
the property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a
wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages. It is not
necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary
to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the
alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.”  (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451-452.)
“The
rule of strict liability applies equally to purchasers of converted goods, or
more generally to purchasers from sellers who lack the power to transfer
ownership of the goods sold. That is, there is no general exception for bona
fide purchasers.”  (Regent Alliance
Ltd. v. Rabizadeh (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1181, internal citations
omitted.)
“In
a conversion action the plaintiff need show only that he was entitled to
possession at the time of conversion; the fact that plaintiff regained
possession of the converted property does not prevent him from suing for
damages for the conversion.”  (Enterprise
Leasing Corp. v. Shugart Corp. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 737, 748, internal
citation omitted.)
Moving
Defendants argues Stephen did not knowingly or intentionally take possession of
Plaintiff’s property and Stephen has no knowledge as to the chain of ownership
of the material he purchases, including the items Stephen purchased from
Brandon Vidal (“Vidal”), and that upon realization that some of the items may
have belonged to Plaintiff, Stephen returned such material to Plaintiff.  (Motion Memo, pg. 12.)  Moving Defendants further argue neither
Briana or Eric have ever had possession of Plaintiff’s alleged stolen property,
and they were named in Plaintiff’s lawsuit because Plaintiff infers they were
involved.  (Motion Memo, pg. 12.)  The Court will address each of the Moving
Defendants in turn:
 
a.     
Stephen [Issue No. 3]
Moving
Defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate Stephen did not knowingly
or intentionally take possession of Plaintiff’s philatelic materials.  Moving Defendants submitted Stephen’s
declaration that states, “on May 22, 2018, [Stephen] purchased some items in
bulk at Lionel Pereira’s Downey store from Brandon Vidal,” that Stephen “had no
knowledge as to the chain of ownership of any material [he] bought from Mr.
Vidal at the time of the purchase,” that “[a]fter reviewing some of the items,
on August 3, 2018, [Stephen] became suspicious that some of the items [he]
purchased from Mr. Vidal may have belonged to Plaintiff.”  (D-DSSF 60-62; Decl. of Stephen ¶¶5-7.)  Stephen’s declaration states he assumed
control or ownership over Plaintiff’s philatelic items.  (Farmers Insurance Exchange, 53
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 451-452.)  Moving
Defendants therefore failed to meet their burden to demonstrate Plaintiff’s
cause of action for conversion alleged against Stephen fails as a matter of
law.  Therefore, Moving Defendants do not
shift the burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact for
Plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion alleged against Stephen.
 
b.    
Eric and Briana [Issue Nos. 6 & 9]
Moving
Defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate neither Eric nor Briana
had possession of Plaintiff’s philatelic items. 
While Moving Defendants submitted Eric’s and Briana’s declarations
stating they have “never been in possession of Plaintiff’s alleged stolen property
as described in Exhibit 30 of Plaintiff’s operative complaint,” such declarations
asserting mere legal conclusions without factual support are not sufficient to
carry their burden on summary adjudication. 
(D-DSSF 132, 188; Decl. of Eric ¶6; Decl. of Briana ¶6.)  Further, Moving Defendants also submit
evidence that Plaintiff’s discovery responses were nonresponsive during his
deposition when asked if he had evidence to support his allegations against
Eric and Briana, specifically of any photographs entering Unit C94.  (D-DSSF 131, 187; D-COE, Exh. D at 588:19-24;
589:1-4, 19-25; 590:1-17.)  However, the questions
posed to Plaintiff during his deposition go to elements of a cause of action
for trespass, not a cause of action for conversion.  Accordingly, Moving Defendants failed to meet
their burden to demonstrate there is no merit to Plaintiff’s cause of action
for conversion against Eric and Briana, and do not shift the burden to
Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether Eric or
Briana had possession of his philatelic items.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the 7th cause of action
is denied.
 
Receipt
of Stolen Property (15th COA)
Penal
Code §496 provides that “any person who has been injured by a violation of
subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney’s fees.”  (Pen. Code §496(c).)
“While
[Penal Code §496(a)] covers a spectrum of impermissible activity relating to
stolen property, the elements required to show a violation of section 496(a)
are simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting
theft, (ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or obtained, and
(iii) the defendant received or had possession of the stolen property.”  (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126, as modified (May
10, 2019), quoting Lacagnina v. Comprehend Systems, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 955, 970 [stating elements
of Penal Code §496 offense].)
“A
violation of section 496(a) may, by its own terms, relate to property that has
been ‘stolen’ or ‘that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion.’”  (Id.,
quoting Pen. Code §496(a).)
Moving
Defendants argue Stephen had no knowledge that any item he purchased had been
stolen at the time he came to be in possession of them because Stephen is a
stamp collector who purchases stamps in bulk during the course of his business
without exhaustive review of each item or its chain of ownership, and Stephen
purchased some material in bulk from Vidal without any knowledge of the items’
chain of ownership.  (Motion Memo, pg. 14.)  Moving Defendants argue once Stephen came to
realize that the property he was holding may have belonged to Plaintiff, he met
his affirmative duty to return the property upon suspicion the property may
have been stolen.  (Motion Memo, pg. 14.)
 Moving Defendants argue Plaintiff has
not set forth any evidence that Eric and Briana bought, sold, received, or
aided in selling, concealing, or withholding any of Plaintiff’s property or
otherwise knew they were in possession of any property that may have been
stolen.  (Motion Memo, pg. 14.)  The Court will address each of the Moving
Defendants in turn:
 
c.     
Stephen [Issue No. 4]
Moving
Defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate Stephen did not know
the property was so stolen or obtained. 
Moving Defendants submitted Stephen’s declaration that states Stephen
“had no knowledge as to the chain of ownership of any material [he] bought from
Mr. Vidal at the time of the purchase,” that “[a]fter reviewing some of the
items, on August 3, 2018, [Stephen] became suspicious that some of the items
[he] purchased from Mr. Vidal may have belonged to Plaintiff.”  (D-DSSF 85; Decl. of Stephen ¶¶6-7.)  Stephen’s declaration does not demonstrate as
a matter of law that he did not know the property was so stolen or obtained
based on his declaration that he suspected some of the items had belonged to
Plaintiff.  Further, Stephen’s verified
amended response to Plaintiff’s SROG stating that he had no information as to
the chain of ownership of any material he purchased does not as a matter of law
demonstrate that he did not know the property was stolen or so obtained.  (D-DSSF 85; D-COE, Exh. M at 8:16-17.)  Moving Defendants therefore failed to meet
their burden to demonstrate Plaintiff’s cause of action for receipt of stolen
property alleged against Stephen fails as a matter of law.  Therefore, Moving Defendants do not shift the
burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact for Plaintiff’s
cause of action for receipt of stolen property alleged against Stephen.
 
d.    
Eric and Briana [Issue Nos. 7 & 10]
Moving
Defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate neither Eric nor Briana
had possession of Plaintiff’s philatelic items. 
While Moving Defendants submitted Eric’s and Briana’s declarations
stating they have “never been in possession of Plaintiff’s alleged stolen
property as described in Exhibit 30 of Plaintiff’s operative complaint,” such
declarations asserting mere legal conclusions without factual support are not
sufficient to carry their burden on summary adjudication.  (D-DSSF 151, 206; Decl. of Eric ¶6; Decl. of
Briana ¶6.)  Further, Moving Defendants
also submit evidence that Plaintiff’s discovery responses were nonresponsive
during his deposition when asked if he had evidence to support his allegations
against Eric and Briana, specifically of any photographs entering Unit
C94.  (D-DSSF 150, 205; D-COE, Exh. D at
588:19-24; 589:1-4, 19-25; 590:1-17.) 
However, the questions posed to Plaintiff during his deposition go to
elements of a cause of action for trespass, not a cause of action for receipt
of stolen property.  Accordingly, Moving
Defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate there is no merit to
Plaintiff’s cause of action for receipt of stolen property against Eric and
Briana, and do not shift the burden to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of
material fact as to whether Eric or Briana had possession of his philatelic
items.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the 15th cause of action
is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied. 
Moving
Defendants’ motion in the alternative for summary adjudication of is denied as
to the 1st, 7th, and 15th causes of action and granted as to the 6th cause of
action.
