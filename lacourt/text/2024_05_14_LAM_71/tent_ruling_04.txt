         vs.
 
SHAHRAM MOUSSAZADEH. 


 Case No.: 
  22STCV24086
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 14, 2024



 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat’s, in pro per, to
continue a motion to set aside default is denied as moot.
 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat
(“Hormoz”) (“Cross-Defendant”) moves in pro per to continue his motion
to set aside default filed on October 17, 2023. 
(Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Background
On
July 26, 2022, Plaintiff Pourandokht Pourat (“Pourandokht”) filed her initial
complaint (“Complaint”) in this action against Shahram Moussazadeh
(“Moussazadeh”) (“Defendant”).
On
January 3, 2023, Moussazadeh filed a cross-complaint (“Moussazadeh CC”) against
Pourandokht, Hormoz, and Soleila Pourat (“Soleila”).  On March 8, 2023, this Court entered defaults
against Hormoz and Soleila.
On
April 11, 2023, Hormoz filed his
initial cross-complaint (“Hormoz CC”) against Moussazadeh.  On July 5, 2023, Hormoz filed his first
amended cross-complaint (“Hormoz FACC”) against Moussazadeh and Moussazadeh’s
attorney, Robert Gentino (“Gentino”), alleging seven causes of action: (1)
declaratory relief, (2) Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, (3) breach of oral
contract, (4) intentional misrepresentation, (5) financial elder abuse, (6)
quiet title, and (7) an unspecified tort alleged against Gentino.
On October 24, 2023, this Court granted
Gentino’s special motion to strike (“anti-SLAPP motion”) the FACC’s single
cause of action against Gentino. 
(10/24/23 Minute Order.)
On April 29, 2024, this Court granted
Moussazadeh’s motion to strike the Hormoz CC and Hormoz FACC.  (4/29/24 Minute Order.)
Hormoz filed the instant motion on January
19, 2024.  Moussazadeh filed his
opposition on April 24, 2024.  Hormoz
filed his reply on April 26, 2024, that does not substantively respond to
Moussazadeh’s opposition.
 
Discussion
          Moussazadeh’s motion to strike the
Hormoz CC and FACC was granted on the basis default was entered against
Hormoz.  
Hormoz
was not an original party to this action and became a party to this action only
as a Cross-Defendant to the Moussazadeh CC. 
Moussazadeh entered default against Hormoz on the Moussazadeh CC in
March 2023.
Entry
of defendant’s default instantaneously cuts off its right to appear in the
action. The defendant is “out of court.” Therefore, the defendant has no right
to participate in the proceedings until either (a) its default is set aside (in
which event, it may respond to the complaint), or (b) a default judgment is
entered (in which event, it may appeal).  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault,
Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.)
Here,
Hormoz’s past motions to set aside the default were denied without prejudice
and he remains in default.  (See 10/13/23
Minute Order; 2/7/24 Minute Order.)
Hormoz’s
instant motion to continue the motion to set aside default does not provide any
basis for a continuance, and there does not appear to be any such underlying
motion filed in this case that has not already been ruled on.  Accordingly, Hormoz’s motion is denied as
moot.
 
Conclusion
Hormoz’s motion to continue a
motion to set aside default is denied as moot.
Moving Party to give notice.
