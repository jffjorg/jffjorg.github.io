And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiffs argue that a recent Court of Appeal decision, Ochoa v. Ford, represents a change in law that warrants reconsideration. However, the judge finds that there has been no "change in law" and that the court's prior ruling, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, remains valid. The judge also notes that the Ochoa court did not distinguish Felisilda and that the two decisions are in conflict. The judge concludes that the arbitration provision in the sales contract is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer and that the plaintiffs' motion is denied. The judge suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ochoa.
