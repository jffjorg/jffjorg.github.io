And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiffs argue that a recent Court of Appeal decision, Ochoa v. Ford, represents a change in law that warrants reconsideration. However, the judge finds that there has been no "change in law" and that the court's prior ruling, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, remains valid. The judge also notes that the Ochoa court did not distinguish Felisilda and that the two decisions are in conflict. The judge concludes that the arbitration provision in the sales contract is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer and that the plaintiffs' motion is denied. The judge suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ochoa.

The judge acknowledged the split in the Court of Appeals on this issue and noted that the California Supreme Court is currently reviewing the Ford Motor Warranty Cases decision.

Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The plaintiffs had argued that the recent Court of Appeal decision in Ochoa v. Ford, which held that a manufacturer is not a third-party beneficiary of an arbitration provision, constituted a change in law that justified reconsideration of the court's order. However, the court found that there has been no change in law, only a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The court has therefore adopted the ruling and rationale of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, which held that a nonsignatory manufacturer can compel arbitration of a claim. The court suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa).

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration. The plaintiffs had sought reconsideration based on a recent Court of Appeal decision in Ochoa v. Ford, which they argued represented a change in law. However, the judge found that there had been no "change in law" and that the Ochoa decision was in conflict with an earlier decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC.

The judge suggested that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in the Ochoa case. The judge's decision means that the arbitration proceedings will continue unless the parties agree to stay them or the California Supreme Court intervenes.

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration. However, the Judge suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings, pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa), which has been accepted for review. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is untimely, but will consider it anyway. The Judge also finds that there has been no "change in law" justifying reconsideration, but rather a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The Judge adopts the ruling and rationale of Felisilda, which holds that the manufacturer is a third-party beneficiary of the sales contract and the arbitration provision is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer.
