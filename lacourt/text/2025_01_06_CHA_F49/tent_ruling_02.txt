Disposition 


REVIEW/CONTINUE 


 



Upon reviewing the Petition, the Court identifies the
following deficiencies:
 
(1)  
Balancing of
Amounts in Paragraph 12a: 
 
The total amounts listed under paragraph 12a of
the Petition (MC-350) do not balance. Petitioner indicates that the total
medical expenses amount to $80,503.43 (MC-350 ¶ 12(a)(1)), while the total
medical expenses to be paid from the proceeds are $1,668.16 (id. ¶ 12a(4)). This
discrepancy suggests an unpaid balance of $78,835.27 ($80,503.43-$1,668.16).
The petition does not list any paid medical expenses or negotiated reductions.
(Id. ¶¶ 12a(2) and (3).)
 
(2)  
Itemization of
Fees
 
The petition seeks reimbursement from the proceeds
for total fees in the amount of $7,918.16. (MC-350 ¶ 16.e.) However, these fees
are not itemized under paragraph 13b of the Petition.
 
(3)  
Direct Payment of Net Proceeds
 
The petition requests approval of direct
payment of the net proceeds, amounting to $17,081.84, to Petitioner Fernandez,
GAL of Claimant Carrillo, rather than depositing the funds into a blocked
account. However, Attachment 18b(8) to the Petition lacks specific proposed
conditions, such as intended uses of the funds and safeguards to ensure they
are preserved for the minor’s benefit.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court requires supplement information and/or amended petition form to address
these deficiencies. A ruling will be issued at a later date after Petitioner
has been afforded an opportunity to correct the issues identified above.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner
Carmen Fernandez’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Andrew Carrillo is CONTINUED
to allow for the submission of additional information or corrections.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
