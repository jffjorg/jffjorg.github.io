And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses to Request for Production, No. 22, Set Two, filed by the defendant/cross-complainant, L.A. Hardwood Flooring, Inc. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff's responses to the request for production, which the defendant/cross-complainant claimed were incomplete and inadequate. The judge found that the defendant/cross-complainant's failure to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion was not motivated by bad faith, and therefore denied the motion.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant/cross-complainant. The plaintiff had sought sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, subdivision (b), but the judge found that this section did not apply to the instant motion. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (i), finding that the defendant/cross-complainant's failure to meet and confer was not motivated by bad faith.

The judge did sustain the plaintiff's objection to the defendant/cross-complainant's request for the names and addresses of the homeowners, finding that this information was equally available to the defendant/cross-complainant and that the plaintiff had properly responded to the request.
