 Case Number:  23STCV17454    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  61 ALLA (A.K.A ALAA) HADDAD, et al. vs ADEL ALTAM, et al.Motion to Set Aside / Vacate the Default is off-calendar. On February 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a dismissal as to the entire case. The Court dismissed the case as to all of the parties. In fact, the court's docket shows the defendants as "dismissed." This motion, therefore, is moot. Further, the court is without jurisdiction to render the relief sought. A timely dismissal "deprives the trial court of jurisdiction in the case."  Gogri v. Jack in th Box Inc., (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 255, 262, fn. 6.
