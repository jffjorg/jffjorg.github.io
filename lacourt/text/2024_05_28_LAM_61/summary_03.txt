And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the motion to bifurcate filed by the defendants on March 21, 2024, is continued. The defendants' proof of service indicates that service was made on the date of filing, but the proof of service mentions a different motion than the one set for hearing. Since no opposition has been filed by the plaintiff, the judge suspects that there may be issues with service. To resolve this, the parties are ordered to refile the motion with proper notice and service and proof thereof.
