 Case Number:  24STCV17628    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  74 Flores v.
Espino et al. 
Defendants Mario Maciel Espino and
Esperanza Maciel’s Motion to Transfer Venue
 
            This
motion arises from a personal injury case. 
            Plaintiff
Eduardo Flores filed his complaint against defendants Mario Maciel Espino
(Espino), Esperanza Maciel (Maciel), Rene Gonzalez (Gonzalez), Waste Management
(Waste Management), Waste Management Collection and Recycling Inc (Collection
and Recycling), and WM Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC (WM). Defendants
Waste Management, Collection and Recycling, WM, and Rene Gonzalez have been
dismissed. Defendants Espino and Maciel (Defendants) filed this motion to
transfer venue to Riverside County. 
On
timely motion, the court must order a transfer of venue “when the court
designated in the complaint is not the proper court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 396b, 397(a).)¿“Venue is
determined based on the complaint on file at the time the motion to change
venue is made.”¿ (Brown v. Superior Court (1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 482; Haurat
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 330, 337.) In
an action involving personal injuries, venue is proper where a defendant
resides or where the injuries occurred.¿¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 395(a).)¿¿¿ 
The
burden is on the moving party to establish facts justifying the transfer.¿ (Mission
Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1982) 31 Cal.3d 921, 928.) The moving
party may submit declarations containing admissible evidence in support of the
motion to transfer venue.¿ (Mission Imports, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p.
928.)¿¿Plaintiff initially pled venue based on the accident having occurred in
Los Angeles County.  (Complaint, ¶
8.)  Defendants provide evidence that the
accident occurred in Riverside County. 
(Mot., Ex. “B.”)  Defendants also
provide evidence that the two remaining Defendants reside in Riverside
County.  (Miller Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) Venue
in a personal injury case is valid in the county where the injury occurred or
the county where the defendants reside. 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 395.) The Court finds that venue is proper in
Riverside County. 
            The
court grants the motion to transfer venue.
            Defendants
to give notice.
