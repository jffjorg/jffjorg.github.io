As for the summary text, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion to seal portions of The Wonderful Company's opposition to Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Co.'s motion for summary judgment. The Wonderful Company argues that certain documents contain private health information and sensitive financial and proprietary business information that should be sealed. The court finds that the minor patients' interest in personal health information and the privacy interest in confidential and proprietary business information override the public right of access. The court grants The Wonderful Company's motion to seal, requiring that the sealed documents be narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
