Property Trust I v. Vickers et al. 
Plaintiff Opendoor Property Trust I’s
Motion to Compel Answer to Requests for Admission
 
BACKGROUND  
This
motion to compel discovery arises out of a property dispute and quiet title
claim. 
            Plaintiff
Opendoor Property Trust I (Plaintiff) seeks to compel initial responses to the
Request for Admission propounded upon defendant Fred Wendell Vickers in his
capacity as the Trustee of the Fred and Beverly Vickers Family Trust
(Defendant). 
            
LEGAL STANDARD 
If
a party to whom requests for admissions fail to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(a).)  The propounding party may
also move for an order deeming the requests admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
The
Court must impose sanctions on the party who failed to serve a timely response
to requests for admissions unless the response has been filed before the
hearing on the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2033.280(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
propounded discovery on Defendant on March 13, 2024.  As of October 14, 2024, when the motion was
filed, Defendant has not served answers. Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling responses without objections. 
            Plaintiff requests $892.00 in sanctions.  Plaintiff filed three motions to compel
discovery and requests sanctions for all three motions divided by three.  Plaintiff’s counsel requests 4.2 hours for
preparing the motions and anticipates an additional 5.5 hours in preparing
replies and attending hearings. The court awards 4.2 hours for preparing the
motions, and an additional two hours for attending the hearings.  Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is
$260.00.  The court awards $537 (6.2 hrs
x $260/hr x 1/3) in sanctions for this motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses to requests for
admission, set one. Defendant must serve answers without objection within 10 days.  The court awards $537 in sanctions payable to
Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
