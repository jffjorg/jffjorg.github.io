```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment against Cesar Del Rosario, citing procedural deficiencies in the plaintiff's submission. The plaintiff failed to dismiss all defendants, provide sufficient evidence and supporting documents, and provide a basis for attorney fees. The court also notes that the defendant improperly filed an answer and cross-complaint without setting aside the default, which cuts off their right to appear in the action. The court intends to strike the defendant's pleadings and will require the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.
