 Case Number:  BS168101    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ FANNIE MAE, Plaintiff(s), vs. GUSTAVO M. UNGO, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: BS168101 Hearing Date: November 12, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION FOR POST-JUDGMENT ATTORNEY FEES  On February 22, 2024, plaintiff Fannie Mae (“Plaintiff”) filed a motion for an order to add attorney fees to the amount of its monetary judgment against defendants in this action. On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended motion for post-judgment attorney fees limiting the request to fees accruing after March 19, 2024. On November 5, 2024, defendant Gustavo M. Ungo, Jr., individually and as Trustee of the Emilia and Gustavo Ungo Family Trust dated June 8, 2006 and as Personal Representative and Executor of The Estate of Gustavo M. Ungo, Sr. (“Defendant”) filed and served an untimely opposition. Based on the November 12, 2024 hearing date, Defendant should have filed and served the opposition by no later than October 29, 2024. (CCP § 1005(b).) The late service precludes Plaintiff from filing a timely reply. The Hearing on Motion for Attorney Fees is therefore CONTINUED to March 10, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. Except for the reply, no further briefing will be permitted.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 8, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
