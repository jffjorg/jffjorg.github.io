The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Vilma Hood's motion to compel non-party Los Angeles County Aging and Disabilities Department/Adult Protective Services (APS) to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion was filed in response to APS' objections to the subpoena based on confidentiality concerns. The judge finds that the information sought is sufficiently limited in scope and is related to the issues in the case, and that a failure to oppose the motion may be deemed a consent to its granting. The judge orders APS to produce documents responsive to the subpoena within 30 days of notice of this order.
