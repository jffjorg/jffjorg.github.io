And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a court judgment against the defendants, M.R. Electrical, LLC and Mario Rodriguez Navarro, without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff's supporting declaration is incomplete, as the referenced Exhibit A of invoices and statements is absent from the declaration. The judge requests that the plaintiff submit a new default judgment package utilizing the updated CIV-100 form and correcting the noted defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC (Order to Show Cause) for the entry of default judgment is continued to a later date.
