The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge William A. Crowfoot in a lawsuit filed by Gerardo Martinez Jr. and Leila Martinez against the City of Pasadena. The case arises from an injury sustained in a fight at a soccer match. The City of Pasadena seeks to compel the Plaintiffs to serve responses to discovery requests and requests sanctions against them. The Plaintiffs failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the Court grants the City's motion to compel. The Court also imposes sanctions against both Plaintiffs, ordering them to pay a total of $1,425 in attorney's fees and filing fees. The ruling requires the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days of the date of the order.
