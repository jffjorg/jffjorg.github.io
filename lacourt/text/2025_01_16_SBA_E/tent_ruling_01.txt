LEGAL STANDARD
 
The Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”)
applies in both federal and state courts to contracts evidencing a transaction
involving interstate commerce. (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-2; Southland Corp. v. Keating
(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 12.) The FAA preempts conflicting state law. (Preston v.
Ferrer (2008) 552 U.S. 346, 353.) The party that contends the FAA applies
bears the burden to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement is in a
“‘contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce” (Woolls v. Super.
Ct. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 197, 211.) 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2,
“[o]n petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of
a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses
to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists unless it determines that: (a) The right to
compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b)¿Grounds exist for
the revocation of the agreement.”¿ 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The instant case
arises out of a lease for a 2023 Mercedes C Class. Defendants argue that
Plaintiff signed a lease agreement that reads, in pertinent part:
 
Agreement to Arbitrate:
 
Any claim or dispute, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise (including any dispute over the interpretation, scope, or
validity of this lease, arbitration section or the arbitrability of any issue),
between you and us or any of our employees, agents, successors, assigns, or the
vehicle distributor, including Mercedes-Benz USA LLC (each a “Third-Party
Beneficiary”), which arises out of or relates to a credit application, this
lease, or any resulting transaction or relationship arising out of this lease (including
any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall,
at the election of either you, us, or a Third- Party Beneficiary, be resolved
by a neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action. (Ameripour Decl.
Exhibit A.)
 
Existence of Valid Arbitration Agreement and
Claims Covered by Arbitration Clause¿ 
 
“[T]he petitioner
bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by
the preponderance of the evidence . . . .” (Giuliano v. Inland Empire
Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.) “In determining whether
an arbitration agreement applies to a specific dispute, the court may examine
only the agreement itself and the complaint filed by the party refusing
arbitration [citation]. The court should attempt to give effect to the parties’
intentions, in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual
language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.” (Weeks
v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350, 353.) “To determine whether a
contractual arbitration clause requires arbitration of a particular
controversy, the controversy is first identified, and the issue is whether that
controversy is within the scope of the contractual arbitration clause.” (Titolo
v. Cano (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 310, 316.) “Doubts as to whether an
arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor
of sending the parties to arbitration. The court should order them to arbitrate
unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to cover
the dispute.” (California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. State
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 198, 205.) 
 
“[A] party opposing
the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any
fact necessary to its defense. [Citation.] In these summary proceedings, the
trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations,
and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony received at the
court’s discretion, to reach a final determination.” (Giuliano, supra,
149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1284.) 
 
            Third-Party Beneficiary
 
            Defendant argues that it can enforce the arbitration
provision in the Plaintiff’s Lease as a third-party beneficiary. (Ronay
Family Ltd P’ship v. Tweed, (2013) 216 Cal. App. 4th 830, 836; Macauly
v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal. App. 4th 1, 6-8.) Defendant emphasizes that the
arbitration clause in the Lease explicitly includes Defendant as a third-party
beneficiary, along with other related parties such as the vehicle distributor.
 
The arbitration
provision states that disputes between the lessee and "us or any of our
employees, agents, successors, assigns, or the vehicle distributor, including Mercedes-Benz
USA LLC," may be resolved through
binding arbitration. (Ameripour Decl. Exhibit A.) Defendant argues that this provision
demonstrates the parties' intent to make Defendant a beneficiary of the
arbitration clause. Furthermore, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s claims
arise out of and relate to the Lease and the resulting warranty relationship,
further solidifying its right to enforce the arbitration provision.
 
Defendant argues
that when a non-signatory falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement
due to the nature of the relationship or explicit inclusion, the non-signatory
may compel arbitration. (See, Cione v. Foresters Equity Services, Inc. (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 625, 636.) Since Plaintiff's claims are tied to the Lease and
the warranty relationship, Defendant asserts that it is entitled to enforce the
arbitration provision, and the claims must be resolved through arbitration.
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that Defendant does not qualify as a third-party beneficiary
under the California Supreme Court’s Goonewardene test, which requires
three elements: (1) the third party must directly benefit from the contract,
(2) a motivating purpose of the contract must be to benefit the third party,
and (3) allowing the third party to enforce the contract must align with the contract’s
objectives and the parties’ reasonable expectations. (Goonewardene v. ADP,
LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 829-830.)
 
First, Plaintiff
asserts that Defendant does not directly benefit from the lease. Payments under
the lease are made directly to the lessor, not to Defendant. While Defendant
may receive an indirect benefit through the dealership’s ability to purchase
additional vehicles, such incidental benefits are insufficient to satisfy the
first element of Goonewardene. (Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC (2022)
23 F.4th 942, 946.)
 
Second, Plaintiff
contends that the motivating purpose of the lease is not to benefit Defendant.
The primary purpose of the lease is to transfer possession of the vehicle to
the lessee and set payment terms with the lessor, not to confer benefits on
Defendant. Plaintiff argues that the dealership and lessee entered into the
lease for their own interests, not to provide benefits to Defendant. (See Fuentes
v. TMCSF, Inc. (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 541, 553.) 
 
Third, Plaintiff
argues that allowing Defendant to bring a breach of contract action against
Plaintiffs would be inconsistent with the lease’s objectives because Defendant
would not suffer damages from any breach of the lease. None of the lessee’s
obligations under the lease affect Defendant, making enforcement of the lease
by Defendant unreasonable and outside the parties’ expectations.
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that warranties from a manufacturer, such as Defendant, are
independent of the Lease Agreement and cannot be compelled to arbitration under
its terms.  Plaintiff emphasizes that
manufacturer warranties do not arise from the lease or sales contract but are
separate obligations and that the appellate court has regularly rejected the
application of third-party beneficiary claims by non-signatory manufacturers. (Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324, 1329; Montemayor et
al. v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958, 961; Kielar v. The
Superior Court of Placer County, 94 Cal. App. 5th 614, 620; Yeh v.
Superior Ct. of Contra Costa Cnty., 95 Cal.App.5th 264.)
 
Plaintiff contends
that the Lease provision does not establish an agreement to arbitrate claims
with third-party non-signatories. The claims are unrelated to the Lease's terms
and solely focus on obligations arising from the manufacturer’s warranties.
Therefore, Plaintiff argues that arbitration should not be compelled under the
Lease Agreement.
 
In reply, Defendant
argues that Plaintiff's opposition to arbitration is unfounded because the
arbitration provision in the Lease explicitly names Defendant Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC as a third-party beneficiary. Unlike the cases Plaintiff relies on,
where manufacturers were not explicitly included, this Lease clearly identifies
MBUSA as an intended beneficiary. Defendant asserts that the arbitration
provision applies to "any claim or dispute" between Plaintiff and
MBUSA, covering all claims arising from the Lease and the manufacturer-consumer
relationship. (Ameripour Decl. Exhibit A.)
 
Defendant argues
that MBUSA meets the criteria for third-party beneficiary status: (1) MBUSA
benefits from the contract, (2) the contract expressly includes MBUSA as a
beneficiary, and (3) enforcing the arbitration provision aligns with the
contract's objectives. Defendant also notes that the Court in Ford Motor
Warranty Cases states, “If the signatories had intended to benefit
FMC, such a purpose would have been easy to articulate. They could have simply
named FMC—directly or by class as the vehicle’s manufacturer—as a person
entitled to compel arbitration.” (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 89
Cal. App. 5th 1324, 1329.)
 
Defendant
emphasizes that doubts about arbitrability should be resolved in favor of
arbitration under federal and state precedent. Since the Lease explicitly
grants MBUSA the right to compel arbitration and Plaintiff's claims fall within
its scope, Defendant requests that the Court compel arbitration and stay the
proceedings until arbitration concludes. Exhibits submitted confirm that both
state and federal courts have upheld MBUSA's right to compel arbitration under
similar agreements.
 
Under the Goonewardene
test, the elements required for a finding of third-party beneficiary status are
(1) whether the third party would, in fact, benefit from the contract, but also
(2) whether a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a
benefit to the third party, and (3) whether permitting a third party to bring
its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent
with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the
contracting parties.” (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th 817, 829-830.)
 
First, we look to
whether the third party would benefit from the contract. While Plaintiff relies
on Ngo to argue that Defendant does not benefit from the contract, in Ngo,
the arbitration agreement stated that only the plaintiff, the dealership, or
the assignee could enforce the arbitration agreement, and therefore, the
arbitration clause was not intended to benefit the manufacturer. (See, Ngo,
supra, 23 F.4th 942, 946.) Here, however, the arbitration agreement
directly states that MBUSA may enforce the arbitration agreement and names
MBUSA as a third-party beneficiary. (Ameripour Decl. Exhibit A.) Therefore, the Court finds MBUSA would
directly benefit from the contract.
 
Second, we look at whether
a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the
third party. Defendant argues that the motivating purpose of the lease was to
turn over the car to Plaintiff in return for payment. In support of their
argument, Plaintiff cites Ngo and Fuentes; however, in both these
cases, the arbitration agreement did not list Defendant as a party with the
power to enforce the arbitration agreement. (See, Ngo, supra, 23 F.4th
942, 946; Fuentes v. TMCSF, Inc. (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 541, 551-552.) Here,
again, MBUSA is listed as a third-party beneficiary with the power to compel
arbitration regarding disputes “which arises out of or relates to a credit
application, this lease, or any resulting transaction or relationship arising
out of this lease (including any such relationship with third parties who do
not sign this contract.)” (Ameripour Decl. Exhibit A.) Therefore,
the Court finds that the motivating purpose of the arbitration agreement within
the contract was to provide a benefit to MBUSA as well as any other signatory
or third-party beneficiary.
 
Last, we consider whether permitting a third party to bring its own breach of contract
action against a contracting party is consistent with the contract's objectives
and the parties' reasonable expectations. “This element calls for a judgment
regarding the potential effect that permitting third party enforcement would
have on the parties’ contracting goals, rather than a determination whether the
parties actually anticipated third party enforcement at the time the contract
was entered into.” (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th 817, 831.) Defendant
argues that MBUSA would not be permitted to bring a breach of contract party
against Plaintiff as any breach of the lease would not cause any damage to
MBUSA. However, in Ngo, when analyzing the third factor of the Goonewardene
test, the Court analyzed the arbitration agreement and not the contract as
a whole. (Ngo, supra, 23 F.4th 942, 948.) Here, the arbitration
agreement lists MBUSA as an intended third-party beneficiary, and therefore,
the Court finds that the parties reasonably expected that MBUSA would have the
power to enforce the contract as a third-party beneficiary. (Goonewardene,
supra, 6 Cal.5th 817, 831; (Ameripour Decl. Exhibit
A.)
 
Thus, the Court finds that MBUSA satisfies
all the elements for a finding of third-party beneficiary status under Goonewardene.
(Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th 817, 829-830.) 
 
Plaintiff also
argues that the warranty claims are not subject to the arbitration provision.
Manufacturer warranties are separate and independent from the Lease Agreement
and are not "claims or disputes... which arise out of or relate to... this
lease." (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324,
1334; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958, 961.)  Plaintiff contends that the claims are based
solely on MBUSA's warranty obligations and are distinct from the Lease terms. However,
the portions of Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Montemayor Plaintiff
cites ins support of this argument analyze the doctrine of equitable estoppel,
not third-party beneficiaries, and Plaintiff has provided no other authority
for his argument to stand on. (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 89 Cal.
App. 5th 1324, 1334; Montemayor, supra, 92 Cal.App.5th 958, 961.) Thus,
the Court finds this argument unpersuasive. 
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Arbitration.
