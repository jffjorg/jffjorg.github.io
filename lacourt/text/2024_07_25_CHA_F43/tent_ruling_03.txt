SUMMARY OF ACTION 
This action arises out of an automobile versus pedestrian
accident that happened on January 18, 2023. Plaintiff Paola Boteo Alfaro (Plaintiff)
was crossing the street en route to school when Defendant Annie Beaudoin
(Beaudoin), who was operating a motor vehicle, crashed into Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff has alleged one cause of action against
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence. Plaintiff
alleges that the road she was crossing, which is next to the school, is
unreasonably dangerous. She alleges that Defendants had a duty to make it
safer.
 
Defendant LAUSD filed its demurrer to Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint on June 6, 2024. Plaintiffs Paola Boteo Alfaro and Eddio
Botero Perez oppose LAUSD’s demurrer.
 
ANALYSIS
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Third Cause of Action for Negligence
Defendant LAUSD demurs to Plaintiffs’ cause of action for
negligence on the basis that it does not states facts sufficient to allege a
cause of action against LAUSD and on the basis that a school district does not
have any duty to provide crossing guards.
 
The elements of a negligence cause of action are duty,
breach, proximate cause, and damages. (See Peredia v. HR Mobile Services,
Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680.)
 
LAUSD argues in its demurrer that Plaintiffs have failed to
cite a statutory basis for their cause of action for negligence. To bring a
cause of action against a public entity, a plaintiff must have statutory
authority to do so. (Gov. Code § 815(a).)
 
Plaintiffs do cite Government Code §§ 815.2, 815.4, and 820,
et seq., in their FAC. These sections all deal with whether a public entity is
liable for injury causes by an act or omission of an employee or independent
contractor of a public entity. There is nothing in Plaintiffs FAC that suggests
that Defendant Beaudoin was an employee of LAUSD or that any employee of LAUSD
was involved in the accident. Plaintiffs also do not cite any sections that
point to the specific duties that they are alleging that LAUSD and the other
Defendants failed to perform. Plaintiffs’ opposition points to Education Code
§§ 44808 and 32280 et seq., but neither of these sections are cited in their
FAC.
 
Because Plaintiffs have failed to indicate a statutory basis
for the duty that LAUSD allegedly breached, Plaintiffs cannot maintain a cause
of action for negligence. LAUSD’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of Action
is sustained with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant LAUSD’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of
Action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiffs are given 30 days leave to amend.
 
Moving party to give notice to all parties.
