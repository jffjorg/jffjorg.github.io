And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on two separate motions. In the first motion, the plaintiffs are seeking to add a cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment against Ford Motor Company and related allegations to their original complaint. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiffs have a legitimate reason for amending their complaint and that the defendant has not shown prejudice or inexcusable delay.

In the second motion, the plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a settlement agreement that was reached with the defendant, TH Investments, LLC. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the parties did stipulate to the settlement in writing and that the court may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. The judge has also retained jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of its terms.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is favorable to the plaintiffs, granting their motion to amend their complaint and enforcing the settlement agreement.
