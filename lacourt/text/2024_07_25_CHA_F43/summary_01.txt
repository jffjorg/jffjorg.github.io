And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The defendant, Bell Sports, Inc., argued that the plaintiff, Rody Castroll, has no evidence to support their causes of action for strict products liability and negligence. The judge agreed, citing the plaintiff's failure to respond to the defendant's requests for admissions and the lack of evidence to support the alleged defects in the helmet that the decedent, Jacob Castroll, was wearing at the time of his death. The judge also granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, finding that there is no evidence to support the alleged conduct on which the claim is based.
