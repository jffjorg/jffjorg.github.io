And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case involves a dispute between plaintiff Maricel Pitcher and defendant Joseph Peyman Fahr, D.D.S., regarding dental malpractice. The dispute began in 2021, when plaintiff filed the action, and defendant filed an answer. The court has previously ordered plaintiff to pay sanctions, but plaintiff has failed to pay these amounts. Defendant has now filed a motion for additional sanctions, seeking $1,500 to penalize plaintiff for disobeying the court's order. The court finds that plaintiff's failure to pay sanctions is without good cause or substantial justification, and grants the motion for sanctions. The court orders plaintiff to pay $500 in sanctions to the Los Angeles County Superior Court by October 30, 2023.
