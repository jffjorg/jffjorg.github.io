The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is a decision based on the information presented to the Judge before today. The Judge has considered the moving papers and ruled as follows. The case involves Plaintiff Maricel Pitcher filing a complaint against Defendant Joseph Peyman Fahr, D.D.S., doing business as Beautiful Smile Dental Center, for dental malpractice. The Defendant filed an answer on September 7, 2021. The Court granted the Defendant's motions to compel further discovery responses on April 28, 2022, and ordered the Plaintiff to serve further discovery responses and pay sanctions.

However, the Plaintiff did not fully comply with the Court's order, and the Court ordered the Plaintiff to provide verified responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 12 and 14 and code-compliant responses to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 11. The Court also ordered the Plaintiff and her counsel to pay Defendant $2,510 in sanctions by August 6, 2022.

On August 29, 2023, the Defendant filed a motion for monetary sanctions to be heard on September 29, 2023. The Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The Court has granted the Defendant's motion for sanctions and ordered the Plaintiff to pay $500 in sanctions to the Los Angeles County Superior Court by October 30, 2023. The ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, which provides that a judicial officer shall have the power to impose reasonable money sanctions for any violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or substantial justification. The sanctions are not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), payable to the court. The order for sanctions must be in writing and recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.
