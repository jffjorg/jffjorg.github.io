```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Caleb Chevy Bardling-Velasco's claims and has denied the petition. The petition does not provide sufficient information about the medical expenses incurred by the minor, including who paid the expenses and whether settlement funds will be used to reimburse the person or entity that paid the expenses. The Court also notes that the petition does not list any liens. The Court cannot approve a minor's compromise unless it reimburses all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. Therefore, the Court orders the Petitioner to revise the petition to address these discrepancies and to ensure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court approval.
