BACKGROUND 
On
December 9, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm General Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants Nabu Hernandez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-100
for subrogation and indebtedness.  The
complaint requested $129,301.85 in damages. 
On
November 29, 2022, the clerk entered default against Defendant. 
On
March 13, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment against
Defendant to be heard on September 29, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant Nabu
Hernandez and award Plaintiff $129,833.35, consisting of $129,301.85 as the
demand of the complaint, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s
fees, and $531.50 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right
to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial
court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount
specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see
Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.)

Company’s application for default judgment filed on September 18, 2023.

Defendant Nabu Hernandez.

is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
