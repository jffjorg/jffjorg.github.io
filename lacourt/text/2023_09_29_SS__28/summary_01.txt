## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by Mr. Crane, Inc. ("Mr. Crane"). Mr. Crane wants to prevent the deposition of its executives, Robert Schiller and Andy Steinberg, in a lawsuit brought by Eusebio Hernandez ("Plaintiff"). 

The judge found that Plaintiff has a valid reason to seek information from Schiller and Steinberg regarding Mr. Crane's policies on unqualified personnel assisting with rigging operations, which is relevant to the Plaintiff's claim of injury. However, the judge also ruled that Plaintiff must first exhaust less intrusive discovery methods, such as interrogatories, before deposing the executives. 

If Plaintiff exhausts these less restrictive methods and can demonstrate a compelling reason why Schiller and/or Steinberg possess crucial information for the case, the judge will then allow the depositions to proceed.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Eusebio Hernandez, has filed an action against Bigge Crane and Rigging Co. and Mr. Crane, Inc. (Does 1-50) for negligence. The plaintiff alleges that he fell while working at a construction site and was injured. He seeks to depose Mr. Crane's executives, Robert Schiller and Andy Steinberg, but Mr. Crane has filed a motion for a protective order to prevent these depositions.

The judge has reviewed the relevant law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420, which provides that a party may move for a protective order to protect against unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. The judge has also considered the case of Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1992), which holds that when a plaintiff seeks to depose a corporate president or other official at the highest level of corporate management, the trial court should first determine whether the plaintiff has shown good cause that the official has unique or superior personal knowledge of discoverable information.

The judge has determined that the plaintiff has shown good cause that Schiller and Steinberg have knowledge of Mr. Crane's policies and practices, but has not shown that they have unique or superior personal knowledge of discoverable information. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion for a protective order and has ordered that the plaintiff may not take the depositions of Schiller and Steinberg without first exhausting less intrusive discovery methods and making a colorable showing that they possess information necessary to the case. The judge has also ordered that notice of this ruling be given and that the moving party file proof of service with the court within five days.
