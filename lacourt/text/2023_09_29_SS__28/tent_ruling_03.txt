considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 20, 2021, Plaintiff Maricel Pitcher (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Joseph Fahr, D.D.S., doing business as Beautiful Smith Dental
Center, and Does 1-10 for dental malpractice. 
On
September 7, 2021, Defendant, Joseph Peyman Fahr, D.D.S. (erroneously named and
sued as Joseph Fahr, DDS, doing business as Beautiful Smile Dental Center) (“Defendant”)
filed an answer. 
On
April 28, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel further discovery
responses.  The Court ordered Plaintiff
to serve further discovery responses and pay Defendant $2,600 in sanctions by May
26, 2022. 
On
July 6, 2022, the Court found that Plaintiff had not fully complied with the
Court’s April 28, 2022, order.  The Court
ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses to Special Interrogatory Nos.
12 and 14 and code-compliant responses to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 3, 4,
and 11 (indicating that Plaintiff has made a diligent search and a reasonable
inquiry to locate the items requested (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230)) by July
21, 2022.  In addition, the Court ordered
Plaintiff and her counsel to pay Defendant $2,510 in sanctions by August 6,
2022. 
On
August 29, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for monetary sanctions to be heard on
September 29, 2023.  Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently set for March 28, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
requests that the Court impose sanctions of $1,500.00 on Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s
failure to pay previous sanction awards. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 177.5 provides: 
“A judicial officer shall have the power to impose
reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500),
notwithstanding any other provision of law, payable to the court, for any
violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or
substantial justification. This power shall not apply to advocacy of counsel
before the court. For the purposes of this section, the term ‘person’ includes
a witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or both.” 
“Sanctions pursuant to this section shall not be
imposed except on notice contained in a party’s moving or responding papers; or
on the court’s own motion, after notice and opportunity to be heard. An order
imposing sanctions shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct
or circumstances justifying the order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.) 
In 20th
Century Ins. Co. v. Choong (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1274, the Court of Appeal
rejected the argument that the trial court abused its discretion by assessing
$250 in sanctions against a party for failing to pay a previously-issued
sanctions award.  The appellate court explained
that “the purpose of the second sanction was not to collect the first, but to
penalize [the party] for ignoring lawful orders of the court. The court had
every right to impose a monetary sanction to compel obedience to its lawful
orders, or to punish disobedience and disrespect of the court's processes
[citation].”  (Id. at p. 1278.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
April 28, 2022, the Court ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendant $2,600.00 in
sanctions by May 26, 2022. Plaintiff has not paid these sanctions and has not shown good cause or substantial justification for the failure to pay these amounts.  Defendant
requests that the Court impose additional sanctions to penalize Plaintiff for
disobeying the Court’s April 28, 2022 order. 
The
Court grants the request and orders Plaintiff to pay the Court $500 in sanctions
by October 30, 2023. CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Joseph Fahr D.D.S.’s motion for sanctions and orders Plaintiff
Maricel Pitcher to pay $500 in sanctions to the
Los Angeles County Superior Court by October 30, 2023. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
