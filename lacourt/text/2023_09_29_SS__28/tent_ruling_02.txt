 Case Number:  20STCV36707    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 24, 2020, Plaintiff Caleb Chevy Bardling-Velasco, by and through his
guardian ad litem Allena Velasco (“Plaintiff”), filed a complaint against
Defendants Bandini Street Elementary School, Los Angeles Unified School
District, LA’s Best, and Does 1-100. The complaint alleged (1) vicarious
liability under Government Code sections 815, 815.2, 815.4, 815.6 and 820, (2)
breach of mandatory duty under Government Code section 815.6, and (3) general
negligence. 
On
March 24, 2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint against Los Angeles
Unified School District (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 alleging liability under
Government Code sections 815, 815.2, 815.4, 815.6 and 820. 
On
April 26, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
July 18, 2022, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication. 
On
May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On September
6, 2023, Petitioner Allena Velasco (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve
minor’s compromise to be heard on September 29, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court approve the petition to compromise Plaintiff Caleb Chevy Bardling-Velasco’s disputed claim. 
DISCUSSION 
Section
12a of the petition states that Plaintiff incurred $1,565.37
in medical expenses, none of which has been paid or subject to reduction.  Section 12a also states that these medical
expenses will not be paid or reimbursed using the settlement proceeds.  Section 12a does not list any liens. 
However,
Section 12b(5) of the petition states that the $1,565.37 in medical expenses have
been paid.  The petition does not explain
who paid these expenses or whether settlement funds will be used to reimburse
the person or entity that paid this amount. 
The
Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless it reimburses all medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Petitioner should revise the petition to address the discrepancies noted
above and to make sure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court
approval. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of minor Caleb Chevy
Bardling-Velasco’s claims, filed by Petitioner Allena Velasco. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
