And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is continuing the motion to quash the subpoena until a future date to allow the parties to have a meaningful meet and confer effort. The plaintiff has claimed that the defendants botched a construction job and overcharged, and has subpoenaed bank records as part of the discovery process. The court questions the scope of the subpoena, as it appears to seek all bank records, rather than just those related to the specific case. The court suggests that the parties should instead serve a subpoena on the defendants seeking specific records, rather than the bank. The court also outlines guidelines for discovery, meet and confer, and informal discovery conferences (IDC's), including the importance of good faith efforts to resolve disputes and the need for civil and professional communication.
