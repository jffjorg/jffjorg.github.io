And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer (a request to dismiss the case) is sustained with leave to amend (allowing the plaintiff to revise the complaint). The case involves an alleged assault and battery at The Comedy Store, where the plaintiff claims he was beaten by bouncers after leaving the bar. The demurring defendant, Paul Shore, claims he is not personally liable. The judge determines that the complaint does not contain a sham pleading issue, as the missing allegations were not harmful to the case. The judge also finds that the bouncer's conduct was far enough removed from their employment duties to be subject to vicarious liability. However, the judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend in order to clarify Paul Shore's role in the causes of action, as the complaint is unclear about his role and potential liability. The plaintiff has 30 days to revise the complaint.
