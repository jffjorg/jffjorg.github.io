And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Baker, a defendant in a lawsuit brought by cross complainants. The cross complainants allege that Baker made defamatory statements about them, breached a contract, and caused them damages. Baker argues that the prior judgment against him for defamation acts as claim preclusion and bars the instant case. The judge disagrees, finding that the allegations of defamation that occurred after the prior judgment are not barred by res judicata. The judge also notes that the cross complainants' use of a contract cause of action when the real gravamen is defamation may cause confusion and trouble down the road. The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the cross complainants to refile their complaint with greater clarity.
