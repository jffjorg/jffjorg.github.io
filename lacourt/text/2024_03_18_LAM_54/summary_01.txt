```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint based on a forum selection clause in the contract requiring litigation in Ohio. The contract contains a unilateral attorney's fees provision, which is held to be a fundamental California public policy. The court finds that Ohio law does not provide for mutuality of remedy for attorney's fees, and therefore, enforcing the forum selection clause would be inappropriate. The motion to dismiss is denied, and the case will proceed to hearing on March 18, 2024.
