BACKGROUND
            
This action
arises from the interest of Plaintiff Paul Anthony Varma in various real and
personal property owned by his mother, Decedent Brenda Leafstedt, who passed
away on November 20, 2023. On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff sued Defendant Mark
E. Leafstedt, alleging a single cause of action for quiet title. The complaint
alleges that a Petition for Probate was filed in the Probate Division of the
Los Angeles Superior Court on January 18, 2024 in LASC Case No. 24STPB00610. A dispute
has arisen involving Decedent’s will particularly as it pertains to real
properties identified in Decedent’s will. 
 
On
February 15, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the first cause of action in
the complaint for quiet title. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
“A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.) A
demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which the
court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or conclusions
of law or fact. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be
alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) In ruling on a
demurrer, “[t]he complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable
inferences from the facts pleaded.” (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 513, 517.) 
 
A. Plaintiff’s Purported
Lack of Standing and the Lack of Jurisdiction
 
            Defendant contends that this
matter belongs before the Probate Court and Plaintiff lacks standing in this
action. Plaintiff contends that the pleadings do not support the assertion that
the Probate Division has exclusive jurisdiction of the claims asserted in the
complaint. 
 
            “It
is the general rule in California that the superior court sitting in probate
has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the persons and share that each has in
the estate of a decedent.” (Howard v. Bennett (1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 546,
548.) “[T]he next of kin of a decedent [has] no standing to in a court of law
or equity to maintain an action for the recovery of property alleged to belong
to the estate of their decedent.” (Hall v. Alexander (1937) 18
Cal.App.2d 660, 663.) “[A]n heir or devisee may, prior to distribution to him
of real property of decedent, maintain an action to quiet his title thereto
against anyone except the administrator or executor.” (Mears v. Jeffry (1947)
80 Cal.App.2d 610, 618.) 
 
            Plaintiff
does not dispute that there is a pending probate action between the parties. The
instant action arises from a dispute concerning properties identified in
Decedent’s will. This action seeks quiet title of ownership interests in the
properties, a matter not before the probate court. 
 
B. Sufficiency of the
First Cause of Action for Quiet Title 
 
A quiet title action must plead: (1) a description of the
property that is the subject of the action, (2) title of the plaintiff as to
which a determination is sought and the basis of the title, (3) the adverse
claims to title against which a determination is sought, (4) date as of which
the determination is sought, and (5) a prayer for determination of the title of
the plaintiff against the adverse claims. (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.) 
 
            Defendant demurs first cause of
action on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to
support a quiet title cause of action. The Court agrees. Plaintiff has failed
to set forth the legal description of the real property that is subject to this
action, allege the title of Plaintiff as to which a determination is sought, allege
the adverse claims to which a determination is sought, allege the date as of
which a determination is sought, and include a prayer for determination of the
title of Plaintiff against adverse claims. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the first
cause of action for quiet title is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
