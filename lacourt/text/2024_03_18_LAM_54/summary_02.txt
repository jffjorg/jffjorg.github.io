And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice Leiter in a case involving a dispute over a decedent's will and real property. The plaintiff, Paul Anthony Varma, sued the defendant, Mark E. Leafstedt, for quiet title to certain real properties. The defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacks standing and jurisdiction to bring the action, and that the complaint does not sufficiently plead a quiet title cause of action.

The court agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff lacks standing and jurisdiction to bring the action, as it is a matter that should be resolved in the Probate Court. Additionally, the court finds that the complaint does not sufficiently plead a quiet title cause of action, as it fails to include essential elements such as a description of the property, title of the plaintiff, adverse claims, date of the determination, and a prayer for determination.

Therefore, the court sustains the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action for quiet title with leave to amend.
