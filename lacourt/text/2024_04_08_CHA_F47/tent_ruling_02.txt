SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Plaintiff Douglas Rewers (Plaintiff) alleges that prior
to 7/31/19, he, Defendant David Rewers (David) and non-party Tuan Nguyen were
shareholders in Defendant Precise Die and Finishing, Inc. (PDF).  (First Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶4).  Plaintiff alleges that on 7/31/19, David, PDF
 and Plaintiff entered a written contract
whereby David and PDF agreed to purchase the ownership interest of Plaintiff in
PDF for $140,000.  (Id. ¶5 and Ex.1
thereto).  Plaintiff alleges that while
he has performed under the contract “defendants” breached the contract.  (FAC ¶¶6-7). 

 
Plaintiff also alleges that in 2018, Defendant Munna
Munsoor/Monsour (Monsour) expressed an interest in buying into PDF.  (FAC ¶9). 
Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that in 2018 there were ongoing
negotiations to purchase into a business known as Bullseye.  (FAC ¶10). 
Based on these dealings, Plaintiff makes a claim against David, Monsour
and PDF for interference with contract. 
(FAC ¶¶9-15).
 
On 2/16/22, Plaintiff filed this action for: (1) Breach
of Contract, (2) Fraud in the Inducement, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty and (4)
Accounting.  On 11/29/23, this Court
sustained Monsour’s demurrer to the complaint with 30 days leave to amend.  On 1/2/24, Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint was filed alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract
(against David and PDF), (2) Interference With Contract (against Monsour,
David, PDF and Doe defendants), (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against David,
Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants), (4) Fraud In the Inducement/Fraud and
Misrepresentation (against David, Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants) and (5)
Accounting (against David, Monsour, PDF and Doe defendants).  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues David, PDF and Monsour (collectively, Defendants) had with the First
Amended Complaint, on 1/31/23, Defendants filed and served by U.S. Mail the
instant demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint and motion to strike the
entire complaint and/or the allegations regarding and the prayer for punitive
damages.  On 3/26/24, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the demurrer.  While the
proof of service attached to the opposition indicates that it was served by
U.S. Mail and email on 3/26/24, a corrected proof of service filed on 4/3/24
indicates that email service did not take place until 3/28/24.
 
On 3/29/24, Defendants filed and served a reply to the
opposition to the demurrer and a notice of no opposition to motion to
strike.  On 4/3/24, Plaintiff’s counsel
filed a notice indicating that the motion to strike was never received which also
included opposition arguments to the motion to strike.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted.
 
Procedural Defects   
 
(1) As noted above, on 11/29/23, this Court sustained
Monsour’s demurrer to the original complaint with 30 days leave to amend which
made the amended pleading due on or before 12/29/23 (excluding the first day,
11/29/23, and including the last, 12/29/23, 30 days from 11/29/23 is
12/29/23).  (See 11/29/23 Minute
Order); CRC 1.10(a).  Plaintiff did not
submit the First Amended Complaint for filing until Saturday, 12/30/23.  (See Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial
Notice).  
 
The Court finds that the late filing of the First Amended
Complaint did not prejudice Defendants. 
Therefore, Defendants’ request to strike the First Amended Complaint
because it was filed beyond the deadline set forth in the Court’s 11/29/23
Minute Order is denied.  
 
(2) The opposition was not timely filed or served.  Due to the 4/1/24 court holiday, the
opposition was required to have been served on or before 3/25/24, 9 court days
before the 4/8/24 hearing date.  CCP
1005(b).  The opposition was not filed
until 3/26/24 and not electronically served until 3/28/24, according to the
corrected proof of service.  Despite the
late filing and service of the opposition(s), they were considered by the Court
in ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike. 
See CRC 3.1300(d)
 
(3) Defendants refer to a Request for Judicial Notice
purportedly filed with the Demurrer; however, no Request for Judicial Notice
filed by Defendants appears in eCourt.  (See
Demurrer, p.11:10-13; Reply, p.4:27-p.5:2).
 
(4) The Court notes that both Plaintiff and Defendants
failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their papers as
required.  CRC 3.1110(a)(4).
 
Both Plaintiff and Defendants are warned to comply with
all court orders, statutory requirements and court rules in the future or risk
their papers not being considered, matters being continued for compliance
and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
Substantive Arguments
 
A demurrer may be based on the grounds, among others,
that a complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action
and/or the complaint is uncertain.  CCP
430.10(e), (f).
 
Alter Ego
 
Plaintiff has failed to include facts to support the
conclusory alter ego allegations in the First Amended Complaint.  (See FAC ¶3).  Allegations of ownership and control are
insufficient to support a finding of alter ego liability.  See Sonora Diamond Corp. (2000)
83 CA4th 523, 539; Dos Pueblos Ranch and Improvement Co. (1937) 8 C2d
617, 621.
 
1st cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
The First Amended Complaint contains allegations that are
inconsistent with/contrary to the allegations made in the original Complaint
regarding the ownership of PDF.  In the
original complaint, Plaintiff alleged that prior to 7/31/19, he, David and
Monsour were partners in PDF.  (See
Complaint ¶4).  Without explanation, in
the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that prior to 7/31/19,
Plaintiff, David and Tuan Nguyen were shareholders in PDF.  (FAC ¶4). 
Nguyen is not mentioned in the contract which forms the basis of the
breach of contract cause of action.  The
foregoing, renders the claim uncertain and subject to demurrer.  CCP 430.10(f).  Plaintiff has incorporated these uncertain
allegations into the remaining causes of action which also makes them uncertain.  (FAC ¶¶9, 16, 24,
37).  
 
2nd cause of action – Interference With
Contract   
 
The elements of an interference with contract cause of
action are: (1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party, (2)
defendant’s knowledge of the contract, (3) defendant’s intentional acts
designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship, (4)
actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and (5) resulting
damage.  Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. (1990) 50 C3d 1118, 1126; CACI 2201.
 
The First Amended Complaint fails to clearly identify the
contract or contracts allegedly interfered with by Defendants.  Plaintiff alleges that Monsour “expressed an
interest in buying into” PDF, that there were “on going negotiations to
purchase a business known as Bullseye,” and that there were discussions and
meetings regarding the foregoing.  (See
FAC ¶¶10-15).  The opposition further
confuses matters by seemingly claiming that there was interference with three
different contracts (a contract between Plaintiff and Bullseye; a “contract for
commissions referred to Precise Die & Finishing,” and Plaintiff’s ownership
interest in PDF).  Based on the
opposition, it also appears that Plaintiff is claiming that different
defendants are allegedly liable for interfering with different contracts, none
of which Plaintiff has clearly identified (i.e., it is not clear who is a party
to what contract, under which contract Monsour became a shareholder of PDF, if
there was ever an executed contract by which Plaintiff gained an interest in
Bullseye).
 
Due to the failure to clearly identify a valid contract(s)
between Plaintiff and a third party which was interfered with, Plaintiff has
failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for interference with
contract.  CCP 430.10(e).  Similarly, such failure renders the claim
uncertain.  CCP 430.10(f).  Plaintiff has incorporated these uncertain
allegations into the remaining causes of action which also makes them subject
to demurrer for uncertainty.  (FAC ¶¶16,
24, 37).    
 
3rd cause of action – Breach of Fiduciary
Duty
 
The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty cause of
action are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) breach of
fiduciary duty, and (3) damages.  Shopoff
& Cavallo LLP (2008) 167 CA4th 1489, 1509; Oasis West Realty, LLC
(2011) 51 C4th 811, 820-821; Knutson (2018) 25 CA5th 1075, 1094.
 
In the original complaint, Plaintiff alleged that he
entered business ventures with defendants and that a partnership existed
between plaintiff and defendants. 
(Complaint ¶23).  In the First
Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he, David and Monsour were all owners
of shares in PDF and directors and officers of the corporation and that the
individual defendants entered into business ventures and were in a partnership
with Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶¶17, 20).  Plaintiff also alleges David had an ownership
interest in Bullseye and owned certain other commissions.  (FAC ¶18). 
Based on the foregoing, like the contractual relationship(s) between the
parties, the basis of the purported fiduciary relationship between Plaintiff
and Defendants which was allegedly breached is not clear.  As such, the 3rd cause of action
fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).     
 
4th cause of action – Fraud In the
Inducement/Fraud and Misrepresentation
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure), (2)
knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4) justifiable reliance and (5)
resulting damage.  Lazar (1996) 12
C4th 631, 638.  A fraud claim must be
pled with factual specificity.  Wilhelm
(1986) 186 CA3d 1324, 1331.
 
Plaintiff has alleged that “[f]rom October of 2018
through September of 2019 Defendant, David Rewers represented on numerous
occasions that he would be fair in the distribution of income from the above
independent customers and would distribute commissions to Douglas Rewers after
he completed an accounting of the income from the above-identified businesses.”  (FAC ¶27). 
Plaintiff goes on to allege that “[r]ather than accounting for the funds
they have distributed the funds to themselves and failed to account for the
funds received.”  Id.  Plaintiff seems to allege that only David
made misrepresentations and Monsour is purportedly liable for concealing the
amounts received and/or by association. 
(FAC ¶¶27-30).  However, Plaintiff
also at times claims that “Defendants” made the representations.  (FAC ¶28). 
Plaintiff then seems to allege that David was acting on behalf PDF when
making the representations.  (FAC
¶33).  It also appears that this cause of
action may also be attempting to allege that Plaintiff was fraudulently induced
into entering the contract which is the subject of the 1st cause of
action for breach of contract.  (FAC
¶35).     
 
Plaintiff has failed to clearly allege the basis/bases
for the fraud claim against each of the Defendants.  Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to plead
the claim with the required factual specificity.  As such, the cause of action is subject to
demurrer.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  
 
5th cause of action - Accounting 
 
The elements of an accounting cause of action are: (1) a
relationship between plaintiff and defendant that requires an accounting and
(2) that some balance is due the plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an
accounting.  Teselle (2009) 173
CA4th 156, 179.
 
The relationship which forms the basis for the accounting
claim is unclear.  Plaintiff refers to an
agreement regarding commissions and joint venture agreements without setting
forth sufficient information in the First Amended Complaint regarding such
agreements.  As such, Plaintiff has
failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for accounting and
the claim is uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e),
(f).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to strike the entire First Amended Complaint
because it was untimely filed is denied.
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is only the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff is
given another  opportunity to try to cure
the defects in his pleading.  The request
to strike the allegations regarding and the claim for punitive damage is moot
due to the ruling on the demurrer.
 
A Second Amended Complaint is due to be filed and served
within 30 days.
