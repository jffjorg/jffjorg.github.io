And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that JW Brands LLC's motion to compel Martin Willerford to serve full and complete verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1 is granted. The motion also requests an order imposing sanctions against Willerford and in favor of JW Brands in the amount of $1,660.00, which is denied.

The case revolves around a written agreement between Plaintiffs Chris Lacroix and Martin Willerford, and Defendants 024 Management Services, Inc. and JW Brands LLC. The agreement was breached by the Defendants, who prevented the Plaintiffs from providing services and refused to return the startup loan funds.

JW Brands served Form Interrogatories, Set 1 on Willerford, but no responses were received. Despite multiple inquiries, Willerford failed to serve the responses. The Judge finds that JW Brands is entitled to an order compelling responses without objection due to Willerford's failure to serve timely responses.

However, the Judge denies the request for sanctions against Willerford and Willerford's counsel because JW Brands failed to provide proper notice regarding against whom the sanctions are sought.
