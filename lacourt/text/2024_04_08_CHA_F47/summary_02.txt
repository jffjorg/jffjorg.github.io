And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is sustained, meaning that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint does not adequately state a claim. The judge is giving the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint and cure the defects.

The judge denied the request to strike the entire First Amended Complaint because it was filed late, but noted that the late filing did not prejudice the defendants. The judge also denied the request to strike the allegations regarding and the claim for punitive damages, as it was moot due to the ruling on the demurrer.

The judge granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice and noted that the plaintiff failed to include facts to support the conclusory alter ego allegations in the First Amended Complaint. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to clearly identify the contract or contracts allegedly interfered with by the defendants, and that the plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and fraud in the inducement were uncertain and lacked factual specificity.

A second amended complaint is due to be filed and served within 30 days.
