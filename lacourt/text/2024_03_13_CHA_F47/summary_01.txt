And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion to compel is placed off calendar due to a defect in notice. Defendant D&M Home Inspections has requested that Plaintiff Monica Gonzalez serve complete verified responses to their Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, within 7 days after the hearing on the motion. Additionally, D&M requests an order imposing sanctions against Plaintiff Monica Gonzalez in the amount of $1,430 with regard to all 3 concurrently filed motions to compel. However, there is no evidence before the Court that any of the Plaintiffs have consented to receive electronic service, and an email address is not listed in eCourt for any of the Plaintiffs. Since there is no response to the motion to cure the defect in notice, the motion is placed off calendar.
