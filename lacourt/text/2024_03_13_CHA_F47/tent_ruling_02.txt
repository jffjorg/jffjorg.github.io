This action arises from Plaintiff Elya Braden’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt (the Vehicle).  On 11/17/23, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendant General Motors LLC (General Motors) and Defendant Paradise
Chevrolet for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty;
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2; (4) Fraud; (5) Violation of Business
& Professions Code 17200 and (6) Negligent Repair.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues General Motors had with Plaintiff’s complaint, on 12/18/23, General
Motors filed and served the instant demurrer to the 4th and 5th
causes of action and motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages.  Plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer or
motion to strike; however, on 3/1/24, 8 court days before the hearing,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint which was served on defendants on
2/29/24, 9 court days before the hearing.     

 
CCP 472(a) provides: 
 
“A party may amend its pleading
once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but
before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is
filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer or motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for
filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by
the parties. The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed
from the date of service of the amended pleading.”
 
Oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike were due
to be filed and served on or before 2/29/24, 9 court days before the 3/13/24
hearing date.  
 
Since the First Amended Complaint was served 9 court days
before the hearing date, defendants, including General Motors, were not
prejudiced by the filing one day late on 3/1/24.  As such, the Court finds the demurrer and
motion to strike to be moot due to the filing and service of the First Amended
Complaint.
