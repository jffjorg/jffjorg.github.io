Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors LLC are moot due to the filing and service of the First Amended Complaint by Elya Braden. The judge notes that the demurrer and motion to strike were filed in response to the original complaint, but the First Amended Complaint was filed after meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues. The judge finds that the defendants were not prejudiced by the filing of the First Amended Complaint one day late, and therefore, the demurrer and motion to strike are moot.
