And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's punitive damages claim. The plaintiff's third amended complaint (TAC) alleges that the defendant, VCI Construction, LLC, failed to stop at a traffic light intersection, causing a car accident in which the plaintiff, Eduardo Tizoc, was a passenger. The TAC also alleges that the defendant delayed suspending the driver, George Anthony Moran, who had a history of violating the defendant's safe driving policies.

The judge found that the TAC lacks specific allegations regarding Moran's prior conduct and fails to provide a concrete nexus of factual allegations of Moran's conduct. The judge also distinguished the case from CRST, Inc. v. Superior Court (2017), where the employer's knowledge of the employee's unfitness to drive and failure to follow safety procedures was sufficient to support a punitive damages claim.

The judge concluded that the TAC fails to allege facts on which a claim for punitive damages can be made, as no meaningful inference of the defendant's conscious disregard or malice can be concluded. The judge granted the defendant's motion to strike without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint with additional allegations.
