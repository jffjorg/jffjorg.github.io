 Case Number:  21STCV43897    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Compel DiscoveryCase Name: Shahid Shaikh v. Sandra Min Cha, et al.Moving Party: Defendants Sandra Min Cha; Mimi ChaResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDOn February 22, 2024 Defendants served an initial set of written discovery, which included Form Interrogatories, Set One (“Interrogatories”) on Plaintiff Shahid Shaikh (“Plaintiff”). (Fierro Decl. ¶¶4, 5; Ex. 1.) Defendants have not received any response to this propounded discovery nor any communication regarding it. (Fierro Decl. ¶6.) MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendants argue Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses justifies granting their motion to compel responses without objection. (Motion, p. 3.) Defendants also request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 for the costs incurred in bringing this motion based on 5 hours of work by Defendants’ counsel in bringing this motion. (Motion, p. 3.) Defendants’ sanctions request is based on 1.5 hours of attorney time preparing the motion, 1.5 hours reviewing and responding to any opposition, and 2 hours attending the hearing on this motion, for a total of 5 hours at a rate of $250.00 per hour — plus an additional $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, p. 3; Fierro Decl. ¶7.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed to the instant motion.ANALYSISI. Motions to Compel DiscoveryWritten responses to form interrogatories must be made under oath. (Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210(a), 2030.250(a).) The response must be served within thirty days after the interrogatories are served on the responding party. (Section 2030.260(a).) If the responding party fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any objection to the interrogatories. (Section 2030.290(a).) If a party fails to respond to form interrogatories, the party serving the discovery may move for an order compelling a response. (Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 2030.300(a).) The court shall also impose monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel a response, unless it finds the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.It is appropriate here to grant Defendants’ motion to compel. Plaintiff here has failed to provide timely responses to Defendants’ Interrogatories. (Fierro Decl. ¶5.) Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond, in turn, prevents Defendants from conducting essential discovery. The Court thus agrees with Defendants that requiring Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendants’ Interrogatories without objection is justified. II. SanctionsDefendants also request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 for the costs incurred in bringing this motion, attesting to 5 hours worked at a $250.00 hourly rate, including 1.5 hours of attorney time preparing the motion, 1.5 hours reviewing and responding to any opposition, and 2 hours attending the hearing on this motion, in additional to the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, p. 3; Fierro Decl. ¶7.) The Court finds Defendants’ $250.00 hourly rate is reasonable. Defendants are also entitled to recover the $60 filing fee incurred in bringing this motion. However, the Court reduces Defendants’ total number of hours worked to 2.5 hours — 1.5 hours to prepare the instant motion and 1 hour to prepare for and attend the hearing, for a total of $625.00. Defendants’ motion is unopposed; the Court’s reduction thus reflects the reasonable total number of hours worked in preparing a reply and attending the hearing. Defendants are thus entitled to sanctions in the amount of $685.00 for the reasonable costs incurred to bring the instant motion.RULINGBased on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED.  Plaintiff to serve code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days of this order.Defendants’ request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $685.00. Sanctions to be paid within 30 days of this order.
