And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to confirm the minor's compromise, citing several reasons. Firstly, the petition lacks subsequent medical records after the minor's discharge from the hospital, leaving the court to speculate about his current condition. Secondly, the petition does not contain a report of the minor's current condition, as required by law. The judge notes that the minor's attorney has submitted a declaration stating that the minor has completely recovered from his injuries, but this statement is not supported by any detail and fails to address whether the minor received any follow-up treatment. The judge is also concerned about the allocation of the settlement, as it does not contain any information about the relationship between the minor and the person who received $150,000 in settlement. Finally, the judge is not persuaded by the attorney's declaration regarding his fees, which do not provide any significant detail about the work he performed. The judge has ordered the attorney to file an amended petition and proposed order that includes the required medical records, a declaration about the other person's injuries and medical expenses, and a declaration explaining how the division of the settlement funds is equitable. The judge has also reduced the attorney's fees to 25%.
