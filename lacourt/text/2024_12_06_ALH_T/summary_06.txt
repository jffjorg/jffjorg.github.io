Here is the text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is to grant the defendants' motions to compel discovery, including responses to requests for admission, form interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to provide responses to their discovery requests, which is a violation of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery justifies granting the motions to compel. The Court also grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $480.00 for each motion, for a total of $1,440.00. The plaintiff is ordered to serve code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days of this order.
