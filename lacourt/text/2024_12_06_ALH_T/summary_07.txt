And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Sarkis Gezalyan and Susana Muradian. The Cross-Complainants, Azat Gezalyan and Shapiro Ventures LLC, have alleged a fraudulent loan scheme and a Ponzi scheme involving Cross-Defendants. The Court has ruled that the Cross-Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support the causes of action for breach of contract and breach of implied contract, and has sustained the demurrer as to these causes of action. However, the Court has overruled the demurrer as to the remaining causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, violation of Penal Code section 496, unjust enrichment, accounting, and injunctive relief. The Court has granted Cross-Complainants 20 days leave to amend their complaint.
