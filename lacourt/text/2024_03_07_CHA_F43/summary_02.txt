And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Cesar's Marble & Granite Inc., against the Plaintiff, Onymar S.R.L. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff does not have the legal capacity to sue because it is a foreign entity not registered with the California Secretary of State, and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Plaintiff opposed the demurrer, arguing that standing cannot be raised on demurrer because it does not challenge factual allegations, and that the complaint sufficiently pleads all necessary elements of the causes of action.

The Judge found that the Defendant's request for judicial notice of screenshots from the California Secretary of State's website was insufficient and denied the request. The Judge also found that the Defendant had not provided sufficient basis to demur on the basis of lack of capacity to sue.

As a result, the Judge overruled the Defendant's demurrer. The Defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
