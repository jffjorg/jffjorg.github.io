SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On October 20,
2023, Plaintiff Welding Evolution, Inc. served Defendant Eric Cortes with
Requests for Production of Documents. The responses were originally due on
November 22, 2023. On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff gave Defendant a 30-day
extension, with a new response deadline of December 21, 2023. On December 18,
2023, Defendant asked for another thirty day extension. The new deadline was
January 22, 2024. Defendant asked for another extension. Plaintiff gave a brief
extension to January 24, 2024, and told Defendant that no further extensions
would be allowed.
 
Though Plaintiff
gave Defendant three extensions, no responses were received by January 24,
2024, the last deadline, so Plaintiff filed this motion on January 30, 2024. After
Plaintiff filed this motion, Defendant served responses on February 8, 2024.
Defendant opposes the motion on the basis that he served responses after the
motion was filed, which he argues would moot the motion. Plaintiff argues in
its reply that the motion is not moot because Defendant’s late responses were
not code-compliant and contained improper objections.
 
Plaintiff seeks
sanctions in the amount of $2,175.00 against Defendant Cortes and his counsel.
 
ANALYSIS
Requests
for Production
A propounding
party may move to compel responses to requests for production of documents
where the responding party fails to provide responses. (CCP § 2031.300.) The
responding party must provide responses within thirty days after the demand is
served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The responding party waives all
objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to timely respond
to requests for production of documents. (CCP § 2031.300.)
 
While Defendant
failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s requests, Defendant did eventually
provide responses after Plaintiff filed this motion. However, Defendant’s “responses”
were not code-compliant and failed to respond to each request individually.
Instead, Defendant’s responses were a blanket response to all of Plaintiff’s
requests that he did not have the documents. Additionally, Defendant indicated
the other parties had the documents and that Plaintiff should refer to the
responses of the other Defendants, rather than giving his own separate responses.
It was also improper for Defendant to include objections because Defendant
waived all objections by failing to timely respond to the requests. Finally, Defendant’s
statements of compliance were also in an improper format.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant must provide code-compliant, objection-free responses to each
individual request for production.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $2,175.00 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel for the motion. The amount was based on Plaintiff’s counsel
spending 3 hours on the motion at $705 an hour, plus the $60 filing fee. (Kramer
Decl., ¶¶ 11-13.) The amount that Plaintiff has requested appears to be
reasonable for this motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel are granted in
the total amount of $2,175.00 for the motion.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to requests for production is granted.
2.      Defendant
is ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the total
amount of $2,175.00. Defendant and Defendant’s counsel are ordered to pay these
sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within twenty (20) days.
