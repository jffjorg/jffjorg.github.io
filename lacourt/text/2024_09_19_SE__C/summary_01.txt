Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the defendant, ESTATE OF LEDA FAUST, without prejudice. The motion was filed on July 1, 2024, and served by constructive service on July 1, 2024, at 3:41 p.m. However, no opposition was filed by the plaintiffs, and the motion was denied on procedural grounds. The judge found that the motion was properly served, but the lack of opposition cannot be attributed to improper service. The judge also noted that there was no evidence submitted to support the arguments raised by the Moving Party, and therefore, summary judgment/adjudication cannot be granted. The judge also raised concerns about whether Taylor Moore, the personal representative of the estate, is authorized to act on behalf of the defendant, Leda Faust.
