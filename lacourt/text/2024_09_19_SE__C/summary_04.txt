Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the plaintiff's unopposed petition for relief from Government Code §945.4, which allows the plaintiff to file a claim against the City of Los Angeles, despite the fact that the claim was not filed in a timely manner. The plaintiff alleged that the failure to file the claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as it was not until after the deposition of defendant Shepherd that it became apparent that the City of Los Angeles was involved in the action. The judge found that the plaintiff acted diligently to prosecute the action and that the failure to file the claim was excusable. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a First Amended Complaint naming the City of Los Angeles as a defendant within 30 days.

The judge also granted an ex parte application to advance the hearing date on the motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants Kyle Hardy Shepherd and Airport Van Rental, Inc. The motions were advanced to October 22, 2024, and opposition and reply papers were ordered to be filed and served in accordance with the new hearing date.
