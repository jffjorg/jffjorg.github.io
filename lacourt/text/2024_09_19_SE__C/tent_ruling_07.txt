HEARING:

I.       
Defendant SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC.’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) is DENIED as
MOOT. 
 
   
II.       
Defendant SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC.’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (set one) is DENIED
as MOOT. 
 
  III.       
Defendant SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC.’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Request for Admissions (set one) is DENIED
as MOOT. 
 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
These Motions to Compel Further Discovery
Responses were filed on July 1, 2024. 
 
In a Consolidated Opposition to the subject motions,
Plaintiff indicates that supplemental responses to all of the discovery at
issue was served on September 11, 2024—after the motions were filed. 
 
In the Reply documents filed on September 12,
2024, Defendant SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC. (“Defendant”) admits that untimely
supplemental responses have been served, but maintains that monetary sanctions
are justified. 
 
Where supplemental responses were served after
a motion to compel further is filed, the Court has discretion to deny a motion
to compel further as moot, and just impose sanctions. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 409.)
 
It is undisputed that supplemental responses
were served after the subject motions were filed. The sufficiency of Plaintiff’s
supplemental responses are not at issue here. Where supplemental responses were
served after the date the Motions were filed, there is nothing further to
compel and the Motions to Compel Further Responses are DENIED as MOOT. 
 
However,
it is also undisputed that supplemental requests were not served until after
the Subject Motions were filed—and only a mere eight days before this scheduled
hearing date. The Court finds good cause for the issuance of reasonable
monetary sanctions as follows: 
 
Plaintiff
MARIA AGUIRRE and her counsel of record are ORDERED to pay Defendant SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC. and their counsel
of record sanctions in the total amount of $1,770.00 ($295/hr. x 2 hrs. per
each Motion)  no later than 90 days
from the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be
extended per agreement of the parties. No costs are awarded—the reservation
receipts attached to the Moving Papers indicate that no filing fees were paid.
