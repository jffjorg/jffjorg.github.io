And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions to compel further discovery responses filed by SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC. as moot, since the plaintiff, MARIA AGUIRRE, served supplemental responses after the motions were filed. The judge finds that the plaintiff's late service of the supplemental responses is a valid reason to deny the motions to compel further responses. However, the judge also orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay the defendant, SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC., and its counsel $1,770.00 in monetary sanctions for the delay in serving the supplemental responses. The sanctions must be paid within 90 days of the issuance of the order, unless the parties agree to an extension.
