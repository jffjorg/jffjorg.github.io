And here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action case, continuing the hearing to a later date to give counsel more time to meet and confer. The plaintiff had moved to compel the defendant's further responses to a request for production of documents, but the defendant stood by its objections. The judge instructed counsel to make further efforts to resolve the discovery disputes, citing California law and precedent. If counsel are unable to informally resolve the disputes, they are instructed to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.
