And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff, Oscar Arthur Saborio, filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles in August 2022, alleging premises liability arising from a bicycle accident in Encino. The City did not appear in the matter, and the plaintiff failed to appear for a final status conference and trial, leading to the dismissal of the complaint in February 2024. The plaintiff's counsel attributed the failure to appear to the prior attorney's departure from the law firm in November 2022 and the lack of calendaring by the remaining attorneys. The judge found that the dismissal was the result of inadvertence or neglect of counsel and granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge also set a new trial setting conference and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the new hearing dates.
