And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion by Whole Foods Market California, Inc. (Defendant) to compel a neuropsychological examination of Gabrielle Kreutzer (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff has alleged general negligence and premises liability arising from a slip and fall at one of the Defendant's stores. The Defendant seeks the examination to determine the Plaintiff's mental condition, but the Court finds that the motion was not timely served and therefore denies the motion without prejudice. The Court also notes that a mental examination is only appropriate if the Plaintiff alleges continuing emotional distress, and that the Defendant must support the motion with a meet and confer declaration.
