22STCV03788
Defendants’ Motion for Second Physical Examination of
Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On January 31, 2022, Kevin Freeman (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Emmanuel and Kristin Dossetti (collectively
“Defendants”) and Does 1 through 50, asserting a negligence cause of action
arising out of dog bite incident occurring on September 13, 2021.  
Defendants filed their answer on May 30, 2023.
On May 13, 2024, the Court denied, without
prejudice, Defendants’ motion for a second physical examination of Plaintiff,
based upon the failure of moving parties to file a declaration showing that
they made a reasonable effort to meet and confer with Plaintiff about the
examination before filing the motion. 
(See Minute Order dated May 13, 2024, at p. 3.)  The Court also cautioned moving parties that
if they were to file a further motion, they “must adhere to the requirements of
the Code, including, but not limited to, Code of Civil Procedure section
2032.310, subdivision (b).  (Ibid.) 
On June 18, 2024, Defendants filed this
motion for a second physical examination of Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 5, and Defendants filed a reply on July 12. 
This motion was initially set for hearing on July
19, but, due to a cyber attack on the Los Angeles Superior Court, the Court
continued the hearing to August 9. 
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by means
of a physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent
of any party, or (3) a natural person in the custody or under the legal control
of a party, in any action in which the mental or physical condition (including
the blood group) of that party or other person is in controversy in the
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
In a personal injury action, the defendant may
demand one physical examination of plaintiff as of right, without advance leave
of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
If a defendant seeks a further physical
examination of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first
file a motion and “obtain leave of court.” (Id., § 2032.310, subd. (a).)
Such a motion must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the person or persons who will perform the examination.” (Id., subd.
(b).) The court may grant such a motion “only for good cause shown.” (Id.,
§ 2032.320, subd. (a).) A showing of good cause generally requires “that the
party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be
relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Super. Ct. (1987)
43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) 
“An order granting a physical or mental
examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the
examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and
procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (d).) “The court is to describe in detail
who will conduct the examination, where and when it will be conducted, the
conditions, scope and nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and
procedures to be employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests
and procedures’—fully and in detail—is to list them by
name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.) 
The moving party must support the motion with a
meet and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd.
(b).) A meet and confer declaration must state facts “showing a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (Id., § 2016.040.) 
The examination will be limited to whatever
condition is “in controversy” in the action. (Id., § 2032.020, subd.
(a).)  
Discussion
The statutory meet and confer
requirement is satisfied.  Following the hearing
on May 13, Defendants made several attempts to meet and confer with
Plaintiff, but Plaintiff did not respond to Defendants’ letters or telephone
calls.  (Cadena, ¶¶ 14-18.) 
In the Minute Order dated May 13, 2024, the Court specifically
cautioned Defendants that if they were to file a new motion, they “must adhere
to the requirements of the Code, including, but not limited to, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.310, subdivision (b). 
(Minute Order dated May 13, 2024, at p. 3.)  
Defendants have not done so. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, subdivision (b) requires that
a motion for an examination must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions,
scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the
specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination.”
(Id., subd. (b).)  Defendants’
motion identifies examiner and the examiner’s specialty, the place of the
examination, but the motion does not specify the time and date of the
examination.  That is required.  In addition, the statement that the “examination
shall include whatever history and tests the doctor deems relevant” is
impermissibly vague, even in the context here, in which numerous tests are specifically
enumerated.
Accordingly, the motion is
DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES without prejudice the motion of Defendants for a
second physical examination of Plaintiff Kevin Freeman.
Moving Party is to give notice.
