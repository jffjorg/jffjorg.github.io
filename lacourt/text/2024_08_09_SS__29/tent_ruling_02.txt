Defendant’s Motion for Neuropsychological
Examination of Plaintiff
 
Tentative
The Court DENIES the motion without prejudice.
 
Background
On
August 12, 2022, Gabrielle Kreutzer (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Whole Foods Market California, Inc. for general negligence and premises
liability arising out of a slip and fall occurring at the Whole Foods Market
located at 6350 West Third Street in Los Angeles on July 16, 2022.
 
On December 15,
2022, Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Food Market, Inc. dba
Whole Foods Market (erroneously sued as Whole Foods Market California, Inc.)
(“Defendant”) filed its answer.
 
On July 17, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel
Plaintiff’s compliance if a neuropsychological examination. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 29. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any party
may obtain discovery . . . by means of a physical or mental examination of (1) a
party to the action, (2) an agent of any party, or (3) a natural person in the
custody or under the legal control of a party, in any action in which the
mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of that party or other
person is in controversy in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
In a personal injury action, the defendant may
demand one physical examination of plaintiff as of right, without advance leave
of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.)  
If a defendant seeks a further physical examination
of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first file a motion
and “obtain leave of court.” (Id., § 2032.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion
must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination.” (Id., subd. (b).) The
court may grant such a motion “only for good cause shown.” (Id., §
2032.320, subd. (a).) A showing of good cause generally requires “that the
party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be
relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Super. Ct. (1987) 43
Cal.3d 833, 840.)   
“An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(d).) “The court is to describe¿in detail¿who will conduct the
examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and nature
of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be
employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests and procedures’—fully¿and¿in
detail—is to list them by name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct.¿(2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)¿¿ 
¿The moving party¿must support the motion with a
meet and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd.
(b).) A meet and confer declaration must state facts “showing a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”¿ (Id., § 2016.040.)¿¿¿¿ 
The examination will be limited to whatever
condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Id., § 2032.020, subd.
(a).) A mental examination is appropriate only if the plaintiff alleges
continuing emotional distress. (Doyle v. Super. Ct. ¿(1996) 50
Cal.App.4th¿1878, 1886-1887.) “While a plaintiff may place his mental
state in controversy by a general allegation of severe emotional distress, the
opposing party may not require him to undergo psychiatric testing solely on the
basis of speculation that something of interest may surface.”  (Vinson,¿supra,
43 Cal.3d at 840.) By alleging a causal link between the emotional
distress and the defendant's conduct, however, a plaintiff “implicitly claims
it was not caused by a preexisting mental condition, thereby raising the
question of alternative sources for the distress.” (Ibid.)  
A court
shall not (except under “exceptional circumstances”) order a mental examination
if the plaintiff stipulates (1) “that no claim is being made for mental and
emotional distress over and above that usually associated with the physical
injuries claimed” and (2) “that no expert testimony regarding this usual mental
and emotional distress will be presented at trial in support of the claim for
damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (b) & (c).)
Discussion
Defendant’s motion was not timely served.  The motion was served electronically on July
17, 2024.  Papers related to this motion
needed to be served on Plaintiff no later than July 16, 2024 – 16 court days before
the hearing, plus two court days. (see Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b)
& 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) The Court finds service of this motion untimely.
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion
without prejudice.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant’s motion for a neuropsychological examination
of Plaintiff.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
