22STCV04971
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative,
for Summary Adjudication, filed by Defendant Swink’s Creations, Inc.
TENTATIVE
The motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN
PART. 
Background
On February 9, 2022, Omar Garcia Aviles
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Samuel I. Bekerian, Henaz Bekerian, and
Does 1 through 50 for (1) negligence – Labor Code section 3700, et seq., (2)
negligence per se, (3) premises liability, and (4) general negligence, all
arising out of a construction accident on October 24, 2020.
On September 30, 2022, Samuel I. Bekerian and
Henaz Bekerian filed their answer.
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff amended his complaint
to name Swink’s Creations, Inc. as Doe 1 and August Roofing, Inc. (“August”) as
Doe 2.
On July 26, 2023, August filed an answer.
On August 17, 2023, Swink’s Creations, Inc.
filed an answer.
August settled with Plaintiff. On July 31, 2024, the Court granted the
motion of August for a good faith settlement determination under Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6
On March 22, 2024, Defendant Swink’s Creations,
Inc. (“Defendant”) filed this motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative,
for summary adjudication. On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. Defendant
filed a reply, along with objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence, on June
21, 2024.
The hearing was initially set for June 27,
2024, and was continued so that certain evidence that was lodged with the Court
could be filed.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
Defendant asserts 40 objections to Plaintiff’s
evidence. Evidence presented in
support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be
admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne
LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The Court must “consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have
been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
None of Defendant’s
objections are in proper form. A party stating an objection must identify the
evidence (and not mere statements in a brief or in a separate statement) as to
which the objection is asserted. The Court OVERRULES Objections Nos. 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31-33, 35, and 39 on this basis.
As to the
remaining objections, all objections must “quote or set forth the objectionable
statement or material.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1352(b)(3).) Defendant has
not done so.  The Court OVERRULES
Objections Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 34, 36-38,
and 40 on this basis.
Discussion
On October 24, 2020, Plaintiff fell from a
ladder while completing stucco work on Samuel Bekerian’s residence located at
11812 Poema Place, in Chatsworth, California. (Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], Nos. 1-2, 5-6.)
A little more than two months earlier, in August
2020, Bekerian and Defendant entered into a contract for Defendant to build a
new patio cover, add a ceiling, and remove and replace two new posts on the
existing patio” of Bekerian’s residence. (DSUMF, No. 3; Plaintiff’s Separate of
Additional Material Facts [“PSAMF”], No. 2.) 
The contract also required Defendant to perform
a “daily cleanup,” and a “haul of trash & debris.” (Defendant’s Compendium,
Exh. 2.) Upon completion of the project, Defendant was required to “remove all
debris and surplus materials … from the site of the project and leave such site
in ‘broom clean’ condition.” (Ibid.) Defendant’s representative testified in
deposition that while Defendant was doing work on the property, it was
Defendant’s responsibility “to keep [the] work area clean and safe.” (Moreno
Decl., Exh. 1 [“Athey Depo.”], at 35:18-22.) Defendant’s work on the property
was not complete as of the date of Plaintiff’s accident. (PSAMF, No. 8; Athey
Depo., at 33:17-20.)
Bekerian hired Plaintiff to perform stucco
work. (DSUMF, No. 5.) Defendant did not employ Plaintiff. (DSUMF, No. 9.)
The accident occurred as Plaintiff was
ascending a metal ladder; as he reached the second to the last step, the metal ladder
swung to the left, away from the residence, and Plaintiff fell. (DSUMF, Nos. 6,
11.)
Defendant worked on the property the day before
Plaintiff’s accident. (PSAMF, No. 3.) No employees or representatives of Defendant
were present at the property on the day of the accident. (DSUMF, No. 8; PSAMF,
No. 4.)
There is some evidence in the record that the ladder
that Plaintiff fell from was one of Defendant’s ladders. (Athey Depo., at
50:15-24 & Exh. 3.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant left trash and
debris on the property from its work, and that this trash or debris caused or
contributed to Plaintiff’s accident. (DSUMF, No. 16.) When Plaintiff was asked
in his deposition, however, whether a trash pile near the accident had anything
to do with his accident, Plaintiff replied, “I don’t know.” (DSUMF, No. 17.)
Plaintiff also alleges that when Defendant completed
its work, it left behind an uneven walking surface and construction debris that
contributed to Plaintiff’s accident. (DSUMF, No. 19.) 
Plaintiff testified that there was plastic on
the roof edge that may have contributed to the sliding of the ladder. (Moreno
Decl., Exh. 2 [“Plaintiff Depo.”] at 82:6-20, 104:9-105:6.)
In his complaint, Plaintiff asserts four causes of action against
Defendant: (1) negligence – Labor Code section 3700, et seq., (2) negligence
per se, (3) premises liability, and (4) general negligence. Defendant now moves
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to each of
the four causes of action.
Plaintiff concedes that summary adjudication is proper as to the
Defendant on the First and Second Causes of Action. Based on the concession of
Plaintiff, and the undisputed facts in the record, the Court finds that Defendant
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the First and Second Causes of
Action in the complaint and grants Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication
of these two causes of action.
That leaves Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action (for premises
liability) and Fourth Cause of Action (negligence). 
The basic elements of a cause of action for
negligence and for premises liability are the same: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner
v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  
Third Cause of Action (Premises Liability)
Defendant moves for summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s cause of
action for premises liability on the ground that it did not have ownership or
control of the premises. (Mem. at 6-7.)
Ownership or control of the
premises relates to the element of duty. Those who own, possess, or control property
generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing the property to
avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm. (Ortega v. Kmart
Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205; Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th
1149, 1159-1163, 1170-1171; Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the
property owner (or a non-owner who exercises possession of or control over the
property) is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the
condition reasonably safe … or to give a warning adequate to enable [others] to
avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443,
446; accord Alcaraz, supra, at pp. 1170-1171.)  
The law is also
clear, however, that “[a] defendant cannot be held liable for the defective
or dangerous condition of property which it did not own, possess, or control. (Isaacs
v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134; accord Gray v. America West Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 76, 81.) Premises
liability does not extend to a person or entity that does not own, does not possess,
or does not control the premises at the time of the accident. 
Here, although Defendant did not own the premises, it was performing
work in the very area in which Plaintiff’s accident occurred. Defendant had
some responsibility to keep the area clean. On this record, there is evidence
from which a trier of fact could reasonably draw an inference that Defendant
was, to at least some degree, exercising “control” over the premises. Accordingly,
the motion for summary adjudication as to the premises liability cause of
action is denied.
Fourth Cause of Action (Negligence)
Defendant moves for summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s negligence
cause of action on the ground that nothing that it did, or failed to do, caused
or contributed to Plaintiff’s accident. (Mem. at 7-8.)
In a negligence cause of
action, the general rule governing duty is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone
is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also
for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or
skill in the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the
latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon
himself or herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the
California Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person
has a legal duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for
the safety of others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)  
Although Defendant argues that it had nothing
to do with the accident in this matter, Plaintiff testified that he saw plastic
on the edge of the patio roof (which Defendant was installing) and this plastic
was at the spot of the roof against which the ladder was placed. (Plaintiff
Depo., at 82:6-20, 104:9-105:6.) Plaintiff contends that this plastic was slippery
and caused or contributed to Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. (Opp. at
12.) In addition, Plaintiff contends that whoever left the ladder in place, erect
and unsecured, created a dangerous condition that contributed to Plaintiff’s
injuries, and there is at least some evidence in the record that this was done
by Defendant. (Athey Depo., at 50:15-24 & Exh. 3; Defendant’s Compendium,
Exh. 3, at 168:20-24; Opp. at 11.) 
On this factual record, there are triable
issues on the material issue of whether, at least in some degree, the actions
of Defendant caused or contributed to Plaintiff’s accident. Accordingly, the
motion for summary adjudication as to the negligence cause of action is denied.

Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the first and second causes of action. 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the third and fourth causes of action.
