And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Plaintiff's motion for an order deeming Defendant's responses to requests for admission as admitted. The Plaintiff served the Defendant with requests for admission on January 8, 2024, but the Defendant did not respond timely. On August 1, 2024, the Defendant served verified responses to the requests for admission, which were in substantial compliance with the relevant code section. The court finds that the Defendant's failure to serve a timely response to the requests for admission did not necessitate the motion, and therefore the request for sanctions is denied. The court also finds that the Plaintiff did not request sanctions in the notice of motion and motion, and therefore the request for sanctions is denied.
