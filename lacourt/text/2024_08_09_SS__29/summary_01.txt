And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendants' motion for a second physical examination of plaintiff Kevin Freeman. The motion was filed on June 18, 2024, and the hearing was originally set for July 19, but was continued to August 9 due to a cyber attack on the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Judge found that the defendants did not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, specifically section 2032.310, subdivision (b), which requires that a motion for an examination specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty of the person or persons who will perform the examination. The Judge also found that the defendants' motion was vague and did not specify the time and date of the examination. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
