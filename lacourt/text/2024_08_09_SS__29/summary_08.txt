And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Timoteo O. Preciado, filed a motion to deem the defendant, Diana Rodriguez Suastegui's, responses to the requests for admission as admitted. The plaintiff served the requests on January 8, 2024, but the defendant did not respond timely. On August 1, 2024, the defendant served verified responses to the requests, which were in substantial compliance with the relevant code section.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for a deemed-admitted order, citing the defendant's timely responses to the requests. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not request sanctions in the notice of motion and motion, and the brief reference to sanctions in the caption did not give sufficient notice as to against whom sanctions are sought.
