And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The plaintiff's complaint was dismissed on February 21, 2024, after they failed to appear for the Final Status or Trial. However, the plaintiff's counsel claims that the dismissal was due to inadvertence or neglect, as the prior attorney assigned to the case ceased working at the law firm in November 2022 and no one calendared the important dates. The judge has found that the dismissal was indeed the result of the plaintiff's counsel's mistake, and has therefore granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge has also set aside the order of dismissal and set a new trial setting conference for 60 days.
