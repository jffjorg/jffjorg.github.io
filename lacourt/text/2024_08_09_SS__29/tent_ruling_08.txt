23STCV24624
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Deeming Defendant to Have Admitted The Matters
Specified in Requests for Admission
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On October 10, 2023,
Timoteo O. Preciado (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Diana Rodriguez
Suastegui, Diego Alquicira (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 25
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an accident
occurring on January 19, 2023. 
 
On December 11, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On January 5, 2024,
Defendants filed their answer to the FAC. 
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant
Diana Rodriguez Suastegui (“Defendant”) with Requests for Admissions (Set One).
(Garcia Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  Defendant
did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion for a deemed-admitted order and for sanctions.
 
On August 6, 2024, Defendant filed
her opposition.  Attached to the
opposition are responses to the Requests for Admission served on August 1.  (Okunor Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.) 
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of
its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding
party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue
of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just
impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 

Discussion
Plaintiff served Defendant on January
8, 2024, with Requests for Admissions (Set One). (Garcia Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh.
A.)  Defendant did not serve a timely
response.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On August 1, 2024, Defendant served verified
responses to the Requests for Admission. 
(Okunor Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.) These responses are in substantial
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for a deemed-admitted order.
 
The request for
sanctions is DENIED.  In general, sanctions
are mandatory where, as here, a party’s “failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated” a motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Here,
however, Plaintiff did not request sanctions in the notice of motion and
motion, and the brief reference to sanctions in the caption does not give sufficient
as to against whom sanctions are sought.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion
for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions also
DENIED.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
