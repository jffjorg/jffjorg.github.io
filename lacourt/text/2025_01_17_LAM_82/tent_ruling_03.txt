 Case Number:  24STCP00957    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  82 Sylvia Bedrossian
v. California State Personnel Board, et al.
Case No.
24STCP00957
Motion to Quash
 
            Petitioner
Sylvia Bedrossian (“Petitioner”) filed this petition for writ of mandate
challenging her five-day suspension for failing to recognize and report three
simulated phishing emails.  On October
30, 2024, the State Compensation Insurance Fund, which is the real party in
interest (the “real party”), filed a motion to quash due to lack of
service.  The court held a hearing on
December 5, 2024, at which counsel for the real party asked to be served “by
having a copy of the petition and two copies of the notice and acknowledgment
of receipt” sent to him directly.  (See
Court’s Minute Order, dated December 5, 2024.) 
Petitioner represented that she would have her attorney service do so
and would file a proof of service.  (See
ibid.)  
 
            On December
17, 2024, Petitioner filed an opposition stating that she served the petition
and two copies of the notice of acknowledgment and receipt form.  This representation is not contained within a
sworn declaration; the representation does not make clear whether Petitioner or
her attorney service served the documents; and there is no proof of service on
file.  However, Respondent did not file a
reply brief or otherwise dispute this representation.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court does not have sufficient information to resolve the
motion.  The parties shall be prepared to
discuss these issues.
