And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner Michael D. Marcus's motion to augment the record with four documents. The documents are an email from Dr. Grossman, a handwritten note from Dr. Koretz, a certified administrative record, and a letter from Petitioner to Respondent's counsel. The judge found that the email was not excluded at the hearing and is already part of the record, so the motion is denied as moot. The judge also found that the handwritten note was not introduced during the hearing and was not improperly excluded, so the motion is denied with respect to that document. The certified administrative record is already part of the record, so the motion is denied as moot. The letter from Petitioner to Respondent's counsel is not appropriate for the administrative record, so the motion is denied with respect to that document. The judge has also continued the trial date from February 5, 2025, to a later date, and set a new briefing schedule.
