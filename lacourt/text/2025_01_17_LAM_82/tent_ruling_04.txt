v. California Department of Motor Vehicles
Case No.
24STCP01215
[Tentative] Order
Denying Motion to Augment Record
[Tentative] Order
Continuing Trial Date
 
Michael D. Marcus (“Petitioner”)
filed this petition for writ of mandate challenging the suspension of his
driver’s license by the Department of Motor Vehicles (“Respondent” or the
“DMV”).   The suspension was based on a
finding that Petitioner’s “medical information was not favorable” and was
imposed after a driver safety investigation, pursuant to Vehicle Code section
13953, determined that Petitioner is unable to operate a motor vehicle safely
because of a medical condition, viz., mild cognitive impairment and dementia.  (See Petition for Writ of Mandate
(“Pet.”) pp. 54, 105-107 of 114.)  Now,
Petitioner seeks to augment the record with four documents.  
            
“As a general rule, a hearing on a writ of administrative
mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the proceeding before the
administrative agency.”  (Richardson v. City and County of San
Francisco (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 671, 702.) 
However, “[w]here the court finds that there is relevant evidence that .
. . was improperly excluded at the hearing before respondent, it may enter
judgment as provided in subdivision (f) remanding the case to be reconsidered
in the light of that evidence; or, in cases in which the court is authorized by
law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, the court may admit
the evidence at the hearing on the writ without remanding the case.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (e).)  The movant must establish “the relevancy of
the evidence” and demonstrate that the evidence was improperly excluded at the
administrative hearing.  (Ibid.) 
 
The court rules as follows:
 
Exhibit A – Petitioner seeks to
augment the record with an email from Dr. Grossman.  This email was not excluded at the hearing on
December 19, 2023.  To the contrary,
Petitioner read the email into the record verbatim, and the hearing officer
considered its contents.  Because the
contents of this email are part of the record, the motion is denied as moot
with respect to Exhibit A.
 
Exhibit B – Petitioner seeks to
augment the record with a handwritten note from Dr. Koretz stating: “I would
have completed the DMV form exactly as Dr. Grossman” and “Because I
share Dr. Grossman’s perspective, it would be incorrect for me to state
otherwise.”  Petitioner referenced this
note during the hearing—describing it as “the statement from Dr. Koretz, who
says that he really would do the same things that Dr. Grossman did . . .”—but
Petitioner did not read it verbatim into the record.  Nor did he seek to introduce the note during
the hearing.  Because this note was not
improperly excluded by the hearing officer, the motion is denied with respect
to Exhibit B.   
 
Exhibit C – This exhibit is already
part of the certified administrative record. 
Therefore, the motion is denied as moot with respect to Exhibit C.
 
Exhibit D – Petitioner seeks to
augment the administrative record with a letter he wrote Respondent’s counsel.
This letter, dated September 9, 2024, is not appropriately part of the
administrative record.  Therefore, the
motion is denied with respect to Exhibit D.
 
Trial is set for February 5, 2025,
but Petitioner did not file his opening brief. 
Therefore, the court continues the trial date and sets a new briefing
schedule.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
1.         Petitioner’s
motion to augment the administrative record is denied.
 
2.         The
court advances and continues the trial date from February 5, 2025, to
_________, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.
 
3.         Petitioner’s
opening brief shall be filed and served on or before _______, 2025.
 
4.         Petitioner
shall lodge the administrative record in electronic form on a thumb drive on or
before ________, 2025.
 
5.         Respondent’s
opposition brief shall be filed and served on or before _______, 2025.
 
6.         Petitioner’s
reply brief shall be filed and served on or before _______, 2025.
 
7.         The
court’s clerk shall provide notice.
