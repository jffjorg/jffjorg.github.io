American Honda Co., Inc. and Does 1 through    10     Case    # 23CHCV01999      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    AUGUST 5, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION ATTENDANCE  OF DEFENDANT’S PERSON MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE, REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 23CHCV01999    Motion  filed: 5/10/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Jose Rosales Alvarez (“Alvarez”  or “Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,  Inc. (“Defendant” or “AHM”) NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court to compel the attendance of Defendant AHM’s Person Most Knowledgeable  (“PMK”). Plaintiff also requests the Court to impose monetary sanctions against  AHM and its attorney of record in the amount of $2,929.50.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.    BACKGROUND   Plaintiff filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly  Act”) lawsuit over alleged defects in his 2020 Honda Civic with VIN: 19XFC1F38LE212889  (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant AHM. Plaintiff purchased  the Subject Vehicle on January 29, 2022, entering into a warranty agreement with  AHM. (Compl. ¶ 15.)   On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against AHM  and Does 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges one cause of action for Violation  of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty. Subsequently, AHM filed its  Answer to the Complaint on August 14, 2023.   On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to  Compel Deposition Attendance of Defendant’s PMK (the “Motion”). Subsequently,  AHM filed its Opposition on July 26, 2024, and Plaintiff replied on July 29,  2024.    ANALYSIS   To compel the deposition of a  party to an action or its officer, director, managing agent, or employee, the  deposing party need only serve a notice in compliance with Code of Civil  Procedure section 2025.240. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) Nothing  further is needed. If, after service of the deposition notice, the deponent  fails to appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410  ...” the deposing party may move for an order compelling the deponent’s  attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)   A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.       Meet and Confer   "Implicit in the requirement  that counsel contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a  requirement that counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith  attempt to resolve the issue," including by rescheduling.¿(Leko v.  Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1124.)   Here, on January 30, 2024, Plaintiff  served AHM with a Notice of Deposition for the deposition of AHM’s PMK and  custodian of records, for a deposition date of March 14, 2024. (Lupinek Decl.,  ¶ 3, Ex. “A.”) On February 23, 2024, AHM’s counsel notified Plaintiff that its  PMK was unavailable on the noticed date. (Id. ¶ 4.) Subsequently, on March 7,  2024, AHM served its written objection to the deposition notice. (Id. ¶ 5,  Ex. “C.”) In response, Plaintiff sent AHM a meet and confer letter discussing  the issues raised in AHM’s objection and requested available dates for AHM’s  PMK. (Id. ¶ 6.) No response was received by Plaintiff. (Ibid.)   On March 20, 2024, after  AHM’s PMK failed to appear at the deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel sent AHM an  email requesting available deposition dates previously requested. (Id. ¶  9.) However, by the time of filing of the Motion, Plaintiff had not heard  responses from AHM. (Id. ¶ 11.)   Based on these records, the  Court concludes that Plaintiff has made good faith attempts to reschedule and  resolve the issues.   2.       Separate  Statement   The California Rules of Court  rule 3.1345 (a)(5) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or  the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.  The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: ... (5) To compel or to quash the  production of documents or tangible things at a deposition[.]”   Here, Plaintiff has fulfilled the  requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.   B.      Motion to  Compel Deposition of AHM’s PMK    Code of Civil Procedure  section 2025.280 subdivision (a) provides that service of a deposition notice  “is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action [] to attend  and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored  information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”   An  objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410 must be written and served  “at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is  scheduled,” and pertains to an “error or irregularity” with the notice itself.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) The procedure for a deponent who  seeks to narrow the scope of a discovery request is to move for a protective  order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)   It is  important to note that objections alone do not stay the taking of the  deposition. To do so, the objecting party should move to quash the  deposition notice and stay the taking of the deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2025.410 (c), [“In addition to serving this written objection, a party may  also move for an order staying the taking of the deposition and quashing the  deposition notice. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer  declaration under Section 2016.040. The taking of the deposition is stayed  pending the determination of this motion.”])   Here, AHM’s objections are not rooted in any “error or  irregularity” within the deposition notice itself. Furthermore, AHM has not filed a motion to stay the taking of the  deposition or to quash the deposition notice. Although AHM claims that it is  not refusing to provide a PMK for the deposition, its inability to promptly  respond or schedule a date acceptable to Plaintiff’s counsel – attributed to  AHM’s logistical challenges, while notable (Opp’n. at pp. 5-6, Hom Decl. ¶¶ 10-11)  – does not suffice as a valid legal basis to override Plaintiff’s rights to  conduct necessary discovery under the statute.    Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to the deposition of AHM’s  PMK upon serving AHM with the valid Notice of Deposition on January 30, 2024.    Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Deposition  Attendance of AHM’s PMK.   C.     Request for  Monetary Sanctions   If  a motion to compel a party deponent to appear for a deposition is granted, the  court must impose a monetary sanction "in favor of the party who noticed  the deposition and against the deponent . . . unless the court finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." (Code Civ  Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)   Utilizing  a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the  Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs  incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $900.00, calculated at a  reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for two hours reasonably spent. Plaintiff has  attached a No Fee Reservation receipt to the Motion, indicating that no filing  fees were incurred.   Therefore, the Court GRANTS  IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, awarding $900.00 in favor  of Plaintiff.   CONCLUSION   The  Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Deposition  Attendance of Person  Most Knowledgeable of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   American  Honda Motor Co., Inc. and its attorney(s) of record are ordered to jointly and severally  pay $900.00 to Plaintiff.   Moving  party to give notice.
