And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition attendance of the defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) in the case of Jose Rosales Alvarez v. American Honda Co., Inc. The plaintiff had served a notice of deposition on the defendant's PMK and custodian of records, but the PMK failed to appear at the deposition. The judge found that the plaintiff had made good faith attempts to reschedule the deposition and resolve the issues, and that the defendant's objections were not rooted in any "error or irregularity" with the deposition notice.

The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $900.00, which was calculated based on the reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for two hours spent preparing the motion. The court found that the defendant and its attorney acted without substantial justification in failing to promptly respond to the deposition notice and schedule a deposition date.

The judge's ruling requires the defendant and its attorney to pay the plaintiff $900.00 in sanctions and to jointly and severally pay the amount to the plaintiff. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
