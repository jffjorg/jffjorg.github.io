And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to requests for admission (RFAs) in part and denies it in part. The respondent, White Cap Supply Holdings, LLC, is required to provide further responses to RFAs 64, 66, and 68-70 within 30 days. The court declines to issue monetary sanctions, finding that neither party has been completely successful in bringing or opposing the motion.

The dispute arose from the respondent's incomplete and evasive responses to the RFAs, which sought admissions regarding the administration of a medical test, known as "The b Test." The court finds that the respondent has a duty to make a reasonable investigation into the facts before answering the RFAs, and that a simple conversation between the respondent and the doctor who administered the test would provide the necessary information.
