Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint filed by Byung No Ree and Jung Hwa Ree, as Trustees of the 2004 Byung No Ree and Jung Hwa Ree Revocable Trust. The Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on February 9, 2023, and the Defendants failed to file a cross-complaint with their answer. The Defendants seek leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint, which arises out of the same agreement and tenancy as the Complaint. The Judge finds that there is no opposition to the motion and that there does not appear to be any bad faith on behalf of the Defendants. The Judge tentatively plans to grant the motion, but notes that the Defendants should be clear as to whom the parties are that are filing the cross-complaint when they file a cross-complaint. The Judge also notes that the current trial date is scheduled for October 21, 2024, which is less than one month away from the current hearing date of this motion. The Judge orders the Defendants to file the cross-complaint within 10 days if the motion is granted.
