And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses from the defendant to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, James H. Tuggle, individually and as trustee of the James Tuggle Family Revocable Living Trust, is seeking to compel the defendant, Reshma Kamath, to respond to the requests.

The judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to serve responses, without objections, to the discovery requests within 30 days of the date of the ruling. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant in the reduced amount of $3,023.50 in attorney's fees and costs.

The defendant had failed to timely respond to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff had properly served the requests on the defendant. The judge finds that the defendant has waived any objections to the requests and that the plaintiff is entitled to compel responses.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300, 2031.260, and 2023.050, which govern the timing and content of discovery responses. The judge also cites a previous case, Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-04, which states that a party who fails to timely respond to a discovery request waives any objections to the request.
