And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the hearing on the motion to strike the answer and first amended cross-complaint will be continued to November 12, 2024, to allow the plaintiff and co-defendants to comply with the meet-and-confer requirements and for the defendant to remedy its suspended status with the Franchise Tax Board. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and co-defendants to file meet-and-confer declarations and the defendant to file declarations and evidence showing it is in good standing with the Franchise Tax Board and the Secretary of State.

The defendant, Autocom, Inc., is currently suspended by the Franchise Tax Board and is unable to defend itself in the current matter due to its suspended status. The plaintiff seeks to strike the defendant's answer and first amended cross-complaint, arguing that the defendant lacks the legal capacity to defend itself.

The judge has taken judicial notice of two exhibits, a certificate of status from the California Secretary of State and an entity status letter from the California Franchise Tax Board, which show that the defendant is not in good standing with the Franchise Tax Board.

The court has found that the defendant is not in good standing with the Franchise Tax Board and lacks the legal capacity to defend itself. However, the court has also found that the defendant has begun the process of ending its suspension and will likely take two months to restore its status. Therefore, the court has given the defendant a short continuance to enable it to revive its corporate powers and validate its prior filings.
