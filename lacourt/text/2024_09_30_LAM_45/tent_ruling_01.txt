Background
This is a breach
of lease action. On November 24, 2020, Plaintiff Rexford Industrial filed this
action against Autocom, Inc. (Cross-Plaintiff), E-Freight Logistics, LLC
(Defendant), Ehsaan Mesghali (Defendant), Ali Manale (Defendant), and Does 1
through 10. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: (1) Breach of Lease
Agreement; (2) Breach of Sublease Agreement; and (3) Breach of Guaranty.
The complaint alleges the following:
Plaintiff owns real property at 16830 Avalon Blvd., Carson, located in the
County of Los Angeles, State of California, 90746 (the “Property”). (Compl., ¶
9.) Before March 5, 2020, Kingsview Industrial Center (KIC) owned this
property. (Id. at ¶ 10.) On February 5, 2010, KIC entered into a lease agreement
with Cross-Plaintiff leasing the Property for five years and two months
beginning on March 1, 2010. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Cross-Plaintiff agreed to pay
rent, various utilities, and taxes on the Property. (Ibid.)
On January 14, 2015, KIC and Defendant
agreed to extend the Master Lease term “for an additional sixty one month [sic]
period, commencing on May 1, 2015 and terminating on May 31, 2020” and
incorporating all terms of the Master Lease. (Id. at ¶ 14.) On or about
July 31, 2018, KIC, as master lessor, Cross-Plaintiff as sublessor, Defendant
E-Freight Logistics, LLC, as sublessee, and Defendants Ehsaan Mesghali and Ali
Manale, as guarantors, entered into a Standard Sublease Multi-Tenant agreement
pursuant under which Cross-Plaintiff agreed to sublease a portion of the
property to Defendant E-Freight Logistics, LLC for a term of one (1) year and
nine (9) months, commencing on September 1, 2018 and ending May 31, 2020. (Id.
at ¶ 16.) Under this agreement, Defendant E-Freight Logistics, LLC agreed to
pay to Cross-Plaintiff a base rent of $7,556.50 for the first 12 months, then
$7,783.20 thereafter until the end of the Sublease Agreement term, and pay 53.2
percent of the utilities owed on the Property. (Id. at ¶¶ 19-21.) On or
about March 5, 2020, KIC executed a grant deed whereby granting Plaintiff the
Property “subject to all other covenants, conditions, restrictions,
reservations, rights, rights-of-way, easements, dedications, offers of
dedications and other matters of record or that would be disclosed by an
accurate . . . survey of the Property.” (Id. at ¶
22.) Shortly afterward, Cross-Plaintiff defaulted under the Master Lease by failing
to pay as agreed. (Id. at ¶ 23.) 
On February 12,
2021, Cross-Plaintiff filed an answer denying 42 of Plaintiff’s factual
allegations and admitting 31 of Plaintiff’s factual allegations. 
On May 3, 2021,
Cross-Plaintiff filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff and Co-Defendants
alleging four causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of
Guarantee; (3) Conversion; and (4) Negligence.
On May 19, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a demurrer in response to the Cross-Complaint seeking to
dismiss Cross-Plaintiff’s cause of action for Negligence. 
On February 18,
2022, Cross-Plaintiff filed an Amended Cross-Complaint.
On March 8,
2022, Plaintiff filed a demurrer and motion to strike Cross-Complaint’s cause
of action for Negligence. The court overruled this demurrer on December 9,
2022. 
On August 28,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike Cross-Plaintiff ’s Answer and First
Amended Complaint. On September 5, 2024, Co-defendants filed a motion to join
Plaintiff’s motion to strike.
 


 
Legal
Standard
“The court may,
upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper,
strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike “all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (b).) The
grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 437, subd. (a).) Where
the motion to strike is based on a matter of which the court may take judicial notice
pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452 or 453, such matter must be specified in
the notice of motion, or in the supporting points and authorities, except as
the court my otherwise permit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437, subd. (b).)
            
Judicial Notice
Courts may take judicial notice of
“[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are
capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonable indisputable accuracy.” (Cal. Evid. Code, § 452(h).) Courts
may take judicial notice of “acts and records of the Secretary of State[,] and
it is not necessary to submit proof that a document has been filed with him to
establish such fact.” (Gigax v. Ralston Purina Co. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d
591, 601, fn. 6.; Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d)(2).) Courts may also take judicial
notice of records and “acts” of administrative agencies. (Scott v. JP Morgan
Chase Bank (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 752-753.)
Here, Plaintiff and Co-defendants request
the court take notice of two exhibits as grounds for this motion to strike: (1)
Secretary of State Certificate of Status – 05/01/2024; and (2) Franchise Tax
Board Entity Status Letter – 08/28/2024. (Pl.’s Request for Judicial Notice –
Exhibit “1” Secretary of State Certificate of Status (05/01/2024); Request for
Judicial Notice – Exhibit “2” Franchise Tax Board Entity Status Letter (08/28/2024).)
Exhibit “1” is a certificate of status from the California Secretary of State
which bears the Secretary of State’s Seal and signature. (Exhibit “1”.) The
certificate was generated on August 28, 2024. (Id.) Exhibit “2” is an
entity status letter from the California Franchise Tax Board which bears the
board’s logo. (Exhibit “2”.) Plaintiff and Co-Defendants present these
exhibits to prove Cross-Plaintiff is not in good standing with the Franchise
Tax Board and thus cannot properly defend itself in the current matter. (Pl.’s
Mtn. to Strike, pgs. 4:7-27, 5:15-23.) Cross-Plaintiff does not oppose
Plaintiff’s and Co-defendants’ request.
The court takes judicial notice of both the
Certificate of Status and the Entity Letter status because both are records of
state administrative agencies, found on the agency websites, and are not easily
disputed. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d)(2); Code Civ. Proc. § 437, subd. (b).) Accordingly,
the court admits both exhibits.
 
Evidentiary
Objections (if applicable)
None.
 


 
Discussion
The Motion to Strike is Procedurally Deficient because
Parties failed to meet and confer or attempt to meet and confer before filing
the Motion to Strike. 
            All
motions to strike require parties to “meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference” before filing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd.
(a).) “If an amended pleading is filed, the responding party shall meet and
confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a
motion to strike the amended pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) The
motion to strike must be accompanied by a declaration stating either that: (1)
the moving party met-and-conferred with party that filed the subject pleading,
and an agreement was not reached resolving all objections; or (2) the other
party failed to respond to the meet-and-confer request, or otherwise did not
meet-and-confer in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(3).) Although
the Court will not deny a motion to strike based on noncompliance, the court
may continue the hearing on the motion to strike until satisfactory
meet-and-confer efforts have been made. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5 subd. (a)(4),
(c).) 
            The
court finds Plaintiff and Co-Defendants fail to establish compliance with the
meet-and-confer requirements under section 435.5. Plaintiff and Co-Defendants
provide no proof that they attempted to meet and confer with Cross-Plaintiff before
filing their motions to strike on August 28, 2024 and September 5, 2024
respectively. Plaintiff’s counsel’s declarations do not establish that the
parties met and conferred in person or by telephone as required under section
435.5. Further, while Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a declaration with Plaintiff’s
motion to strike, the declaration does not state the parties were able to reach
an agreement resolving the issues raised in the motion to strike. Instead, the
declaration submitted with Plaintiff’s motion to strike solely specifies the
steps taken to prove Defendant’s suspended status. (Uss Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.)
Accordingly, the court does not find Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
establishes that the parties met and conferred in good faith in accordance with
section 435.5.
Cross-Plaintiff’s Answer and First Amended
Cross-Complaint are invalid because Cross-Plaintiff’s right to sue is currently
suspended. 
            Revenue and
Taxation Code section 23301 “suspends” the “powers, rights and privileges” of
corporate entities that do not pay “taxes, penalties or interest within a
specified time.” (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, § 7056; Grell v. Laci Le
Beau Corp. (1999)
73 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1306.) Section 23301’s purpose is to “put pressure
on the delinquent corporation to pay its taxes, and that purpose is satisfied
by a rule which views a corporation’s tax delinquencies, after correction, as
mere irregularities.” (Boyle v. Lakeview Creamery Co. (1937) 9 Cal.2d
16, 19.) Suspended corporations lack the “legal capacity to prosecute or defend
civil action[s]” during the suspension and cannot defend themselves. (Grell,
supra 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306 ; Casiopea Bovet, LLC v. Chiang
(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 656, 652 (Citation omitted in original.).) However, a
suspended entity may be sued. (Grell, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p.
1306.) A suspended entity may revive its right to defend itself “by filing all
required tax returns, paying the necessary taxes, penalties or fees due, and
applying to the Franchise Tax Board for a certificate of revivor.” (Corp. Code,
§ 2205, subd. (d); Benton v. County of Napa (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1485,
1490.) 
However, “[a] plea of lack of capacity of
a corporation to maintain an action by reason of a suspension of corporate
powers for nonpayment of its taxes is a plea in abatement, which is disfavored
by the law.” (Benton, supra, 226 Cal.App. 3d at p. 1491.) Pleas
in abatement are generally disfavored because they “do not challenge the
justness or merits of a plaintiff’s claim, but rather object to the place,
mode, or time of asserting a claim.” (Center for Self-Improvement &
Community Development v. Lennar Corp. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1543, 1552; Nevills
v. Shortridge (1905) 146 Cal. 277, 278, 79 P. 972.) Thus, when a corporate
litigant’s “suspended status” becomes an issue, trial courts usually “permit a
short continuance to enable the suspended corporation” to remedy its suspended
status. (Timberline, Inc. v. Jaisinghani (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1361,
1366.)
            Here,
Plaintiff and Co-defendants argue the court should strike Cross-Plaintiff’s
Answer and First Amended Cross-Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff has no
right to defend itself due to a suspended status. Cross-Plaintiff filed its
Answer on May 4, 2021 and a First Amended Cross-Complaint on February 18, 2022.
Per the documents judicially noticed above, Plaintiff ’s legal status in
California was suspended on May 1, 2024 for lack of good standing with the Franchise
Tax Board. (Pl.’s
Request for Judicial Notice – Exhibit “1” Secretary of State Certificate of
Status (05/01/2024); Request for Judicial Notice – Exhibit “2” Franchise Tax
Board Entity Status Letter (08/28/2024).) Plaintiff and
Co-defendants argue Cross-Plaintiff cannot currently defend itself in motions
or proceedings because it does not have the right to do so.
Cross-Plaintiff opposes
the motion to strike, requesting a “reasonable opportunity to cure [its]
suspended status.” (Plaintiff ’s Opp. to Mtn. to Strike, pgs. 2:24-28, 3:8-27.)
Cross-Plaintiff argues the that the “normal practice” for cases like the
instant action where a suspended status “comes to light during litigation” is
to “permit a short continuance to enable the suspended corporation” to cure the
defect such as paying back taxes and fees. (Timberline, Inc. v. Jaisginhani,
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1366.) This would allow the Cross-Plaintiff to
revive its corporate powers and validate its prior filings. Cross-Plaintiff
presents a declaration from its CEO, Sang W. Kim, stating Cross-Plaintiff is
already working with the Franchise Tax Board to restore its status. (Boyle, supra, 9
Cal.2d at p. 19; Declaration of Sang W. Kim [Kim Decl.], ¶¶
1-3.) Cross-Plaintiff also estimates it will take two months to restore its
status. (Kim Decl. at ¶ 4.)
The court finds
that Plaintiff is not in good standing with the Franchise Tax Board under
section 23301 and lacks the legal capacity to defend itself. Even though Cross-Plaintiff
filed the motions while still in good standing, the timing of those filings
does not entitle Cross-Plaintiff to the right to defend itself while suspended.
Because the hearing on the motion to strike is September 30, 2024, and Cross-Plaintiff
still has a suspended status, Cross-Plaintiff cannot avail itself of the rights
and privileges of defending itself at the hearing. 
However, considering
Plaintiff and Co-defendants did not meet and confer with Cross-Plaintiff before
filing this motion, Cross-Plaintiff has already begun the process of ending its
suspension which will take about two months, and the motion does not address
the merits of the case, the court will continue the hearing on the motion to
strike for two months during which Plaintiff and Co-defendants must satisfy the
meet-and-confer requirement and Cross-Plaintiff must remedy their suspension
status. 
Conclusion
Accordingly, the
court CONTINUES the hearing for Plaintiff’s and Co-defendants’ motion to strike
to November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 45 to provide Plaintiff and
Co-defendants an opportunity to comply with the meet-and-confer requirements of
section 435.5 and Cross-Plaintiff the opportunity to remedy its suspension
status with the Secretary of State. The court orders Plaintiff and
Co-Defendants to file meet-and-confer declarations that comply with the
requirements of section 435.5 no later than seven court days prior to the
continued hearing date. The court orders Cross-Plaintiff to file declarations
and evidence showing it is in good standing with the Franchise Tax Board and
the Secretary of State no later than seven court days prior to the continued
hearing date.
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
