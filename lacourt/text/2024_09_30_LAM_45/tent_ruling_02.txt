Background
Plaintiffs James H. Tuggle, individually,
and James H. Tuggle, as Trustee of the James Tuggle Family Revocable Living
Trust, filed this action against Defendant Reshma Kamath on December 12, 2022.
Plaintiffs allege three causes of action: (1) Malpractice; (2) Breach of
Contract; and (3) Financial Elder Abuse. Plaintiffs engaged Defendant for legal
services in April 2021 and allege malpractice based on the following factual
allegations. (Compl., ¶ 4(a).) 
Defendant represented Plaintiffs in a
proceeding to stop foreclosure on the Olympic Hotel, a property owned by the
James Tuggle Family Revocable Living Trust (Tuggle Trust). (Ibid.) Plaintiffs
allege that instead of recommending or taking appropriate legal action, the Defendant
filed a federal action personally naming James H. Tuggle, individually, as
plaintiff and the Olympic Hotel and others as defendants, rather than the Trust
itself. (Ibid.) This resulted in the defendants incurring legal fees and
costs the trustee (here James H. Tuggle) paid. (Ibid.) In February 2022,
Plaintiffs informed Defendant the foreclosure was now moot and requested
Defendant dismiss the federal action. (Ibid.) Defendant countered that
because Plaintiffs had not paid her attorney’s fees, she would not file a
notice of dismissal. (Ibid.) 
In June 2021 in a small claims case,
Plaintiffs sought Defendant’s legal services for an appeal. (Id. at  ¶ 4(c).) Plaintiffs claim because Defendant
never informed him when the appeal hearing was scheduled, the judgment was
finalized against him costing him $7,791.70. 
On December 20, 2021, Plaintiffs hired Defendant for a separate case to
get a default judgment. (Id. at ¶ 4(b).) Defendant filed the motion for
entry of default but failed to comply with Civil Procedure sections 473 and
473.5. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs allege that even though Defendant was informed
of her deficiencies so that she could remedy them before the final hearing, she
did not correct them. (Ibid.) The motion was denied, and Plaintiffs
spent an additional $4,000.00 to substitute a different attorney. (Ibid.).

On February 21, 2023, Defendant filed an
Answer and a Cross-Complaint. (Def.’s Cross-Complaint; Def.’s Answer.)
Defendant’s Cross-Complaint alleges eleven causes of action against Plaintiff’s
including Defamation, Malicious Prosecution, Breach of Contract, and Abuse of
Process. (Def.’s Cross-Complaint.) The court struck all causes of action except
the breach of contract claim. 
Between March 2023 and July 2023,
Plaintiffs propounded upon Defendant motions to compel various discovery responses.
(Pl.’s Mtn. to Compel Responses.) The court denied these motions. On May 8,
2024, Plaintiffs propounded on Defendant Requests for Production. (Pl.’s Mtn.
to Compel – Exh. “A” – First Set of Demands for Production of Documents.) On
April 9, 2024 and July 1, 2024, Plaintiffs emailed Defendant requesting
compliance with their discovery requests. (Pl.’s Mtn. to Compel – Exh. “B” –
Emails from Plaintiffs’ Counsel to Defendant.) Defendant did not respond. On
August 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion.
 
Legal Standard
If a party to whom requests for production
of documents were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and for monetary sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (b)-(c).) Section 2031.300 contains no time limit
for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. The propounding
party need not demonstrate good cause or satisfy a meet-and-confer requirement
– all that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of requests for
production of documents was properly served on the opposing party, that the
time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served.
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-04.)
The party who fails to timely respond to
the discovery request waives “‘any objection’ to the request” including those
based on “privilege” or “attorney work product.” (Ibid. (quoting Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a)).) The trial court may
relieve waiver if, the party demonstrates that “it subsequently served a
response to the demand”; its response “‘is in substantial compliance’ with the
statutory provisions governing the form and content of the response”; and “‘[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.’” (Id. at p. 404 (quoting Civ. Code
Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2); 2031.300, subd. (a)(1)-(2)).)
 
Discussion
Requests
for Production (Set One)
Plaintiffs move to compel responses from Defendant
to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). 
Plaintiffs establish the following: On May
8, 2024, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Requests for Production of Documents
(Set One). (Decl. of Robert N. Conrad, ¶ 3, Exh. “A”.) Plaintiffs allege they
propounded by mail because on May 1, 2024, Defendant “demanded that all
discovery be propounded to her only by mail.” (Ibid.) On July 1, 2024,
Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed Defendant to follow up on the requests, which were
due on June 12, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 4-5, Exh. “B”.) As of the date of this
motion, Defendant has not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 5.)
The court finds these facts are sufficient
to establish that Defendant failed to timely serve responses to Plaintiffs’ requested
discovery. Plaintiffs establish that they properly served the requested
discovery on May 8, 2024. Defendant had 30 days, plus five additional days
because of service by mail, to serve responses on Plaintiffs by June 12, 2024.
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.260, subd. (b), 1013, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs also
establish that Defendant failed to respond by the June 12, 2024 deadline. Defendant
does not challenge this motion, and thus waive any objections to the
Plaintiffs’ requests.
The court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs’
motion to compel responses from Defendant to Requests for Production of
Documents (Set One). The court orders Defendant serve responses, without
objections, to these discovery requests within 30 days of the date of this
ruling.
Sanctions
Plaintiffs request $3,916.00 in attorney’s
fees and costs for monetary sanctions against Defendant for this motion. (Conrad
Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate is $595.00 per hour and Plaintiffs
seek to recover 4.8 hours for this motion and $60.00 in costs. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs also seek $1,000.00 in sanctions under section 2023.050. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate is
reasonable, but the number of hours Plaintiffs seek to recover is unreasonable.
This is a basic motion, and the issues raised in the motion, along with the
absence of an opposition brief do not justify the amount Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs
seek 2.3 hours for preparing this motion, 1.5 hours for preparing the reply,
and 1 hour for preparing for and attending the hearing. (Ibid.) The
court finds that reducing the total hours for replying to an opposition to zero
hours is reasonable. The number of hours Plaintiffs seek for attending hearing
is reasonable. As to costs, Plaintiffs seek $60 for filing fees. (Ibid.)
The court finds this cost is reasonable. Thus, Plaintiffs’ total reduced
recoverable amount in attorney’s fees and costs is $2,023.50 ([$595.00/hour x 3.3
hours preparing motion and attending hearing] + $60 filing fee).
The court must also grant Plaintiffs
$1,000.00 in mandatory monetary sanctions. Defendant has not responded to
Plaintiffs’ discovery demand “in good faith” and has provided no “substantial
justification” for not responding. (Civ. Code Proc. § 2023.050, subd. (a)(1),
(c).) Thus, Plaintiffs monetary sanctions include $1,000.00.
The court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs’
request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the reduced amount of $3,023.50
in attorney’s fees and costs. The court orders Defendant to pay $3,023.50 to Plaintiffs,
within 20 days of the date of this hearing.
 
            It is so ordered.
