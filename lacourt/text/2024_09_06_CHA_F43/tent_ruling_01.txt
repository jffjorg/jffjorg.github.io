SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Alliant
Credit Union (Plaintiff) is the holder of a contract whereby Defendant Edgar
Magos Salazar (Defendant) purchased from Plaintiff’s assignor a 2019 Keystone
Avalanche 375RD motor vehicle. The Contract is in default and the balance due
and owing on the contract is $65,793.84. 
 
Plaintiff seeks
possession of the vehicle, with Plaintiff having filed the application for writ
of possession on January 24, 2024. No proof of service was filed with the
complaint or the application for writ of possession, though Plaintiff did file
proof of service with the notice of continuance of the hearing on June 6, 2024.
However, prior to the hearing on an application for writ of possession, a
defendant must be served with a copy of the summons and complaint, a notice of
application and hearing, and a copy of the application and any affidavit in
support thereof. (CCP § 512.030.) Plaintiff has not filed proofs of service for
these things.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s application is denied without prejudice. 
 
Moving party to
