And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the application for writ of possession filed by Alliant Credit Union (Plaintiff) without prejudice. The Plaintiff is seeking possession of a 2019 Keystone Avalanche 375RD motor vehicle, which is the subject of a contract that is in default. The balance due and owing on the contract is $65,793.84. The Plaintiff filed the application for writ of possession on January 24, 2024, but failed to provide proof of service for the summons and complaint, notice of application and hearing, and application and supporting affidavit, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 512.030. As a result, the judge has denied the application without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff has the opportunity to rectify the deficiency and re-file the application.
