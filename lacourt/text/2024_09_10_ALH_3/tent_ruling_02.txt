I.           
INTRODUCTION 
This action
was filed on March 14, 2022, by plaintiffs Anthony K. Chu dba Law Offices of
Anthony Chu (“Chu”) and Jian Qi (“Qi”) (collectively, Plaintiffs”). The
operative complaint, the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) was filed on June 1,
2023. Plaintiffs assert causes of action for avoidance of fraudulent transfer
and civil conspiracy. The Court notes that Plaintiffs filed several requests
for dismissal on October 3, 2023, seeking to dismiss Ketian Yue, Chenchen Xu,
Sunrise Logistic Group from the entire TAC and dismiss the First and Second
Causes of Action against Yun Zheng, Jennifer Liu, and Shajoie Zhang, however, the
dismissals were not entered because Plaintiffs did not use the correct form. 
          In
short, the action arises from Plaintiffs’ attempt to collect on judgments from
New Diamond and New Diamond’s owner, Qingyu Zhang, who allegedly made
fraudulent transfers in order to avoid paying said judgments. Before the Court
is a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication filed by 2000 West, Yun
Zheng (“Y. Zheng”), sued as Doe 5, and Shaojie Zhang (“S. Zhang”), sued as Doe
6. 2000 West, Y. Zheng, and S. Zhang (collectively, “Defendants”) seek summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to each cause of
action in the TAC. 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) A
defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or
her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has
shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) To meet this burden of showing a cause of
action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the
plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.) A
moving defendant need not conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause
of action, but it is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the
absence of evidence. (Id. at p. 854; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The supporting evidence can be in the form of
affidavits, declarations, admissions, depositions, answers to interrogatories,
and matters of which judicial notice may be taken. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.) “Once the
defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . .
to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials of its pleadings to
show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead, “shall set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.)
“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
III.       
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Request for
Judicial Notice: Defendants’ request for judicial notice of an
order issued by the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)  
Objections to
Declaration of Anthony Chu: Defendants’ Objection Nos. 2 and 3 relating to a
deposition taken of Q. Zhang in a civil case filed in Ohio are SUSTAINED in
part. (Wong v. Stillwater Ins. Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1297, 1324
[out-of-state deposition of purported percipient witness from different case not
admissible as evidence under California’s summary judgment statute].) Plaintiffs
seek to introduce Q. Zhang’s deposition from a prior case filed by Q. Zhang and
against 2000 West and Y. Zheng. While attorneys for both 2000 West and Y. Zheng
were present at Q. Zhang’s deposition, and Frost, Brown, Todd, LLC (who is currently
counsel of record for Defendants) was counsel of record for Y. Zheng in the
prior action, S. Zhang was not a party to this lawsuit and therefore did not
receive notice of the deposition or have an opportunity to cross-examine Q.
Zhang. 
Additionally,
there is no evidence that Q. Zhang’s deposition was intended to serve as trial
testimony or that the parties subsequently reached any agreement concerning use
of his deposition at trial in that case, or in other cases. (Berroteran v.
Superior Court (2022) 12 Cal.5th 867, 901-902.) In Berroteran, the
California Supreme considered the difference between testimony given at a
deposition compared to trial testimony and the tactical reasons why an examining
party may elect not to conduct aggressive questioning at a deposition, which is
primarily intended to pin down the testimony of an adverse witness and serve as
impeachment evidence. The Berroteran court stated that the proponent of
the prior deposition testimony had the burden of showing, when opposing a
motion to exclude, that the examining party had the “same interest and motive
for cross-examination that would exist at trial” and set forth specific
factors, for any trial court considering whether to exclude a deposition taken
in a different case. The fact that the parties were adverse is not, standing
alone, sufficient to demonstrate an interest and motive to cross-examine. 
Defendants’ Objection
Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-12, 14, and 15 are SUSTAINED because there is no certificate
of authentication from a custodian of record for bank statements and checks. In an impermissible sur-reply, Plaintiffs contend that the subpoenaed
records were already “provided” to Defendants in prior discovery exchanges. (Sur-reply, Chu Decl., ¶¶ 9-11.) The issue is not
whether Defendants have been given the records; the issue is that Plaintiffs
have yet to demonstrate the admissibility of the purportedly subpoenaed records
to the Court by providing the Court with a declaration from the custodian of
records. 
Defendants’
Objection Nos. 4, 5, 16-19, 23, 24 to court records from Ohio state court are
OVERRULED. The Court takes judicial notice of the existence of these records,
but not the truth of the matters stated within. 
Objection
Nos. 13, 21, 22 are SUSTAINED for lack of foundation. 
Objection
Nos. 28-38 are SUSTAINED on the grounds that the statements objected to are
improper legal conclusions. 
Objection to
the Declaration of Jennifer Liu: Defendant’s objection to the
entirety of the Declaration of Jennifer Liu is SUSTAINED as untimely.
Plaintiffs served this declaration on September 4, 2024, which is only 6 days
before the hearing in violation of CCP section 437c(b)(2). Plaintiffs do not
offer any explanation for the failure to timely serve the declaration. In their
impermissible sur-reply, Plaintiffs claim that “for personal reasons”, the
declaration could not be finalized until August 30, 2024. (Sur-reply, Chu
Decl., ¶ 12.) However, this explanation, besides being inadequate, is belied by
the act that the declaration is actually dated September 1, 2024. 
IV.       
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs allege that 2000 West
was formed in Ohio for the purpose of purchasing a parcel of real property in
Hamilton County and that New Diamond fraudulently transferred money to 2000
West for this purchase in order to avoid paying a judgment in an employment
case brought by Qi against New Diamond. This employment case was initiated in
2016 and Plaintiffs obtained their judgment against New Diamond in 2021. (TAC,
¶ 33.) Plaintiffs claim that the funds transferred by New Diamond, which
amounted to a 50% ownership interest in 2000 West, were a fraudulent conveyance
because New Diamond did not receive a reasonably equivalent value in exchange by
being named as a shareholder of 2000 West. (TAC, ¶ 34) Instead, Q. Zhang (who
owns New Diamond) was named as a shareholder. (TAC, ¶ 35.) The funds
transferred from New Diamond to 2000 West form the basis for the First, Second,
and Third Causes of Action. The First Cause of Action for Fraudulent Transfer
is predicated on actual fraud whereas the Second Cause of Action for Fraudulent
Transfer is predicated on constructive fraud. The Third Cause of Action is for Civil
Conspiracy. 
In July 2020, Plaintiffs filed a
malicious prosecution case against Q. Zhang. Plaintiffs allege that after  Q. Zhang was served with the summons and
complaint in this case, he fraudulently transferred his 50% interest in 2000
West to Y. Zheng in order to avoid paying any potential judgment. (TAC, ¶¶ 63-64.)
Plaintiffs eventually obtained a default judgment in this malicious prosecution
case around April 30, 2021. (TAC, ¶ 65.) The transfer of Q. Zhang’s ownership
interest in 2000 West to Y. Zheng form the basis for the Fourth, Fifth, and
Sixth Causes of Action. The Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Transfer is
premised on actual fraud. The Fifth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Transfer is
based on constructive fraud. The Sixth Cause of Action is for Civil Conspiracy.

A “fraudulent conveyance is a
transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent
to prevent the creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claims.” (See
Yaesu Electronic Corp. v. Tamura (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 8, 13.) Under the Fraudulent Transfer
Act (Civ. Code, §§ 3439–3439.12), a transfer of assets made by a debtor is
fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after
the transfer, if the debtor made the transfer “with actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud any creditor.” (Civ. Code, § 3439.04, subd. (a)(1).) In determining
actual intent, consideration may given to factors including whether:
(1)  Whether the transfer or obligation was to an insider.
 
(2)  Whether the debtor retained possession or control of
the property transferred after the transfer.
 
(3)  Whether the transfer or obligation was disclosed or
concealed.
 
(4)  Whether before the transfer was made or obligation
was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit.
 
(5)  Whether the transfer was of substantially all the
debtor's assets.
 
(6)  Whether the debtor absconded.
 
(7)  Whether the debtor removed or concealed assets.
 
(8) Whether the value of the consideration received
by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred
or the amount of the obligation incurred.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 3439.04, subd.(b).) A transfer
that would otherwise be voidable as intentionally fraudulent is not voidable
against a transferee who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent
value. (Civ.Code, § 3439.08, subd. (a).)
In the absence of actual intent,
a transfer of assets is fraudulent if the debtor did not receive a reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was:
(a) engaged in or about to engage in a business or transaction for which the
debtor's assets were unreasonably small, or (b) intended to incur, or believed
or reasonably should have believed that he or she would incur, debts beyond his
or her ability to pay as they became due. (Civ.Code, § 3439.04, subd. (a)(2).)
In their motion, Defendants argue
that Plaintiffs cannot establish that the transactions between Y. Zheng, 2000
West, and Q. Zhang were made fraudulently because they were made in good faith
and with valid consideration, and had nothing to do with Plaintiffs’ attempt to
collect on judgments against New Diamond and Q. Zhang. Defendants argue that the
money transferred from New Diamond to 2000 West consisted of: (1) reimbursement
of funds that were originally provided by Y. Zheng, (2) Q. Zhang’s initial
capital contributions to 2000 West, and (3) rental payments due under a
sublease agreement by which New Diamond sub-leased a warehouse in Ohio (“the
Subject Property”) from 2000 West’s landlord. Defendants claim that Q. Zhang
transferred his 50% ownership interest in 2000 West to Y. Zheng, the sole
manager of 2000 West, after he failed to reimburse Y. Zheng for expenditures
made in connection with the formation of 2000 West and the purchase of the Subject
Property. 
Defendants explain that 2000
West was comprised of three members: Y. Zheng, Q. Zhang, and nonparty Jennifer
Liu (“Liu”). Defendants claim that around 2017, Y. Zheng and New Diamond agreed
that Y. Zheng would provide New Diamond with $362,500 so that New Diamond could
secure a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”); this SBA loan
would then finance 2000 West’s acquisition of the Subject Property, which would
be leased by New Diamond. (UMF No. 3.) Y. Zheng authenticates a copy of a check
for $362,500 made payable to New Diamond dated April 3, 2017. (Y. Zheng Decl.,
Ex. 2.) Y. Zheng also states that this agreement was memorialized in a document
entitled, “Funding Agreement”, but does not state when this memorialization
occurred (Y. Zheng Decl., Ex. 3.) The purported memorialization states that the
Fundng Agreement is an “agreement is entered into by and between [New Diamond]
and [Y. Zheng] on and effective April 4, 2017.” In what appears to be a
typographical error, the document also states that Y. Zheng “provided funding
of $362,500 on April 4, 2020 to New Diamond in order to facilitate a SBA loan
application to secure funding for the warehouse.” The timing of the purported
fundng in 2020 is contradicted by the check written to New Diamond dated April
3, 2017, therefore, it appears that this document was created after the check
was made and backdated because “4/4/17” and “04/04/17” are handwritten next to
the signature blocks. 
Y. Zheng claims that the $362,500 she
gave for New Diamond’s SBA loan also acted as her capital contribution to 2000
West ($285,000) with the remaining $77,500 to serve as a personal loan to Q.
Zhang. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) Another member of 2000 West, Liu, provided
her capital contribution of $190,000 in cash. In contrast, Q. Zhang initially did
not provide his capital contribution of $475,000 to 2000 West. Instead, he executed
a promissory note dated October 1, 2017, agreeing that the full amount of his
capital contribution would be “due upon lease termination and/or execution of
purchase.” (Y. Zheng Decl., Ex. 5.) 
Shortly after executing this promissory
note, on or about October 5, 2017, New Diamond wired $160,000 to 2000 West as
part of Y. Zheng’s capital contribution towards the purchase deposit for the
Subject Property. (Id., ¶ 12.) The remaining $125,000 held by New
Diamond became a short-term loan from 2000 West, due by April 30, 2018, with 6%
annual interest. (Id., ¶ 15, Ex. 7.) New Diamond eventually repaid the
principal amount by the due date and the interest was forgiven. (Y. Zheng
Decl., ¶ 24.) As evidenced by checks dated October 23, 2017, through April 30,
2018, New Diamond paid $186,666.69 to 2000 West. (Y. Zheng Decl., Exs. 8-15.) After
April 30, 2018, New Diamond continued to send checks to 2000 West in order to
pay monthly rent due under the sublease agreement and as part of Q. Zhang’s
capital contribution. (Y. Zheng Decl, Exs. 16-25.) The last check from New
Diamond was dated March 1, 2019. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶. 36.) 
Apart from Y. Zheng and Q. Zhang’s
involvement in 2000 West, Y. Zheng declares that from August through October 2018, she and Q. Zhang were
considering investing in different warehouses. She made 2 checks payable to New
Diamond as part of these investments for $253,173.25 and $169,326.25 which,
along with the $77,500 loaned to Q. Zhang as agreed-upon in 2017, amounted to
$500,000. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶¶ 37-39.) This $500,000 loan was subsequently memorialized
in an agreement dated January 1, 2019, which stated that Q. Zhang was supposed
to pay Y. Zheng back by September 30, 2019, and Q. Zhang’s ownership interest
in 2000 West would serve as collateral for this loan. (Y. Zheng Decl., Exs.
28-29.) Q. Zhang did not pay Y. Zheng the $500,000 by the due date, and on
October 1, 2019, they executed an amendment which transferred Q. Zhang’s
interest in 2000 West to Y. Zheng. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶¶ 40, 41, Exs. 30-31.) Q.
Zhang later filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court against Y. Zheng and 2000 West
claiming that the transfer was fraudulently obtained. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶ 43,
Ex. 32.) The lawsuit was eventually resolved in Y. Zheng’s favor after the Ohio
court granted Y. Zheng’s motion for summary judgment. (Id., ¶ 43.) 
Y. Zheng and her husband, S. Zhang, also
each declare that from 2017 through 2020, they were not aware of the judgments
obtained against either New Diamond or Q. Zhang. (Y. Zheng Decl., ¶ 42; S.
Zhang Decl., ¶ 3.) They both further declare that none of the transactions were
undertaken with the intent to assist New Diamond or Q. Zhang in evading any obligations
to their creditors. (Ibid.) 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants have
met their moving burden to show that Plaintiffs cannot establish their claims
for fraudulent transfer or civil conspiracy. Defendants made a prima facie
showing that they acted in good faith and the transfers from Q. Zhang and New
Diamond were made for a “reasonably equivalent value” based on Q. Zhang’s obligations
to Y. Zheng and 2000 West. (Civ. Code, § 3439.08, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiffs argue in their opposition
brief that triable issues of material fact exist regarding the intent of the
transfers at issue, as well as Defendants’ involvement in those transfers.
Plaintiffs claim that Y. Zheng and S. Zhang were both investors in New Diamond
and therefore, the transfers from New Diamond to 2000 West, as well as those
from Q. Zhang to Y. Zheng, were made to “insiders” intended to preserve their
investments, which is a factor to take into consideration when determining
whether there is an “actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of
the debtor.” (Civ. Code, § 3439.04 subd. (b)(1).) As evidence, Plaintiffs rely
on communications attached to Y. Zheng’s filings in the Ohio Lawsuit which
refer to Y. Zheng and S. Zhang’s “investment” in New Diamond. (Chu Decl. p.
231.)  However, the fact that Q. Zhang
initiated the Ohio Lawsuit against Y. Zheng in 2021, before Plaintiffs
initiated the instant action, shows that there was no collusion or conspiracy
to transfer assets to avoid Plaintiffs’ attempts to collect on a judgment;
rather, the Ohio lawsuit demonstrates that Q. Zhang actually attempted to
invalidate the agreement to transfer his ownership interest in 2000 West to Y.
Zheng. To conclude that the Ohio lawsuit was preemptively filed as a ruse between
Q. Zhang, 2000 West and Y. Zheng in order to lend legitimacy to any transfers
and shield Defendants’ “investment” in New Diamond from Plaintiffs’ collection
efforts would require an incredible amount of speculation, especially since the
Ohio lawsuit was filed before the instant one and did not even include S. Zhang.

Plaintiffs also attempt to cast doubt
on Y. Zheng and 2000 West’s purported loans to Q. Zhang and New Diamond because
the agreements appear to be backdated. However, on reply, Defendants persuasively
argue that even if the agreements are backdated, there is no evidence that they
do not accurately memorialize the purpose of those documents or the financial arrangements
that were made. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to raise a
triable issue of fact showing that the transfers between Q. Zhang and New
Diamond and Defendants were fraudulent. Without a fraudulent transfer,
Plaintiffs necessarily fail to show that Defendants were engaged in a civil
conspiracy.

          In light of
the foregoing, the Motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
