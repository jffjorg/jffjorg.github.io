And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to strike punitive damages and paragraphs 25, 26, and 32 of the complaint is GRANTED in its entirety. The plaintiff, Svetlana Henderson, has alleged that she owns the Subject Property, a residential duplex, and that her brother, John B. Fortner, has fraudulently transferred her mother's interest in the property to himself without her knowledge or approval. The court finds that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring an elder abuse claim that belongs to her mother and that she does not allege that she is bringing an action as her mother's successor-in-interest. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and deceit by concealment are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court will defer its decision on whether to give leave to amend the complaint until after it has ruled on Fortner's demurrer, which is scheduled for hearing on November 27, 2024.
