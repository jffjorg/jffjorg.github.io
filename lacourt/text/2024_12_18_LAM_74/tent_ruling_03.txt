v. Tarzana Health and Rehab et al.
BACKGROUND 
            This
case is a wrongful death and elder abuse suit brought by Nasser Sedaghat’s
successor in interest (Plaintiff) against defendant Tarzana Health and Rehab,
SSC Tarzana Operating Company, LP, Sava Seniorcare Administrative Services,
LLC, Kamran Kamrava and Does 1-50. 
 
Plaintiff Nasser Sedaghat’s Motion
to Disqualify Counsel
Plaintiff
moves to have attorney Stewart Levin disqualified as counsel.  On February 6, 2024, the court relieved
Stewart Levin as counsel, who stated in open court that he did not intend to reappear
in the case.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
is moot. 
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
 
Plaintiff Nasser Sedaghat’s Motion
to Impose and Enforce Costs on Appeal
In June 2023, Plaintiff successfully
appealed from Department 34’s dismissal of his complaint. Following the reversal,
the Court of Appeal remanded the case to the Superior Court and the case was
reassigned to this department. In its remittitur returning the case to the Superior
Court, the Court of Appeal awarded Plaintiff his costs on appeal. Plaintiff
thereafter filed his memorandum of costs on September 7, 2023.
Plaintiff’s memorandum of
costs cites California Rule of Court, rule 8.278(d)(2) as authority for his
recovery of costs on appeal. (See Mtn. Exh. B - Memorandum of Costs on Appeal.)
That court rule applies to recovery of attorney’s fee to which Plaintiff as a
non-attorney self-represented litigant is not entitled. Thus, the court awards
Plaintiff zero-dollars for his costs on appeal.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
