And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Rafael David Miranda's motion for reconsideration of the Court's previous ruling on Plaintiff Richard Lopez's motion for summary judgment. The Court ruled that the motion for reconsideration is untimely, as it was filed more than a month after the judgment was entered. Additionally, the Court found that the grounds presented by Defendant do not constitute "new or different facts, circumstances, or law" that were not previously known or discoverable. Therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion for reconsideration. The Court denies the motion for reconsideration and orders Defendant to give notice.
