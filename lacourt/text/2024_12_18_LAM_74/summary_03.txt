And here is a brief English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by plaintiff Nasser Sedaghat. Firstly, the motion to disqualify counsel, Stewart Levin, is moot since the court relieved him of his duties on February 6, 2024, and he stated he would not reappear in the case. Secondly, the motion to impose and enforce costs on appeal is denied. The court awards the plaintiff zero-dollars for his costs on appeal, citing California Rule of Court, rule 8.278(d)(2), which only applies to attorney's fees, and the plaintiff is not entitled to them as a non-attorney self-represented litigant.
