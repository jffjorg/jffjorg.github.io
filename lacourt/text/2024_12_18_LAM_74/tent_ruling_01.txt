  Case Number:  22STCV22815    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Lopez v.
Miranda et al. 
Defendant Rafael David Miranda and
Trustee’s Motion to Reconsider.
 
BACKGROUND  
Plaintiff
Richard Lopez (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against defendants Rafael David
Miranda, and Does 1-20 for (1) Quiet Title, (2) Slander of Title, and (3)
Cancellation of Instrument.
Defendants
filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Laura Miranda-Diaz, Jose Miranda,
Jason Jackson, Francisca Hernandez and Roes 1-50 (collectively
Cross-Defendants).  Defendants allege
four causes of action: (1) Declaratory Relief; (2) Intentional Interference
with Contract; (3) Negligent Interference with Contract and (4) Wrongful
Eviction.  Defendants allege that a
settlement (Settlement Agreement) was reached with Andres Contreras regarding
Miranda’s mortgage on 920 North Eastman Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90063 (the
Property) and that the cross-defendants conspired to defraud Defendants.  
            The
Court entered judgement for Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s complaint on October 18,
2024.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
"A
motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for
reconsideration can offer 'new or different facts, circumstances, or law' which
it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
time of the prior motion.... A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent
a strong showing of diligence." Forrest
v. Dept. Of Corps. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1172. See also Baldwin v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 (noting that 1992 amendment to Code Civ. Proc., § 1008
tightened diligence requirements).
 
DISCUSSION
            On
October 18, 2024, the Court entered judgment for Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s
complaint. More than a month later on November 25, 2024, Defendant filed his
motion for reconsideration of the Court’s ruling on Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment.  Entry of judgment divests a trial
court’s authority to decide a motion for reconsideration.  (Safeco Ins. Co. v. Architectural Facades
Unlimited, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1477, 1482.)  Therefore, the Court may not decide Defendant’s
motion for reconsideration. 
Assuming
solely for the sake of argument that the Court does have jurisdiction to
consider Defendant’s motion for reconsideration, Defendant requests reconsideration
on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff’s separate statement did not comply with the
separate statement requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section
437, and (2) triable issues of material fact existed because of defects in the
separate statement. 
            Neither
of these grounds are “new or different facts, circumstances, or law” because
these alleged deficiencies existed upon the filing of the motion for summary judgment.
 Defendant contends that case law about the
sufficiency of separate statements was newly discovered.  Defendant’s contention misunderstands what
constitutes “new law.” “New law” is not law that Defendant newly discovered; “new
law” is instead law that did not exist when the Court ruled on Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment. The supposedly new law that Defendant cites
pre-dates Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.  
 
CONCLUSION
The
Court denies the motion for reconsideration. 
Defendant
to give notice.
