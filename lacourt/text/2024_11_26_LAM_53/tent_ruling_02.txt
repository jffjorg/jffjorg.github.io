[1] On
October 28, 2024, the court issued an order exercising its discretion to
continue the hearing on this motion because (1) cross-complainant Mulgrew
Aircraft Components, Inc. filed a notice of lodging of documents conditionally
under seal, but (2) did not file a motion to seal as required.  (Oct. 28, 2024 Order, pp. 1:22-2:2,
2:23-3:7.)


[2] Even if
the court had concluded that Mulgrew had shown that all the categories of
information were subject to reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy, the
court has concluded, as set forth above, that Mulgrew has not submitted
evidence showing that the information derives economic value from not generally
being known to the public as required. 
(Civ. Code, § 3426.1, subd. (d)(1).)
