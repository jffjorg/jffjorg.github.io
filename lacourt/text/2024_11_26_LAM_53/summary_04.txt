And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint. The court has reviewed the allegations made by the plaintiffs and finds that they state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion.

The court finds that the defendants, Sergio Moreno Morales and Sandy Segovia, made misrepresentations to the plaintiffs, inducing them to invest funds in excess of $1,000,000. The court also finds that the defendants, Morales and Lee, converted funds deposited by the plaintiffs into ASE's bank account for personal benefit.

The court overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to file an answer to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint within 10 days. The court also orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
