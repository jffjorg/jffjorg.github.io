Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint
The court considered the amended moving, opposition, and reply papers
filed in connection with this demurrer. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Alan M. Bagamaspad and Elenita A. Bagamaspad, individually
and as trustees of the Bagamaspad Revocable Living Trust (“Plaintiffs”), filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint in this action on May 14, 2024, against
defendants Sergio Moreno Morales, a/k/a Sergio Moreno, Michael Yuan Lee, a/k/a
Michael Yuan Li, ASE Construction, Inc., Fremont Cabinet Imports, Inc., Ten
Advisors, Inc., Francisco Puertas, and Sandy Segovia.         
Defendants Sergio Moreno Morales, a/k/a Sergio Moreno (“Morales”),
Michael Yuan Lee, a/k/a Michael Yuan Li (“Lee”), ASE Construction, Inc. (“ASE”),
Fremont Cabinet Imports, Inc., Francisco Puertas, and Sandy Segovia (“Segovia”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) now move the court for an order sustaining their
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. 
The court overrules defendant Morales’s demurrer to the sixth cause of
action for intentional misrepresentation because (1) the court has already overruled
his demurrer to this cause of action, and (2) the court again finds that it
states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against defendant
Morales because Plaintiffs have alleged that (i) in 2019, Morales represented
himself to Plaintiffs as a licensed contractor (SAC ¶¶ 25, 100, 102), (ii)
Morales proposed a business agreement pursuant to which Plaintiffs and Morales
would create a construction company, Morales would transfer his real properties
to ASE, and Morales would purchase construction equipment to be used for its business
operations (SAC ¶¶ 26-27, 104),  (iii) those
representations were false (SAC ¶ 75, subd. (iii), 106), Morales knew they were
false when he made them (SAC ¶ 108), and Morales intended that Plaintiffs rely
on the representations to induce Plaintiffs to invest funds in excess of
$1,000,000 (SAC ¶ 109), (iv) Plaintiffs reasonably relied on these
representations (SAC ¶¶ 103, 106), and (v) Plaintiffs were harmed as a result
of their reliance on Morales’s false representations (SAC ¶ 110).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); April
24, 2024 Order, pp. 2:5-19, 5:5-6; Lauckhart v. El Macero Homeowners Assn. (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 889, 903 [elements of intentional misrepresentation].) 
The court overrules defendant Segovia’s demurrer to the sixth cause of
action for intentional misrepresentation because it states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action since Plaintiffs have alleged that (1) Segovia
made misrepresentations to Plaintiffs from 2019 to 2022, including (i) that
information, resources, and the capital contributions were for the benefit of
the business agreement and that Morales would transfer his real properties to
ASE, would purchase construction equipment to be used for its business
operations, and would deposit a sum of money into ASE’s business account (SAC ¶¶
35, 104), and (ii) that Morales was a licensed contractor (SAC ¶¶ 50, 100), (2)
Segovia knew the representations were false and intended to mislead Plaintiffs
by making the representations regarding the investment agreement (SAC ¶¶ 106-108),
(3) Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Segovia’s representations by moving forward
in their dealings with Morales (SAC ¶¶ 50, 103, 109), and (4) Plaintiffs have
suffered harm as a result of Segovia’s misrepresentations (SAC ¶ 110).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lauckhart,
supra, 92 Cal.App.5th at p. 903 [elements of intentional
misrepresentation].)  
The court overrules defendants Morales and Segovia’s demurrer to the
seventh cause of action for negligent misrepresentation (1) because, as to
defendant Morales, (i) the court already overruled his demurrer to this cause
of action, and (ii) the court again finds that it states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Morales for the same reasons set forth in
connection with the court’s ruling on the sixth cause of action, and (2)
because, as to defendant Segovia, it states facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action for the same reasons set forth in connection with the court’s
ruling on the sixth cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); April 24, 2024 Order, pp. 3:9-15,
5:5-6; Borman v. Brown (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1060 [elements of
negligent misrepresentation].) 
The court overrules defendant Morales’s demurrer to the eighth cause
of action for conversion because (1) the court already overruled Morales’s
demurrer to this cause of action, and (2) the court again finds that it states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Morales (SAC ¶¶ 127, 129,
130).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e); April 24, 2024 Order, pp. 3:23-28, 5:5-6; Foster v. Sexton (2021)
61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1020-1021 [elements of conversion].) 
The court overrules defendant Lee’s demurrer to the eighth
cause of action for conversion because it states facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action since Plaintiffs have alleged that (1) Plaintiffs deposited
funds of at least $164,271.12 into ASE’s bank account for its operations (SAC ¶
128), and (2) defendant Lee converted those funds (SAC ¶ 128) by using those
funds for his personal benefit.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Foster, supra, 61 Cal.App.5th at
pp. 1020-1021 [elements of conversion].) 
The court acknowledges, as Defendants have argued, that generalized
claims for money are not actionable as conversion.  (Sanowicz v. Bacal (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 1027, 1042.)  However, money
can be the subject of a conversion claim if there is a specific, identifiable
sum involved.  (Ibid.)  Here, as set forth above, Plaintiffs have
alleged the conversion of a specific, identifiable sum in the amount of
$162,271.12, such that it may support a cause of action for conversion against
defendant Lee.  (Ibid.; SAC ¶ 128.)
            The court notes that (1) the eighth
cause of action is also alleged against defendant ASE, and (2) defendant ASE is
identified to be a moving party in connection with this demurrer.  However, Defendants’ moving papers appear to
address the sufficiency of this cause of action as alleged against defendants
Morales and Lee only.  (SAC p. 24:1-3
[identifying ASE as defendant to this cause of action]; Dem., pp. 2:1-7
[identifying ASE as a moving party], 9:16-17 [“Plaintiffs Allege to Fail
Conversion Against Lee & Morales”].)  Thus, Defendants have not shown that this
cause of action does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
for conversion against defendant ASE.
