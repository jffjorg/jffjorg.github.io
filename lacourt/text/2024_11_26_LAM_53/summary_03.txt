And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ana Gomez v. Department of Motor Vehicles. The defendant has moved to compel the plaintiff's deposition and for sanctions after the plaintiff failed to appear for a scheduled deposition and did not serve objections to the deposition notice. The court has found that the defendant has shown that it served the plaintiff with multiple deposition notices, including one on April 5, 2024, to which the plaintiff did not respond with objections. The court has also found that the plaintiff did not effectively appear for the deposition on April 17, 2024, and that the defendant attempted to communicate with the plaintiff regarding her availability and suggested dates for the deposition. As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and has awarded monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,603.85.
