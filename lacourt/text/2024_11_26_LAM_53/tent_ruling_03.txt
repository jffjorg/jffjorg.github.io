  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff’s
  deposition and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Department of Motor
Vehicles
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Department of Motor Vehicles (“Defendant”) moves the court
for an order   (1) compelling plaintiff
Ana Gomez (“Plaintiff”) to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken
by counsel for Defendant, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $5,199.85.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination . . . , the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
The court finds that Defendant has shown that (1) Defendant served various
notices of deposition on Plaintiff, including on April 5, 2024, to which
Plaintiff did not serve objections, and (2) Plaintiff did not effectively
appear for her noticed deposition on April 17, 2024.  (Fong Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, 6, 7 [on April 17,
2024, “Plaintiff appeared remotely [for deposition] for approximately 3-5
minutes and then the screen went blank on Plaintiff’s feed[;]” Plaintiff thereafter
informed Defendant’s counsel that she was charging her phone; and Plaintiff did
not return to the deposition], 8-9; Fong Decl., Exs. A [Notice of Deposition
for October 17 and 18, 2023], B [Notice of Deposition for March 4-6, 2024], E
[Notice of Deposition for April 17 and 18, 2024].)  Defendant has also shown that it has
attempted to communicate with Plaintiff regarding her availability and
suggested dates to take her deposition, to which Plaintiff has not adequately
responded.  (Fong Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)
The court therefore grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to
appear for and testify at deposition. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  The court finds that $3,603.85
((5 hours x Fong’s $228 hourly rate) + $2,463.85 in deposition costs) is a
reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in connection with
this motion.  (Fong Decl., ¶¶ 10-11; Fong
Decl., Ex. I, pp. 1 [Veritext Invoice for April 17, 2024 in the amount of
$1,037.80], 3 [Veritext Invoice for April 18, 2024 in the amount of $718.55], 6
[Veritext Invoice for April 17, 2024 in the amount of $707.50].)
ORDER
            The court grants defendant
Department of Motor Vehicle’s motion to compel plaintiff’s deposition and for
sanctions as follows.
            The court orders plaintiff Ana Gomez
to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel for defendant
Department of Motor Vehicles, at 300 South Spring Street, Suite 1702, Los
Angeles, California, 90013, on ___________________________, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
            The court orders plaintiff Ana Gomez
to pay monetary sanctions to defendant Department of Motor Vehicles in the
amount of $3,603.85 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant
Department of Motor Vehicles to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
