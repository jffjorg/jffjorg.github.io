Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed amended motion for an assignment order and charging order in part and denied it in part. The plaintiff requested a charging order against the defendant's interest in LA Dorm LLC, but the judge denied this request without prejudice because the motion was not properly served on the LLC. The judge granted the request for an assignment order against the defendant's interest in W-Stands Inc. and LA Dorm LLC. The judge noted that the plaintiff submitted evidence of the defendant's executive position at W-Stands Inc. and managing membership at LA Dorm LLC, and the defendant failed to oppose the motion. The judge also noted that the Rutter's Enforcement of Judgment guide holds that the court has authority to order the assignment outright, and the judge agrees with this opinion. The judge ordered the assignment of the defendant's interests in W-Stands Inc. and LA Dorm LLC to the plaintiff.
