Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Defendants Tarzana Health Systems, LLC, Peter Brugetti, and U.S. Bank. The ruling finds that the pleading defects in the complaint cannot be cured by amendment. The complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support the duty element in the first, second, and third causes of action for negligence, premise liability, and business proprietor's or property owner's liability for criminal conduct of others. The Judge finds that the allegations of knowledge and dangerous propensity are conclusory and lack supportive fact pleading. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the request for leave to amend is denied.
