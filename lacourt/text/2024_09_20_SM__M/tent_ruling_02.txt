MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses

Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. The party only needs to
show that a set of interrogatories were properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 2033.280(b), a party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not
result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA must ‘move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall”
grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
  
ANALYSIS 
 
 Plaintiff Can Capital Inc. moves to compel initial discovery
responses from Defendants Benjamin Sarcadi and Breaking Barriers
Developmentally Disabled Services as to their respective Form Interrogatories,
Sets One, and to deem matters admitted as to their respective Requests for
Admissions, Sets One.
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served on Defendant Sarcadi and Breaking
Barriers, via counsel, certain written discovery including Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Admission- Set One. (Katz Decl., ¶ 4, Exs. A.) As to the RFAs,
Plaintiff provides that following several extensions, Defendants failed to
respond at all to the RFAs. (Id., ¶¶ 5-12.) However, as
to the FROGs, Defendants provided responses. Defendants provided
objections-only responses to the FROGs. (Id., Ex. E.) The Court concurs that
the objections are likely unmeritorious and in bad faith, as the objections
were waived. The fact remains that Defendants have responded, and thus the
proper motion would be for a further response. Thus, the motion to
compel cannot be granted as to the FROGs.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses to the FROGs
is DENIED, and the motions to deem matters admitted is GRANTED. The RFA’s are
deemed admitted.  Mandatory sanctions are
imposed in the noticed amount of $840.00, jointly and several against Defendant
and its counsel, payable within 30 days.
