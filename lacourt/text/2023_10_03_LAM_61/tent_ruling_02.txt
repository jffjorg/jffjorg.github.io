Plaintiff objects to this court’s taking notice of the probate court’s ruling,
on the grounds that the request for judicial notice does not describe which
facts in the ruling this court is requested to take notice of. (See Estate
of Nicholas (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1089 [“The trial judge should
always be careful to specify exactly the document or portion of a document
contained in a court file of which he is taking judicial notice. Also, counsel
should be required to state, with like specificity, the exact document or
portion of a document from a court file or record, when requesting the court to
take judicial notice of a court record.”].) This is not a persuasive objection,
as Defendant asks this court to take notice of the ruling and the asserted basis
therefore, which is within the scope of judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452,
subd. (c), (d) [official acts of judicial departments and court records].) This
court need take no notice of the underlying truth of the presumption of fraud.
