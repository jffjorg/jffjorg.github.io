## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendants NewRez LLC and The Bank of New York Mellon against Plaintiff Kristi Courtois. The motion argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring her claims because she has not been appointed as the executor of the estate of Austeene Geroge Cooper, the deceased.

Previously, Plaintiff's petition to probate the will was denied due to concerns about potential fraud.  While Plaintiff initially held special letters of administration, these expired. Plaintiff has since filed a new petition to administer the estate.

The judge has decided that the outcome of the motion for judgment on the pleadings hinges on the outcome of Plaintiff's new petition. If the petition is denied, the motion will be granted, dismissing Plaintiff's claims. If the petition is granted, meaning Plaintiff is appointed as the executor, the motion will be denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants, NewRez LLC and The Bank of New York Mellon, which argues that the plaintiff, Kristi Courtois, lacks standing to bring her claims. The plaintiff's basis for standing is her status as the executor of the estate of Austeene Geroge Cooper, but the defendants argue that this status is invalid because the probate court denied the plaintiff's petition for probate of will and did not renew her special letters of administration. The plaintiff has since filed a new petition to administer the decedent's intestate estate, but the outcome of this petition is uncertain.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the resolution of the motion depends on the resolution of the plaintiff's petition to administer the estate. If the petition is denied, the motion will be granted without leave to amend. If the petition is granted, the motion will be denied. The judge notes that defects in standing may be cured, but the resolution of the plaintiff's new petition is uncertain.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion is contingent upon the ruling on the Plaintiff's petition to administer the estate of Austeene G. Cooper in probate case number 20STPB07802. If the petition is denied, the motion for judgment on the pleadings will be granted without leave to amend. If the petition is granted, the motion for judgment on the pleadings will be denied.

The Plaintiff, Kristi Courtois, lacks standing to bring the action due to not being appointed as executor of the Decedent's estate. The Plaintiff was granted Special Letters of Administration to prosecute the present action, but the probate court denied her petition for probate of will due to "conclusive presumption of fraud". The Plaintiff has filed a new petition to administer the Decedent's intestate estate, but the resolution of this petition is uncertain.

The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's claim to standing rests upon her status as executor of the Decedent's estate, which she has not been appointed to. The Plaintiff argues that her lack of standing may be cured if the probate court grants her petition. The Judge has taken judicial notice of the probate court's denial of the Plaintiff's petition for probate of will and the expiration of her special letters of administration.

The Judge has cited various laws and case citations, including Code of Civil Procedure § 438, Probate Code § 21380, and Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672. The Judge has also noted that defects in standing may be cured, as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235.
