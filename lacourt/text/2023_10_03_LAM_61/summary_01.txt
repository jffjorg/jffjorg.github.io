And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings will be contingent upon the ruling on the plaintiff's petition to administer the estate of Austeene Geroge Cooper. If the petition is denied, the motion will be granted without leave to amend. If the petition is granted, the motion will be denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff lacks standing at present, but defects in standing may be cured if the probate court grants the petition. The hearing date for the petition is October 2, 2023, and the judge will not grant or deny the motion until the petition is decided.
