```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two key issues. Firstly, Plaintiff objects to the court taking notice of the probate court's ruling, citing a lack of specificity in the request for judicial notice. However, the court finds this objection unpersuasive, as Defendant has requested the court to take notice of the ruling and its asserted basis, which falls within the scope of judicial notice. Secondly, the court notes that the petition was filed on September 5, 2023, and Defendant's motion was filed on September 6, 2023. The court will likely take judicial notice of the probate court's ruling and the underlying facts, citing relevant case law and statutes, including Evidence Code § 452.

## English Summary 

The judge is considering a motion filed by the Defendant. The Defendant is asking the court to take judicial notice of a ruling from a probate court case. The Plaintiff objects to this request, arguing that it lacks specificity. The judge disagrees, stating that the Defendant's request for judicial notice is specific enough and falls under the rules governing judicial notice of court records. The judge ultimately rules that the court will take judicial notice of the probate court ruling.
