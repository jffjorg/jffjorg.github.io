```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two key issues. Firstly, Plaintiff objects to the court taking notice of the probate court's ruling, citing a lack of specificity in the request for judicial notice. However, the court finds this objection unpersuasive, as Defendant has requested the court to take notice of the ruling and its asserted basis, which falls within the scope of judicial notice. Secondly, the court notes that the petition was filed on September 5, 2023, and Defendant's motion was filed on September 6, 2023. The court will likely take judicial notice of the probate court's ruling and the underlying facts, citing relevant case law and statutes, including Evidence Code ยง 452.
