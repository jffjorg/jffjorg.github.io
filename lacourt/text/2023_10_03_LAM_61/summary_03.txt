The judge tentatively rules to approve a $42,500 settlement in the case of David Jackson vs. CoStar Realty Information, Inc.  This settlement resolves Jackson's individual claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and his personal claims for unpaid wages.  

The judge finds the settlement fair and reasonable, considering the strength of Jackson's case, the potential risks and costs of litigation, and the allocation of funds to compensate Jackson, address the alleged Labor Code violations, and cover attorney fees and costs. The settlement does not resolve claims by other potential aggrieved employees, who remain free to pursue their own claims.

The Judge grants Plaintiff David Jackson's Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement, finding it to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. The Defendant, Costar Realty Information, Inc., shall pay a gross settlement amount of $42,500.00, to be allocated as follows: $2,000.00 to PAGA civil penalties, $5,902.50 to Plaintiff personally for his unpaid wages claims, $13,772.50 to Plaintiff personally for penalties, liquidated damages, and interest, and $21,325.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel for payment of attorney fees and costs. The settlement applies only to Plaintiff’s individual claims and PAGA claims, with no provision for other aggrieved employees except for dismissal of their PAGA claims without prejudice. The attorney fees and costs allocated in the settlement total a little more than 50% of the gross settlement proceeds. Plaintiff’s counsel supports the requested award of attorney fees with a lodestar analysis, claiming that a reasonable lodestar for the actual fees incurred here would be $47,942.75. The amount of fees sought is reasonable in light of the lodestar.
