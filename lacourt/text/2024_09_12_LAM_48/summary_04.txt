And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The Plaintiff, Anthony Bouyer, filed an action against Defendant 4051 Ardmore LLC on October 10, 2023, alleging two Unruh violations that occurred during his visit to the Defendant's business on September 27, 2023. The Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $10,074.00, consisting of $8,000.00 in damages, $1,504.00 in costs, and $570.00 in attorney fees. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not adequately proven his entitlement to the damages claimed and has failed to provide sufficient evidence of the costs and attorney fees.

The Court cites Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. and Johnson v. Guedoir, stating that in a default judgment proceeding, the plaintiff must prove they are entitled to the damages claimed and affirmatively establish their entitlement to the specific judgment requested. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, and an Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment is scheduled for March 14, 2025.
