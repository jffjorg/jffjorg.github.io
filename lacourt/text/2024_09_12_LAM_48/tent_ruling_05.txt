  CASE NO.: 24STCV02592
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 12, 2024



 
Payam
Tishbi, counsel of record for Plaintiff Maria Guevara Jimenez, seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there has been a breakdown in attorney-client relationship due to the inability
to communicate with the client.  No party
opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until October 13, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Maria
Guevara Jimenez and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of September 2024
