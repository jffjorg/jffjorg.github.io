And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the minor's compromise. The claimant, Nolan Mernin, has agreed to settle his claim with Decedent's uninsured motorist insurer for $300,000.00. However, the Judge cannot find that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable at this time due to several deficiencies in the petition. These deficiencies include the lack of identification of the settling defendant or entity, the failure to include Attachment 11b(2) as required, and the insufficient explanation of the basis for the attorney fees request. The Judge has given the parties an opportunity to file an amended petition with a new hearing reservation.
