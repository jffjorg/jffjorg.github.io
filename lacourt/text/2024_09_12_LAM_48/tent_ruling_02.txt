[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 12, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Matthew Morgan and Defendants Ford Motor Company and Vista Ford have reached a settlement
in this Song-Beverly action.  On May 14, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses.  Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is granted.
As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees
and expenses.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  California courts apply the “lodestar” approach
to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Plaintiff
requests a total of $42,636.17, consisting of $26,990.50 in attorney fees, an additional
0.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees ($9,446.68), $2,698.99 in costs
and expenses, and $3,500.00 for review of the Opposition, drafting the Reply, and
attending the hearing on this motion.
Plaintiff
provides a copy of counsel’s billing records. 
(Shahian Decl., Ex. 20.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel charges various hourly rates: $595 (1.3 hours) for Olivia Avelino; $595
(7.2 hours) for Angel Baker; $325 (1.6 hours) for Alyana Dias; $375 (4 hours) for
Veronica Diaz; $550 (0.5 hours), $570 (2 hours), and $595 (1.9 hours) for Tionna
Carvalho; $485 (1.8 hours) for Mark Gibson; $440 (0.3 hours) and $475 (13 hours)
for Daniel Law; $475 (2.4 hours) and $525 (2.3 hours) for Regina Liou; $495 (2.2
hours) for Jacob Lister; $595 (1.3 hours) for Bryan Miller; $425 (2.7 hours) for
Alexus Ringstad; $390 (4 hours) for Brian Tan; $475 (0.9 hours) for Michael Tracy;
$525 (0.9 hours) for Anna Weiser; and $395 (6 hours) for Brandon Winston.
The
Court finds that rates greater than $495 are unreasonably high for such a straightforward
lemon law action.  Accordingly, the Court
recalculates the fees using a maximum rate of $495, resulting in the following deductions:
$130.00 for Olivia Avelino (minus $100/hour for 1.3 hours); $720.00 for Angel Baker
(minus $100/hour for 7.2 hours); $367.50 Tionna Carvalho (minus $55/hour for 0.5
hours, minus $75/hour for 2 hours, minus $100/hour for 1.9 hours); $69.00 for Regina
Liou (minus $30/hour for 2.3 hours); $130.00 for Bryan Miller (minus $100/hour for
1.3 hours); and $27.00 for Anna Weiser (minus $30/hour for 0.9 hours).  This results in a total deduction of $1,443.50,
and a revised total of $25,547.00.
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff overbilled for use of “cookie-cutter” and template form pleadings,
overbilled for clerical tasks, and block billed, and Defendants identify several
examples.  (Opposition at pp. 10-13; Biemann
Decl., Ex. F.)  The Court has reviewed
Defendants’ challenged billing entries and finds that the overall amount of
time is reasonable, particularly because the Court declines to award the
additional $3,500.00 anticipatorily billed for the reply and hearing.
Plaintiff
requests a lodestar multiplier of an additional 0.35.  “[A] trial court should award a multiplier for
exceptional representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the
quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable
skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar calculation.”  (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1139.)  This matter was not noticeably different from
other lemon law cases, did not involve complex or novel legal issues warranting
a multiplier, and Plaintiff’s counsel has extensive experience litigating similar
matters.  Despite the length of time from
case inception to settlement, there are no indications that Plaintiff’s counsel
engaged in any actions different from a typical strategy to achieve this result.  The Court declines to add a multiplier.
Considering
the type of case, complexity of the case, length of litigation, and the record as
a whole, the Court concludes that a reasonable amount of attorney fees is $25,547.00.
Defendants
argue that some of the $2,698.99 in costs are statutorily unrecoverable and unsupported
by evidence.  (Opposition at p. 15.)  A prevailing plaintiff in a Song-Beverly action
may recover all “costs and expenses . . . determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1794, subd.
(d).)  “[I]t is clear the Legislature intended
the word ‘expenses’ to cover items not included in the detailed statutory definition
of ‘costs.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North America,
Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.) 
Plaintiff’s billing records show that the expenses are reasonable and recoverable
in this Song-Beverly action.  (See Shahian
Decl. ¶ 77 & Ex. 20.)
The
motion for attorney fees and expenses is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court awards Plaintiff $25,547.00 in attorney
fees and $2,698.99 in costs and expenses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
