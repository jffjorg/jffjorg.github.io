And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part Plaintiff Matthew Morgan's motion for attorney fees and expenses. The Court awards Plaintiff $25,547.00 in attorney fees and $2,698.99 in costs and expenses. The Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel charges unreasonably high rates for some of the work, so the Court reduces the total amount of attorney fees. The Court also declines to add a multiplier to the attorney fees because the case was straightforward and did not involve complex or novel legal issues. The Court awards the costs and expenses as requested by Plaintiff, finding that they are reasonable and recoverable under California law. The motion is granted in part, and the parties must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
