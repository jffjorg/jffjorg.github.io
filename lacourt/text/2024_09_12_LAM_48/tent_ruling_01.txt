  CASE NO.: 22STCV17795
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 12, 2024



 
On August 1, 2024, Defendant
General Motors filed a motion for summary judgment against Plaintiffs Richard C.
Gallegos and Christina L. Gallegos.  The motion
primarily relies on Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209 to
argue that Plaintiffs’ vehicle was not a “new motor vehicle” under the Song-Beverly
Act.
Rodriguez was
argued and submitted to the California Supreme Court on September 4, 2024.  Because the Supreme Court’s ruling in Rodriguez
should be dispositive of this motion, the Court will continue the hearing until
after the anticipated opinion.
Accordingly,
the Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment is CONTINUED to December 17, 2024 at
8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
The
Final Status Conference scheduled for 11/12/2024 at 9:00 a.m. is advanced to this
date and CONTINUED to January 6, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
The
Jury Trial scheduled for 11/25/2024 at 9:00 a.m. is advanced to this date and CONTINUED
to January 21, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of September 2024
