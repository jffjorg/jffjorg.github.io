  CASE NO.: 24STCV18206
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PETITION TO APPROVE
  MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 12, 2024



 
Claimant
Nolan Mernin, a minor, by and through his parent Meghan L. Mernin, has agreed to
settle his claim with Decedent’s uninsured motorist insurer in exchange for $300,000.00.  Of this amount, $4,160.00 is allocated for medical
expenses, $75,000.00 is allocated for attorney fees, and $840.00 is allocated for
costs, leaving a balance of $220,000.00 for Claimant.  If approved, the funds will be invested in a single-premium
deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and cannot find that it is fair and reasonable at this time.
Item
10 does not identify the settling defendant or entity.
Item
11b(2) indicates that Petitioner has a claim against the recovery of Claimant, but
the Petition does not include Attachment 11b(2) as required.
Attachment
13a’s declaration does not sufficiently explain the basis for the attorney fees
request.
The
Petition does not include proof of the fees and expenses, as required by Item 14.
Accordingly,
the Petition is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Petitioner
may file an amended petition with a new hearing reservation.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
