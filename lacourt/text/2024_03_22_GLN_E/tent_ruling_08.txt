TENTATIVE
RULING - MOTION TO DEEM ADMITTED 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
“Plaintiff, Ali Ahmad, moves the Court for an Order: (1) Deeming admitted Plaintiff’s
Request for Admissions, Set One to Defendant, Veracor Financial, LLC, a Georgia
limited liability company; and (2) Imposing Monetary Sanctions in the amount of
$1,761.65 against Defendant and its attorney of record, Michael Plotkin, Esq.,
jointly and severally for Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response to the
Request for Admissions, thereby necessitating the instant motion forcing the
unnecessary expenditure of attorney’s fees and costs by Plaintiff.
 
This
motion is made pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§2023.010 and
2033.280, et seq. on the grounds the requests for admissions are relevant to
the subject matter of this action, Defendant has failed to serve responses to
the above-referenced discovery, and Defendant’s failure to respond is without
substantial justification. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280,
it is mandatory the Court impose a monetary sanction on the party and/or
attorney whose failure to serve timely responses to a Request for Admissions
necessitated this motion.”
 
PROCEDURAL
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, Ali Ahmad
Responding Party: No Opposition by Veracor Financial
LLC, a Georgia limited liability company
 
Procedural
16/21
Day Lapse (CCP §12c and §1005(b): Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP §1013, §1013a): To be addressed at hearing – The instant
motion was served via electronic mail to Veracor’s counsel at
mepesq@earthlink.net on 1/10/2024. This email address is the same email address
listed on eCourt for Veracor’s counsel, Michael E. Plotkin. Several days later
on 1/17/2024, Plotkin filed a “Withdrawal of Electronic Service” for Veracore.
[Plaintiff’s counsel spells Defendant’s name as Veracor, but Defendant’s
counsel spells it as Veracore.] Since the “Withdrawal of Electronic Service”
was filed after Plaintiff served this motion, it would appear that service was
proper if Plotkin’s email address on eCourt was correct. However, since no
Opposition was submitted, the Court would like Plaintiff to address this issue
at the hearing. Further, the Court notes how the Proposed Order was not served
on Defendant.

ANALYSIS
– REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
“Within
30 days after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests
are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting
party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared,
unless on motion of the requesting party the court has shortened the time for
response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended
the time for response.” (CCP §2033.250(a).)
If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (CCP §2033.280(b).) The court
shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. (CCP §2033.280(c).)
Further, if a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP §2033.280(a).) However, the court on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that: (1)
the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230, and (2) the party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).)
TENTATIVE RULING
On
11/28/2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served via email, Request for Admissions, Set
One, on Defendant, Veracor Financial, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company.
(Decl. Salisbury ¶9.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that the last day to serve
verified responses to the Request for Admissions, Set One, was 1/2/2024. (Decl.
Salisbury ¶10.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that no responses to the Request for
Admissions, Set One, have been received as of 1/10/2024. (Decl. Salisbury ¶11.)
If Plaintiff clarifies the service issue addressed
above, the Court is inclined to GRANT Plaintiff’s Motion deeming admitted
Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One, to Defendant Veracor Financial
LLC, a Georgia limited liability company.
Sanctions
“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280(c).) 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$1,761.65 against Defendant and its attorney of record, Michael Plotkin Esq.,
jointly and severally for Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response to the
Request for Admissions.
Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions as follows: (1)
An hourly rate of $425.00 per hour; (2) Two hours preparing this motion; (3)

The Court will discuss the issue of sanctions—which
appear to be mandatory—with counsel.
