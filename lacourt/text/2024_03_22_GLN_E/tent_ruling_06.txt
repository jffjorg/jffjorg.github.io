BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed this
action on 3/24/2023 against Mihran Y. Meguerian and Ivet Grigoryan. On
8/25/2023, Plaintiff named Doe 11 as Modera Event Venue, Inc. after having
discovered the true name of Doe 11.
LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP §2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
ANALYSIS
On
November 2, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant, Modera Event Venue, Inc., with
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One. After several extensions, eventually
on January 31, 2024 when Defendant requested another extension, Plaintiff
granted a final extension to February 14, 2024 for verified responses without
objections. On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff did not receive responses.
TENTATIVE RULING 
Defendant did not provide
responses within 30 days, and Defendant did not provide responses by the
extension deadline.
If
Plaintiff can show proof of service, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses
from Defendant, Modera Event Venue, Inc., to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One, is GRANTED. Defendant is to provide verified responses, without
objections, within 20 days of this order.

Sanctions
CCP §2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions, reimbursement of costs, and
attorney’s fees against Defendant in the amount of $1,661.50.
Plaintiff’s counsel requested sanctions as follows:
(1) A billing rate of $200.00 per hour; (2) Four hours preparing this motion;
(3) One hour of anticipated review of Defendant’s Opposition; (4) One hour of preparation
of Plaintiff’s Reply; (5) Two hours for court appearance; and (6) $61.65 for
the cost of filing this motion.
The Court will discuss the issue of sanctions with
counsel.
