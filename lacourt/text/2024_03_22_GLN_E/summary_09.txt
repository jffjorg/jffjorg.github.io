```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has considered the parties' briefs and supporting papers and has tentatively denied the request for a preliminary injunction. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the likelihood of success on the merits due to the lack of specificity and clarity in the purported agreement between the Plaintiff and her deceased brother. The Judge also criticizes the Plaintiff's credibility based on a declaration submitted by Dr. Moradian, which mentions the Plaintiff's intent to hide assets to qualify for healthcare benefits. The Judge finds this statement to be damaging to the Plaintiff's credibility and requests that the Plaintiff's counsel explain this statement and why it does not fatally damage her credibility. The Judge will hear argument at the hearing on March 22, 2024.
