And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Orlando Price to compel the deposition of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Person(s) Most Qualified (PMQ) for ADA Compliance. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has continued to object to the deposition and refuses to produce documents, while the defendant argues that it has valid objections to the document request and that the plaintiff took the deposition off calendar prior to the deposition. The judge notes that the plaintiff's motion does not clearly explain how it meets the requirements of CCP §2025.450(a)-(b)(1) and (b)(2), and that the defendant's arguments are unclear as well. The judge will hear argument on the motion at the hearing. Additionally, the plaintiff is seeking sanctions under the wrong section of the code, and the judge will also hear argument on this issue.
