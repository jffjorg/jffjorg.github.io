LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO VACATE/SET
ASIDE DEFAULT/DISMISSAL
CCP
§473(b) states as follows:
The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken. However, in the case of a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding determining the ownership or right to possession of real or
personal property, without extending the six-month period, when a notice in
writing is personally served within the State of California both upon the party
against whom the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding has been
taken, and upon his or her attorney of record, if any, notifying that party and
his or her attorney of record, if any, that the order, judgment, dismissal, or
other proceeding was taken against him or her and that any rights the party has
to apply for relief under the provisions of Section 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure shall expire 90 days after service of the notice, then the
application shall be made within 90 days after service of the notice upon the
defaulting party or his or her attorney of record, if any, whichever service
shall be later. No affidavit or declaration of merits shall be required of the
moving party. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court
shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the time within
which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.
 
(CCP §473(b).)
 
Carmel, LTD. v. Tavoussi sheds further
light on CCP §473(b):
 
Section 473,
subdivision (b), authorizes the trial court to relieve a party from a default
judgment entered because of the party's or his or her attorney's mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The section provides for both mandatory and
discretionary relief. Mandatory relief is available “whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect ....” (§ 473, subd.
(b).) “[I]f the prerequisites for the application of the mandatory provision
of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have
discretion to refuse relief.” **699 (Leader v. Health Industries
of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 612, 107
Cal.Rptr.2d 489 (Leader ).) Thus, to the extent that the
applicability of the mandatory relief provision does not turn on disputed
facts, but rather, presents a pure question of law, it is subject to de novo
review. (Ibid.) Where the facts are in dispute as to whether
or not the prerequisites of the mandatory relief provision of section 473,
subdivision (b), have been met, we review the record to determine whether
substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings. (See Howard
v. Owens Corning (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 621, 631, 85
Cal.Rptr.2d 386 [findings of fact reviewed for sufficiency].) Evidence is
substantial when it is of “ ‘ “ponderable legal significance,” ’ ” reasonable,
credible, and of solid value. (Ibid.)
 
“The ‘attorney
fault’ language was added to section 473 in 1988. Prior to that time,
a litigant who suffered a default or default judgment due to inexcusable
attorney error could only obtain relief if he or she could persuade *400 the
court that counsel's behavior amounted to ‘total abandonment’ of the client;
otherwise attorney conduct that was ‘simply inexcusable’ fell between the two
poles and provided no basis for relief. [Citation.] The amendments were clearly
designed to fill this gap. The purpose was threefold: to relieve the innocent
client of the consequences of the attorney's fault; to place the burden on
counsel; and to discourage additional litigation in the form of malpractice
actions by the defaulted client against the errant attorney.” (Solv–All
v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1009, 32
Cal.Rptr.3d 202 (Solv–All ).) But the mandatory provision
of section 473, subdivision (b), “protects only the innocent client [and]
provides no relief for the culpable client who participates in conduct which
led to the default....” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1251–1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322 (Lang ).) If the trial court
finds that the moving party's misconduct was a contributing cause of the default,
that party “cannot rely on the mandatory relief provision of section
473.” (Lang, at p. 1252, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 322.)
 
(Carmel, Ltd.
v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 399-400.)
 
ANALYSIS
Mandatory Relief
“[T]he superior court is only required to grant a
motion for relief under the mandatory relief provision of section 473(b) if the
three conditions are met: (1) the motion is timely filed, (2) is in “in proper
form,” and (3) is accompanied by an attorney affidavit attesting to, and
showing that the challenged order was taken due to, attorney fault. (Jiminez
v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 63 citing Dollase v. Wanu Water,
Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1315, 1322-1323.)
“The range of attorney conduct for which relief can be
granted in the mandatory provision is broader than that in the discretionary
provision, and includes inexcusable neglect. But the range of adverse
litigation results from which relief can be granted is narrower. Mandatory
relief only extends to vacating a default which will result in
the entry of a default judgment, a default judgment, or an entered dismissal.”
(Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603,
616.)
Here, there is a dispute as to whether Plaintiff can
even vacate the dismissal under the mandatory relief provision of 473(b). This
issue stems from Plaintiff admitting that since September 15, 2022, he had been
representing himself in pro per and attorney Mark Goodfriend only representing
him on a couple occasions under a Notice of Limited Scope Representation.
Therefore, Defendants argue the mandatory relief provision doesn’t apply since
he wasn’t represented by counsel, and because the attorney affidavit of fault
does not fully admit fault. 
The Court will not address whether or not the
mandatory relief provision of 473(b) applies because it appears as if Plaintiff
can be granted relief under the discretionary relief portion of 473(b).
Discretionary Relief
“The
court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (CCP §473(b).)
Unlike the mandatory provision, wherein the neglect
does not have to be excusable, the discretionary provision requires excusable
neglect. Further, unlike the mandatory provision, the discretionary provision
has a timeliness provision in which the application for relief must be made
“within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months…”
Plaintiff, Tracey Baumert, submits his own declaration
that states:
2. Since on or about
September 15, 2022, I have been representing myself, in pro per in this action
and/or attorney Mark Goodfriend has represented me on one or more occasions
under a Notice of Limited Scope Representation. Because of illness and unemployment
(see below) and because I am not familiar with or knowledgeable about the law
or legal procedures, even with Mr. Goodfriend’s assistance, which he has
provided to me without charge in connection with this motion and on one or more
other occasions, it has taken me until now to finalize this motion and have it
filed. 
3. Since June 2023, I
have been in and out of the hospital and have suffered from serious health
issues, including bleeding ulcers, gallstones, liver issues that might require
a liver transplant as soon as early 2024, breathing issues, jaundice and my losing
about 60 pounds over about 2 months (about a third of my body weight). In
addition to debilitating health issues, I have been unemployed and have had
substantially no income since at least about April of this year due to strikes
by writers and actors – I work in the entertainment industry – which has
multiplied the stress I have been under. Although the strikes ended in or about
November 2023, I have not been able to return to work. Also, in or about early
December 2023, I got Covid for the first time, and still have not fully
recovered. 
4. I was not aware that a
hearing was to be held on October 9, 2023. I did not appear for the hearing,
because I did not know about it. I acknowledge that I received a notice by
email on or about September 19, 2023 informing me about this hearing, but I never
saw that email, or the notice of the October 9 hearing that the email linked
to, on or before October 9, 2023. The reason I did not see that email or notice
and was not aware of the October 9, 2023 hearing and did not appear is that I
had been sick starting on or about August 31, 2023, and was hospitalized from
September 8 to 15, 2023 (as reflected by Exhibit 1 hereto) and was recovering
and recuperating at least through October, 2023 - and still am. Additionally, I
receive a large number of emails to multiple email addresses that I use for
different purposes, and I am sometimes, and was in this case, overwhelmed by
and unable to keep up with incoming email. 
5. The first time I knew
of a hearing on October 9, 2023 was on or after October 11, 2023, when a Notice
of Ruling was emailed to me, or on or about October 13, 2023, when Mr.
Goodfriend so notified me by email.
(Decl. Baumert ¶¶2-5.)
 
Opposition states that moving party had the burden in
demonstrating that the neglect was excusable and that here Plaintiff did not
demonstrate excusable neglect because Plaintiff admitted that she received a
notice by email on or about September 19, 2023 informing her about the October
9, 2023 hearing and that stating that one didn’t see the email prior to the
hearing date is not excusable neglect.
Opposition also argues that the motion wasn’t filed
within a reasonable time because the dismissal was on October 9, 2023, but this
motion was not filed until December 29, 2023.
Here, the Court finds Opposition’s arguments
unavailing. 
“[W]hat is a reasonable time in any case depends upon
the circumstances of that particular case. While in “the determination of that
question, a large discretion is necessarily confided to [the trial]
court” [citation omitted] there must be some showing—some evidence—as the
basis for the exercise of such discretion.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948)
31 Cal.2d 523, 528.)
The motion appears to be filed in a reasonable time.
First, this motion was filed within 6 months from the dismissal. Further, in
light of the declaration of Baumert, it appears the motion was filed within a
reasonable amount of time due to the circumstances of Baumert being ill for an
extended period of time.
Defendants also argue that excusable neglect has not
been established. Defendants argue that failing to check emails is not
excusable.
The Court finds Defendants’ arguments unavailing. 
As stated in Shapiro v. Clark:
While a request for
relief under section 473(b) is entrusted “largely” to the trial
court's discretion (In re Marriage of Connolly (1979) 23 Cal.3d
590, 597–598, 153 Cal.Rptr. 423, 591 P.2d 911), the law strongly favors an
exercise of that discretion in favor of granting relief. “With respect to
setting aside a default judgment, it is the policy of the law to favor, whenever
possible, a hearing on the merits....” (Orange Empire Nat. Bank v. Kirk (1968)
259 Cal.App.2d 347, 352, 66 Cal.Rptr. 240; see Zamora v. Clayborn
Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 255–256, 121
Cal.Rptr.2d 187, 47 P.3d 1056.) “Because the law favors disposing of cases
on their merits, ‘any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved
in favor of the party seeking relief from default [citations].’ ”
(Shapiro
v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1139.)
“It is therefore
simply wrong to suggest that busyness and lapse of memory cannot justify
relief. The question in each case is whether the circumstances, which may
include busyness and lapse of memory, make the neglect in issue excusable.”
(Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1143.)
Here, in light of
Plaintiff’s health issues, the Court finds Plaintiff’s neglect excusable.
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate the dismissal is GRANTED. The Court will hear argument as to
if there is a service issue. 
Sanctions
Under 473(c):
(1) Whenever the
court grants relief from a default, default judgment, or dismissal based on any
of the provisions of this section, the court may do any of the following:
(A) Impose
a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending
attorney or party.
(B) Direct
that an offending attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars
($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund.
(C) Grant
other relief as is appropriate.
 
(2) However, where
the court grants relief from a default or default judgment pursuant to this
section based upon the affidavit of the defaulting party’s attorney attesting
to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, the relief shall
not be made conditional upon the attorney’s payment of compensatory legal fees
or costs or monetary penalties imposed by the court or upon compliance with
other sanctions ordered by the court.
 
(CCP §473(c)(1)-(2).)
 
The parties do not appear to raise the issue of
sanctions.
