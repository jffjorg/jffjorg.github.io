MEET AND CONFER
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) “The parties
shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Defendant’s
counsel alleges he met and conferred but a resolution was not able to be met.
(Decl. Friedman ¶4.)
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The
court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case
with reasonable precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard
v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727,
734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only
parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose
of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”
(Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
ANALYSIS
Declaratory Relief
Overall,
Defendant’s demurrer is somewhat unclear, in the Court’s view.
Defendant demurs under § 430.10(e) on the basis of
failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
Defendant does not state what facts must be alleged to
successfully allege the elements of declaratory relief; nor does Defendant explain
how Plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege the required elements.
Instead, Defendant argues that because Plaintiffs’
First Supplemental Cause of Action for declaratory relief seeks declaratory
relief as to the proper ownership of the Angeleno Companies but  Plaintiffs do not claim an interest in the
Angeleno Companies, there can be no question that the First Supplemental Cause
of Action and the ownership dispute involve identical parties and identical
causes of action. 
Defendants cite a case that allegedly states that the
pendency of another action growing out of the same transaction is a ground for
abatement of the second action.
Defendant then argues that Plaintiffs don’t have
standing to bring this action because Plaintiffs are not the real parties in
interest with respect to the relief being sought. 
In Opposition, Plaintiffs acknowledge that they do not
claim to own the Angeleno LLC, but argue that that does not deprive them of
standing to seek a declaration as to the ownership of those LLCs. The Opposition
also argues the declaratory relief claim isn’t subject to abatement because the
two actions do not involve identical parties.
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court will hear argument. The briefs have not, in the Court’s view, clarified
the relevant issues for the Court. 
The Court’s tentative inclination is to deny the
demurrer, but the Court will hear from the parties.
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted.
