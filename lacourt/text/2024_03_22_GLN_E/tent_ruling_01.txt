LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO COMPEL
DEPOSITION
Under CCP § 2025.450:
(a) If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
 
(b) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
(1) The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2) The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
(CCP
§2025.450(a)-(b).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Generally
speaking, Plaintiff argues that he has been trying to take the deposition of
Defendant’s PMQ and that Defendant continues to object to the subject areas and
documents to be produced. Defendant argues that when one of the depositions was
re-noticed, it provided valid objections to the document request and refused to
produce documents prior to the deposition. Defendant argues that the Plaintiff
took the deposition off calendar prior to the deposition.
 
The Court will hear argument. Movant does
not clearly explain how it meets the requirements of § 2025.450(a)-(b)(1) and (b)(2).
At the hearing, Movant should explain how it is meeting the requirements of § 2025.450(a)-(b)(1)
and (b)(2). Likewise, it is unclear how Defendant is arguing that Plaintiff has
not met the requirements of § 2025.450(a)-(b)(1) and (b)(2).
 
SANCTIONS
 “If a motion
under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who
noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §2025.450(g)(1).)
Plaintiff moves for sanctions under the wrong section
and cites to 2031.300(c) which pertains to sanctions re: compelling inspection
demands, not compelling a deposition.
Defendant argues sanctions are unwarranted because it fully
intended to produce its PMQ for their deposition, and provided proper, valid
objections, and Plaintiff’s cancellation of the deposition is of no fault due
to Defendant.
The Court will hear argument as to sanctions.
