Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike certain paragraphs from the Cross-Complainants' First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) will be granted in part and denied in part. The motion is made by the Cross-Defendants, Mark Geragos and Paulette Geragos, who argue that the paragraphs requesting punitive and exemplary damages should be stricken because there are no specific factual allegations set forth in the FACC against them. The Court agrees with this argument and finds that the allegations in the FACC do not support the claims for punitive damages. However, the Court is currently disinclined to grant the motion as to the other portions of the FACC unrelated to punitive damages. The case involves a property dispute between neighbors and allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice. The Court will hear from the Plaintiffs, but is leaning towards granting the motion to strike certain paragraphs.
