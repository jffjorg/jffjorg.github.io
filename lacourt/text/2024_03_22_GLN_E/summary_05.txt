And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the plaintiff's cause of action for negligent entrustment. The defendant had argued that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff's claim and that the defendant had no knowledge or information about the defendant's driving history or competence. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that a jury could find that the defendant knew or should have known that the defendant was incompetent or unfit to drive. The court found that the defendant's motion was premature and that a jury should decide the issue. The court also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice and granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice.
