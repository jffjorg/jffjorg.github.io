COURT’S[TENTATIVE]
  DECISION RE:     
 
Motion
  to strike
 



 
I.               
BACKGROUND
On
December 6, 2024, Defendants Saro Dereghishian and Sami’s Auto Body Inc.
(“Defendants”) hired Plaintiff Sason Catering Inc. (“Plaintiff”) to cater an
event. (Complaint ¶ 12.) Defendants and
Plaintiff signed a contract, which required Defendants to pay Plaintiff $42,645
for Plaintiff’s services. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Defendants’ checks bounced. (Complaint ¶¶ 13, 15.) On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants Saro Dereghishian, Sami’s
Auto Body Inc., and Does 1 through 10, alleging five causes of action.
On
July 30, 2024, Saro Dereghishian filed an answer pro per. That same day, Saro
Dereghishian filed a pro per answer on behalf of Sami’s Auto Body Inc.
On
August 26, 2024, this court held a Case Management Conference, where this court
advised Defendants that “a corporation may not be represented by an individual
in pro per” and Plaintiff made an oral motion to strike Defendant Sami’s Auto
Body Inc.’s answer. (08/26/24 Minute Order.) This court deferred the motion so
Plaintiff could file a noticed motion. (08/26/24 Minute Order.)
On
August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike Defendant Sami Auto Body
Inc.’s answer (the “Motion”).
II.            
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiff
asks this court to take judicial notice of Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc.’s
Articles of Incorporation and Statement of Information. (Request for Judicial
Notice p. 2; Ex. 1.)
This
court grants Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452(c), (h).)
III.          
LEGAL STANDARD
“The grounds
for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or
from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437(a).) “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper . . . [s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(b).) 
 
“[A]
corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of
record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate
officer, director or other employee who is not an attorney. It must be
represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD
Constr. Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) The
court may strike or dismiss the pleading filed by an unrepresented corporation.
(Id. at p. 1146.) The court should liberally and routinely grant leave
to amend when the defect is reasonably capable of cure. (Id.)
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION
Defendant
Sami’s Auto Body Inc. is a California Corporation. (Ex. 2; Complaint.) Saro
Dereghishian filed an answer on behalf of Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. “In
Pro Per.” (Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. Answer p. 6.)  A corporation cannot represent itself in
propria persona before this court. (CLD Constr. Inc. v. City of San Ramon, supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145.).) 
Accordingly,
this court grants Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant Sami’s Auto Body
Inc.’s answer.
V.             
CONCLUSION
This
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to strike and grants Defendant Sami’s Auto Body
Inc. leave to refile an answer within thirty (30) days.
This
court further denies Plaintiff’s request that the court enter default against
Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc.
