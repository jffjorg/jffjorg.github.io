And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case between Sason Catering Inc (Plaintiff) and Saro Dereghishian and Sami's Auto Body Inc (Defendants). The Plaintiff had hired the Defendants to cater an event, but the Defendants' checks bounced. The Plaintiff filed a complaint and the Defendants filed an answer, but Sami's Auto Body Inc's answer was filed by Saro Dereghishian, who is not a licensed attorney. The court held a Case Management Conference and advised the Defendants that a corporation cannot be represented by an individual in pro per. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to strike Sami's Auto Body Inc's answer. The judge granted the motion, striking Sami's Auto Body Inc's answer because it was filed by an unrepresented corporation. The judge also granted the corporation leave to refile an answer within 30 days. The judge denied the Plaintiff's request to enter default against Sami's Auto Body Inc.
