Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Leslie Roberts' application for default judgment against DB West Construction, Inc. and Daniel Baughman without prejudice. The case involves a breach of contract and fraud action, where Roberts alleges that DB West and Baughman failed to perform construction and renovation work on her residence in Covina, resulting in various defects, life safety issues, and code violations. Roberts seeks damages in the amount of $259,110, including $198,600 in damages, $31,350 in interest, $28,420 in attorney fees, and $740 in costs. However, the judge ruled that Roberts cannot seek damages in excess of the $64,000 alleged in the First Amended Complaint (FAC), as the FAC does not specify any other damages. The judge also noted that Roberts' allegations "according to proof" are insufficient in a default judgment proceeding, as they do not inform defendants of their maximum liability. The case will proceed to an OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment on October 12, 2023.
