  Case Number:  22PSCV00018    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff Leslie Roberts’s Application for Default  Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Leslie Roberts’s Application for Default  Judgment is DENIED without prejudice. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract and fraud action. On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff Leslie  Roberts entered into an agreement with DB West Construction, Inc. (DB West) and  Daniel Baughman (collectively, Defendants) in which Defendants agreed to  perform construction and renovation work on Roberts’s residence in Covina.  Roberts alleges various defects, life safety issues, and code violations  because of Defendants’ work, resulting in Roberts having to hire a different  contractor and incur damages in excess of $64,000. On  January 10, 2022, Roberts filed a complaint against Defendants and Does 1-20,  alleging the following: (1) breach of contract, (2) negligent construction, (3)  intentional misrepresentation, (4) negligence supervision of construction, and  (5) negligence. On May 19, Roberts filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)  against the same defendants, only alleging (1) breach of contract and (2)  intentional misrepresentation. On October 12, Roberts filed a Second Amended  Complaint (SAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action. On  April 10, 2023, the court struck Defendants’ answer after they failed to appear  and secure counsel. On July  25, 2023, default was entered against Baughman. On August 1, default was  entered against DB West. On August 24, Roberts submitted the present  application for default judgment. An  OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for October 12, 2023. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Roberts  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $259,110,  including $198,600 in damages, $31,350 in interest, $28,420 in attorney fees,  and $740 in costs. For the following reasons, the court DENIES Roberts’s  application without prejudice. A  party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceeds the amount  requested in the complaint. (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822,  826.) In determining the maximum amount of damages allowable, “courts must look  to the prayer of the complaint or to ‘allegations in the body of the complaint  of the damages sought’ to determine whether a defendant has been informed of  the ‘maximum liability’ he or she will face for choosing to default.” (People  ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659, 667, quoting National  Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410,  417-418.) Allegations “according to proof” are insufficient in a default  judgment proceeding as they do not inform defendants of their maximum liability.  (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 1024, 1032.) In  this case, Roberts’ FAC alleges that Roberts paid a total of $64,000 for  Defendants’ services. (FAC, ¶ 24-25.) Roberts does not specify any other  damages and instead alleges them according to proof. Thus, absent an amendment  of the FAC, Roberts cannot seek damages in excess of the $64,000 alleged. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Roberts’  application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
