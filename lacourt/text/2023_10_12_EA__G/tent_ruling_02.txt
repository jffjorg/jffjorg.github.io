Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Cavalry SPV I, LLC’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In September 2019, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) charged
off a credit card account held by Plaintiff Seonah Lee with a past-due balance
of $40,214.15. Subsequently, the balance was reduced to $39,689.70 and
Plaintiff Cavalry SPV I, LLC (Cavalry) purchased the debt.
On December
23, 2022, Cavalry filed a complaint against Lee and Does 1-100 alleging the
following causes of action: (1) account stated and (2) open book account. On
January 16, 2023, Cavalry’s process server personally served Lee in Walnut.
On August
22, 2023, default was entered against Lee and Cavalry submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for October 12, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Cavalry
seeks default judgment against Lee in the total amount of $40,193.20, including
$39,689.70 in damages and $503.50 in costs. Because the court finds Cavalry has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for
default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Cavalry’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
