And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24LBCV01328, where the plaintiff is seeking punitive damages against the defendant, Karena Testman Benskin, and Does 1 to 75. The defendant filed a motion to strike the portions of the complaint that request punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support the claim.

The court finds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to warrant a prayer for punitive damages under Taylor or Dawes, and grants the defendant's motion to strike the relevant portions of the complaint. The court gives the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint.

The ruling states that the plaintiff's allegations of prior arrest for public intoxication and excessive speed are not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and that the court must find clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice to award punitive damages.
