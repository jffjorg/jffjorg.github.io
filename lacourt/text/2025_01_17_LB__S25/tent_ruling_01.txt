  Case Number:  24LBCV01328    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Karena Testman Benskin and Does 1 to 75, alleging, negligence and negligence per se causes of action. Plaintiff alleges that on or about July 1, 2022, Defendants were driving a motor vehicle at unsafe speed while intoxicated on 2nd Street in Long Beach, California and crashed into Plaintiff’s vehicle. (Compl., ¶¶ 7, 9.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants fled the scene after crashing into Plaintiff’s vehicle and was subsequently involved in another car crash with multiple parked vehicles. (Compl., ¶ 9.)On November 21, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to strike. On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On December 30, 2024, the Court continued the instant motion hearing to January 17, 2025. That same day, Defendant filed a reply.Legal StandardA party may move to strike matters from an opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false or improper. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435, 436, subd. (a).) Motion to strike may also target all or any part of pleadings not filed or drawn in conformity with the applicable laws, rules or orders. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) A Motion to Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action. (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.)To obtain punitive damages in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) The clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability . . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1211.)“Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) "[D]espicable” connotes conduct that is ". . . so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Lackner, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210.) “Fraud” is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).) “Malice” is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “Not only must there by circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166.)Meet and ConferThe requirements are satisfied. (Saunders Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, Exs. A-B; Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(2) & (3).)Parties’ ArgumentsDefendant moves to strike the following portions of the complaint:A. Page 7, Paragraph 9(h), Lines 14-17;B. Page 8, Paragraph 13; andC. Page 8, Prayer, Lines 13-17.Defendant argues Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages does not contain specific allegations supporting a conclusion that Defendant acted with oppression, fraud, malice. Defendant distinguishes the present matter from Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 892 in that Taylor fell short of holding that punitive damages are always appropriate in cases involving driving while intoxicated. Defendant contends that the complaint does not meet the heightened standard for the imposition of punitive damages, pointing to the complaint failing to allege Defendant’s level of intoxication and other additional aggravating factors. (See Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88 [a claim for punitive damages withstood a motion to strike as the plaintiffs alleged the defendant drove “with knowledge that probable serious injury would result to persons in the area…” and “ran a stop sign, and was zigzagging in and out of traffic at a speed in excess of 65 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour zone at the entrance to a popular recreation area on a Sunday afternoon when many pedestrians and bicyclists were in the immediate vicinity.”]) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff fleeing the scene is irrelevant to the determination of whether punitive damages are warranted. (See People v. Corners (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 148.)In opposition, Plaintiff argues that sufficient facts have been plead to maintain punitive damages. Plaintiff points out that unlike in Dawes and like in Taylor, here, there are allegations of prior arrest for public intoxication and excessive speed are sufficient. (See Compl., ¶ 9, subds. (a), (c) and (d).) Plaintiff also contends that cases cited by Defendant, including but not limited to People v. Comers, are inapplicable to this case.In reply, Defendant reasserts its earlier arguments, adding that Plaintiff’s prior conduct is irrelevant because the test for conscious disregard focuses on Defendant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged conduct.Tentative RulingThe Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to warrant a prayer for punitive damages under Taylor or Dawes. Defendant’s motion is granted Page 7, Paragraph 9(h), Lines 14-17; Page 8, Paragraph 13; and Page 8, Prayer, Lines 13-17 are stricken. Plaintiff is given 10 days leave to amend.
