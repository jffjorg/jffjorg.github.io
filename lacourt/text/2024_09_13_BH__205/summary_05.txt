And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. denies the motion by defendants Gucci America, Inc. and Krystian Gutierrez to compel Mink Advanced Imaging and Blue Shield of California to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of medical records and to impose sanctions. The defendants had sought to compel compliance after the plaintiff, Candice Wilkinson, refused to comply with the subpoena due to objections raised. However, the Court finds that the parties failed to schedule an informal discovery conference (IDC) as required by the Superior Court's rules, which led to the denial of the motion.
