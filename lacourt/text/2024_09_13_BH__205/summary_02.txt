And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fraud and UCL claims brought by Jocelyn Donald (p/k/a "Jozzy") against Music Publishing Accelerator, LLC and Treehouse Publishing, LLC. The judge ruled that the fraud claim is barred by the economic loss rule, which prohibits a party from converting a breach of contract action into a tort action. The judge also ruled that the UCL claim fails because it is based on the same allegations as the fraud claim and does not allege any fraudulent conduct that will likely deceive the public.

The judge has also granted the motion to seal Exhibits A and B, which contain confidential financial terms and personal financial information. The judge found that there is an overriding interest in protecting the exhibits, which consist of private contracts that contain confidential financial terms and personal financial information. The judge ruled that the information contained in the exhibits is commercially valuable due to its secrecy and would provide an unfair advantage if it became available to industry competitors.
