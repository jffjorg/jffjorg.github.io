And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates. The moving defendant, Gautam Mehra, seeks a 120-day continuance to allow his new counsel to get up to speed on the case and for the parties to complete discovery. However, the judge does not see a need for a continuance at this time. The court notes that the parties have not made an affirmative showing that the substitution of counsel is in the interests of justice, and that the parties have not been diligent in pursuing discovery. The judge also notes that there is no indication that counsel's other trial, set to start on September 25, 2024, is likely to go forward.
