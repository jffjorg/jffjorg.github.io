Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their SAC, strike the cross-defendants' answer, and vacate the entry of default. The plaintiffs had argued that their former counsel's inexperience and error led to their repeated failures to appear at hearings and comply with court orders, and therefore they should be given relief under Code Civ. Proc. §473(b). However, the judge found that the dismissal was due to the plaintiffs' failure to prosecute, which is not grounds for mandatory relief. Additionally, the judge concluded that discretionary relief is not warranted because the attorney's neglect was not excusable.
