* The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to stop the defendants from foreclosing on a property. The plaintiffs, Evan Kagan and Safaa Idyouss, claimed that the defendants had violated the Homeowners' Bill of Rights (HBOR) and sought to enjoin the foreclosure. The defendants, Newrez LLC, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, and others, argued that the plaintiffs were not entitled to HBOR protections because the property was not owner-occupied and the loan was not for personal, family, or household purposes.

The judge agreed with the defendants, finding that the HBOR only applies to owner-occupied residential real property, and that the plaintiffs' loan was a commercial loan, not for personal, family, or household purposes. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs had specifically agreed in the Deed of Trust that they would not occupy the property as their primary residence and that they never intended to occupy it as a principal residence. Therefore, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.
