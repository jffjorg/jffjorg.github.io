  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad
Nezhad, a/k/a Angela Farsad 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendants Alliance Health Choice, Inc., Nadia Goel, and Ramin
Broukhim
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers, opposing declaration, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad, a/k/a Angela Farsad
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Alliance
Health Choice, Inc. (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, demand number 13, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$4,060.
The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date in this action
has passed and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Except
as otherwise provided, “any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to
complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions
concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a).)  “Thus, if a party properly notices a discovery motion to be heard
on or before the discovery motion cutoff date, that party has a right to
have the motion heard.  By negative implication, a party who notices a
discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does
not have a right to have the motion heard.”  (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586 [emphasis in original].) 
Plaintiff filed the pending
motion on August 25, 2023, with a hearing date of July 25, 2025.  (Mot., p. 1:25.)  On November 1, 2023, the court issued a minute
order (1) granting Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue trial and
related dates, and (2) advancing the hearing on this motion from July 25, 2025
to March 8, 2024.  (Nov. 1, 2023 Minute
Order, p. 1.)  In its order continuing
the trial in this action to July 31, 2024, the court ordered that “[a]ll
discovery cut-off and discovery motion cut-off dates, and deadlines for the
exchange of information concerning expert trial witnesses shall be based on the
new trial date.”  (Nov. 1, 2023 Order, p,
1, ¶ 3.)  The court’s electronic case
management system states that, on March 5, 2024, Plaintiff rescheduled the
hearing on Plaintiff’s motion by continuing the hearing from March 8, 2024 to
July 19, 2024.  Thus, the court did not
rule on Plaintiff’s motion on March 8, 2024. 
The court finds that the
discovery motion cutoff date in this action was July 16, 2024, i.e., 15 days
before the July 31, 2024 trial date. 
(Nov. 1, 2023 Order, p. 1, ¶¶ 1, 3; Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a).)  However, Plaintiff (1) rescheduled
the hearing on this motion to July 19, 2024, after the discovery motion cutoff
date had passed, and (2) did not (i) request that the court grant leave to have
a motion concerning discovery heard closer to the initial trial date pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, subdivision (a), or (ii) show that
the considerations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050,
subdivision (b) support extending the discovery motion cutoff date.  (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc., supra,
165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1588 [court’s discretion to grant leave to reopen
discovery is “not unfettered,” and can “be exercised only upon ‘tak[ing] into
consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested’”].) 
The court therefore finds
that, because Plaintiff noticed the pending motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to discovery to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff
date passed, Plaintiff does not have a right to have this motion heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1586.) 
ORDER          
            The court denies plaintiff Angela
Zoreh Farsad Nezhad, a/k/a Angela Farsad’s motion to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents and for sanctions.
            The court orders defendant Alliance
Health Choice, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
