MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Maxie James
(erroneously sued as Maxi Faith James) and Ellae Lisque, LLC              
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Tpine Leasing Capital, L.P.
Motion to Set Aside Defaults and Default Judgment
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants Maxie James (erroneously sued as Maxi Faith James)
(“James”) and Ellae Lisque LLC (“Ellae Lisque”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
move the court for an order vacating (1) the entry of default against James,
entered on October 20, 2023, (2) the entry of default against Ellae Lisque,
entered on March 25, 2024, and (3) the default judgment entered by the court in
favor of plaintiff Tpine Leasing Capital, L.P. (“Plaintiff”) and against
Defendants in the amount of $59,596.06 on April 22, 2024. 
“When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a
party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been
entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice
of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend
the action.  The notice of motion shall
be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the
earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her;
or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the
default or default judgment has been entered.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) 
A motion to set aside a default or default judgment under section 473.5
must be accompanied by (1) “an affidavit showing under oath that the party’s
lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect[,]” and (2) a copy of the answer,
motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (b).)  “‘[W]ith respect to setting aside a default
judgment, it is the policy of the law to favor, whenever possible, a hearing on
the merits . . . .’”  (Luxury Asset
Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
894, 907.) 
The court finds that Defendants have met their burden to show
that the court should set aside their defaults and the resulting default
judgment entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) 
First, the court finds that Defendants filed this motion within the
time required by section 473.5 because (1) the court entered default judgment
on April 22, 2024, and (2) Defendants filed this motion on June 12, 2024, i.e.,
within two years after entry of that default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Second, the court finds that Defendants have complied with the
requirement to file a copy of the pleading proposed to be filed in the action
by submitting a copy of their proposed answer. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (b); Kirschner Decl., Ex. D [Def.
Proposed Answer].) 
Third, the court finds that Defendants have shown that (1) they
did not receive actual notice of this lawsuit in time to defend themselves in this
action and (2) their lack of actual notice was not caused by their avoidance of
service or inexcusable neglect.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subds. (a), (b).) 
Plaintiff filed two proofs of service as to Defendants.  As to James, on October 5, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a proof of service, signed by a registered process server, stating that
James was personally served with the summons, complaint, and other case
management documents on August 29, 2023, at 810 Edgewood Street, 102,
Inglewood, California.  As to Ellae
Lisque, on February 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service, signed by a
registered process server, stating that Ellae Lisque was personally served by service
on the office of the Secretary of State on February 6, 2024, pursuant to the
court’s order granting Plaintiff’s application for order permitting service of
process on Secretary of State.  (Oct. 5,
2023 Proof of Service, ¶¶ 2-5, 7, subd. (e); Feb. 16, 2024 Proof of Service, ¶¶
2-5, 7; Jan. 31, 2024 Order, p. 2:1-20.) 
Because the proofs of service were completed and signed by a registered
process server, there is a rebuttable presumption of the facts stated
therein.  (Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return
of a [registered] process server . . . upon process or notice establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in
the return”].)  The court finds that
Defendants have met their burden to rebut the facts stated in the proofs of
service.  (American Express Centurion
Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390 [because of the statutory
presumption, a defendant must “produce evidence that he was not served”].) 
James has stated, in her declaration, that (1) she was not personally
served on August 29, 2023 at 810 Edgewood St., 102, Inglewood, California; (2)
she does not live at that address and was not present at that address on the
date of service, i.e., August 29, 2023; (3) neither James nor Ellae Lisque
received notice of this action from the Secretary of State, from Ellae Lisque’s
agent of service, or from any other person or in any other manner; and (4)
James learned of this action on or about March 29, 2024, when she received mail
solicitation from a law firm regarding this matter and inquiring whether she
needed legal representation.  (James
Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.)  James has further stated
that neither she nor Ellae Lisque avoided service.  (James Decl., ¶ 4.)  The court finds that this is sufficient to
rebut the presumption of the facts stated in the proofs of service.  (Evid. Code, § 647; American Express
Centurion Bank, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.) 
The court acknowledges that, in support of its opposition, Plaintiff
has submitted documents that defendant James provided to it when seeking
approval of the subject lease,[1]
including a copy of James’s driver license stating her address to be 810
Edgewood Street, Apartment 102, Inglewood, California (i.e., the address of
service).  (Randhawa Decl., Ex. 4, PDF p.
44.)  However, this evidence does not
establish that, on the date of service, James (1) still lived at that address,
or (2) was present at that address and therefore able to accept service of the
summons and complaint.  Moreover, James’s
supplemental declaration, filed in reply, states that, on the date of service,
her residence was 1000 W. 8th Street, Apartment 2305, Los Angeles,
California.  (Supp. James Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the court finds that Defendants
have shown that service did not result in actual notice to Defendants in time
to defend this action and therefore grants Defendants’ motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (c) [“Upon a
finding by the court that the motion was made within the period permitted by
subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of actual notice in time to defend the
action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect, it may set aside the default or default judgment on whatever terms as
may be just and allow the party to defend the action”].) 
ORDER

James, entered on October 20, 2023, is set aside.

James and Ellae Lisque LLC on April 22, 2024, is set aside.

and serve the answer to plaintiff Tpine Leasing Capital, L.P.’s Complaint, in
the form attached as Exhibit D to the “Declaration of Ethan D. Kirschner in
Support of Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Defaults and Default Judgment,”
within five days of the date of this order.
The court sets a Case Management Conference on August 19, 2024, at
8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants Maxie
James and Ellae Lisque LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
