English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses motions filed by two defendants, Caesarstone USA, Inc. and Stylenquaza LLC, in a products liability case. Caesarstone demurred to each claim of the Complaint and moved to strike allegations regarding punitive damages. The Court overruled Caesarstone's demurrer, finding that the elements of negligence and concealment are sufficiently alleged. The motion to strike was denied as to punitive damages.

Stylenquaza moved to quash service of the summons and Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Court granted the motion, but allowed the plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery, including a deposition of Stylenquaza's PMQ, before ruling on the motion. The Court will continue the hearing to allow for this discovery.
