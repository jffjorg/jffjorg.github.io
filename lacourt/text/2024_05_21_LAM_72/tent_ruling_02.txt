 Case No: 
  22STCV29871 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 21, 2024
 Calendar Number:  10



 
 
 
Petitioner Teodora Vasquez (“Petitioner”) seeks the approval
of the compromise of the claims of Plaintiff Scarlett Vasquez (“Scarlett”) (the
Court uses first names for clarity only, and means no disrespect).
 
The Court tentatively DENIES the request because the
attorney’s fee to be taken out of Scarlett’s settlement is too high.
 
Background
 
            This
is a landlord-tenant case. Petitioner, Scarlett, and Gladys Perez
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) lived at 5937 S. Avalon Boulevard, Unit 6, Los
Angeles, CA 90003 (the “Property”). Defendants are the owners and managers of
the Property.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege a number of defects in the Property that Defendants failed to fix,
including plumbing, electrical, and sanitation issues.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that they were forced to vacate the Property on October 27, 2020.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this action on September 13, 2022. The operative complaint is now the
First Amended Complaint, which raises claims for (1) breach of contract; (2)
breach of implied warranty of habitability; (3) nuisance; (4) negligence; (5)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6) wrongful eviction; and (7)
violation of Civil Code, section 1942.4.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.)  The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
            No
party objects to the settlement here.
 
The gross settlement value is $52,500.00. Scarlett will
receive $2,500.00.
 
Petitioner requests approval of $1,000.00 in attorney’s fees
to be taken from Scarlett’s settlement, an amount equal to 40 percent. The
retainer’s agreement attached indicates that the attorney’s fee will be 40% for
all Plaintiffs. The net settlement will be $1,500.00.
 
No costs will be taken out of Scarlett’s settlement. The
retainer agreement attached indicates that costs will be Plaintiffs’
responsibility. It is unclear from the retainer agreement attached how the
costs will be distributed among the parties.
 
The settlement is not intended to reimburse medical expenses
by any of the Minor Plaintiffs.
 
            The
amount of attorney’s fees appears too high as a percentage of the minor’s
recovery.  For this reason, the Court
denies the motion.  The Court would
approve the motion if the attorney’s fees were reduced to $750, which is 30% of
the minor’s recovery.
