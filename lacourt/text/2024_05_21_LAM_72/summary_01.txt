  The lease agreement was terminated on December 10, 2021

Legal Standard:
  To state a cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must establish (1) the existence of the contract, (2) performance or excuse for non-performance, (3) breach, and (4) resulting damages
  To state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege the existence of a duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury
  To state a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, a plaintiff must allege a misrepresentation, knowledge of its falsity, intent to induce reliance, actual and justifiable reliance, and resulting damages

Rulings:
  The court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first and fourth claims
  The court grants the motion with leave to amend as to the second and third claims
  The court denies any motion for judgment as to a claim for negligent misrepresentation on the grounds that the issue is not properly included in the notice and any such motion would be moot because the defendant did not raise a claim for negligent misrepresentation
  The court grants the motion without leave to amend as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim
```
