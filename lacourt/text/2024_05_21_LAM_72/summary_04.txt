And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the Superior Court of California, County of Kern. The court has ordered that the case be transferred for all purposes to the Kern County court. The plaintiffs must pay all transfer costs. The case was originally filed in Los Angeles County, but the defendants have provided evidence that the accident occurred in Kern County, where they reside. The court has ruled that the proper court for the trial is the Kern County court, and the case has been transferred accordingly.
