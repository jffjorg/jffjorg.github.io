The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the request for approval of the compromise of the claims of Plaintiff Scarlett Vasquez, as the attorney's fee of $1,000 to be taken from Scarlett's settlement is too high (40% of the minor's recovery). The judge would approve the motion if the attorney's fees were reduced to $750, which is 30% of the minor's recovery.
