And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Motion to Compel Deposition in part, requiring the Plaintiff, Sean McDowell, to make himself available for a deposition within 20 days of the issuance of this Order. The Motion was filed by Defendant LNP Everland, Inc. and supported by the Declaration of Chad Biggins. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not attend a noticed deposition and did not serve a valid objection. The Request for Sanctions is denied due to Defense Counsel's incivility and the litigation delay caused by the Defendants. The Court notes that Defense Counsel's language in the Motion was not civil and courteous, and that zealous advocacy does not equate with "attack dog" or "scorched earth".
