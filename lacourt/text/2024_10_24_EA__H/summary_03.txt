The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle accident on April 20, 2023. The plaintiffs, David Zucconi and Anahiz Zucconi, filed a complaint against Claire Louise Wallen and others, alleging injuries and damages. Wallen filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, and default was entered on July 12, 2024.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motions to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs to November 25, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to ensure that notice is given to the plaintiffs. The judge has also deferred ruling on Wallen's application for default judgment until the time of trial.
