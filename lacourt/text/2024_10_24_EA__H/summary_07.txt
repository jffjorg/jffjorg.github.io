And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Lisa Leonard, alleges that her mother died due to poor care at a medical facility. The defendant, Emanate Health Medical Center dba Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital's, argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is time-barred.

The judge agrees that the complaint is time-barred, as the plaintiff did not file her original complaint until over one year after her mother's death. The judge also agrees that the complaint fails to plead a cause of action for medical negligence, as it does not allege an act or omission by the defendant that breached any duty of care owed to the plaintiff and/or her mother.

The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer, but grants the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff is required to provide additional information about the intent to sue letter and the statute of limitations.
