Discussion
A.       The Motions To Be Relieved as Counsel
Morgan
& Morgan Los Angeles, LLP seeks
to be relieved as counsel of record for D. Zucconi and A. Zucconi.
The motions to
be relieved as counsel were filed (and served via email and mail) on September
10, 2024 and set for hearing on October 3, 2024. On September 23, 2024, the
Court issued a minute order indicating that notice was insufficient. (See Order
dated 9/23/24.) Due to this notice deficiency, the Court continued the hearing
on the motions to be relieved as counsel to October 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and
directed moving counsel to provide notice of the continued hearing date. Notice
of the order was initially provided to Rightly Perry, the former handling
attorney at Morgan & Morgan Los Angeles, LLP (Los Angeles location), only;
on October 9, 2024, the Court provided notice of the foregoing to Constantinos
Pavlakos, the current handling attorney at Morgan & Morgan Los Angeles, LLP
(Irvine location). There is nothing on the docket reflecting that moving
counsel has given notice of the new hearing date to D. Zucconi and A. Zucconi.
Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing on the motions to be relieved as
counsel to November 25, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. so that notice can be provided. 
Moving
counsel is to provide notice of the continued hearing date in conformity with
California Rules of Court rule 3.1362 forthwith and to file a proof of service
no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date. The Court
will not continue the hearing again.
          B.       The
Application for Default Judgment
Cross-Complainant
Wallen has filed an application for default judgment against D. Zucconi. The
Court will defer ruling on the application until the time of trial. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 585, subd. (e).)
