LLC v. Stone, et al., Case
No. 22PSCV00391
For the reasons stated below, the Court
intends to continue the hearing on Plaintiff Chalmers-Walnut, LLC’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees. During the hearing on October 24, 2024, the Court will hear
from counsel regarding an appropriate continued date.
 
Background 
Case No. 22PSCV00391 
This is an unlawful detainer action
involving the premises located at 19224 East Walnut Drive North, Suite C,
Rowland Heights, CA 91748 (“Premises”). 
On April 19, 2022, Plaintiff
Chalmers-Walnut, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint, asserting two unlawful
detainer causes of action against Snow Stone, Meng Wang (“Wang”), All Unnamed
Occupants in Possession of or in Use of the Premises, and Does 1-50. 
On October 10, 2022, the case
proceeded to trial; that day, the matter was taken under submission. On October
25, 2022, a Court Order Re: Judgment was entered. On November 8, 2022, judgment
was entered. 
On November 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed
(and electronically served) a “Notice of Entry of Judgment.” On December 6,
2022, Plaintiff filed a “Memorandum of Costs.” 
On April 20, 2023, Case Nos.
22PSCV00391 and 23PSCV01012 were deemed related; Case No. 22PSCV00391 was
designated as the lead case. 
On June 20, 2023, Snow Stone filed a
“Notice of Stay of Proceedings,” advising therein of its Chapter 7 bankruptcy
filing. 
On September 26, 2023, Wang filed a
“Notice of Stay of Proceedings,” advising therein of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy
filing. 
A Status Conference Re: Bankruptcy is
set for October 24, 2024. Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees.

 
Case No. 23PSCV01012 
In the related case, Plaintiff alleges
that on November 29, 2022, Plaintiff, Snow Stone, and Wang entered into a
Settlement and Release Agreement, wherein Snow Stone and Wang were required to,
inter alia, leave the Premises in the condition required under the terms of the
Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease—Gross (the “Lease”). Snow
Stone and Wang failed to comply with this requirement. 
On April 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting a breach of contract cause of action against Snow Stone,
Wang, and Does 1-50. 
Again, on April 20, 2023, Case Nos.
22PSCV00391 and 23PSCV01012 were deemed related; Case No. 22PSCV00391 was
designated as the lead case. 
On September 26, 2023, Wang filed a
“Notice of Stay of Proceedings,” advising therein of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy
filing. 
A Status Conference Re: Bankruptcy is
set for October 24, 2024.
Discussion 
Plaintiff
moves the court for an award of attorney fees in the amount of $20,756.00
against Snow Stone and Wang.
The
Court intends to continue the hearing on the motion as there is no indication that
Snow Stone and Wang have been made aware of the October 24, 2024 hearing date.[FN]
Further,
while Plaintiff’s counsel Michael A. Taitelman during the July 23, 2024 Status
Conference Re: Bankruptcy that the bankruptcy as to Snow Stone has “closed,” he
further represented that the bankruptcy as to Wang “remains ongoing.”
There
is no indication on the docket that Wang’s bankruptcy proceeding has concluded;
as such, the stay remains in effect.
