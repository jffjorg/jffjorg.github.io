And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, D.S.A. Sports, Inc., failed to design and operate a fully accessible website for visually impaired people, including herself. However, the judge noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the lack of evidence that the defendant operates the website www.sportsfevercal.com, the failure to attach documentary evidence to support paragraphs 6-13 of the declaration, and the vagueness and ambiguity of paragraph 8 of the proposed judgment. The judge has directed the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses these defects.
