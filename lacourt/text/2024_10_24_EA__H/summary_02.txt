And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the continuous disputes over the hearing date for the Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees. The motion was originally set for hearing on July 10, 2023, but was continued multiple times due to various continuances. Despite the Court's efforts to schedule a hearing, the parties failed to receive notice of the new hearing date, resulting in Snow Stone and Wang becoming self-represented. The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing to October 24, 2024, and has ordered Plaintiff's counsel to give notice to the parties.
