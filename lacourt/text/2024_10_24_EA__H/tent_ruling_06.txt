      Defendants Rushmore Servicing and
U.S. Bank Trust National Association’s (not in its individual capacity, but
solely as Trustee of the Truman 2021 SC9 Title Trust) Demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint is SUSTAINED, with 20 days’ leave to amend.
2.
      Defendants Rushmore Servicing and
U.S. Bank Trust National Association’s (not in its individual capacity, but
solely as Trustee of the Truman 2021 SC9 Title Trust) Motion to Strike Portions
of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is DENIED as MOOT.

I.        Background
Plaintiffs
Virginia Tatlonghari and Ruelito Tatlonghari (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as
follows:
Plaintiffs are the owners of the real property
located at 16320 E. Cherry Blossom Street in La Puente (“subject property”).
Plaintiffs obtained a mortgage loan on the subject property from J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”), which was memorialized by a deed of trust recorded
April 8, 2008 (the “Deed”). On April 8, 2015, an “Assignment of Deed of Trust”
was recorded, wherein the Deed was assigned from Chase to Nationstar Mortgage,
LLC (“Nationstar”). On April 29, 2019, a second “Assignment of Deed of Trust”
was recorded, wherein the Deed was assigned from Nationstar to Selene Finance
LP (“Selene”). On February 22, 2023, a third “Assignment of Deed of Trust” was
recorded, wherein the Deed was assigned from Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC
(“SLS”) to U.S. Bank Trust National Association,
not in its individual capacity but solely as trustee of the Truman 2021 SC9
Title Trust (“U.S. Bank”). On September 12, 2023, a fourth “Assignment of Deed
of Trust” was recorded, wherein the Deed was assigned from Selene to SLS. On
October 3, 2023, a “Notice of Default and Election to Sell” (“Notice of Default”)
was recorded. Plaintiffs were never notified of any foreclosure alternatives
prior to or after the Notice of Default was recorded. Plaintiffs submitted
three loan modification applications and never received any response. On
February 13, 2024, a “Notice of Trustee’s Sale” was recorded. Rushmore Loan
Management Services, LLC (“Rushmore”) was the purported loan servicer of the
mortgage loan. The subject property was sold on May 28, 2024.
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint,
asserting causes of action against Rushmore, U.S. Bank and Does 1-10 for:
1.       Violation of Civil Code § 2923.5,
2.       Violation of Civil Code § 2924.9,
3.       Wrongful Foreclosure,
4.       Unfair Business Practices, Violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq., and
5.       Violation of Civ. Code § 2923.6.
Pending before the Court is Rushmore and U.S. Bank’s
demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint. For the reasons stated
herein, the Court sustains the demurrer, with 20 days’ leave to amend, and
denies the motion to strike as moot.
 
II.      Legal Standard
A demurrer
may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)
“A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole
v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
 
III.     Request for Judicial Notice
A
court may take judicial notice of, among other things, “official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of a state and of facts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” People v. Terry, 38 Cal. App. 3d 432, 439, 113
Cal. Rptr. 233, 237 (Ct. App. 1974) [citing Evid. Code § 452]; See
also Intengan v. BAC Home Loans Servicing LP (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1047,
1054 [court “may take judicial notice of
the fact of the existence and legal effect of legally operative documents, such
as the identity of the beneficiary designated in the deed of trust, where not
subject to reasonable dispute”].) With this standard in mind, the Court grants Defendants’
Request for Judicial Notice (i.e., of the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale dated June
13, 2024 and recorded June 20, 2024).
 
IV.     Discussion
Rushmore
and U.S. Bank (together, “Defendants”) demur, per Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10(e), to the first through fifth causes of action in Plaintiffs’
complaint, on the basis that they each fail to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
 
First Cause of Action (i.e., Violation of Civil Code
§ 2923.5)
Civil Code section 2923.5 requires a mortgage
servicer to attempt to contact a borrower in person or telephonically in order
to assess the borrower’s financial situation and explore options to avoid
foreclosure at least 30 days before a notice of default is recorded. (Civ. Code
§ 2923.5, subd. (a)(2).) If the servicer is unable to make the above contact,
it may satisfy the outreach requirements by first sending a letter and, after
the letter has been sent, attempting to contact the borrower telephonically at
least three times. (Civ. Code § 2923.5, subd. (e)(1) and (2).)
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants “failed to satisfy
the requirements of Civ. Code § 2923.5(a)(2) before recording a Notice of
Default and violated this statute” (Complaint, ¶ 34); however, they earlier
alleged only that they “did not receive any letters from RLMS DEFENDANT” (Id.,
¶ 20). As Defendants state, there is no provision in section 2923.5 requiring
the servicer to confirm that the letter is received; it only requires that the
letter be sent. Because Plaintiffs fail to allege that Defendants made no
attempts to contact them telephonically, any argument to that effect made in
the opposition is disregarded as improper. Defendants’ demurrer to the first
cause of action is sustained on this basis.
 
Second Cause of Action (i.e., Violation of Civil
Code § 2924.9)
Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants failed to notify them as required by Civil Code section
2924.9. (Complaint, ¶ 38.)
Civil Code section 2924.9 provides that “[u]nless a
borrower has previously exhausted the first lien loan modification process
offered by, or through, his or her mortgage servicer . . . within five business
days after recording a notice of default . . . , a mortgage servicer that offers one or more foreclosure prevention alternatives shall send a written
communication to the borrower that includes” the following information: (1) that
“the borrower may be evaluated for a foreclosure prevention alternative or, if
applicable, foreclosure prevention alternatives”, (2) “[w]hether an application
is required to be submitted by the borrower in order to be considered for a
foreclosure prevention alternative”, and (3) the “means and process by which a
borrower may obtain an application for a foreclosure prevention alternative.” (Civ.
Code § 2924.9, subd. (a).) This
requirement “shall not apply to entities described in subdivision of Section
2924.18” and “shall apply only to mortgages or deeds of trust described in
Section 2924.15.” (Id., subds. (b) & (c).) Mortgage servicers
subject to this requirements are liable for economic damages resulting from
“material violations” of section 2924.9. (Civ. Code § 2924.12, subd. (b).)
First,
Plaintiffs have not alleged that the lien is a first trust deed loan or that
the servicer is not an entity under section 2924.18. Next, Plaintiffs have not
pled facts reflecting that the purported statutory violation was “material”
pursuant to section 2924.12, subdivision (b). “Courts have interpreted the term
‘material’ to refer to whether the alleged violation affected a plaintiff’s
loan obligations or the modification process.” (Cornejo v. Ocwen Loan
Servicing, LLC (E.D. Cal. 2015) 151 F.Supp.3d 1102, 1113.) Plaintiffs have
failed to allege how any such violation affected their loan obligations or the
modification process. Defendants’
demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained on this basis.
 
Third Cause of Action (i.e., Wrongful Foreclosure)
“To . . . maintain a wrongful
foreclosure claim, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendants caused an
illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of the property pursuant to a
power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the plaintiff suffered
prejudice or harm; and (3) the plaintiff tendered the amount of the secured
indebtedness or was excused from tendering.” (Chavez v. IndyMac Mortgage
Services (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1052, 1062.)
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants wrongfully
foreclosed on the subject property based upon violations of sections 2923.5 and
2924.9. (Complaint, ¶ 44.) Plaintiffs’ cause of action fails, inasmuch as it is
based on the first two causes of action. Defendants’ demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained on this basis.
 
Fourth Cause of Action (i.e., Unfair Business
Practices, Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.)
To state a cause of action for unfair business
practices, a plaintiff must establish defendant engaged in “unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading
advertising.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) This section establishes three
types of unfair competition, prohibiting “practices that are either ‘unfair,’
or ‘unlawful,’ or ‘fraudulent.’” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 1490, 1496.) 
 
Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants violated
section 17200 “when they purposely violated Civ. Code §§ 2923.5 and 2924.9.”
(Complaint, ¶ 56.) Plaintiffs’ cause of action fails, inasmuch as it is based
on the first two causes of action and because they have failed to allege
standing.
Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action
is sustained on this basis.
 
Fifth Cause of Action (i.e., Violation of Civ. Code
§ 2923.6)
Civil
Code section 2923.6 prohibits “dual tracking,” that is, a permitting a
foreclosure sale to occur while a loan modification application is pending.
More  specifically, subdivision (c)
provides that “[i]f a borrower submits a complete application for a first lien
loan modification offered by, or through, the borrower’s mortgage servicer at
least five business days before a scheduled foreclosure sale, a mortgage
servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record
a notice of default or notice of sale, or conduct a trustee’s sale, while the
complete first loan modification application is pending.” A mortgage servicer “shall
not record a notice of default or notice of sale or conduct a trustee’s sale
until any of the following occurs: (1) The mortgage servicer makes a written
determination that the borrower is not eligible for a first lien loan
modification, and any appeal period . . . has expired[,] (2) The borrower does
not accept an offered first lien loan modification within 14 days of the offer[,]
[or] (3) The borrower accepts a written first lien loan modification, but
defaults on, or otherwise breaches the borrower’s obligations under, the first
lien loan modification.” (Civ. Code §
2923.6.)
Here,
Plaintiffs do not allege that any of their loan modification applications were
deemed complete or that a complete application was submitted prior to the
recording of the Notice of Default or Notice of Sale or prior to the date of
the trustee’s sale. Defendants’ demurrer is sustained on this basis.
 
V.       Conclusion
The
Court sustains the demurrer as to all five causes of action. Plaintiff is
granted 20 days’ leave to amend. (City of Stockton v. Superior Ct., 42 Cal. 4th 730,
747, 171 P.3d 20, 32 (2007) [“[L]eave to amend is liberally allowed as a matter
of fairness, unless the complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of
amendment.”].)
In light of the ruling on the demurrer, the Court
denies the motion to strike as moot.
