And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Lucky B Express, Inc. The plaintiff, Boa Logistics, LLC, is seeking a judgment of $102,099.93, which includes the principal amount of $77,458.08, interest, court costs, and attorneys' fees. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not complied with all the requirements for default judgment, including the use of JC Form CIV-100 to request the court judgment. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to indicate how it calculated its attorneys' fees. Therefore, the judge is denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff may re-file the request after completing the necessary steps.
