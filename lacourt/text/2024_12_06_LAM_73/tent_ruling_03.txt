REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 12/04/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On February
7, 2024, Plaintiff Boa Logistics, LLC filed the instant action against Defendant
Lucky B Express, Inc. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges causes of action for Breach of Contract and Negligence.
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiff is a licensed property broker by the Federal Motor
Carrier Administration. It arranges freight transportation for its customers.
Defendant Lucky B. Express, Inc. ("Lucky B") is a motor carrier
operating interstate to provide services required by Plaintiff. Plaintiff and
Lucky B entered into a contract which provided that, inter alia, Lucky B would
provide transportation services as directed by Plaintiff. Lucky B agreed to
transportation of temperature-controlled shipments and ensure that shipments
would arrive successfully. On January 27, 2022, Lucky B transported a load
directed by Plaintiff. The load was picked up in good condition in California,
but upon arrival at Trader Joe's in Pennsylvania, it was rejected due to
evidence of mouse infestation on the pallets. This breach required the
destruction of the contaminated goods, costing $74,858.08 in product loss and
$2,600 for disposal, for a total principal amount of $77,458.08.
 
On November 21, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant.  
 
On
December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Default Judgment. Plaintiff is requesting a judgment against Defendant in the
principal amount of $77,458.08. In addition to the principal amount, Plaintiff
is entitled to: (1) Interest in the sum of $17,867.24, calculated at the rate
10% per annum on the principal amount of $77,458.08 ($21.22 per day times 842
days from the Loss and Damages Claims form (BOL) dated 8/15/2022; (2) court
costs of $1,043.54; and (3) attorney’s fees of $5,731.07 for a total of
$102,099.93.
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has

judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment,

evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of

The Court does not find that
Plaintiff has complied with all requirements for default judgment. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. While Plaintiff filed a CIV-100 form on November 21, 2024
requesting entry of default, Plaintiff must also file a CIV-100 form to request
default judgment with Section 2 of the form filled out. 
 
On
December 12, 2024, in support of its request for default judgment, Plaintiff
only filed form JUD-100, a memorandum of costs, a summary of the case and a
declaration in support. The Court notes that Plaintiff does not indicate how it
calculated its attorneys’ fees. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED for
failure to complete the CIV-100 form. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
