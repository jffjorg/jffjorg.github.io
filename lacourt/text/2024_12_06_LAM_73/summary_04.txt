And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the dismissal of the cross-complaint. The cross-complaint was originally dismissed on October 2, 2024, due to the defendant's failure to file a declaration in opposition to the dismissal. The defendant argued that his counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect was the reason for the failure to file the declaration. The judge has amended the October 2, 2024 order to reinstate the cross-complaint and has ordered the defendant to file a declaration in opposition to the dismissal due to the 5-year statute of limitations.
