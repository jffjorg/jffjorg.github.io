PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SECOND AMENDED
COMPLAINT (filed 10/15/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2023,
Plaintiff Janet Dixon filed the instant action against Defendant The People
Concern. 
 
On June 12,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file First Amended
Complaint. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges the following. Plaintiff is a resident of Defendant The People Concern,
which is a temporary housing shelter. Plaintiff informed Defendant’s staff that
she does not eat meat, such as beef, chicken or turkey. On April 27, 2023, a
member of Defendant’s staff served Plaintiff dinner that contained chicken. The
staff told Plaintiff the chicken was vegan. However, Plaintiff alleges the
chicken was not vegan and that after eating the food, she became very ill.
Plaintiff alleges she was ill 3 days following the incident and it took her a
day and a half to recover. She alleges that she reported the issue to
Defendant’s staff, but they still continue to serve her meat. 
 
On
October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint,
arguing:
·       Plaintiff
seeks leave to file an amendment to the complaint and a Second Amended
Complaint in order to set forth the basis for punitive damages against the
Defendant as well as verify the complaint.
·       Plaintiff’s
Proposed Second Amended Complaint is based on the same general set of facts as
the Complaint and First Amended Complaint; refers to the same incident(s)
beginning on or about April 20th, 2023, and continuing thereafter; and seeks
recovery for the same injuries suffered by Plaintiff as alleged in the original
Complaint and First Amended Complaint.
 
Defendant
filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Plaintiff’s
motion is procedurally defective
·       Plaintiff did not fulfill the requirements of California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1324.
o   Plaintiff does not state when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered. (CRC Rules 3.1324(b)(3).) Plaintiff’s
supporting declaration also fails to offer any explanation as to why the
amendment was not made earlier. (California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(b)(4). The
motion fails to state meaningfully why the amendments are necessary and proper.
(CRC Rules 3.1324(2))
o   Lack of robustness in a pleading is not a justifiable basis
for filing an amended complaint.
o   None of the alleged acts of wrongdoing by Defendant occurred
later than March 19, 2024, which predates her filing of her First Amended
Complaint.
·       Defendant requests sanctions be imposed against Plaintiff for
bringing a frivolous motion
 
Plaintiff
filed a reply stating that Defendant’s opposition is untimely and should be
disregarded. Plaintiff also maintains that her motion to file SAC is warranted.
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Timeliness of Opposition
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff argues in her reply that
Defendant’s opposition was untimely and should be disregarded. 
 
Opposition papers are required to be filed and served at
least nine court days prior to the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). However, a
court may properly consider papers that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP
section 1005(b) unless “substantial rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300(d); Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)
 
Here, Defendant filed its opposition on November 21, 2024.
The Court finds Defendant’s opposition is timely as it was filed at least nine
court days prior to the hearing date of December 6, 2024. Thus, the Court
considers Defendant’s opposition. 
 
B.     
Legal Standard 
 
The trial court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in
the furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) “There is a policy of great liberality in
permitting amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding.” (Berman
v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) “An application to amend a
pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion.” (Ibid.)   
 
Under Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) of the California Rules of
Court, a separate declaration must accompany a motion for leave to amend and
must specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is
necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) A party seeking leave
to amend must attach a copy of the proposed pleading to the motion for leave to
amend. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a).)  
 
C.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for an order granting Plaintiff
leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. 
Plaintiff substantially complied with CRC Rule 3.1324. Plaintiff provided a declaration in support of the instant
motion, an Appendix of Proposed Changes to the First Amended Complaint and
separately filed the proposed Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff’s declaration
states the effect of the proposed amendments and claims the proposed amendments
will allow for punitive/exemplary damages. (Dixon Decl.,
¶
3.) Plaintiff also states that she discovered on or about September 5, 2024, after receiving the
Defendants’ answers, that she mistakenly did not verify the complaint and that did
not sufficiently state any grounds needed to recover, or attempt to recover,
punitive/exemplary damages. (Dixon Decl., ¶
7.)
 
The courts have a strong policy of allowing motions for leave
to amend. “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion
will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to
amend….” (Morgan v. Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527.)  A court
can deny leave to amend after long, inexcusable delay, where there is
cognizable prejudice, such as discovery needed, trial delay, critical evidence
lost, or added preparation expense.  (Solit v. Tokai Bank (1999) 68
Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448; Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
739, 761; Green v. Rancho Santa Margarita Mortgage Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 686, 692; Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)
 
Defendant does not argue in its opposition that it will be
prejudiced by the motion for leave to amend. Trial in this matter is not set
until June 16, 2025. There is no indication that there was unreasonable delay
in seeking leave or that Defendant would be prejudiced. Plaintiff has indicated
the proposed amendments allow for punitive/exemplary
damages, which is necessary and proper to provide Plaintiff the full
range of remedies available to her. 
 
Therefore, since there has been no showing Defendants will be
prejudiced by the motion for leave to amend and Plaintiff
has substantially complied with the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b), Plaintiff’s motion is
GRANTED.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
