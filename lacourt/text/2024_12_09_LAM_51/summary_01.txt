And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Uber Defendants' motion to compel arbitration, requiring Plaintiff Soho Yun to arbitrate her dispute with Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Raiser-CA, LLC. The judge found that the parties had agreed to arbitrate disputes through their Terms of Service, which Plaintiff had accepted. The judge noted that the Terms of Service contained an arbitration provision and that Plaintiff's Complaint was based on a motor vehicle accident while using Uber's services. Since there was no opposition to the motion, the judge granted the motion and stayed the case as to the remaining defendants.
