Moreover, even if Cuglietta had not rebutted this assertion, the court would
find that Axume’s observation that Cuglietta was intoxicated would not,

claims of misconduct if satisfied that the consumption of liquor was not likely
to have affected the indulgent jurors’ capacity to competently perform their
duties[,]” and (2) Plaintiff did not present evidence establishing that
Cuglietta consumed enough alcohol so as to render him incapable of performing
his duties.  (Axume Decl., ¶ 10; Hasson
v. Ford Motor Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 388, 412.)
