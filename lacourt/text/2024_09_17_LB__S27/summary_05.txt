And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to appear pro hac vice, which would allow John J. Wackman to represent Veoride, Inc. in a court case. The judge has denied the motion due to service issues. The proof of service submitted by Wackman does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court 9.40, which requires proof of service on all parties who have appeared in the action and on the State Bar. The judge has ordered Veoride, Inc. to give notice of the denial. The parties must indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling by calling the court or submitting an email with the case number and party name. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they must arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
