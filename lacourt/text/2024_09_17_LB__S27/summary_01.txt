And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to compel further responses, declaration, memorandum of points and authorities, separate statement, and proposed order. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Digital Planet Studio, Inc. and Irfan Merchant, against the defendants, Thunder Studios, Inc., Roderic M. David, Rolando Nichols, Candela Rebot, and Leslie Sorrentino. The judge has granted the motion, but with certain conditions. The plaintiffs must reserve separate hearing dates and pay separate filing fees for each motion, as the motion was filed as a single motion but is really four separate motions. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer in an attempt to resolve the discovery disputes between them. If they are unable to do so, the judge may appoint a discovery referee instead of ruling on the motions.
