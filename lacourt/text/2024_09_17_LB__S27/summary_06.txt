And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has seen a significant increase in discovery motions in lemon law cases, particularly motions to compel further responses and PMK depositions. The parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these issues, leading to unnecessary attorneys' fees and a backlog of motions on the court's docket. The court has previously ruled on similar issues and believes that the parties can easily resolve their disputes with further discussion. The court is ordering the parties to meet and confer on the issues before the continued hearing date and to file briefs and declarations if they are unable to resolve their disputes. The court is also continuing the hearing for one month and imposing sanctions if the parties fail to comply with the court's orders.
