And here is a summary of the judicial document in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by General Motors LLC (Defendant) against Jesus Camez Eschevarria and Joanna S. Flores (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs purchased a used car from a third-party dealer with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's warranty. The Defendant argues that the car does not meet the statutory definition of a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act, and therefore, the Plaintiffs cannot bring a claim under the Act. The judge notes that there is a split in circuit court authority on this issue, with the Second Appellate District holding that a previously owned motor vehicle purchased with the manufacturer's new car warranty still in effect is a "new motor vehicle" as defined under the Act (Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc., 2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 913). The judge concludes that the definition of "new motor vehicle" under the Act includes used cars sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's new motor vehicle warranty, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
