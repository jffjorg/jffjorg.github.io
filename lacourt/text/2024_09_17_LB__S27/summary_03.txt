And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the parties' positions and arguments in this case. The defendant, Perry G. Wong's estate, seeks to discover Officer Burchard's personnel file, including medical and workers' compensation records, to determine if the damages claimed by Officer Burchard were caused by past injuries. The County of Los Angeles (COLA) opposes the motion, arguing that the records sought are not relevant to the case and that they are entitled to privacy.

The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the discovery and that the records sought are relevant to the case. The court will conduct an in-camera inspection of the subject documents to determine which records should be disclosed to the defense.

The court also notes that COLA failed to file proof of service of the moving papers on the defendant, but since COLA filed an opposition to the motion, the court presumes that COLA was served with the moving papers. The court will not require the defendant to serve an additional subpoena to the third-party administrator if COLA is able to access the records.

Finally, the court orders that the disclosed information may not be used for any purpose other than a court proceeding pursuant to applicable law, and that COLA has submitted a proposed protective order in this regard.
