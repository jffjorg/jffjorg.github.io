The court has issued a tentative ruling on the matter of whether Defendants' employees, Enrique Olvera and Andrew Shallon, should be permitted to attend Plaintiff Marilyn Dwellingham's deposition.

The court also notes that the parties should resolve the issue of how the deposition will be conducted and when it will be conducted, and suggests that Whallon and Olvera can assist Counsel in guiding the deposition through text messages or other means. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer forthwith to resolve the issue.
