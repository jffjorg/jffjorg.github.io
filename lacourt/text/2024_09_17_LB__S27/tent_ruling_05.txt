 Case Number:  23LBCV01317    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 John J. Wackman seeks permission to appear pro hac vice to represent Defendant,
Veoride, Inc.  The application satisfies
CRC 9.40.  The application is denied,
however, due to service issues.  The
proof of service indicates the application has been served on the parties to
the action.  CRC 9.40 requires proof of
service on all parties who have appeared in the action and on the State
Bar.  Wackman declares he served the
State Bar, but this is not the same as proof of service on the State Bar, which
is required by the Rules of Court.  
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must call the court at 562-256-2227 indicating intention to
submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive a phone call indicating the parties are
submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the
motion may be placed off calendar. 
If a party submits on the tentative, the party’s email must include the
case number and must identify the party submitting on the tentative.  If the parties do not submit on the
tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.
