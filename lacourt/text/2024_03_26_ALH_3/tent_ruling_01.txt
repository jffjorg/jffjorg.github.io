  2024



 
On January 18. 2022, plaintiff Zvi
 Kriple (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Holly Hawk
(“Defendant”) arising from a dispute over the costs of boarding for a horse
 named Shan’s Ready.  On December
 5, 2023, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories - General (Set
One) on Defendant. (Kriple Decl., Ex. 1.) No responses were
received. (Kriple Decl., ¶ 3.) On January 31,
 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant
a letter requesting to meet and confer regarding Defendant’s failure to respond
and failure to request an extension to the deadline to respond. (Kriple Decl.,
Ex. 2.) 
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this motion for an order compelling Defendant to serve discovery responses.
However, there is no proof of service on file showing that the motion was ever served
on Defendant. Accordingly, the motion is taken off calendar.
