Here is a summary of the document in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Louis A. Sparks, Jr. v. Willie Bell, et al. The case involves a complaint alleging murder and conspiracy, and the defendant has served discovery requests, including form interrogatories, inspection demand, and requests for admission. The plaintiff has failed to respond to these requests, and the defendant has moved to compel responses and deem requests for admission admitted. The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend, and the plaintiff has failed to amend the complaint within the specified time period.

The court has granted the defendant's motions to compel responses and deem requests for admission admitted, and has also granted the defendant's ex parte application to dismiss the case against the Bell defendants. The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint, and has warned that if the plaintiff does not appear at the hearing and provide reasonable grounds for his failure to amend, the court will dismiss the Bell defendants with prejudice.
