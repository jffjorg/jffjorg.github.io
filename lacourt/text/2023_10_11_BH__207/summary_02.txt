And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Beverly Hills Escrow, Inc. (BHE) to deposit the unrecorded grant deed and escrow funds with the clerk of the court and be discharged as a stakeholder in the lawsuit. BHE is an escrow company that was selected to hold the escrow funds and deeds in connection with a real estate transaction between the plaintiff, Fred Behfarin, and the defendants, DH Distribution and Sergey Menshikov. BHE asserts that it has no interest in the escrow funds, grant deed, or subject property, and that it is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the outcome of the dispute.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the parties dispute which set of escrow instructions controls, and that the plaintiff seeks declaratory relief that the first set of escrow instructions controls, which would require BHE to deposit the funds with the plaintiff and record the grant deed. The judge concludes that BHE would be a necessary party to afford the plaintiff complete relief, and that the clerk of the court cannot step into BHE's shoes with respect to the declaratory or injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff.
