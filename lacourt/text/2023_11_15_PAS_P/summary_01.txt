Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend in this unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, 1819 Wilson Avenue, LLC, alleges that the defendants, Carlos and Sheri Bermejo, failed to pay rent due under the lease and that the defendants failed to vacate the property. The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the 3-day notice to quit is defective and that they do not owe the plaintiff attorney fees under the lease.

The judge finds that the 3-day notice is defective because it seeks rent due more than one year ago and does not specify that Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are excluded. The judge also finds that the notice is based on attorney fees incurred in connection with a DFEH proceeding, which does not constitute amounts due under the lease.

The judge orders the demurrer to be sustained without leave to amend and that the defendants give notice of this ruling and serve and lodge a proposed Judgment of Dismissal forthwith.
