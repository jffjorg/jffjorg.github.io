Pursuant to CCP §§ 430.41 and  435.5(a), the meet and confer requirement has
been met.(Stephens
Decl., ¶ 2; Colangelo Decl., ¶¶ 2-10.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and
confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP, § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not
constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court continues on to the
merits.
