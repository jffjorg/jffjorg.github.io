[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
3 Legged Machine, Inc. d/b/a Blackberry Smoke (“Plaintiff”) appears to request entry
of default judgment against Defendant Thunder on the Iron Range, LLC in the
total amount of $47,265.54, comprising $32,200.00 in damages, $3,184.71 in
interest, $968.33 in costs, and $10,912.50 in attorney’s fees.
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First,
Item 2(c) of the Request (Form CIV-100) states that Plaintiff seeks interest in
the amount of $3,184.71. However, Item 6(a)(2) of the Proposed Judgment (Form
JUD-100) indicates that Plaintiff seeks interest in the amount of 4,860.88.
Thus, the total amounts listed in Item 2(f) of the Request and Item 6(a)(6) of
the Proposed Judgment do not match. In his supporting declaration, Mr. Wilson,
III, states that Plaintiff is entitled to interest in the amount of $3,184.71.
(Wilson, III Decl., ¶ 13.) Mr. Wilson, III also states that he “arrive[d] at an
amount of $4,860.88 for the pre-judgment interest.” (Wilson, III Decl., ¶ 19.)
Thus, it is unclear which amount of interest Plaintiff seeks. 
Second,
Mr. Wilson, III states that “the loss of $32,200.00 was incurred on July 29,
2022 while this declaration was prepared on January 30, 2024; between these
dates, there have passed 551 days.” (Wilson, III Decl., ¶ 19.) However, it
appears that there are 550 days between the dates of July 29, 2022 and January
30, 2024. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
