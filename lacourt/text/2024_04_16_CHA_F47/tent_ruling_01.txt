REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED 

 

Motion filed on 10/12/23.   

 

MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez

RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Fresh
Start Healthy School Meals, Inc.



NOTICE: ok

 

RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
that the
truth of each matter specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set 2,
served on 8/30/23 to Defendant Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc. be deemed
admitted.  Additionally, Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Fresh Start Healthy in the amount of $2,460.00.

 



RULING: The request to deem Requests for
Admissions admitted is denied.  The
request for sanctions is granted in a reduced amount as set forth below.  

 

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

This action arises out of Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez’s
(Plaintiff) employment as a truck driver with/for Defendants: (1) Juan Carlos Saucedo (Saucedo), (2) K12 School Services
(K12), 

(3) Fresh Start Healthy School Meals (Fresh Start
Healthy) and (4) Fresh Start Meals, Inc. (Fresh Start Meals).  On 8/2/21, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendants for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (3)
Non-compliant Wage Statements; (4) Wages Not Timely Paid During and Upon
Separation of Employment; (5) Unpaid Business Expenses; (6) Unpaid Meal Period
Premiums; (7) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums; (8) Violation of California Business
& Professions Code§§ 17200, et seq.; and (9) Failure to Provide Employment
Records in Violation of Labor Code§§ 1198.5 & 432.7.

 

On 8/30/23, Plaintiff served Fresh Start Healthy with
Requests for Admissions, Set 2, making responses due on or before 10/2/23.  (Roshanian Decl.).  Fresh Start Healthy did not serve responses
despite Plaintiff’s counsel’s meet and confer efforts.  Id. 
Therefore, on 10/12/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order that the truth of each matter specified in Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admissions, Set 2, served on 8/30/23 to Defendant Fresh Start
Healthy be deemed admitted.  Additionally,
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Fresh Start Healthy in the amount of
$2,460.00.  On 3/21/24, Fresh Start
Healthy filed and  served an opposition
to the motion.  On 4/8/24, Plaintiff filed
and served a reply to the opposition.    

 

ANALYSIS

 

The opposition indicates that Fresh Start Healthy served
responses to the subject Requests for Admissions on 2/27/24.  In the reply, Plaintiff concedes receipt of
late responses.  As such, the Court cannot
deem the Requests for Admissions admitted. 
See CCP 2033.280(a)-(c); St. Mary’s (2014) 223 CA4th 762,
775-776.

 

While Fresh Start Healthy argues that sanctions should
not be imposed because it was not aware of the discovery because of a breakdown
in the communication between it and its former counsel, Fresh Start Healthy fails
to cite applicable authority to support its position.  Rather, Fresh Start Healthy relies on CCP
2033.290(d), which applies to motions to compel further responses to requests
for admissions.  

 

CCP 2033.280, the applicable statute regarding the
failure to serve timely responses, provides that the imposition of monetary
sanctions is mandatory when the failure to serve timely responses necessitated
the motion.  See CCP
2033.280(a)-(c).   

 

However, the Court finds the $2,460.00 in sanctions requested
to be excessive.  The Court awards $1,560.00
in sanctions (1 hour to prepare the motion + 1 hour to review the opposition
and prepare the reply + 1 hour to appear at $500/hour + $60.00 filing fee).

 

CONCLUSION

 

The request to deem Requests for Admissions, Set 2, served
on Defendant Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc. on 8/30/23, admitted is
denied.  The request for sanction is
granted in a reduced amount.  Sanctions in
the amount of $1,560.00 are imposed against Defendant Fresh Start Healthy
School Meals, Inc. and are payable within 30 days.
