The judge also grants the defendant's request for summary adjudication as to issue 3, which relates to the defendant's hiring of Lagnado.

The judge denies the defendant's request for summary adjudication as to issues 1 and 2, which relate to the defendant's supervision and retention of Lagnado. The judge also denies the defendant's request for summary adjudication as to the entirety of the 4th and 5th causes of action.
