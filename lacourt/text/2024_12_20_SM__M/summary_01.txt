And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel initial discovery responses and deem Requests for Admission admitted. The defendant, Pepperdine University, moved to compel the plaintiff, Breanna C. Webb, to produce verified, code-compliant responses to the defendant's Form Interrogatories and to deem the Requests for Admission admitted. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant filed the wrong motion.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide a timely response to the Form Interrogatory, and therefore granted the motion to compel. The judge also found that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff failed to serve a substantially code-compliant response to the Requests for Admission, and therefore denied the motion to deem admitted.

The judge noted that the plaintiff served a substantially code-compliant response to the Requests for Admission before the hearing on the motion, and therefore the defendant's motion was untimely. The judge also noted that the defendant failed to provide any evidence that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.

As a result, the judge granted the motion to compel, but denied the motion to deem admitted. The judge also declined to impose sanctions, citing the mixed success of the defendant's motions.
