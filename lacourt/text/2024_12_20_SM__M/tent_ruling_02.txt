MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Deposition of Drinkwater

Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated”
witness (officer, director, managing agent or employee of party) to attend and
testify, as well as produce any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing for inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce
documents or tangible things for inspection without having served a valid
objection under CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order
compelling attendance, testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The
motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party
deponent fails to attend the deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by
a declaration stating that the moving party has contacted the party deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) If the deposition
notice included a request for production of documents, the motion to compel
attendance must also show good cause to justify the production. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) 
  
A motion to compel production of documents described in a
deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of good cause. (CCP §
2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must provide declarations
containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents described in
the notice. Courts liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where
facts show the documents are necessary for trial preparation. 
 
The motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).)
This time limit also applies to motions based on a deposition subpoena for
production of documents or a business records subpoena. The 60-day time limit
runs from the date objections are served because the deposition record is then
complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1192.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Diplomat Property Manager
LLC moves for an order compelling the deposition of Defendant Ginger Drinkwater,
monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,300.00, and for a terminating sanction
against Drinkwater. 
 
On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff served
on Drinkwater a "Notice of Deposition and Request For Production of
Documents to Defendant, Ginger Drinkwater.” (Yassin Decl., Ex. A.) The date for
the deposition was set for November 12, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. by way of remote
deposition before a certified court reporter. On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
sent a letter to Drinkwater at both street addresses for the Subject Property with
a copy of the court reporter's remote appearance link and court reporter' s
information for the scheduled deposition on November 12, 2024. (Yassin Decl., ¶
3.) On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff sent two emails to Drinkwater at her email
address providing the remote deposition link. (¶¶ 4-5.) Drinkwater failed to
respond to any communications. (¶¶ 6-8.) On November 12, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.,
Plaintiff’s counsel appeared at the scheduled deposition along with a Court Reporter
via Zoom to conduct the deposition. (¶ 7.) At 10:20 a.m. the Court Reporter
took a Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id., Ex. E.) Drinkwater failed to appear
for her deposition and failed to make any effort to contact Plaintiff’s counsel
to advise of her inability to attend her deposition or to otherwise seek an
alternative date. (¶ 8.)
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel is
GRANTED. Sanctions are imposed in the reduced total amount of $1,600.00,
inclusive of costs, against Drinkwater and in favor of Plaintiff. Sanctions are
to be paid within 30 days.  The deposition
is ordered to occur within 20 days.
