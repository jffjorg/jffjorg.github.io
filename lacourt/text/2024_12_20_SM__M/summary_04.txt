And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied a motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiffs Orie Prince and Ryan Weiss. The Plaintiffs seek an accelerated trial date to resolve their habitability case against Defendants Harel, et al., who allegedly failed to maintain the Premises in a safe and habitable condition, leading to constructive eviction and health issues. The Judge found that while the Plaintiffs' situation is sympathetic, the court's calendar does not permit priority of this case, and the Plaintiffs do not present unique circumstances that justify their priority over other cases. The Judge is not persuaded that granting priority would serve the interests of justice, and therefore, the motion is denied.
