Summary:

The court has granted the City of Santa Clarita's motion for a preliminary injunction against Tacos Jacky and other defendants, ordering them to cease their unpermitted sidewalk vending food preparation and service operation. The court found that the defendants had repeatedly violated local regulations and had been issued multiple citations and fines, and that the city had a legitimate interest in protecting public health and safety. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that the state statutes preempted any local regulation of sidewalk vending, finding that the city had the authority to establish additional regulations under its police powers.
