SUMMARY OF ACTION
On May 9, 2023, plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan acquired
a single parcel of real property with a multi-unit building. The property was
sold pursuant to a trustee sale following the default on the secured loan to
the property by defendant Linda Maultsby. On September 1, 2023, plaintiff filed
a complaint for unlawful detainer as to 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles.
 
On October 2, 2023, the clerk entered a default against all
unnamed occupants. On October 24, 2023, the court denied Defendant’s motion to
quash service of the summons and complaint. The court ordered Defendant to
serve a responsive pleading within five (5) days of service of the order. On
November 2, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of filing of a petition for writ of
mandate. On November 30, 2023, the Appellate Division issued an order denying
the writ of mandate. 
 
On December 12, 2023, the clerk rejected the request for
entry of default applications seeking possession of the premises, due to the
failure to dismiss all unnamed occupants. At the time of the January 5, 2024,
Case Management Conference, the court set an OSC re: Why Default Should Not Be
Entered Based on The Determination of The Writ Proceedings Before the Court of
Appeals for January 19, 2024. On January 19, 2024, the court acknowledged the
petition to the California Supreme Court, and set a hearing date for March 5,
2024. The court took the hearing off-calendar upon representation of notice
that the California Supreme Court rejected the writ of mandate. 
 
On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint. On March 21, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of related cases listing
eight separate cases filed by Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan against Maultsby, et
al. One case precedes the subject action. The courtroom with the older case
declined to relate the cases on March 22, 2024. On March 27, 2024, the court
took the motion to transfer off-calendar and directed Plaintiff to file any
such motion in Department 1. 
 
RULING: Sustained without Leave to Amend.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
·        
The
court takes judicial notice of the existence of the outside trial court orders,
but not any content including factual findings. (Kilroy v. State of California (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 147-148; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) The orders also constitute unpublished material, and
therefore not citable for any reference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a); Rittiman v. Public Utilities Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote 18).)
 
Defendant Linda Maultsby submits a demurrer to the complaint
for unlawful detainer on grounds of lack of capacity to bring the unlawful
detainer action, insufficient facts, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. More
specifically, Plaintiff only represents an approximately 47% ownership interest
in the property, with no other co-owner(s) named as a party to the action. The failure
to join all co-tenants effectively renders the notice to quit defective due to
both the lack of any identification of all parties. The notice also fails to
address all unnamed co-tenants. Defendant also denies proper service. Plaintiff
in opposition maintains the failure to name all co-owners is “irrelevant” to
proceeding with the instant unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff also contends
any challenges to the propriety of the service itself constitutes extrinsic
evidence beyond the scope of the demurrer. Defendant in reply references the
prior proceedings and reiterates the insufficient three day notice in the
current case. Plaintiff challenges any and all efforts to cure the previously
determined flawed notice. 
 
Exhibit 1 in the first amended complaint incorporates a copy
of the trustee’s deed upon sale to the following persons/entities: “MURAL MEDIA
LLC 401K PLAN AS TO AN UNDIVIDED 47.618% INTEREST AND PENSCO TRUST COMPANY LLC,
CUSTODIAN FBO SYLLA MCCLELLAN IRA; 080000001321 AS TO AN UNDIVIDED 23.810%
INTEREST AND JAMES C. ELKINS AND MELINDA J. ELKINS, TRUSTEES OF THE ELKINS
FAMILY REVOCABLE TRUST OF 2002, AS TO AN UNDIVIDED 16.667% INTEREST AND LA WREN
CE HENIG, TRUSTEE OF THE LA WREN CE C. HENIG, D.D.S., INC. AGE BASED PROFIT
SHARING PLAN AS TO AN UNDIVIDED 11.905% INTEREST.” The complaint is only
brought the 47.61% ownership interest. The notice to quit and/or vacate the
premises dated August 24, 2023, lacks any identified owner. [First Amend.
Comp., Ex. 2.] The February 29, 2024, Notice to Occupant(s) to Vacate Premises
and Land only identifies Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan. [First Amend. Comp., Ex. 4.]
 
Plaintiff, as a cotenant seeking possession of the property
from a trespasser, e.g. a holdover tenant, may in fact bring an action on
behalf of all parties without all parties named in the action. (McCormick v. Marcy (1913) 165
Cal. 386, 392 [“One tenant in common may recover possession of the whole estate
against all persons except his cotenants, and his recovery inures to the
benefit of his cotenants”]; Newman v. Bank of Cal. (1889) 80 Cal. 368, 372 [“But such tenant may maintain an
action against a mere trespasser for the possession of the whole of the
property”].) The court therefore finds a basis of standing and no improperly
omitted parties for purposes of the subject action.
 
The underlying foreclosure sale renders the action subject
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision (b). As a foreclosed upon
owner, the holdover tenant may receive notice on a three day timeline. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161(3).) 
 
Defendant may not raise service of process issues in a
demurrer. The demurrer constitutes an appearance in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1014.) Defendant was required to
concurrently file a motion to quash to challenge service and jurisdiction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (e) [“A defendant or
cross-defendant may make a motion under this section and simultaneously answer,
demur, or move to strike the complaint or cross-complaint”].)
 
Notwithstanding the above
challenges, the court considers the substantive challenges to the three day
notices. Defendant in reply emphasizes the prior court orders
determining the prior notices invalid. Plaintiff apparently filed multiple
unlawful detainer actions in various courtrooms, presumably in hope of
successfully proceeding on one of them. 
 
Defendant admits to not bringing any challenge on grounds of
claim preclusion, and the court declines to sua sponte make any argument for
Defendant. The court therefore also declines to exercise any exception to the
judicial notice rules allowing potential consideration of the content of the
other trial court orders for purposes of claim preclusion. Defendant also
failed to challenge the complaint on grounds of abatement due to other pending
actions on the same rights and claims. 
 
On the actual three day notices incorporated into the first
amended complaint, it remains undisputed that Plaintiff served the first August
24, 2023, dated notice to quit prior to filing the complaint on September 1,
2023. Following the delays due to the writs of mandate to the Appellate and
California Supreme Court, Plaintiff served a new notice to quit dated February
29, 2024, and an amended complaint on March 14, 2024. 
 
As referenced above, the revised notice appears sufficient
in timing, and standing based on identification of the real party in interest
exerting rights to regain possession. Nevertheless, the court finds the first
notice to quit lacked basic identifying information of the real party in
interest, and therefore constituted invalid notice. While Plaintiff presumably
assumed the revised notice supersedes the prior notice, lacking from the
opposition is any legal support for the right to file a superseding notice
following service of a prior, defective notice. 
 
The filing of the complaint with the defective notice
in the instant action rendered the entire action invalid. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1161a; Esa Management, LLC v. Jacob (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1 [278 Cal.Rptr.3d 482, 484]; American Nat. Bank of Santa Monica v. Johnson (1932) 124 Cal.App.Supp. 783, 787.) “A residential tenant
cannot waive the notice provisions.” Esa
Management, LLC v. Jacob, supra, 63
Cal.App.5th Supp. 1 [278 Cal.Rptr.3d 482, 485].) The court therefore finds the
superseding notice within the same action constituted an invalid effort to
rescue the prior defective notice and improperly extend the action. Plaintiff
cannot amend the complaint seeking to correct the defective notice to quit. A
new action is/was required.
 
The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and
the action dismissed.
 
Maultsby to give notice to all parties.
