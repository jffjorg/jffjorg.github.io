And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against defendant Robert McFarlane. The defendant failed to comply with the court's order to serve further responses to interrogatories, and has now violated two court orders. The plaintiff had previously moved for sanctions, but the court denied the motion and ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses to discovery. The defendant did not comply with this order, and the plaintiff's motion for sanctions is now granted. The court will impose evidentiary, issue, and monetary sanctions against the defendant.
