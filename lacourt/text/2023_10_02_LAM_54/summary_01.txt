And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against defendant Robert McFarlane. The defendant failed to comply with the court's order to serve further responses to interrogatories, and despite a previous warning, did not provide adequate supplemental responses. The court finds that the requested sanctions, including evidentiary, issue, and monetary sanctions, are appropriate given the defendant's willful failure to comply with discovery orders. The defendant did not oppose the motion, and the court has considered the totality of the circumstances, including the detriment to the plaintiff and the number of attempts to obtain discovery. The judge notes that the penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.
