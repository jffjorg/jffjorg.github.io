This is a wage and hour, PAGA, and UCL suit.  Defendant Techno-Advanced, Inc. seeks to quash service of summons with regard to its CEO, CFO, and secretary, Alfred Babayans.  Babayans was identified as Doe 1 on May 20, 2024.  Defendant argues that Babayans was improperly added via doe amendment when Plaintiff knew Babayans’ identity and involvement at all times.  Therefore, Defendant contends that the doe amendment cannot relate-back to the filing date of the Complaint, which was October 25, 2022.A plaintiff may file an action against a doe defendant when she is “ignorant of the name of a defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 474.)  The phrase, “ignorant of the name of a defendant” means either (1) plaintiff was unaware of defendant's identity, (2) plaintiff was unaware of defendant's culpability (facts giving rise to a cause of action against the defendant), or (3) the law did not give plaintiff a right of action until after commencement of the action.  (See Marasco v. Wadsworth (1978) 21 Cal.3d 82, 88.)  “[Code Civ. Proc.] [s]ection 474 allows a plaintiff in good faith to delay suing particular persons as named defendants until he has knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to believe liability is probable. The distinction between a suspicion that some cause could exist and a factual basis to believe a cause exists is critical in the operation of section 474. The former is one reason attorneys include general charging allegations against fictitiously named defendants; the latter requires substitution of the defendant's true name.”  (Dieckmann v. Superior Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 345, 363.)In Balon v. Drost (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 483, 487–88, it was said:“Section 474, however, ... is restricted to the knowledge of the plaintiff at the time of the filing of the complaint.” (Munoz v. Purdy, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d at p. 947, 154 Cal.Rptr. 472; see also Westfour Corp. v. California First Bank, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1559–1560, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 394; Sobeck & Assoc., Inc. v. B & R Investments No. 24 (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 861, 867, 264 Cal.Rptr. 156; Streicher v. Tommy's Electric Co. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 876, 882, 211 Cal.Rptr. 22.) “The lack of knowledge of the true name of the defendant ... must be ‘real and not feigned.’ [Citation.] ... ‘Ignorance of the facts is the critical issue, and whether it be due to misinformation or negligence is not relevant.’ [Citations.]” (Munoz v. Purdy, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d at p. 947, 154 Cal.Rptr. 472; see also Irving v. Carpentier (1886) 70 Cal. 23, 11 P. 391; Westfour Corp. v. California First Bank, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1559–1560, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 394.) Under section 474, therefore, a plaintiff has no duty “to exercise reasonable diligence prior to filing the complaint to discover the defendant's identity.” (Snoke v. Bolen (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1427, 1432, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d 492.)Code Civ. Proc. § 474 “includes an implicit requirement that a plaintiff may not ‘unreasonably delay’ his or her filing of a Doe amendment after learning a defendant's identity. Second, a defendant named in an action by a Doe amendment under section 474 may challenge the amendment by way of an evidence-based motion, which argues that the plaintiff ‘unreasonable delayed’ his or her filing of the challenged amendment. Third, ‘unreasonable delay’ . . . includes a prejudice element, which requires a showing by the defendant that he or she would suffer prejudice from plaintiff's delay in filing the Doe amendment.”  (A.N. v. Cty. of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066–67.)“Absent compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 474, service of a summons on a purported Doe defendant is ineffective.”  (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Constr. Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145.)“When a defendant is properly named under section 474, the amendment relates back to the filing date of the original complaint.”  (McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 368, 371.)Defendant argues that at “all relevant times, Alfred Babayans identity was readily attainable as the CEO, CFO and Secretary ofTECHNO-ADVANCED, INC. via a simple corporate entity search on the California Secretary of State's website. [ ] There is no explanation on the LACIV 105 form or in any legal pleading why, over the course of a year and a half, that Plaintiffs could not identify Alfred Babayans as CEO, CFO and Secretary of TECHNO-ADVANCED, INC. prior to either filing or service of the Complaint or the Amendment on the LACIV 105 form.”  This lacks merit.  As discussed above, Plaintiffs need not demonstrate reasonable diligence.The only other argument is that “Defendant Techno-Advanced, Inc. is a small business where each of the Plaintiffs were interviewed by Alfred Babayans, received their paychecks from Alfred Babayans, saw Alfred Babayans daily in the office and were hired, terminated or resigned through Alfred Babayans.”As an initial matter, the above statement is made by counsel, and it is unclear how counsel would have personal knowledge of such facts.  Further, while Babayans’ identity may have been known when this lawsuit was filed, this does not mean Plaintiffs actually knew of Babayans’ involvement in the wage and hour violations at hand.  Certainly there is no direct evidence of this provided by Defendant.  Nothing to the contrary has been indicated by Plaintiffs.  As also discussed above, a mere suspicion is not enough.  Additionally, even if the Doe amendment were improper and service must be reinitiated, the statute of limitations has not run and Babayans could merely be added to the Complaint by an ordinary amendment.  Indeed, the statute of limitations for an action on wages is three years.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 338.)  The statute of limitations for a UCL claim is four years.  (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17208.)  The Complaint was filed on October 25, 2022, meaning that Plaintiffs would have until October 25, 2025, to add Babayans to this action.  The Motion to Quash is denied.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
