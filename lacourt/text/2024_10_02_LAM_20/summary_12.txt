And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this action, in which Plaintiff Latoya S. Redd seeks to recover $35,489.51 in attorneys' fees from settlement funds in case YC072873. The Defendants, Thomas Kovich, William R. Johnson, and Tyson & Mendes, LLP (T&M), have demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts. The judge has rejected the demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately states a cause of action.

The judge found that Plaintiff did obtain a judgment in an independent action for the validity and amount of the subject lien, and that the settlement funds have not been disbursed. The judge also rejected the Defendants' argument that they have no fiduciary duty to Plaintiff, citing State Bar Opinion 1998-101.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer be overruled, and that the RJNs (request for judicial notice) be granted. The Defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days. The judge has also encouraged counsel to submit written comments on the tentative ruling, rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
