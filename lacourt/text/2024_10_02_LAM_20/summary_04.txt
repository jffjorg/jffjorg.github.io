And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the plaintiff's claims rely on A.B. 218's retroactive elimination of the government claims requirement and is therefore unconstitutional. The judge concludes that A.B. 218 is not unconstitutional and that the government claims requirement is akin to a statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the expenditure of public funds to revive previously barred claims serves a public purpose and is not a gift within the meaning of the California Constitution. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied, and the requests for judicial notice are granted.
