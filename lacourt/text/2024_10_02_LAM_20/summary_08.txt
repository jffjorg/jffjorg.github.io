And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Techno-Advanced, Inc., seeks to quash service of summons with regard to its CEO, CFO, and secretary, Alfred Babayans. The plaintiff argues that it did not know Babayans' identity and involvement at all times and that the Doe amendment was proper. The court finds that the plaintiff did not have to demonstrate reasonable diligence in identifying Babayans and that the Doe amendment relates back to the filing date of the original complaint. The defendant's contention that the plaintiff could have reasonably discovered Babayans' identity earlier is without merit. The court denies the Motion to Quash and orders the defendant to give notice.
