[1] The Unlawful Detainer complaint was originally
brought on behalf of a different entity, but was later amended to be brought on
behalf of the Eislers.


[2] Defendants argue that this case was not actually
stayed, and continued to be actively litigated until July 9, 2021, and
therefore, the deadline should only be extended by the 409 days this case was
actually stayed during the pendency of the appeal.  (See Tatikian Decl. ¶¶ 7-9.)  The Court need not address whether scheduling
a trial date, entering an order declaring Plaintiff a vexatious litigant, or holding
status conferences regarding the status of the appeal preclude a finding that
this action was actually “stayed” for purposes of the five year deadline,
because even construing the deadline most favorably to Plaintiff, the deadline
has still passed.
