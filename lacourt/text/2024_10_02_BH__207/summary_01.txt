The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition by Plaintiff Adam Wolf against Defendant Antonio Gomez Pineda, Jr. The motion is unopposed. The Judge finds that Defendant failed to appear at the noticed deposition, despite proper service of the deposition notice and multiple attempts by Plaintiff to reschedule the deposition. The Judge grants the motion to compel Defendant's appearance for deposition and orders Defendant to appear in person for deposition within 30 days of notice of the Court's orders. The Judge also imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1561.65, which represents three hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers and attend the hearing, plus the motion filing fee.
