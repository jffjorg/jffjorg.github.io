And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's deadline to bring the case to trial was February 11, 2024. The plaintiff failed to bring the case to trial within the mandatory five-year statutory deadline and is therefore subject to dismissal. The judge grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the action with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff cannot re-file the lawsuit. The court also orders the defendants to file and serve a proposed Order and Judgment in conformance with the court's ruling on or before October 11, 2024.
