And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling discusses a case brought by the Eislers, originally on behalf of a different entity, but later amended to be brought on their behalf. The defendants argue that the case was not actually stayed, and therefore, the deadline for action should only be extended by the 409 days it was stayed during the pendency of the appeal. The court finds that even construing the deadline favorably to the plaintiff, it has still passed. The ruling does not address whether scheduling a trial date, declaring the plaintiff a vexatious litigant, or holding status conferences regarding the appeal preclude a finding that the case was actually stayed.
