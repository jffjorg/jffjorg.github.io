Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 8:1985 (citing Blumenthal
v. Superior Court (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 317; Marriage of Fuller
(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1070); see also id. at ¶ 8:1986 [“Where an award
is sought against the attorney for advising the opposing party not to answer or
respond, the notice of motion must identify the opposing counsel and state that
sanctions are being sought against such counsel personally”].)
