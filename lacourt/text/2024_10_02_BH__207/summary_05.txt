Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses the implications of entering a default in a lawsuit. The Judge notes that once a default is entered, the defendant's rights to take further action in the litigation are terminated, except for filing a motion to set aside the default. The Judge also highlights that the entry of default cuts off the defendant's right to file pleadings and motions, as well as receive notices and service of pleadings or papers. The ruling references two court cases, Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) and Bailey v. Citibank, N.A. (2021), to support these points.
