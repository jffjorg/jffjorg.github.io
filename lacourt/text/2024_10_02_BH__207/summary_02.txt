And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for sanctions against the opposing party's counsel. However, the notice of motion does not explicitly state that sanctions are being sought against the counsel, which is required by law. The judge notes that the requested amount is different from what is stated in the Declaration of Sara Rashti, paragraph 10. The judge is citing relevant case law and legal guidance to determine whether to grant or deny the request for sanctions.
