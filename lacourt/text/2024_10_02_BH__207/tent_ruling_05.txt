[1] “The entry of a default terminates a defendant's
rights to take any further affirmative steps in the  litigation until either its default is set
aside or a default judgment is entered.” 
(Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155
Cal.App.3d 381, 385.  Further, the entry
of default “[c]uts

 off the
defendant's right to file pleadings and motions (other than a motion to
set aside default under § 473), and it also cuts off the defendant's
right to notices and the service of pleadings or papers.”  (Bailey v. Citibank, N.A. (2021) 66
Cal.App.5th 335, 347, emphasis added.)
