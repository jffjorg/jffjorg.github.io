 Case Number:  24SMCV01264    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  207 TENTATIVE  RULING - NO. 1      DEPARTMENT   207     HEARING DATE   October    2, 2024     CASE NUMBER   24SMCV01264     MATTER   Request    for Default Judgment      Plaintiff Eastern Funding LLC requests for default judgment against  Defendant Y&S Pine Bluff, LLC and Shahrokh Steve Javidzad,  aka Shahrokh Javidzad aka Steve Javidzad, in the amount of $140,484.43, which  is composed of special damages demanded in the Complaint in the amount of $125,578.71;  prejudgment interest in the amount of $11,104.94; costs in the amount of $655;  and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $3,145.78.   A.    Damages   On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff Eastern Funding LLC (“Plaintiff”)  filed a complaint against Defendants Y&S Pine Bluff, LLC (“Y&S”) and  Shahrokh Steve Javidzad aka Shahrokh Javidzad aka Steve Javidzad (“Javidzad”)  (together, “Defendants”) alleging six causes of action for (1) breach of  written agreement; (2) breach of personal guaranty; (3) money lent; (4)  indebtedness; (5) conversion; and (6) claim and delivery stemming from  Plaintiff’s loan to Defendants for the purchase of various business equipment,  which Defendants’ allegedly failed to repay.  Default  was entered against Defendants on August 22, 2024, and the Doe defendants were  dismissed on September 10, 2024.                Plaintiff’s  Complaint seeks $125,578.71 in special damages. (See Compl.) Therefore,  Plaintiff does not seek damages that are in excess of what is pled in the  Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the  plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.  Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,  1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is  limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)                 In support of the request, Plaintiff  has provided the Declaration of Karen Tennant, attached to which is the written  Promissory Note and Security Agreement signed by Defendant Javidzad on behalf  of Y&S, and in Javidzad’s individual capacity as guarantor.  (Ex. 1 to Tennant Decl.)  The Note is secured by various pieces of  equipment (“collateral”).  Defendants  failed to make the required payment on April 19, 2023 or any payment  thereafter.  (Tennant Decl. ¶ 12.)  The  balance due on the Note is $125,578.71.  (Tennant Decl. ¶ 14 and Ex. 6.)  Further, Defendants have not returned the  collateral.  (Tennant Decl. ¶ 24.)               Therefore, the Court finds that  Plaintiff is entitled to the requested $125,578.71 in damages.    B.    Prejudgment Interest               The  interest computation for the $11,104.94 requested is stated as follows:     ·        $125,578.71 principal x contractual 15.9% annual interest  rate ÷ 365 days/yr x 203 days from 2/7/24 to 8/28/24 = $11,104.94               Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest  in the requested amount of $11,104.94.   C.     Possession of  Collateral               As discussed above, and in the concurrent tentative  ruling on Plaintiff’s applications for writ of possession, Plaintiff has  demonstrated entitlement to return of the collateral.  However, the Court cannot grant Plaintiff’s  writ of possession at all the addresses requested.    D.    Attorneys’ Fees and Costs   Code of Civil Procedure  section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under  Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees  when authorized by contract, statute, or law.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides  “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the  measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to  the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides  “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that  attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be  awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party  who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she  is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable  attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”   (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)   The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:     [T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a  dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains  any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any  relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief  and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as  determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its  discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between  the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under  Section 1034.   (Code  Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)                          Paragraph 5(B) of  the Note provides:   Maker and all Guarantors will jointly and severally pay to Holder  such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the cost and expense of  enforcing this Note, including but not limited to: reasonable compensation to  the attorneys of Holder which are hereby deemed to be 15% of the then balance  due and owing on this Note, but in no event less than $1,000.00 nor more than  that permitted under applicable law; costs and expenses directly or indirectly  related to the Collateral (i.e., costs and expenses for pursuing, searching  for, receiving, taking, keeping, storing, advertising, and selling the  Collateral)   (Ex. 1 to Tennant Decl.)                        Plaintiff seeks  $3,145.78 in attorneys’ fees pursuant to the Court’s default schedule.  Local Rule 3.214 provides that for default  cases involving principal sums over $100,000, the default reasonable attorneys’  fees are $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000.  1% of $25,587.71 is $255.88.  $2,890 plus $255.88 equals $3,145.88.  Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s  requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $3,145.78.               Plaintiff also requests $655 in costs composed of $555 in filing fees and $100 in process server fees. (CIV-100.)  Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted as  Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,  subd. (a)(4).)   CONCLUSION               Therefore, the  Court grants Plaintiff’s request for default judgment and orders Plaintiff to  lodge a  proposed judgment in conformance  with the Court’s ruling on or before October 9, 2024.               Further, on the  Court’s own motion, the Court vacates the Case Management Conference as moot,  and sets an Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment on October 31,  2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  No  appearance will be necessary if the Default Judgment is entered before the  Order to Show Cause hearing.       DATED:  October 2, 2024                            ________________________________                                                                         Michael  E.

MOTION

 

On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff Eastern Funding LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Y&S Pine Bluff, LLC (“Y&S”) and
Shahrokh Steve Javidzad aka Shahrokh Javidzad aka Steve Javidzad (“Javidzad”)
(together, “Defendants”) alleging six causes of action for (1) breach of
written agreement; (2) breach of personal guaranty; (3) money lent; (4)
indebtedness; (5) conversion; and (6) claim and delivery stemming from Plaintiff’s
loan to Defendants for the purchase of various business equipment, which Defendants’
allegedly failed to repay.

 

Plaintiff now applies for a writ of possession against each Defendant.  Plaintiff’s applications are unopposed.

 

In lieu of denying the applications at the initial hearing, the Court
continued the hearing to permit Plaintiff to correct deficiencies.

 

LEGAL
STANDARD

 

            “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a
writ of possession by filing a written application for the writ with the court
in which the action is brought.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 512.010, subd. (a).)  

 

The application shall be submitted under oath and
shall include all of the following:

 

(1) A showing of the basis of the plaintiff’s
claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the property claimed.
If the basis of the plaintiff’s claim is a written instrument, a copy of the
instrument shall be attached.

 

(2) A showing that the property is wrongfully
detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came into
possession of the property, and, according to the best knowledge, information,
and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.

 

(3) A particular description of the property and
a statement of its value.

 

(4) A statement, according to the best knowledge,
information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location of the property and,
if the property, or some part of it, is within a private place which may have
to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is probable cause to
believe that such property is located there.

 

(5) A statement that the property has not been
taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an
execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is
by statute exempt from such seizure.

 

(Id.,
subd. (b).)

 

            Prior to the hearing, the defendant
shall be served with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint; (2) the Notice of
Application and Hearing; (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in
support thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
512.030, subd. (a).)  “If the defendant
has not appeared in the action, and a writ, notice, order, or other paper is
required to be personally served on the defendant under this title, service
shall be made in the same manner as a summons is served[.]”  (Id., subd. (b).)

 

The “Notice of Application and Hearing” shall
inform the defendant of all of the following:

 

(a) A hearing will be held at a place and at a
time, to be specified in the notice, on plaintiff’s application for a writ of
possession.

 

(b) The writ will be issued if the court finds
that the plaintiff’s claim is probably valid and the other requirements for
issuing the writ are established. The hearing is not for the purpose of
determining whether the claim is actually valid. The determination of the
actual validity of the claim will be made in subsequent proceedings in the
action and will not be affected by the decision at the hearing on the
application for the writ.

 

(c) If the defendant desires to oppose the
issuance of the writ, he shall file with the court either an affidavit
providing evidence sufficient to defeat the plaintiff’s right to issuance of
the writ or an undertaking to stay the delivery of the property in accordance
with Section 515.020.

 

(d) The notice shall contain the following
statement: “If you believe the plaintiff may not be entitled to possession of
the property claimed, you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney. Such
attorney should be consulted promptly so that he may assist you before the time
set for the hearing.”

 

(Code
Civ. Proc., § 512.040.)

 

            At the hearing, a writ of possession
shall issue if (1) plaintiff establishes the probable validity of plaintiff’s
claim to possession of the property; and (2) the undertaking requirements of Section
515.010 are satisfied.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 512.060.)

 

Unless the court finds the defendant has no interest in the property,
the court shall not issue a writ of possession until the plaintiff has filed an
undertaking with the court in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant’s interest in the property. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 515.010.)

 

ANALYSIS

 

            Subsequent to the first hearing,
Plaintiff has filed proofs of service demonstrating that the summons and
complaint were personally served on Defendants on July 19, 2024.  Default was entered against Defendants on
August 22, 2024.  As such, notice of the
applications for writ of possession is not generally required.[1]  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010 [“No bill of
exceptions, notice of appeal, or other notice or paper, other than amendments
to the pleadings, or an amended pleading, need be served upon any party whose
default has been duly entered or who has not appeared in the action or
proceeding”].)

 

            Substantively, Plaintiff has
proffered the Declaration of Karen Tennant to support the request.  Attached to the Tennant Declaration are (1)
the promissory note, signed by Javidzad on behalf of Y&S and personally
guaranteed by Javidzad, which lists the property Plaintiff seeks as security
for the $99,663 promissory note; (2) the invoice for the property sought; (3)
an equipment shipping authorization form signed by Javidzad, authorizing the
purchase and delivery of the equipment; (4) the financing statement; (5)
Plaintiff’s Notice of Default and Demand for Payment letter dated 10/27/2023,
listing the total amount due as $112,840.35; and (6) Defendants’ default payoff
statement, showing an outstanding defaulted balance of $125,578.71 due as of
February 7, 2024.  

 

            The Tennant Declaration further
indicates that Defendants failed to make the loan payment that was due on April
19, 2023, or any payment thereafter. 
(Tennant Decl. ¶ 12.)  Tennant
further declares, that based on her experience as Vice President of Risk
Management, the estimated auction resale value of the property is approximately
$30,100.  (Tennant Decl. ¶ 35.)

 

            Plaintiff seeks a writ directing the
levying officer to seize the property from the following locations:

 

i. 10435 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los
Angeles, CA 90025; 

ii. 221 E. 12th Street #300, Los Angeles
CA 90015; 

iii. 508 N. Foothill Road, Beverly Hills,
CA 90210; or 

iv. Another address known to Defendants.

 

            The first two addresses (Santa
Monica Blvd. and E. 12th Street) are listed on the promissory note
as Y&S’s principal place of business, and another location where Y&S
conducts business, respectively.  (Ex. 1
to Tennant Decl.)  Moreover, the second
address is apparently the address where the items were shipped to, according to
the invoice (Ex. 2 to Tennant Decl.)  Therefore,
both these addresses appear to be public businesses and the likely locations of
the property.  

 

            However, the Foothill Road address
appears to be a private residence.  In
order to direct the levying officer to seize property from a private place,
Plaintiff must first show probable cause that the property is located
there.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.010,
subd. (b)(4); § 512.060, subd. (b).)  

            

            Subsequent to the prior hearing,
Plaintiff has filed the Declaration of Paul N. Andonian, which provides:

 

3. I have been in communication with Defendant
SHAHROKH STEVE .TAVIDZAD, an individual, aka SHAHROKH .TAVIDZAD aka STEVE
.TAVIDZAD ("Defendant"). During our communications, I have repeatedly
requested the return of EASTERN FUNDING LLC's ("Eastern") collateral
or information regarding its whereabouts, 

 

4. In response to my requests, Defendant
eventually claimed that said collateral was located at his former residence,
508 Foothill Road, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. Attached hereto as Exhibit
"l", and incorporated herein as though fully set forth, is a copy of
email communications between this office and the Defendant relating to the
location of Eastern's collateral.[2] 

 

5. As detailed in the attached emails, Defendant
claims he was improperly locked out of this residence, and Eastern's collateral
was converted by Defendant's former landlord. 

 

6. I spoke with attorneys who represented
Defendant's landlord. They assert that Defendant's claims relating to his
former residence and Eastern's collateral are false, and that there was no such
collateral left behind by Defendant's at his former residence. 

 

7. They further advised that they have prevailed
in the lawsuit referenced in Defendant's email, attached hereto as Exhibit
"l", by obtaining a dismissal, and that Defendant is now attempting
to revive said lawsuit. 

 

8. Notwithstanding, Defendant, by his own
admission, was storing Eastern's collateral at a residential address. Thus,
there is a likelihood that Eastern's collateral may still be at some other
residential address occupied by, or under the control of, Defendant.

 

(Andonian
Decl. ¶¶ 3-8.)

 

            In light of the indications that
Plaintiff no longer resides at the Foothill Road address and in light of the
landlord’s comments that Plaintiff did not leave the collateral behind at the
Foothill Road address, the Court does not find probable cause that the
equipment is located at the Foothill Road address.  

 

Similarly, the Court cannot issue a writ for the levying officer to
seize property from “another address known to Defendants,” as this location
lacks specificity for the Court to determine whether it is a private place, or
what probable cause Plaintiff has for believing the property is located there.

 

CONCLUSION AND ORDER

 

For the reasons stated, the Court grants, in part, Plaintiff’s
Applications for Writ of Possession regarding 10435 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los
Angeles, CA 90025 and 221 E. 12th Street #300, Los Angeles CA 90015.   The Court denies the Applications in all
other respects.
