```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the City's motion to strike the Plaintiff's Addendum to the lawsuit is GRANTED. The Addendum, filed by the Plaintiff on September 19, 2024, introduces new facts that arose after the filing of the original complaint and therefore constitutes a supplemental pleading, which requires permission from the Court. The Plaintiff failed to comply with the requirement to obtain the Court's permission to file the Addendum under California Code of Civil Procedure section 464(a). The Court finds that the Addendum was improperly filed and grants the City's motion to strike it in its entirety.
