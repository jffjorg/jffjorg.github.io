 Case Number:  24NNCV02291    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
STRIKE PLAINTIFFS ADDENDUM TO LAWSUITI.         INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Angela Avetisyan
("Plaintiff") initiated this action against Defendant City of
Glendale ("City") on June 17, 2024, seeking $1,000,000 in damages for
harassment and emotional distress related to her property located at 717 East
Cypress Street, Glendale, CA. The dispute arises from the City’s determination
that the property is permitted for a single-unit dwelling, while a duplex
currently exists on the site. Plaintiff contests the City’s refusal to
recognize the duplex and objects to the City’s requirement that she bring the
property up to code to obtain permits for unpermitted work.
On August 26, 2024, the City filed
a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Subsequently, on September 19, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an Addendum to her original complaint. In response, the City
filed a motion to strike the Addendum on September 30, 2024. On October 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to the City’s motion to strike. 
Moving Party’s Position
City moves to strike Plaintiff’s
Addendum to the lawsuit on the grounds that it improperly functions as a
supplemental complaint without prior court approval. Under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 464(a), which mandates that a party obtain leave of
court or a stipulation between the parties before filing a supplemental
complaint.
Opposition
Plaintiff opposes City’s Motion to
Strike arguing that the Addendum does not introduce new causes of action but
merely clarifies and expands on existing claims. Plaintiff asserts that the
Addendum filed was not supplemental and that striking the Addendum would
unjustly prevent her from presenting her case.
Reply
No reply has been filed as of
10/18/24.
Meet and Confer
“Before filing a motion to strike
pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or
by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached
that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike. If an
amended pleading is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again
with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a motion to strike
the amended pleading.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 435.5(a).) 
The City has met its obligation to
meet and confer under Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5(a). On September
24, 2024, counsel for the City sent a meet and confer email to Plaintiff
regarding the objections to be raised in the motion to strike. (Kang Decl. ¶
3). However, Plaintiff did not respond by the time of drafting the motion.
Therefore, the City has fulfilled its statutory obligation to meet and confer
prior to filing this motion.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Code Civ. Proc. Section 436 permits
trial courts to strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in a pleading:  
 “The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper:  
 (a)¿Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  
 (b)¿Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
436.)  
CCP § 464(a) a) The plaintiff and
defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental
complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the
former complaint or answer.
III.      ANALYSIS
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 436(b), a court may strike any pleading not filed in
conformity with state laws, court rules, or court orders. In this case,
Plaintiff filed an "Addendum to Lawsuit" (“Addendum”) on September
19, 2024, without seeking leave of court as required under CCP § 464(a).
The Addendum filed by Plaintiff on
September 19, 2024, introduces several new facts that arose after the filing of
the original complaint. These include an alleged threatening letter Plaintiff
received from Edward B. Kang, the City’s attorney, dated August 1, 2024, which
she claims threatened a demurrer unless she voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit.
(Addendum p. 2, Exh. B) Plaintiff also recounts a meeting with Mr. Kang on
August 21, 2024, at the City’s Human Resources Office, which she states was
unproductive and did not lead to any meaningful resolution. (Addendum p. 2;
Exh. C)
Additionally, Plaintiff describes
an incident at the City’s Code Compliance Office, where she alleges that she
was forcibly removed by a Building Official while attempting to retrieve
documentation related to her case. Following this, on September 4, 2024,
Plaintiff sent correspondence to the City’s counsel addressing the incident. (Addendum
p. 2; Exh. E) She further asserts that she escalated her complaints by reaching
out to the Mayor of Glendale. (Addendum p. 2-3)
On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff
received an email from the City Clerk’s Office regarding her case. (Addendum p.
3; Exh. G) Since all these events occurred after the filing of the original
complaint, the new information introduced in the Addendum constitutes
supplemental pleading, requiring Plaintiff to obtain the Court’s permission to
file it under CCP § 464(a).
Pursuant to CCP § 464(a), any party
wishing to supplement their complaint with new facts must obtain leave of
court. Here, Plaintiff failed to comply with that requirement. As a result, the
court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to strike the addendum.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
City’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Addendum in WHOLE.
 
            IV.       CONCLUSION
            The Court GRANTS
City’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Addendum.
            City is to
give notice.
