  Case Number:  23AHCV01728    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATIONI.         INTRODUCTION
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff Deeson
Pan (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed this action against Defendant
Xuesong Guan (“Defendant”) for (1) breach of contract, (2) constructive fraud,
(3) negligent misrepresentation of facts, (4) unfair business practice in
violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., and (5)
unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code section 17204. The action
arises from property located at 1420 S. Del Mar Ave, Unit #6, San Gabriel,
California. Plaintiff alleges that he is the rightful owner of the property and
claims Defendant has rented the property and collected rent from tenants
without Plaintiff’s consent. 
On August 24, 2023, Defendant, in
propria persona, filed an Answer to the Complaint. After retaining counsel, on
June 4, 2024, Defendant filed an Amended Answer with the Court’s approval. On
July 15, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Have Requests for
Admission Deemed Admitted as to Plaintiff, filed on April 29, 2024.  The
Court found that Defendant had served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission on
January 23, 2024, and Plaintiff failed to provide any responses. As a result,
the Court granted the motion and awarded Defendant $1,500 in monetary
sanctions.
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
both a Motion for Sanctions and a Motion to Set Aside and Vacate the Court’s
July 15, 2024, order. The Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to Set Aside and
Vacate Judgment on September 18, 2024. 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff,
representing himself, filed this Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s
prior ruling. Defendant filed an opposition on October 8, 2024.
Moving Party’s Position
Plaintiff moves for the Court to
reconsider its rulings on the Motion for Sanctions and the Motion to Set
Aside/Vacate Judgment, both of which the Court denied on September 18, 2024.
First, Plaintiff asserts that he filed the motion for reconsideration in a
timely manner, in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Second,
Plaintiff argues that the Court had previously agreed that his objections to
Defendant’s Requests for Admission did not require verification, as they were
objections. Plaintiff further asserts that, although the Court found that
Defendant did not receive the responses sent to 4907 Wilmonte Ave, Temple City,
CA 91780, this address was the registered business address for FU SHIH INC., a
corporation controlled by Defendant, who serves as its Chief Executive Officer.
Additionally, Plaintiff contends that Defendant falsely informed the Court that
she never received the responses. Based on these assertions, Plaintiff requests
reconsideration of the Court’s ruling.
Opposition
Defendant opposes Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration, arguing that Plaintiff’s objections are unclear and
unrelated to any motion for summary judgment, as no such motion has been filed.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s primary issue concerns the Court’s July 15,
2024, ruling deeming the Requests for Admission admitted. Defendant further
contends that Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration lacks the required
affidavit under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 and points out that
Plaintiff’s service of documents has been improper throughout the case. Based
on these arguments, Defendant requests that the Court deny the motion for
reconsideration.
Reply
Plaintiff filed his reply on
October 23, 2024.
            
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008(a)
provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order . . .
[may] make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party
making the application shall state by affidavit¿what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”¿¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008(a).) A trial court has discretion with respect to granting a
motion for reconsideration.¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court¿(2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿ 
“A motion for reconsideration may
only be brought if the party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or
different facts, circumstances, or law which it could not, with reasonable
diligence, have discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion.
(Citations.) A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent a strong
showing of diligence.” (Garcia v.¿Hejmadi¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674,
690;¿Forrest v. State Of California Dept. Of Corporations¿(2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 183, 202¿disapproved of and overruled on unrelated grounds
in¿Shalant¿v.¿Girardi¿(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1172 (footnote 3);¿New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court¿(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212–213;¿Baldwin
v. Home¿Sav.¿of¿America.¿(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Timeliness
A formal notice of ruling is
required to trigger the time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration. The
10-day time limit begins upon service of the notice of entry of the order.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
In this case, Plaintiff filed the
motion for reconsideration on October 2, 2024, seven days after the notice of
ruling was served on September 25, 2024. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is timely.
Standard for Motion for Reconsideration 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008: 
            “When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that
made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.” 
Plaintiff argues that the Court
should reconsider its prior orders denying his Motion for Sanctions and Motion
to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment, both of which were denied on September 18, 2024.
Plaintiff asserts that the instant motion was timely filed and notes that the
Court had previously acknowledged his objections to Defendant’s Requests for
Admission did not require verification. Plaintiff also claims that he mailed
his responses to Defendant’s registered business address. Defendant opposes the
motion, arguing that Plaintiff failed to properly serve documents throughout
the case.
The Court finds Plaintiff’s Motion
for Reconsideration unclear as to what specific ruling the Court is being asked
to reconsider. The title of Plaintiff’s motion refers to a summary judgment
ruling, which has not been made in this case. It is unclear whether Plaintiff
seeks reconsideration of the July 15, 2024, ruling that deemed Requests for
Admission admitted or the Court’s September 18, 2024 ruling denying both the
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate and the Motion for Sanctions. Plaintiff has failed
to clearly articulate the specific order for which reconsideration is sought.
Additionally, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has not complied with the procedural requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008. This section mandates that the moving party must submit
an affidavit describing the prior application, when it was made, to which
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. Plaintiff has failed to submit
such an affidavit.
Even if the procedural requirements
had been met, the Court had previously ruled that Plaintiff did not properly
serve his responses to the Requests for Admission. Plaintiff sent the responses
by email and by mail to 4907 Willmonte Ave, Temple City, CA 91780. However,
during the relevant period, from February 7, 2024, to February 27, 2024,
Defendant was self-represented, and her address of record, as stated in the
Substitution of Attorney form, was 1420 S. Del Mar, San Gabriel, CA 91776.
Moreover, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, a
self-represented party may only be served electronically with express consent
to receive service by email. Plaintiff has provided no evidence that Defendant
consented to email service.
Plaintiff also had the opportunity
to file an opposition to Defendant's motion, demonstrating substantial
justification for his failure to properly serve discovery responses. However,
despite attending the hearing and being aware of the motion, Plaintiff did not
present any opposing arguments (see September 18, 2024, Minute Order, p. 5).
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant was properly served lacks
merit.
As Plaintiff has not met the
procedural requirements, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration.
  
            IV.       CONCLUSION
            The Court
DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice.
Dated: October 24, 2024
