And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by GM Coach Inc. and Gary Meng to the first amended complaint (FAC) is sustained without leave to amend as to the third cause of action and with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The FAC was filed by Yonghong Li, the mother of Ziheng Li, who died while operating a tour bus for GM Coach Inc. and Gary Meng.

The judge has concluded that the FAC fails to state a cause of action for negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). Specifically, the FAC did not plead sufficient facts to establish the elements of duty and causation required to maintain a cause of action for negligence. Additionally, the FAC failed to plead sufficient facts to establish the elements of IIED.

The judge has also concluded that the FAC's allegations regarding California's workers compensation scheme are insufficient to establish that the wrongful death claim is not barred by the exclusivity of the scheme.

The judge has given Yonghong Li twenty (20) days to amend the FAC to cure the defects identified in the demurrer. If no amendment is filed, the demurrer will be sustained and the case will be dismissed.
