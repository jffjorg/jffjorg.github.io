  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production (CRS# 9885)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 10, 2011, plaintiff
Leonard W. Borisoff (“Borisoff”), a composer, filed a complaint against
defendants the Pullman Group, LLC; Wertheim, LLC; David Pullman; and Broadcast
Music, Inc. Defendants prevailed in the compelled arbitration proceeding and
were awarded ownership of Borisoff’s past and future royalties and attorney
fees of $67,866.13. On October 3, 2013, Defendants petitioned the Court to
confirm the award, which the Court did on January 15, 2014, with a final
judgment entered on August 27, 2014. Borisoff appealed the judgment. The Court
of Appeal reversed the judgment. On February 4, 2021, the Currency Corp
(“Plaintiff”) was substituted as Borisoff’s successor in interest after he
passed away in 2020.
            On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint, alleging (1) fraud, (2) intentional
interference with contract, and (3) declaratory relief against Defendants
Pullman Group, David Pullman, and Wertheim LLC. 
On October 11, 2023, Defendants filed the
instant motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff regarding Requests
for Production, Set One. Plaintiff filed its opposition on November 28, 2023.
Defendants filed their reply on December 4, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Upon
receiving responses to its discovery requests, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses if the responses are incomplete or
evasive, or objections are without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a),
2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b),
2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (See Lehman Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
RFP Nos. 2-5
            RFP Nos. 2-5 seek documents related
to loans or security agreements between Borisoff and Currency Corp. Plaintiff
objects that the requests seek irrelevant information because the claims in the
complaint do not implicate loans between Borisoff and Currency. Defendants claim
that such documents are relevant for proving that Currency is properly Borisoff’s
successor entitled to bring this suit. (Mtn. 8:1-4.) However, Defendants do not
explain how loans and security agreements are relevant to establishing standing.
Therefore, Defendants have failed to set forth good cause for RFP Nos. 2-5.  
II.
RFP Nos. 6, 7, 9, 11-15
            Plaintiff responded to these RFPs by
stating that all relevant documents have been produced. However, “[a]ny
documents or category of documents produced in response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be identified with the specific
request number to which the documents respond.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280(a).)
Plaintiff bears the burden of identifying the documents responsive to each RFP.
Defendant is not required to search through a production and guess which
documents are responsive. Plaintiff shall either produce documents responsive
to these RFPs with proper labeling, or identify with bates number the
previously-produced documents responsive to each RFP.   
III.
RFP No. 10
            RFP No. 10 seeks “All DOCUMENTS
reflecting PULLMAN DEFENDANTS' efforts to obtain release of liens or loans by
Currency Corp. or its predecessors relating to YOUR royalty payments.” 
            Plaintiff objects that this request
is ambiguous and it cannot be determined what Defendants are referring to. Plaintiff
alleges that Currency provided loans to Borisoff secured by Borisoff’s royalties.
(SAC ¶ 12.) Plaintiff alleges that Pullman subsequently offered to provide new
loans to Borisoff based on the same royalties. (Ibid.) Pullman allegedly
told Borisoff that Pullman needed to “secure releases from Borisoff’s existing
lenders” to accomplish this. (Id., ¶ 13.) This was allegedly part of
Pullman’s interference with Borisoff’s contracts and royalty sources. Thus, RFP
No. 10 clearly references facts raised in the complaint. A further response is
required. 
IV.
RFP Nos. 16-20
            RFP Nos. 16-20 seeks documents
evidencing payment of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Defendants argue that the information
is relevant because Plaintiff alleges attorneys’ fees as damages. Defendants
provide no indication that Plaintiff is claiming attorneys’ fees as damages.
Plaintiff
includes a standard prayer for attorneys’ fees in its SAC, but that does not
mean Plaintiff claims attorneys’ fees as damages. Defendants have not
established good cause for RFP Nos. 16-20. As such, further responses are not
required.
 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel further
responses to RFPs is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 6, 7, and 9-15. Plaintiff shall
produce further responses within 15 days. Sanctions are denied as the parties
acted with substantial justification.
