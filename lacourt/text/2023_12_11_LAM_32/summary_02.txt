Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel further responses to requests for production (RFPs) as to RFP Nos. 6, 7, and 9-15. The plaintiff must produce further responses to these RFPs within 15 days. The ruling denies sanctions as the parties acted with substantial justification.

The judge finds that the defendants have satisfied the meet and confer requirement, but that the plaintiff has failed to set forth good cause for RFP Nos. 2-5. The ruling also finds that the plaintiff has not identified the documents responsive to RFP Nos. 6, 7, and 9-15, and that the plaintiff bears the burden of identifying the documents responsive to each RFP.

The ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel further responses to RFP No. 10, which seeks documents reflecting the defendants' efforts to obtain release of liens or loans by the plaintiff or its predecessors relating to the royalty payments. The ruling finds that this request is relevant to the facts raised in the complaint and that a further response is required.

The ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 16-20, which seeks documents evidencing payment of attorneys' fees and expenses. The ruling finds that the defendants have not established good cause for these requests and that further responses are not required.
