Documents, Set One is GRANTED. 
Defendant’s
Motions to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set

ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Westfield Topanga Owner LLC moves the court for an order to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Request for Production of Documents and Form
Interrogatories pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.030,
2031.310, and 2030.290. Defendant also seeks an order requiring Plaintiff pay
reasonable attorney fees of $1,350 and $1,135.  
 
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).)  A motion to compel further production must set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary
for the motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in evidence.
“Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts show that
the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court
(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1).) 
 
A
motion to compel further responses to form or specially prepared
interrogatories may be brought if the responses contain: (1) answers that are
evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise
of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive response; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2030.300(a).)   
 
On
December 22, 2023, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One and
Request for Production of Documents Set One on Plaintiff. (Thompson Decl. ¶2,
Exh. A.) On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff provided objections to all of the
discovery requests except for Form Interrogatory 9.1 and 14.1. (Thompson Decl.
¶3, Exh. B.) The responses were not verified. (Thompson Decl. ¶3, Exh. B.)
Defendant attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the
objections. (Thompson Decl. ¶4, Exh. C.) After no response, Defendant sent
another follow up email. (Thompson Decl. ¶5, Exh. D.) Defendant followed up
with Plaintiff a week later after receiving no response. (Thompson Decl. ¶6,
Exh. E.) To this date, Defendant has not received any response to their meet an
confer efforts. 
 
The
court finds the objections without merit. The discovery requests are not so
vague, ambiguous, or irrelevant. If any of the requests do seek privileged
information, Plaintiff must provide a privilege log.3
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motions to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One and Form Interrogatories, Set One are GRANTED.

 
Sanctions
 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300(d) and 2031.310(h) provide that for
mandatory monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
The
court GRANTS Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,195,
total (4 hours for preparing both motions, 1 hour attending the hearing on
motions, and $60 filing fee per motion).
