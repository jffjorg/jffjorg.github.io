PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
 
The Court considers the petitions.  No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in part by
CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf
of a minor claimant and gives the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the
minor’s claim “with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending.”  A petition for court
approval of a compromise must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise or covenant.  (CRC Rule
7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of the petitioner and claimant
at the hearing on the compromise of the claim unless the court for good causes
dispenses with their personal appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules 7.950
& 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when court
approval of a minor's compromise is sought. Although we need not decide the
question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a minor's
compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Minor Plaintiffs move for approval of a settlement with Defendants
Southwestern Law School and Beach Front Property Management, Inc. in which
minor Iyse Melendez would receive approximately 5.5% and Isaias Melendez would
receive 30% of the total settlement for all four Plaintiffs. Attorneys’ fees of
35% will be deducted from the minor claimant’s settlement amounts. Iyse’s
settlement funds will be placed into a deferred annuity. Isaias’ settlement
funds will be deposited into a special needs trust. 
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. Having reviewed the petition, the
Court finds that the individual settlements and attorney’s fees are fair in
light of the alleged injuries sustained by claimants. 
 
The Court sets an OSC re purchase of annuity as to Iyse for April 24,
2024 at 8:30 am.
 
As to the special needs trust (SNT) for
Isaias, the Court makes the following findings pursuant to Probate
Code section 3604(b):

The SNT
     beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs the individual’s
     ability to provide for his own care or custody and constitutes a
     substantial handicap;
The SNT
     beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met without
     the trust; 
The money to be
     paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably
     necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.

 
The main requirements
for court created or funded trusts are set forth at California Rules of Court Rule
7.903(c) and LASC Rule 4.116(b).  The
proposed trust instrument meets those requirements.
 
The proposed initial trustee
is Pamela Blattner, a private professional fiduciary (PPF) in Encino,
California. Under CRC Rule
7.903(c)(5), Probate Code section 2320, a bond is required (the trustee is not a
corporate fiduciary). The Court ORDERS a bond in the amount of $1,671,500.
The Court sets an OSC re
submission of bond and filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open trust supervision
action in probate for April 24, 2024 at 8:30 am. The
Court requires first trust accounting in 12 months and sets a due date for
filing of accounting of May 21, 2025. 
The petitions are GRANTED.
