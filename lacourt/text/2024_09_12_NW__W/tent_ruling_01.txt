FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
This is a premises liability case. On December 18, 2022, Plaintiff
Marco Lopez filed a complaint against Defendants Kevin Jon Gallo, and Mauricio
Antonio Siguenza asserting causes of action for premises liability and
negligence. Plaintiff alleges he was injured when he fell from the roof of
Defendants’ premises while performing contractor’s services. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Kevin Jon Gallo’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant Kevin Jon Gallo requests this court take judicial notice
of the following: (1) Summons and Complaint of the Plaintiff Marco Lopez filed
in this matter, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 22VECV02435 on or about
December 16, 2022 (Exh. A); (2) Requests for Admissions Set 1 served by Defendant
Kevin Jon Gallo on Plaintiff Marco Lopez on February 8, 2024 filed with this
court (Exh. B); and (3) Minute Order of the court in this matter following Defendant's
motion to have requests for admissions deemed admitted in Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22VECV02435, dated June 3, 2024 (Exh. C). 
 
The court GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice. (Evid.
Code §452(d); see Bounds v. Superior Court (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 468,
477 (quoting Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 605).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Kevin Jon Gallo moves the court for an order granting
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s complaint and single cause of action for general negligence does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 438(c)(1)(B), a
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings if the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.
(CCP § 438(c)(1)(B).)  The standard for granting a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer.
(Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.)  The
court must assume the truth of all factual allegations in the complaint, along
with matters subject to judicial notice.  (Wise v. Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th. 725, 738.)  The court must view
the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. (Edwards v.
Centex Real Estate Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15,
28.)    
 
Plaintiff asserts two causes of action for premises liability and
general negligence against Defendant. “The elements of a negligence cause of
action are the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and
proximate cause resulting in injury. [Citation.] The elements of a cause of
action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty,
breach, causation, and damages. [Citation.]” (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998 (citing Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th
1200, 1205; Civil Code § 1714(a)).) In order to impose liability on a property
owner for a dangerous condition, the owner must have either actual or
constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition or have been able to discover
the condition by the exercise of ordinary care. (See Ortega, supra, 26
Cal.4th at 1206.) An owner is charged with constructive knowledge of the
existence of a dangerous condition if the condition was present for a
sufficient period of time. (See id.) “Whether a dangerous condition has
existed long enough for a reasonably prudent person to have discovered it is a
question of fact for the jury.” (Id. at 1207.)  
 
The Request for Admissions deemed admitted negate the elements of
Plaintiff’s premises liability and general negligence allegations.
Specifically, the admissions admit that (1) Defendant is not liable to
Plaintiff for the injuries sustained on October 21, 2022; (2) Defendant did not
exercise control over any work being done by Macabi Builders, Inc. (the roofers
hired by the general contractor) at Defendant’s residence; (3) Defendant did
not exercise control over any work being done by Plaintiff at his residence;
(4) Defendant did not affirmatively contribute to the injuries Plaintiff
sustained on October 21; 2022; (5) Defendant did not create a dangerous
condition that led to Plaintiff’s injuries on October 21, 2022; and (6) there
is no evidence Defendant hired Plaintiff to do any work at his residence. (RJN,
Exh. B.) 
 
No opposition has been submitted. Due to these admissions,
Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a cause of action against Defendant for
premises liability or general negligence. Moreover, Plaintiff has not responded
to Defendant’s Requests for Admissions and has not filed any response to the
instant Motion to show that there is a reasonable possibility that an amendment
to the pleading will cure the defect. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
