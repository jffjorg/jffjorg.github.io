And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The defendant, Manuel Imperial and Docgo, Inc., had moved the court to compel the plaintiff, Obed Macedo, to respond to their written discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to these requests, and the defendant is seeking sanctions in the amount of $410.00 for each motion, totaling $1,640.00.

The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide any responses to the requested discovery, and therefore, the defendant's motion is granted. The plaintiff is ordered to produce verified discovery responses without objection within 20 days.

Additionally, the court grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $820.00, totaling the costs incurred in bringing each motion. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280, as well as the case of Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, in support of its ruling.
