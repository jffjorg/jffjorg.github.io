And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"This is a premises liability case in which the plaintiff, Marco Lopez, claims he was injured while performing contractor services on the roof of the defendants' property. The defendants, Kevin Jon Gallo and Mauricio Antonio Siguenza, have moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them.

The court grants the defendants' motion, finding that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action against the defendants for premises liability or general negligence. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not responded to the defendants' requests for admissions, which deem admitted certain facts that negate the elements of the plaintiff's claims.

As a result, the court grants the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. This means that the defendants will be dismissed from the case, and the plaintiff will not be able to proceed with his claims against them."
