DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Manuel Imperial and Docgo, Inc. move the
court for an order compelling Plaintiff’s response to Defendants’ written
discovery, including Form Interrogatories, Set 1 and 2; Request for Production
of Documents, Set 1 and 2; and Special Interrogatories Set 1 and 2 as well as
move for an order having Defendants’ Request for Admissions, Set 1 be deemed
admitted. Defendants make the motion on the grounds Plaintiff has failed to
provide any responses to the requested discovery. Defendants also seek
sanctions in the amount of $410.00 for each motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On March 12, 2024, Defendants served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, Special Interrogatories, Set 1, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1. (Khurin Decl. ¶3.) Defendants served Plaintiff
with Request for Admissions, Set 1 on June 6. (Khuin Decl. ¶3.) The responses
were due April 12, 2024 and July 9, 2024, respectively. (Khuin Decl. ¶3.) Plaintiff
sought an extension until April 17, 2024 to serve responses to the
Interrogatories and Request for Production, but never served any responses.
(Khurin Decl. ¶4.) Plaintiff also sought an extension until July 12, 2024 to
serve responses to the Request for Admissions, but never served any. (Khurin
Decl. ¶4.) Defendants served Plaintiff with the Request for Production, Set 2
and Interrogatories, Set 2 on June 6, 2024. (Khurin Decl. ¶5.) Plaintiff sought
an extension to respond to those discovery requests as well but never served
any responses. (Khurin Decl. ¶6.) To date, no further extensions have been
requested and the discovery is still outstanding. (Khurin Decl. ¶7.) The motion
is unopposed. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ unopposed
motions to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to Defendants’ Form
Interrogatories, Set 1 and Set 2; Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Set 2; Request
for Production and Inspection of Documents, Set 1 and Set 2; and Request for
Admissions, Set 1 is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce verified
discovery responses without objection in twenty days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants seek $410.00 imposed in sanctions for the costs incurred in
bringing each motion, totaling $1,640.00. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for
monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $820.00, total.
