```
And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is considering the admissibility of a photo that is allegedly what fell on the Plaintiff. The photo was identified in response to discovery requests, but the judge is concerned about its admissibility due to multiple levels of hearsay. The judge also notes that the photo was not directly identified by the Plaintiff or any other witness. On the other hand, General Contractor argues that it should not be bound by previous rulings because it did not bring the motions for summary judgment, and therefore did not have an opportunity to support objections. The judge is tentatively ruling that the photo is not admissible and that General Contractor should not be bound by previous rulings.
