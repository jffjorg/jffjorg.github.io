[1] In para. 7 of the Declaration of Corey Garrard in
opposition to the motion, counsel states than an investigator he hired to speak
to Sifuentes showed him the photo and Sifuentes purportedly confirmed that this
was what fell on Plaintiff. The foregoing is multiple level hearsay and is
disregarded. 
          Similarly, that the photos were
identified in response to discovery requests does not make the photo admissible
or otherwise explain the concerns stated here. 


[2] On the other hand, General Contractor argues in its
Reply that it was not bringing the motions for summary judgment (they were
brought by Owner and Sub-Contractor) and hence it did not have an opportunity
to support the objections. (Likewise, Mgm’t Co. had not then been brought into
the case.) Therefore, General Contractor should not be bound by those rulings.
