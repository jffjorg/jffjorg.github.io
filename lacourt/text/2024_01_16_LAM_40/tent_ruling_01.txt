 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Danny
  Bakewell, Sr.’s Motion to Compel Sidney Williams’ Attendance, Production of
  Documents, and Testimony at Deposition, and Request for Monetary Sanctions
  Against Sidney Williams in the Amount of $7,901.65.



 
Background
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr. sues
Defendants OneUnited Bank (the Bank), Kevin Cohee (Chairman and CEO of the
Bank), and Does 1 to 20 pursuant to an April 15, 2020 First Amended Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraud and Deceit, (3)
Declaratory Relief, (4) Unfair Competition, (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and
(6) Fraudulent Sale of Securities.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant Cohee induced Plaintiff Bakewell into subscribing to $250,000 of
OneUnited Bank Preferred Stock by making alleged false representations to
Bakewell to the effect that Bakewell would be able to redeem his $250,000 in
Preferred Stock, plus corresponding dividends, upon request, only for OneUnited
Bank to deny such a request by Bakewell in December 2019.
On or around August 19, 2022, non-party
Sidney Williams was personally served with a deposition notice and subpoena
from Plaintiff Bakewell, with the deposition set for September 16, 2022.
Williams is the spouse of Representative Maxine Waters, an individual who has
since been deposed in connection with this litigation, specifically with regard
to her past redemption of OneUnited Bank shares for a profit.
On September 13, 2022, Williams
objected to the deposition through counsel. The September 16, 2022 deposition
did not move forward.
On September 19, 2023, Williams was
personally served with a further deposition notice and subpoena from Plaintiff
Bakewell, with a deposition set for October 5, 2023. 
On October 2, 2023, Williams served
objections to the deposition notice and subpoena.
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff
Bakewell’s counsel informed Williams’ counsel that based on Williams’
nonappearance, Plaintiff would be sending a meet and confer letter prior to
filing a motion to compel Williams’ deposition and production.
Williams failed to appear for the
October 5, 2023 deposition.
On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff
Bakewell’s counsel advised Williams’ counsel of the substance of this motion.
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff
Bakewell moved to compel deposition testimony and production from Williams.
Later that day, Williams’ counsel
emailed Plaintiff Bakewell’s counsel, arguing that an insufficient meet and
confer had occurred and encouraging Plaintiff to withdraw his motion.
On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff
Bakewell’s counsel’s office emailed Williams’ counsel indicating that Plaintiff
would not withdraw the motion but agreed to continue the hearing date of the
motion to compel to permit further meet and confer.
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff
Bakewell’s counsel’s office emailed Williams’ counsel to indicate that
Plaintiff’s position remained the same as outlined in his motion and that,
based on Williams’ counsel’s November 1, 2023 position, further meet and confer
would not be fruitful.
On January 3, 2024, Williams
opposed the motion.
That same day, Defendants OneUnited
Bank and Cohee filed a joinder to the opposition.
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff
Bakewell replied to the opposition.
Plaintiff Bakewell’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance and Production

I.
Timeliness
Based on a hearing date of January
16, 2023, and manner of service aside, Plaintiff’s opposition was due on
January 2, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) The opposition was filed
a day late, as explained by Sidney Williams’ counsel. (1/3/24 Late Filing
Decl.) The reply fails to address the timeliness of the opposition. The Court
thus considers the matter waived. (See Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 343; see also Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 690, 697; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288.)
II.
Legal Standard
If, [1] after service of a
deposition notice, [2] a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, [3] without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, [4] fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with
it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, [5] the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a) [Arabic numerals
added for clarity].)
Although Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450 does not apply to nonparties and section 2025.480 does not
address attendance, courts regularly consider and grant motions to compel
nonparties to attend depositions. (See, e.g., Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 352, 355 (Terry) [court considered motion to compel nonparty
to attend deposition]; Sears, Roebuck, & Co. v. National Un. Fire Ins.
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1351 (Sears) [court held that subpoenaing
party can move to compel when nonparty deponent does not appear or produce
documents at deposition]; Brun v. Bailey (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 641,
645-646 [Brun] [court considered motion to compel nonparty to attend
deposition].)
The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
The motion shall also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b)(2).)
If the proposed deponent made some
response to the deposition notice, then a separate statement must accompany any
motion to compel deposition attendance or production. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345, subd. (a), (b)(1).)
III.
Order Compelling Deposition(s):
GRANTED.
A. Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (a) [Separate Statement]
Here, Plaintiff Bakewell has
properly filed a separate statement, thus satisfying the Rule of Court. (Mot.,
Separate Statement; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (b)(1).)
In the opposition, Sidney Williams
argues that “Plaintiff’s Separate Statement fails to include the definitions in
his subpoena which are necessary to understand each discovery request and the
corresponding objection.” (Opp’n, pp. 4-5.)
The Court disagrees. The separate
statement contains the contents required by California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345, subdivisions (c)-(c)(6). (See Mot., Separate Statement, pp. 2-28; see
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (c)(4) [“If necessary, the text
of all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it,” emphasis added].)
Moreover, as to the meaning of the
word “You,” the meaning is clear from the subpoena and from the context of the
separate statement itself to generally mean either Sidney Williams or a person
authorized to act on his behalf.
B. Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2) [Meet and Confer]
The Court determines that adequate
meet and confer or follow up communications by Plaintiff through counsel
preceded Plaintiff’s filing of this motion, thus satisfying the Code. (Mot.,
Ivie Decl., ¶¶ 1-3, 7; Opp’n, Chao Decl., ¶¶ 8-14, Ex. 8; see Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)
In the opposition, Sidney Williams
challenges the meet and confer efforts. (Opp’n, pp. 12-13.) The Court finds no
merit to these arguments. The record sufficiently shows that the parties
conferred about the substance of this motion and did not come to an agreement
regarding production of and by Williams. (Mot., Ivie Decl., ¶¶ 1-3, 7; Opp’n,
Chao Decl., ¶¶ 8-14, Ex. 8, Oct. 24, 2023 Letter.)
C. Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a)(1) [Merits]
Here, Plaintiff Bakewell has shown
that (1) he served Sidney Williams, (2) a non-party, (3) with a deposition
subpoena for attendance and production on October 5, 2023, which Williams
failed to attend, and in response to which Williams failed to produce any
documents. (Mot., Ivie Decl., ¶¶ 1-3, Ex. A.)
The fact that Sidney Williams is
not a party to this action does not deprive this Court of the authority to rule
on this motion. (See Terry, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 355; Sears, supra,
131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1351; Brun, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 645-646.)
The deposition subpoena at issue
contains 11 production requests and no plainly stated matters of examination.
(See Mot., Ivie Decl., Ex. A.)
Williams has objected to the
deposition subpoena on various grounds. Williams generally objects to the
subpoena on the ground that Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 sets a
60-day timeline to move for the requested relief, with the deadline passing
here prior to Plaintiff filing this motion. Williams also generally argues that
the subpoena contains improper definitions and that the subpoena is harassing
insofar as it seeks the confidential and financial information of a third party
that is not relevant to this action. Williams more specifically objects on
grounds of overbreadth and impropriety as to defining “you,” lack of relevance,
overbreadth in time and scope, constitutional right to privacy, right to
protection of confidential information, attorney-client privilege, work product
privilege, marital communications privilege, and/or lack of particularization
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.510, subdivision (a)(2). (See
Mot., Ivie Decl., Ex. B.)
In his motion, Plaintiff Bakewell argues
that Williams was properly served with a deposition and wrongfully failed to
appear for the deposition or produce documents, instead providing only
meritless objections. Plaintiff also argues in essence that section 2025.480 is
not applicable because this motion was brought pursuant to section 2025.450.
Plaintiff adds that Williams has discoverable knowledge of transactions between
Maxine Waters and OneUnited Bank. Plaintiff otherwise argues that good cause
for production exists here because the deposition “relate[s] to [Maxine
Waters’] stock certificates, stock purchase agreements, and board resolutions
regarding the stock issued to … Waters, which … Williams was a signatory on the
purchase agreement, by Defendants,” and because “these documents will reveal
that Defendants contentions that Ms. Waters’ stock was not redeemed and that
the bank has never redeemed the stock of a shareholder are false.” (Mot., pp.
5-8.)
Plaintiff Bakewell’s separate
statement responds to the substance of Sidney Williams’ objections. The
separate statement explains that “Mr. Williams is a former director of
OneUnited and a signatory to a purchase agreement of stock purchases by Ms.
Waters.” (See Mot., Separate Statement, pp. 2-28 [quote a page 5, § Issue in
Dispute].)
In opposition, Sidney Williams
argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Williams because he was
electronically served with this motion rather than personally served as
required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. Williams adds, in addition
to other arguments, that the 60-day rule in Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.480 makes this motion untimely because the motion should have been filed
within 60 days of the objections to the 2022 deposition subpoena served on
Sidney Williams. Williams also argues that Williams’ objections to the
deposition subpoena are meritorious and that Plaintiff harassed Representative
Waters at her deposition. (Opp’n, pp. 5-12.)
No opposing separate statement was
filed by Sidney Williams, and is not required under the California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345.
In reply, Plaintiff Bakewell argues
that his motion has merit and should be granted, that the separate statement is
proper and need only include definitions when necessary to understand the
context of the request, and that the motion was properly and timely served on
Williams, particularly where rule 3.1346 only applies to motions to compel
answers at a deposition, i.e., motions to compel further, not initial,
deposition answers and/or production. Plaintiff concludes by arguing in support
of his meet and confer efforts. (Reply, pp. 2-5.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Bakewell.
The sought-after discovery is
relevant. Plaintiff Bakewell sues OneUnited Bank and its CEO, Kevin Cohee,
based, in part, on allegations that Plaintiff Bakewell was induced to purchase
stocks in OneUnited Bank based on promises from Defendant Cohee guaranteeing
Plaintiff’s ability to redeem his shares at any time upon request, a promise on
which OneUnited Bank and Cohee have reneged. (See FAC, ¶¶ 6, 9, 12-14, 19, 23,
29-30, 31-32.) Plaintiff argues that “Defendants [have] conten[ded] [in
discovery] that Ms. Waters’ stock was not redeemed and that the bank has never
redeemed the stock of a shareholder.” (Mot., p. 7.) On September 5, 2023, however,
Plaintiff deposed Representative Maxine Waters for the purpose of obtaining
testimony relating to whether OneUnited Bank had permitted Waters to redeem her
shares in OneUnited Bank, which OneUnited Bank allowed, with a net profit of
$100,000 despite no increase in valuation in the shares. (Mot., Ivie Decl., ¶ 4.)
The deposition subpoena and its production requests here relate to questions of
whether Sidney Williams owned stock in OneUnited Bank and whether he was able
to redeem those stocks, including tangential communications with Kevin Cohee. (See
Mot., Ivie Decl., Ex. A.) 
Within this context, Williams’
testimony is relevant to whether Defendants made misrepresentations to
Plaintiff regarding whether other OneUnited Bank shareholders were permitted to
redeem their shares. Such information could also be conceivably relevant to
whether Defendants’ conduct shows a breach of oral contract with Plaintiff
through conduct showing Plaintiff was denied contractual relief afforded to
other shareholders in similar circumstances.
Section 2025.480, its 60-day
requirement, and any arguments related thereto are not applicable because, as
correctly noted by Plaintiff, section 2025.480 is not the basis for Plaintiff’s
motion. Section 2025.480 involves compelling further deposition answers and/or
production following a deposition, not compelling an initial deposition after
nonresponse or objections. The latter circumstances involve section 2025.450,
which establishes other requirements for moving to compel a deposition and/or
production. (See Mot., p. 4 [legal standard for this motion based on section
2025.450]; but see Mot., pp. 1-2 [no specific statutory section specified but compelling
initial attendance implied].)
While Williams argues that he was
improperly served with this motion because service was effected via email and
not personal service, in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346 (Opp’n,
pp. 4-5), rule 3.1346 applies to motions compelling deposition answers or
production after a deposition has taken place, not motions to compel initial
attendance and production. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1347 [previously
Rule 337, which specified that “[t]he proponent of a motion for an order
compelling an answer to a question propounded at a deposition shall lodge
with the court the original transcript of the deposition not less than five
calendar days before the date set for hearing the motion, emphasis added]; see
also Reply, pp. 3-4 [making this argument].)
The Court also finds that the
objections to the subpoena do not contain sufficient merit.
Relevance has been discussed above.
The Court adopts that discussion to
determine that the overbreadth in time and scope objection is also not
meritorious because the entire stock history and redemption of stock
transactions for Sidney Williams are relevant to (1) OneUnited Bank’s history of
redemption of shares, a relief allegedly denied to Plaintiff, and (2) whether
OneUnited Bank lied to Plaintiff regarding whether it had offered redemptions
to other shareholders.
The objection that Plaintiff
Bakewell did not properly define “You” in the subpoena lacks merit because
“You” is properly defined to entail Sidney Williams and persons authorized to
act in his place or on his behalf. (See Mot., Ivie Decl., Ex. A, Attach. 3,
Definitions, ¶ 4; see Section III.A. supra [other arguments by Williams
relating to “You”].)
The right to privacy,
confidentiality, and third-party information objections lack merit insofar as
there appears a compelling need to obtain information relating to Sidney
Williams’ stock and stock redemption transactions with OneUnited Bank. (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 556 [Where a case involves an
obvious invasion of a privacy interest that is fundamental to the holder’s
personal autonomy, a compelling interest or need must be present to overcome
the privacy interest].)
Any privileges raised by Sidney
Williams can be elaborated in a privilege log in conformity with Hernandez
v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 291, fn. 6—provided, of
course, that no protective or other order is already in place to deal with
privilege concerns in discovery. The Court does not see any prima facie basis
to conclude that there would be any attorney-client and work product privileges
to assert in testimony or production relating to financial transactions between
Williams and OneUnited Bank.
Last, the documents sought by the
subpoena are sufficiently particularized for the purposes of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2020.510, subdivision (a)(2).
The Court therefore finds that
Plaintiff Bakewell’s motion is meritorious.
D. Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1) [Good Cause]
The Court adopts its discussion
relating to relevance in Section III.C. to find that good cause exists for
production.
E. Compel Deposition
Conclusion
Plaintiff Bakewell’s motion is
GRANTED. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(2).)
IV.
Sanctions: GRANTED, in
part.
If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff Bakewell seeks $7,901.65
in sanctions against Sidney Williams—but not against counsel—for fees and costs
incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel in pursuing Williams’ deposition and this
motion. (Mot., p. 8.)
In opposition, Sidney Williams
argues that sanctions are not merited against him and that it is Plaintiff and
his counsel who should be sanctioned. (Opp’n, pp. 13-14.)
The reply does not further argue
the issue of sanctions, merely renewing the request. (See Reply, p. 5 [“Plaintiff
respectfully requests that … Plaintiff be ordered to pay a monetary sanction of
$7,901.65 …”].)
The Court finds that sanctions are
appropriate.
Sidney Williams has improperly
failed to respond and submit to a deposition and related production requests,
i.e., authorized methods of discovery, thus meriting sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
The Court also determines that a
rate of $560 per hour is reasonable, that five hours of recovery is appropriate
for the time expended by counsel attempting to advance a deposition, that only
seven hours are reasonably recoverable for work expended by counsel in filing
this motion, replying, and attending this hearing, and that costs of $61.65 for
filing this motion are recoverable. (See Mot., Ivie Decl., ¶ 8.)
Sanctions are thus GRANTED, in
part, in the reduced amount of $6,781.55. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.’s
Motion to Compel Sidney Williams’ Attendance, Production of Documents, and
Testimony at Deposition, and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Sidney
Williams in the Amount of $7,901.65, is:
(1) GRANTED as to compelling a
deposition and production by Sidney Williams; and
(2) GRANTED, in part, as to
sanctions, in the amount of $6,781.55, against Sidney Williams.
The parties are encouraged to discuss
an agreeable date for the deposition so that a date can be set at the hearing.
