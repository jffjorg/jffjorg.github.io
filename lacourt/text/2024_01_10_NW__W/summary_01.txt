English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Jomar Construction, Inc.'s motion for good faith settlement. The settlement was made in good faith, and the court notes that the Tech-Bilt factors are satisfied. The parties have been engaged in extensive settlement discussions, and Jomar has already settled with the plaintiffs for a full dismissal, release, and payment of $30,000. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the court does not have to produce evidence in support of a good faith determination. The court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion.
