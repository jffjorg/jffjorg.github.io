Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, D. Masin Consulting, LLC and Rosenthal & Rosenthal of California, Inc., to the first amended complaint filed by Limelight International, Ltd. and others. The demurrer challenges the subject causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent conveyance, malicious prosecution, and conspiracy to fraudulently transfer property.

The Judge finds that the operative complaint sufficiently articulates the elements of the claim and overrules the demurrer. The Judge declines to consider extrinsic inference regarding the outcome of the liquidation as to secured and unsecured creditors and defers any evidentiary consideration to an appropriate form.

The Judge also finds that the arguments for a premature claim based on an underlying contingency insufficiently supported and that the court adheres to the holding from the Sixth District Court of Appeal. The Judge notes that the court's decision is based on the pleadings and does not consider extrinsic evidence or other facts.

The Judge orders that the demurrer be overruled and that the defendants answer within 10 days of the order. The Judge also orders that the parties provide notice of the ruling.
