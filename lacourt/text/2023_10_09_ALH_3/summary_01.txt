English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the City of San Marino (Defendant) against Quan Zheng and Aaron Zheng (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant is liable for negligence and negligent selection, retention, and supervision for failing to protect Aaron Zheng, a 12-year-old, who was punched in the head by Yiliang Zha during afterschool pickup on September 20, 2022. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiffs do not allege a statutory basis for liability and that a public entity is not liable for failing to protect individuals against crime. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs do not identify a statutory basis for liability and sustains the demurrer. However, the Court grants 20 days' leave for the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to allege a statutory basis for liability.
