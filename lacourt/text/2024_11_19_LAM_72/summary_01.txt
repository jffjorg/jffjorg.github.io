And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for trial preference due to the managing member's terminal illness. The defendant's managing member, Bahram Mashhood, has Stage 4 cancer and a substantial medical doubt of survival beyond six months. The judge sets the trial date for March 17, 2025, and a Final Status Conference for March 7, 2025. The parties are directed to comply with the court's trial preparation order in advance of the Final Status Conference. The judge disagrees with the plaintiff's argument that the defendant delayed in seeking trial preference and that Mashhood's survival beyond six months suggests a changing medical prognosis. The judge finds that Mashhood's medical condition still raises a substantial doubt about his survival for six months going forward.
