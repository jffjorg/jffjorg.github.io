Background
 
            This
is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are taken from the Complaint
and supporting documents.
 
            Defendant
is a tenant at the residential property located at 725 N. Sweetzer Avenue, Unit
102, Los Angeles, California 90069 (the “Property”). Plaintiff is the landlord
and owner of the Property. Plaintiff agreed to rent the property month-to-month
and pay rent of $2,100.00 per month.
 
            On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay rent
or quit (the “Notice”) by posting it on the premises. The Notice stated that Defendant
owed $29,400.00 in unpaid rent for the period of February 15, 2022 through
April 14, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on March 22, 2022, seeking past-due rent of $29,400.00,
attorney’s fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages.
 
            On
June 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. On
July 18, 2024, judgment was entered in Defendant’s favor and against Plaintiff.
 
            On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney’s fees. Defendant
did not file an opposition.           
 
Legal Standard
 
“In any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
“The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall
determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this
section, whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment. Except [where an
action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of
the case], the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who
recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The court may also
determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this
section.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (b).)
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
The lease agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant (the
“Lease”) provides as follows:
 
“23. ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any legal action or proceeding be
brought by either party to this agreement, the prevailing party shall be
reimbursed for all reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in addition to other damages
awarded. Due to the ever increasing fees that can be charged by attorneys, it
is agreed by the parties that both sides will waive their right in a jury
trial.”
 
(Fisher Decl., Ex. A (“Lease”) at p.
2, ¶ 23)
 
“ ‘[T]he primary purpose of an unlawful detainer action is
to obtain the possession of real property in the cases specified by statute.’
[Citation.] ” (Strickland v. Becks (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d Supp. 18, 21.) “The
judgment, if any, for damages and the rent found due pursuant to section 1174
is a mere incident to the main object—the recovery of possession.” (Ibid.)
Where “[t]he defendant … prevailed by defeating the plaintiff's claim to
possession …. the defendant, and not the plaintiff, was the prevailing party[.]”
(Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiff did not bring a claim for possession, and
Defendant defeated Plaintiff’s claim for nonpayment of rent. Defendant is
therefore the prevailing party and is thus entitled to attorney’s fees under
the Lease.
 
Hourly Rates and Hours
 
Defendant requests an hourly rate of $350.00 for Zakary
Fisher. (Fisher Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court finds this rate to be reasonable based on
Fisher’s experience. (See Fisher Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)
 
Fisher provides a chart of his hours billed for this matter.
(Fisher Decl. ¶ 11.) Defendant requests a total of 30.2 hours for Fisher. The
Court finds that this time expenditure is reasonable.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion and awards $10,570.00
in attorney’s fees.
