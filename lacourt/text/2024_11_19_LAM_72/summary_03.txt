And here is a summary in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Doomarina Sardarbekians to compel defendants Wahib Mashini, et al. to serve further responses to her request for production of documents. The motion was filed on October 24, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for November 19, 2024.

The plaintiff claims that the defendants' responses to discovery are incomplete and that they have not fully complied with the discovery requests. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that they have complied with the discovery requests and that the plaintiff's motion is not justified.

The judge notes that the parties were unable to meet and confer due to unique circumstances, including the fact that the defendants' counsel was on paternity leave from September 16, 2024 to November 4, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiff's filing of the motion was substantially justified and continues the motion to December 24, 2024, allowing the parties to meet and confer to attempt to take some or all of the issues out of contention.
