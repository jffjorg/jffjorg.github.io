 Hearing Date:  November 19, 2024
 Calendar Number:  8



 
 
 
Defendant Linda J. Maultsby (“Maultsby”) demurs to the Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) filed by Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan
(“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court OVERULES the demurrer.  Maultsby shall file an answer within 10 days.
 
Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are
taken from the allegations and attached exhibits in Plaintiff’s Complaint,
except where otherwise noted.
 
Plaintiff is the owner of real property that is legally
described as “Lot 446 of Tract No. 1446, in the City of Los Angeles, County of
Los Angeles, State of California, as per Map recorded in Book 20, Page 34 of
Maps, in the office of the County recorder of said County” (the “Property”).
The Property contains a multi-unit building which is comprised of four units
with the following addresses: (1) 2757 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA
90016; (2) 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016; (3) 5107
Westhaven St., Los Angeles, CA 90016; and (4) 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles,
CA 90016.
 
Maultsby is a tenant at the Property pursuant to a lease
agreement that pre-dates Plaintiff’s ownership of the Property. Maultsby
occupies 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016 (the “Unit”).
 
Plaintiff entered an agreement to sell the Property to a
third party. The third party wished to inspect the Property, including the
Unit. On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant a notice requiring
Defendant to permit an inspection of the Property and Unit. Plaintiff
subsequently delivered a second letter requesting the same, on an unspecified
date. Defendant did not allow Plaintiff to inspect the Property and the Unit.
 
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendant in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, Department 78, Case No. 23STCV21442 (the “Department 78 Action”),
raising a claim for unlawful detainer. The complaint in the Department 78
Action seeks restitution and possession of the Property and Unit, damages, and
costs of suit. The complaint in the Department 78 action attaches as Exhibit 2
a three-day notice to quit that was served on August 24, 2023 and is identical
to the August 24 Notice attached as Exhibit 2 in this action.
 
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action (the
“Department 72 Action”), raising a claim against Plaintiff for unlawful
detainer. The Complaint seeks restitution of the Unit, damages, and costs of
suit.
 
On February 29, 2024, the Court stayed the Department 72
Action pending the resolution of the Department 78 Action under the doctrine of
exclusive concurrent jurisdiction.
 
On May 14, 2024, judgment was entered for Defendant in the
Department 78 Action as a result of Defendant’s demurrer in that case.
 
On July 18, 2024, the Court issued an order lifting the stay
on the Department 72 Action and granting Plaintiff leave to amend to correct a
number of deficiencies in the Complaint, to plead an alternate cause of action
based on a Notice to Quit that was served after this case was initiated by
Plaintiff, and to name additional alleged occupants of the Property as
defendants.
 
On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Maultsby, Jaccoma Maultsby, Jezreel
Maultsby, Charmaine Thompson, Blanca Estala Tinoco, Jorge Tinoco, and Olivia
Weaver, raising two causes of action for unlawful detainer.
 
On September 3, 2024, the Court sustained Maultsby’s
demurrer to the FAC on the basis of incapacity. The Court granted leave to
amend so that Plaintiff could allege what type of entity it is and the legal
basis for its capacity to sue.
 
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the SAC, which raises
two claims for unlawful detainer.
 
On September 25, 2024, Maultsby demurred to the SAC.
Plaintiff filed an opposition and Maultsby filed a reply. 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Maultsby’s requests for judicial notice and
takes notice of the requested public records.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has
been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to
the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
 
(a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is
uncertain. As used in this subdivision, “uncertain” includes ambiguous and
unintelligible.
(g) In an action
founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the
contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Uncertainty and Failure to State a Claim
 
Although Maultsby raises these grounds for demurrer in her
notice, she does not make any argument as to them. The Court therefore does not
find that these grounds are a basis for sustaining the demurrer.
 
Capacity to Sue
 
As discussed above, lack of capacity is properly raised on
demurer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (b).)
 
A limited liability company has the capacity to sue and be
sued. (Corp. Code, § 17701.05, subd. (b).)
 
Mural Media LLC (not Plaintiff) is a limited liability
company organized in the State of Oregon on December 31, 1996 and dissolved by
the Secretary of State for the State of Oregon on February 28, 2019.
(Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Demurrer to FAC, Ex. E.)
Mural Media LLC was never reinstated by the State of Oregon and there are
currently no active filings for the exact name “Mural Media LLC” in the State
of Oregon. (Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Demurrer to
FAC, Ex. B.) Mural Media, LLC was registered as a foreign LLC in the State of
California to conduct intrastate transactions on March 30, 2000, and its
registration was terminated by the California Secretary of State on February
14, 2022. (Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Demurrer to
FAC, Ex. C.)
 
The Court previously found that the FAC did not reflect that
Plaintiff has capacity to sue. In its opposition to Maultsby’s demurrer to the
FAC, Plaintiff argued that it is not an LLC, but rather, a retirement plan.
(Opposition to Demurrer to FAC at pp. 8:21-9:2.) Plaintiff stated that Mural
Media, LLC is a separate entity from Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan.
(Opposition to Demurrer to FAC at pp. 8:21-9:2.)
 
Plaintiff now alleges that it is a retirement plan, and not
an LLC. (SAC ¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges that it is a separate entity from Mural
Media, LLC. (SAC ¶ 2.) Plaintiff alleges that, as a separate entity, it
generally has capacity to sue. (SAC ¶ 3.)
 
“ ‘A pension plan […] is a formal plan or program whereby
funds are accumulated to pay for retirement income or other deferred income to
employees of an employer, payable at a future date, generally at the normal
retirement age as specified in the plan. The plan […] constitutes a separate
entity from the employer[.]’ ” (Coastline JX Holdings LLC v. Bennett
(2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 985, 1005 fn. 8 [citation to practice guide omitted]
[holding at p. 1006 that profit-sharing plan established subject to ERISA was not
subject to claims by creditors of the employer].)
 
            “In
general, any person or entity has capacity to sue or defend a civil action in
the California courts. This includes artificial ‘persons’ such as corporations,
partnerships and associations.” (American Alternative Energy Partners II v.
Windridge, Inc. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 551, 559.) “A partnership or other
unincorporated association has capacity both to sue and be sued in the name it
has assumed or by which it is known.” (Ibid.)
 
            Maultsby
contends that a pension plan cannot properly be considered a person because
Family Code, section 105 defines “person” to include “a natural person, firm,
association, organization, partnership, business trust,
corporation, limited liability company, or public entity.” (Fam.
Code, § 105.) The Family Code separately defines “employee benefit plan” to
include “public and private retirement, pension, annuity, savings, profit
sharing, stock bonus, stock option, thrift, vacation pay, and similar plans of
deferred or fringe benefit compensation, whether of the defined contribution or
defined benefit type whether or not such plan is qualified under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-406) (ERISA), as amended. The
term also includes “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3 of ERISA (29
U.S.C.A. Sec. 1002(3)).” (Fam. Code, § 80.)
 
            There
are two problems with this argument. First, the definitions in sections 80 and
105 were written to cover the construction of the Family Code. (Fam. Code, §
50.) Plaintiff has not provided authority indicating that these definitions
were intended to control California corporations law or civil procedure.
Second, insofar as an employee benefit plan is a ‘separate entity’ (see Coastline
JX Holdings LLC, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at p. 1005 fn. 8), it appears
to constitute an organization. Thus, even if Family Code, section 105 controls,
it does not appear to exclude an entity retirement plan.
 
            Thus,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged its capacity to sue.
 
            The
Court therefore overrules the demurrer.
