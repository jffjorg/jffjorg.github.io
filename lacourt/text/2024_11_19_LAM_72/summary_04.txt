And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by Defendant T.D. Trauth for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $10,570.00 against Plaintiff Linda Greif, Trustee of the Greif Family Trust. The court grants the motion and awards the attorney's fees to Defendant.

The court finds that Defendant is the prevailing party in the unlawful detainer case because Plaintiff did not bring a claim for possession and Defendant defeated Plaintiff's claim for nonpayment of rent. The court also finds that Defendant's hourly rate of $350.00 for Zakary Fisher is reasonable based on Fisher's experience.

The court orders Plaintiff to pay the attorney's fees to Defendant's counsel within 30 days of the issuance of this order.
