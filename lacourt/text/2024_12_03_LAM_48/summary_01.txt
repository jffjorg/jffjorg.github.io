And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested a judgment of $1,687,536.51, consisting of $500,000.00 in damages, $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $3,154.68 in prejudgment interest, $721.83 in costs, and $183,660.00 in attorney fees. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's declaration did not support the claimed damages, and that the plaintiff's request for emotional distress damages and punitive damages was insufficient. The judge also found that the plaintiff's request for attorney fees was grossly excessive. The case is scheduled for a hearing on June 3, 2025, at which time the judge will consider dismissing the case for failure to enter default judgment.
