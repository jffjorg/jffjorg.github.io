[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
  FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 3, 2024



 
On September 14, 2021, Plaintiff Leo Cordova filed
this action against Defendants Long Spring Freight LLC, A&D Hauling
Services, and Vincent Huei.  The Court
has entered default against A&D Hauling Services (October 20, 2021),
Vincent Huei (October 20, 2021), and Long Spring Freight LLC (August 19, 2024).
On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed this request
for entry of default judgment.
Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $1,687,536.51,
consisting of $500,000.00 in damages, $1 million in punitive damages, $3,154.68
in prejudgment interest, $721.83 in costs, and $183,660.00 in attorney fees.
“‘Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove
they are entitled to the damages claimed.’ 
[Citation].”  (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288.)  “[T]he plaintiff must affirmatively establish
his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.” (Id. at p. 287.)
Plaintiff’s declaration does not support $500,000.00
in damages.  Plaintiff was able to find a
new job in January 2021 and was out of work for only three months.  (Cordova Decl. ¶ 12.)  Based on his earnings of $4,600 to $4,800 per
month when working for Defendants, Plaintiff calculates his lost past earnings
to be $14,400.00.  (Cordova Decl. ¶
12.)  This amount is supported by the
evidence.  For the remainder of the
damages, Plaintiff requests $485,600.00 in emotional distress damages “for
everything that Defendants have put [him] through” and “[b]ecause [he is] now
constantly living with anxiety and depression about the situation.”  (Cordova Decl. ¶ 14.)  Plaintiff has experienced “repeated instances
of severe stress, lack of sleep, crying, and feelings of severe anxiety,” and
he has received medical treatment. 
(Cordova Decl. ¶ 13.)  This is
insufficient to warrant $485,600.00 in emotional distress damages.
Plaintiff requests $1 million in punitive damages.  “An award of punitive damages hinges on three
factors: the reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct; the reasonableness of
the relationship between the award and the plaintiff’s harm; and, in view of
the defendant’s financial condition, the amount necessary to punish him or her
and discourage future wrongful conduct.” 
(Kelly v. Haag (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 910, 914.)
Plaintiff does not provide evidence of Long Spring
Freight LLC’s or A&D Hauling Services’s financial condition.  For Vincent Huei, Plaintiff “[is] familiar
with Defendant Vincent’s personal financial condition based on what [he]
observed and what he told [him].” 
(Cordova Decl. ¶ 16.)  According
to Plaintiff, Vincent Huei “comes
from a wealthy family in China and has done well in his family business,”
helped his wife start a new business with money brought over from China, and
gave significant funds to other family members to start businesses.  (Cordova
Decl. ¶ 16.)  This information is hearsay.  He also provides a property report for real
property that Vincent Huei sold for $948,000 in August 2021.  This is insufficient to show Vincent Huei’s
financial condition now in December 2023.
Plaintiff requests $166,940.00 in attorney
fees for litigating this case.  Plaintiff
requests an additional $16,720.00 (38.5 hours) in attorney fees for drafting
the default judgment papers, which is grossly excessive for a simple default
judgment package with only one relevant exhibit.  Based on the amount of damages currently
sought ($1.5 million, although this amount is unsupported), a reasonable amount
of attorney fees is $16,890.00, “unless otherwise determined by the
court.”  (LASC Local Rules 3.207,
3.214(a).)  Plaintiff’s chart of attorney
rates and number of hours is insufficient for the Court to determine what other
amount of attorney fees would be reasonable.
The request for entry of default judgment is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to
Enter Default Judgment is scheduled for June 3, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
