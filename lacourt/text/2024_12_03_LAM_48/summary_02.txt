And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling granting four discovery motions filed by the defendant, Staples Inc. The motions were to compel deposition and responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff, Maria Guevara Jimenez, failed to appear for her deposition and did not provide timely responses to discovery requests. The judge ordered the plaintiff to appear for deposition within 30 days and to provide verified responses, without objections, to discovery requests within 30 days. The judge also granted the defendant's request for sanctions and ordered the plaintiff to pay a total of $2,064.70 within 30 days. The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests has waived any objections to the discovery requests, including those based on privilege or attorney work product.
