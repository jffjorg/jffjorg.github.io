[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO
  COMPEL DEPOSITION AND MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 3, 2024



 
On
January 31, 2024, Plaintiff Maria Guevara Jimenez filed this action against Defendant
Staples Inc.
Now
pending before the Court are four discovery motions filed by Defendant.
MOTION
TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, employee of a party, or person
designated as the person most qualified to testify fails to appear for examination
or produce documents, the demanding party may move to compel attendance, testimony,
and production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)
On
September 3, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 20, 2024.  On September 19, 2024, Defendant followed up with
an email to Plaintiff providing the information for Plaintiff to appear for her
deposition and asking if Plaintiff required a different date for her deposition.  Plaintiff failed to appear for her deposition
and a Certificate of Non-Appearance was taken.
The
unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Plaintiff is ordered to pay total sanctions of $1,064.70 (court reporter
fees and filing fee for this motion) to Defendant within 30 days.
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
On
May 14, 2024, Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production of Documents on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide any responses.
On
September 30, Defendant filed motions to compel responses.
Plaintiff
filed no oppositions to these motions and did not serve timely responses.  It does not appear that Plaintiff served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing.
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered
to provide verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents within 30 days.
The
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Plaintiff is ordered to pay total sanctions of $1,000.00 to Defendant within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
