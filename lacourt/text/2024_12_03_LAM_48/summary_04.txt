And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted. The court finds that the defendants have shown the existence of an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff on April 4, 2023, which provides for arbitration using a neutral arbitrator with AAA. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement satisfies the Armendariz factors, which require that the arbitration agreement provide for neutral arbitrators, adequate discovery, written awards, and all types of relief available in court. The court further finds that the plaintiff's action is not purely representative, and therefore, the court will stay the plaintiff's representative PAGA claims during arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The entire action is stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration. A status conference is scheduled for December 3, 2025, to review the progress of the arbitration.
