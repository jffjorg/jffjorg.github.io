And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets out the court's thoughts on the opposition filed by the plaintiff to the defendant's demurrer. The plaintiff proposes to amend its complaint to address the demurrer's grounds, but the court has not reviewed the proposed amendment. The court is inclined to allow the plaintiff to file the amended complaint and deem the demurrer moot, but the court wants to hear how the plaintiff believes the amendment addresses the demurrer's grounds. The court notes that if it allows the amendment and another demurrer is filed and sustained, the court might deny leave to amend again. The court also clarifies that a failure to oppose a demurrer does not suggest the demurrer should be granted, citing a rule that applies only in appellate courts, and that the court has an independent duty to determine the motion's merit.
