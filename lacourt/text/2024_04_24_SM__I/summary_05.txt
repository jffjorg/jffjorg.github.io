And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling sets out the court's expectations for the parties to meet and confer on various issues, including the witness list, exhibit list, and jury instructions. The court has received the courtesy copy of the FSC materials and notes that the parties disagree on the witness list and exhibit list. The court finds that the witness list is insufficient and estimates for cross-examination must be provided. The parties are also expected to meet and confer on objections to proposed jury instructions and to provide a revised exhibit list. The court has continued the trial readiness conference and FSC to April 30, 2024, and advanced the trial date to May 6, 2024. The court emphasizes the importance of good faith meet and confer and reminds the parties that time before the jury is precious.
