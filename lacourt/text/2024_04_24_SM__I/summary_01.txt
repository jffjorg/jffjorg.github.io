And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has concerns about the expert testimony presented in the case. Albert's numbers are used in calculations, and Rybolt's analysis of the Jaeschke Effect is questionable. Hirschkorn's experience in selling on Amazon.com is unclear, and his methodology is not precise enough to provide a fact-based analysis. The judge is concerned about the correlation between the data and causation. The judge suggests that a regression analysis would be a strong tool to establish causation, but it was not done in this case. The judge is inclined to take this matter up at the FSC or trial readiness conference.
