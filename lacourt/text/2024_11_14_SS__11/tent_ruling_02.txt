The MDL court agreed with OptumRX as to
the first element but still denied OptumRX’s motion.  In May 2024, OptumRX sought writ relief from
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  On
October 22, 2024, the Sixth Circuit denied the writ, agreeing with the MDL
court’s ruling on the fourth element. 
(See Notice of Supp. Authorities, Ex. A.)

OptumRX lost another motion to
disqualify in federal court in Massachusetts. 
The district court followed the MDL court’s analysis.  (See id. at Ex. B.)

Discovery of documents covered by a protective order is routine.  (See In Re: Nat. Prescription Opiate Litig., supra, 2024 WL 3387288, at *9.)

Again, the Sixth Circuit and the
Massachusetts federal court agreed with the MDL court’s analysis.  (See Notice of Supp. Authorities, Exs. A,
B.)  


 
[6] The Court anticipates
that a similar protective order will be enacted in Plaintiff case.
