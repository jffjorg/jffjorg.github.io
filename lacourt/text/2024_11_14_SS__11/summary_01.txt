And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied OptumRX's motion to disqualify Motley Rice LLC from representing the People of the State of California. OptumRX alleged that Motley Rice LLC acquired confidential government information during government investigations and that this information could be used to the disadvantage of OptumRX. The judge found that Motley Rice LLC was acting as a public officer or employee during the investigations and that the information acquired was not confidential government information. The judge also found that the information was already available to all other plaintiffs in the case and therefore could not cause a material disadvantage to OptumRX. The judge concluded that OptumRX's motion was denied because it did not satisfy the second and fourth elements of the legal test.
