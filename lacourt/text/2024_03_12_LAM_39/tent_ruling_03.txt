LA Doe, et al. v. Los Angeles Unified School District
Case
No. 23STCV275840
Demurrer
and Case Management Conference
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiffs
Jane LA Dow and Jane MA Doe (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against the Los Angeles Unified School District (the “LAUSD”) and their former
teacher, Corey Hogan (“Hogan”) based upon having allegedly been sexually abused
by Hogan between 2002 and 2006. 
Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action:
 
            1.         Negligence against all defendants 
            2.         Negligent Supervision against all
defendants 
            3.         Negligent Hiring/Retention against the
LAUSD 
            4.         Negligent Failure to Warn, Train, or
Educate against the LAUSD 
            5.         Sexual Harassment against all
defendants 
            6.         Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress (“IIED”) against the LAUSD
            7.         Breach of Fiduciary Duty against all
defendants 
            8.         Gender Violence against Hogan
            9.         Sexual Battery against Hogan
            10.       Sexual Assault against Hogan 
 
The LAUSD now demurs to first,
second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.  Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.  The Court sustains the demurrer to the fourth
cause of action without leave to amend. 
The demurrer is otherwise overruled. 

 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“It is black letter law that a
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.”
 (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In
ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of
the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) 
“This rule of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws
inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.”  (Perez v.
Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)

DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this action pursuant to Assembly Bill 218, which made California
Government Code section 905(m) retroactive to include conduct in years prior to
2009.  Now, the LAUSD demurs to the first
and third causes of action (which are the claims against the LAUSD), arguing
that AB 218 violates the California Constitution’s prohibition against the gift
of public funds.   
 
            Prior
to the passage of AB 218, Government Code section 905 exempted claims of
childhood sexual abuse occurring on or after January 1, 2009, from the claims
presentation requirements.  (See Rubenstein
v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 914.) 
Thus, when the Legislature enacted AB 218, it retroactively eliminated the
claims presentation requirement for the new claims of sexual abuse before 2009.  (See Gov. Code, § 905, subd. (p).)  The claims presentation requirement is a substantive
element of a claim for childhood sexual abuse against a governmental entity
based on past misconduct by its employees. 
(See Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201,
209.)  Therefore, the LAUSD argues that
AB 218 retroactively stripped its statutory governmental immunity and
resurrected “dead” claims, which is an unconstitutional “gift” of public
funds.  
 
               The
Court overrules the demurrer.  “It is
generally held that in determining whether an appropriation of public funds is
to be considered a gift, the primary question is whether the funds are to be
used for a public or private purpose; the benefit to the state from an
expenditure for a public purpose is in the nature of consideration and the
funds expended are therefore not a gift even though private persons are
benefited therefrom.  The determination
of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature
to determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as
that determination has a reasonable basis.” 
(County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 745–746,
internal quotations and citations omitted.) 
Further, “[a]s a general rule statutes should be construed, if
reasonably possible, to avoid finding they are unconstitutional.”  (Martin v. Santa Clara Unified School Dist.
(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 241, 254.)  The
purpose of AB 218 was to reduce procedural barriers for victims to assert childhood
sexual abuse claims.  (See K.M. v.
Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, 738.)  The Legislature also sought to “help prevent
future assaults by raising the costs for this abuse.”  (See X.M. v. Superior Court (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th
1014, 1027, citing the legislative history of AB 2018.)  The Legislature determined that these are
valid public purposes, and the Court cannot say the Legislature lacked a
reasonable basis to do so.  Therefore,
the demurrer is overruled on this ground.
 
            The
LAUSD argues that the fourth cause of action is invalid.  This cause of action is encompassed by the
second and third causes of action.  (See C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
875.)  Therefore, the Court sustains the
demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.
 
The LAUSD
argues that there are insufficient facts to support the fifth cause of action.  A school district is not liable for a
teacher’s sexual harassment of students unless “unless an official of the
school district who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures
on the district's behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberately indifferent
to, the [teacher’s] misconduct.”  (Roe
v. Hesperia Unified School District (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 13, 33, internal
quotations and citaitons omitted.)  Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant “acted with deliberate indifference towards responding to
. . . and preventing further abuse.” 
(Complaint, ¶ 115.)  For pleading
purposes, Plaintiffs’ allegations suffice, and the demurrer to the fifth cause
of action is overruled.  
 
            Finally,
in the notice of motion, the LAUSD argued that there are insufficient facts to
support the sixth cause of action. 
However, this argument is not raised in the memorandum of points and
authorities.  It appears that the LAUSD
could be liable based upon IIED committed by Hogan, per Government Code
sections 815.2 and 820.  Therefore, the
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is overruled.
