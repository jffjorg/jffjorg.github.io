  - "As a general rule, statutes should be construed, if reasonably possible, to avoid finding they are unconstitutional."

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action in the lawsuit brought by Jane LA Doe and Jane MA Doe against the LAUSD and their former teacher, Corey Hogan. The plaintiffs allege that they were sexually abused by Hogan between 2002 and 2006, while attending school. The LAUSD argues that the retroactive application of Assembly Bill 218, which eliminated the claims presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims, violates the California Constitution's prohibition against the gift of public funds.

The Judge overrules the demurrer and finds that the LAUSD is not liable for the sexual harassment and abuse of students. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, finding that it is encompassed by the second and third causes of action. The Judge sets the following dates: a final status conference on October 3, 2025, and a trial on October 14, 2025. The parties are required to comply with all pretrial procedures and file joint trial documents by September 25, 2025.
