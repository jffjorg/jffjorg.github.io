And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted National Commercial Recovery, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) unopposed motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to amend its complaint to include a separate fraud claim against Sylvia Cantu as Trustee of "The 20446 Willoughby Lane Trust Dated September 21, 2022", alleging that Cantu fraudulently transferred real property into a trust without consideration paid in exchange. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to file and serve the second amended complaint within 10 days. The judge has also noted that the Plaintiff has fulfilled the procedural requirements of the California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1324, and that denying the motion would deprive the Plaintiff of its right to assert a potentially meritorious cause of action.
