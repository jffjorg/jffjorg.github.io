And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anthony B. Lovell versus the County of Los Angeles (Lakewood Sheriff's Station). The County has filed a demurrer, which is a legal objection to the complaint, on several grounds. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 20 days to revise the complaint to address the objections raised by the County. The judge has also found that the complaint is uncertain, but did not sustain the demurrer on this basis because the missing page of the complaint may clarify the uncertainty. Finally, the judge has rejected the County's argument that the plaintiff has failed to identify a statutory scheme under which liability can be imposed upon the County for damages.
