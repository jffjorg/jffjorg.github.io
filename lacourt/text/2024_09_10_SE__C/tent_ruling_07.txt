Tentative Ruling 
Defendant County of Los Angeles’s Demurrer is
SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background
This is a civil rights action. On December 1, 2023,
Plaintiff Anthony B. Lovell (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant County
of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as Lakewood Sheriff’s Station) alleging causes
of action for: (1) False Arrest; (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and (3) Violation of Bane Act.
Defendant County of Los Angeles (“County”) demurs on the following
grounds:
1.    Plaintiff
Complaint fails to comply with the mandatory statutory time requirements of the
California Tort Claims Act. 
2.    Plaintiff’s
Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitution a cause of action,
pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e).
3.    Defendant
is immune from liability pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 815, 815.2, 820.2,
820.4, and 820.8. 
Legal
Standard 
Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the
basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action. A demurrer admits,
provisionally for purposes of testing the pleading, all material facts properly
pleaded. (Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1247.) A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)
Discussion
California Tort Claims Act
 
“[A]ny suit brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . must be commenced .
. . not later than six months after the date such notice [of rejection of a
government claim] of is personally delivered or deposited in the mail.” 
(See Bridgman v. Allen (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 288, 295 (citing Gov. Code
§ 945.6, subd. (a)(1).)  This requirement is “mandatory and must be
strictly complied with.”  (Chase v. State of California (1977) 67
Cal.App.3d 808, 812.) 
A plaintiff may file a written application to a public
entity for leave to present a late claim.  (Gov. Code § 911.4, subd.
(a).)  A plaintiff may petition the court for relief from the Government
Code claim requirements if the public entity denies the plaintiff’s application
for leave to present a late claim.  (Gov. Code § 946.6, subd. (a).) 
A plaintiff may not file a government claim after filing a lawsuit to prosecute
a cause of action based on that government claim.  (Le Mere v. Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 237, 247.) 
Here, the County argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege
that he complied with the mandatory time requirements under the California Tort
Claims Act.  Plaintiff counters that
non-compliance is not a ground for sustaining a general demurrer, and that a
defendant may only raise such a defense on a motion for summary judgment and/or
trial.  Plaintiff is mistaken.  “[A] plaintiff must allege facts
demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement.
Otherwise, his complaint is subject to a general demurrer for failure to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (State of California v.
Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1243.) 
Accordingly, on this basis, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with
20 days leave to amend.  
Uncertainty
The County argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint is
uncertain.  “[A] special demurrer for
uncertainty is not intended to reach the failure to incorporate sufficient
facts in the pleading but is directed at the uncertainty existing in the
allegations actually made.” (Butler v. Sequeira (1950) 100 Cal.App.2d
143, 145-146.) Moreover, demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and will only
be sustained where the pleading is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably
respond, i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Calif. Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the Complaint, as filed, is
unintelligible.  However, the Court notes
that the Complaint appears to be missing the second page which may contain a portion
of the factual allegations. Without the missing page, the Court cannot determine
whether the Complaint is uncertain.  Therefore,
Defendant’s demurrer is not sustained on this basis.  Plaintiff is advised to file and serve a
complete copy of any future amended complaints. 

Governmental Immunity
The County argues that Plaintiff has failed to identify a
statutory scheme under which liability can be imposed upon the County for
damages.  
A public entity is not liable for an injury, except as
otherwise provided by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a).) Civil
Code section 1714, which imposes a general duty of care on all persons, is an
insufficient statutory basis for imposing direct liability on public
agencies. (Eastburn v Regional Fire Protection Auth. (2003) 31
Cal.4th 1175, 1180.) No negligence cause of action may be asserted
directly against a public entity, but under Government Code section 815.2,
subdivision (a), vicarious liability may be imposed on public entities for
the “tortious acts and omissions of their employees.” (See Comment
to Gov. Code, § 815.2.) A public employee is liable for any injury
caused by act or omission “to the same extent as a private person,” except as
provided by statute. (Gov. Code, § 820, subd. (a).) Public employees
have an array of immunities, including the immunity for discretionary acts
(Gov. Code, § 820.2). 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that the County is liable under
Cal. Govt. Code §§ 815.2 and 820. (Complaint, Third Cause of Action, p.7:1-3.)
Therefore, the demurrer is not sustained on this basis.
