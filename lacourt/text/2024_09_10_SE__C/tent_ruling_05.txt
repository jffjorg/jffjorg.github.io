Background 
This wrongful eviction case was filed by Plaintiff JAMES
CISNEROS (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants LONDON EXPRESS, LP and JACQUES
ASSAYAG (collectively “Defendants”) on July 7, 2023. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants manage the trailer park
that Plaintiff currently resides in. “Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
rental agreement that did to [sic] meet the requirements of the California
Mobilehome Residency Law or California Civil Code §§798.15, 798.16, 798.41.”
(Complaint ¶ 7.) “Plaintiff has tendered his rent as required in a timely
manner and additional rents in the form of utility payments that were presented
to him in a separate billing as required by the ‘void’ rental agreement.” (Id.
¶ 8.) “Defendants… failed to credit Plaintiff for the utility payments by a
reduction in the rent as required by California Civil Code §798.41 thus
resulting in an illegal rent increase in violation of Civil Code §§798.30.”
(Id. ¶ 9.) “In 2020, a dispute arose between Plaintiff and Defendant over the
failure of Defendant to reduce the rent by the amount of the separately billed
utilities. Plaintiff filed an action in [LASC] case, 20BFSC00935, whereby the
Court rendered a judgment in Plaintiff’s favor. After the court ruled in
Plaintiffs’ favor Defendant illegally raised the amount of rent that Plaintiff
purportedly owed on the utility bill and another dispute ensued.” (Id. ¶ 10.) 
“During the course of the LASC 20BFSC00935 the court found
London Express, LP was not a partnership registered on the website of the
Secretary of State of California…. Similarly, Defendant has not found a
partnership registration for London Express, LP on the California Secretary of
State site.” (Id. ¶ 11.) “Plaintiff tendered his rents to Defendant form July
1, 2022 until September 30, 2022 and Defendant rejected of all Defendants for
no reason other than to retaliate against Plaintiff and to initiate an unlawful
detainer action.” (Id. ¶ 12.) “Defendant initiated an unlawful detainer action
against Plaintiff based upon the return of Plaintiffs’ rents payments tendered
from July 1, 2022 until September 30, 2022 without cause.” (Id. ¶ 14.)
“Defendant London Express, LP was not a proper party to file an unlawful
detainer action against Plaintiff because it was not the real party in interest
per [CCP] §367 nor was it a legally recognized entity or real estate broker as
required by Corporations Code §15902.01 and Bus. & Prof. Code §10131” (Id.
¶ 15.) “Defendant London fraudulently and illegally collected rents that it was
not entitled to.” (Id. ¶ 16.) Defendant Assayag dismissed the unlawful detainer
action prior to trial. (Assayag Decl., ¶ 18.)
Plaintiff alleges that London Express, LP is the alter ego
of Jacques Assayag. (Id. ¶5.) The Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) Malicious Prosecution; (2) Fraud; (3) Accounting; (4) Declaratory
Relief; and (5) Injunctive Relief.
On November 30, 2023, Defendants LONDON EXPRESS, LP and
JACQUES ASSAYAG’s Special Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s
Complaint was GRANTED as to the First, Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action and
DENIED as to the Second and Third Causes of Action.

Defendants now move for an order awarding
attorneys’ fees of $ 5,918.00 plus costs of $920.90, for a total amount of
$6838.90, on the ground that they were the prevailing parties in their Special
Motion to Strike.  
The motion is unopposed as of September 6, 2024.  
Legal Standard 
CCP § 425.16 states “[a] cause of action against a person
arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of
petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California
Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special
motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has
established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the
claim.”  CCP § 425.16(b)(1).  The Anti-SLAPP motion is a quick and
inexpensive method for unmasking and dismissing causes of action, complaints,
and lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a party’s constitutional
right of petition or free speech.  (Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo
Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1055-1056.) CCP §
425.16(c)(1) provides “in any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her
attorney’s fees and costs.”  Subdivision (b) as quoted above refers to
causes of action and special motions to strike those causes of action
only. 
Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the
Court ordered the Defendants to file this Motion for Attorney’s Fees within 30
days of the service of the Court’s order. Pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §
1010.6(a)(3) the last day the Motion could have been filed was January 3,
2024.  The Motion ultimately was filed on
January 2, 2024. Accordingly, the Motion is timely.
Here,
Defendants are entitled to attorney’s fees and costs as prevailing parties pursuant
to CCP § 425.16(c)(1) because the Special
Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint was granted as to the First, Fourth, and
Fifth Causes of Action and denied only as to the Second and Third Causes of
Action. 
Defendants contend the total
amount of attorneys’ fees incurred is $5,918.00 plus costs of $920.90 for a
total of $6,838.90. Defendants show they incurred 32.4 hours in
preparing the Anti-SLAPP Motion. (Decl. Craddick ¶¶ 6-47.) Counsels’ hourly
rate is $185.00/hour for partners and $175.00/hour for associates. Having
reviewed the hourly charges, the Court finds that they were reasonably
incurred. 
In the memorandum of costs, the Court is unpersuaded that
the initial filing fee of $845.00 or case management statement fee of $5.26 should
be included given that Defendants did not prevail on all claims and thus must
maintain involvement in the instant action. Accordingly, the Court awards costs
in the reduced amount of $12.97.
