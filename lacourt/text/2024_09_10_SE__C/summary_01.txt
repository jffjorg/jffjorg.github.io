Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reconsidering their previous ruling that granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's (Reynaldo Rios) Verified Answer. The original complaint was filed on March 3, 2022, and default was entered against Rios on April 15, 2022. However, the plaintiff subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on July 20, 2023, substituting Rios's true name. Rios filed a Verified Answer on September 20, 2023, and the plaintiff moved to strike it on September 25, 2023. The court granted the motion to strike on December 14, 2023. However, the court now finds that the original complaint is no longer operative, and the answer filed on September 20, 2022 was timely. Therefore, the court is setting aside its previous ruling and allowing Rios's answer to stand. Rios's motion to set aside the default is now moot.
