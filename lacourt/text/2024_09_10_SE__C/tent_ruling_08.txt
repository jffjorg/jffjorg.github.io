Defendants to give
notice.  
 
 
This is a personal injury action. Plaintiff Rigoberto
Cuevas-Robles applies ex parte for an order advancing the hearing dates for
Plaintiffs’ twelve (12) Motions to Compel Discovery presently scheduled for
April 9, 2025, May 28, 2025, May 29, 2025, June 3, 2025, June 4, 2025, and June
5, 2025, to all be heard on the same date and time on September 30, 2024. 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative
factual showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other
statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
This matter was continued to today’s date from September 3,
2024.  As of that date, Defendants had
reserved a hearing date on September 24, 2024 for a motion to compel
arbitration, but the motion had not been filed yet.  Defendants argue that
if their motion to compel arbitration is granted, Plaintiffs’ discovery motions
will be heard by the arbitrator instead of the court.  The Court continued the ex parte application
to provide Defendants additional time to file and serve a motion to compel
arbitration.  Defendants filed and served
their motion to compel arbitration on September 6, 2024.  The hearing is currently scheduled for May
29, 2025.  
Plaintiff’s ex parte application is DENIED without
prejudice.  On the Court’s own motion, Defendants’
Motion to Compel Arbitration is ADVANCED from May 29, 2025 to today’s date and
CONTINUED to December 17, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Opposition and Reply briefs to be filed in
compliance with the new hearing date.  Discovery
is STAYED pending further order of the Court.
