Tentative Ruling 
On Its own motion, the Court reconsiders the
portion of its Order dated December 14, 2024 which granted Plaintiff Lorraine
Cota’s Motion to Strike Defendant Reynaldo Rios’s Verified Answer filed on
September 20, 2023.  The Order granting
Plaintiff Cota’s Motion to Strike is VACATED and SET ASIDE.  Defendant Rios’s Answer shall stand.  Defendant Rios’s Motion to Set Aside Default
is MOOT. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
This is a financial elder abuse lawsuit.  
Plaintiff Lorraine Cota filed a Complaint against
Defendants Marco Antonio Martin, 365 Kapital, LLC, My Rights Inc., Rinaldo (Mando) Rios (“Rios”), and Excellence RE Real
Estate. Inc. on March 3, 2022.
As relevant here, personal service was purportedly made
upon “Rinaldo (Mando) Rios” on March 14, 2022, and proof of service was filed
on March 21, 2022.
Default was entered against Defendant Rios on April 15,
2022.  
Defendant Rios moves to set aside default on the grounds
that service of the Summons did not result in actual notice, he lacked actual
notice in time to raise the defect before the default was entered, and the
default and default judgment are void. (CCP § 473.5.) He also seeks equitable
relief on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and mistake. (CCP § 473(d).) 
A court has inherent authority to reconsider its own
rulings. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094). 
Here, after default was entered against Rios on April 15,
2022, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on July 20, 2023, substituting the
name alleged in the Complaint, “Rinaldo (Mando) Rios”, with defendant’s true
name, “Reynaldo (Mando) Rios”.  Proof of
service of the Amended Complaint was filed on September 5, 2023.
On September 20, 2023, Rios filed a Verified Answer.  On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff moved to
strike the answer on the ground that it was filed after default had been
entered.  On December 14, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to strike the answer.  
It is now apparent that the Court’s December 14, 2024 ruling
was in error in so far as it granted Plaintiff’s motion to strike the answer.  The Court overlooked the fact that the April
15, 2022 default was entered as to the original complaint, but Plaintiff subsequently
filed and served an Amended Complaint substituting Rios’s true name.  Thus, the original complaint was no longer
operative, and the answer Rios filed on September 20, 2022 in response to the
amended complaint was timely.  
Accordingly, the portion of the Court’s ruling on December
14, 2023 granting Plaintiff’s motion to strike Rios’s September 20, 2022 Answer
is set aside and vacated.  The Answer
shall stand.  Rios’s motion to set aside
the April 15, 2022 default is moot.
