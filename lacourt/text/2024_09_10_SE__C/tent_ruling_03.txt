Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant George Makary and
Ayad Makary’s unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants to give notice. 
 
Background 
On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant George Makary
filed a Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Guillermina Vazquez alleging
interference with economic relations and private nuisance for refusing to
vacate real property commonly known as 11611 Burke Street, Whittier, CA 90606. 
On February 1, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a
First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) against Cross-Defendants George Makary,
Ayad Makary, and Jazmin Vazquez for quiet title alleging that her signature on
a 2021 quitclaim deed was forged by Jazmin Vazquez.
In the FAXC, Defendant/Cross-Complainant contends that “on
or about January 31, 2013, Cross-Complainant purchased the Property. Cross-Complainant
GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ took title with her daughter Cross-Defendant JAZMIN G.
VAZQUEZ as joint tenants (1) because that allowed the lender to consider JAZMIN
G. VAZQUEZ’S income which enabled GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ to obtain a better loan;
and (2) to provide a mechanism to transfer the Property to JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ if
GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ were to die without the need and expense of probate” (FAXC,
¶ 10.) “GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ made all loan payments on the Property. GUILLERMINA
VAZQUEZ did not know how to make online loan payments. Accordingly, GUILLERMINA
VAZQUEZ gave the loan payments to JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ who informed GUILLERMINA
VAZQUEZ that she was making all loan payments online. JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ stopped
making the online loan payments at some point and instead kept the money that
GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ gave her to make the loan payments.” (FAXC, ¶ 11.) Cross-Complainant
contends that “on or about April 6, 2017, JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ created a
fraudulent Quitclaim Deed purporting to transfer GUILLERMINA VAZQUEZ’S joint
tenant ownership interest to JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ making JAZMIN G. VAZQUEZ the
sole owner of the Property.” (FAXC, ¶ 12.) 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants move for summary judgment on the
grounds that the Makarys acquired their interest free and clear of Plaintiff’s alleged
interest in the property.
As of September 6, 2024, this motion is unopposed. 
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants’ requests for judicial notice. The Court takes judicial notice only as to the
existence, content, and authenticity of such documents; it does not take
judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted therein. (Dominguez
v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.) 
 
Legal Standard 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary judgment “has
met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the
party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot
be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2).)  “Once the
defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . .
to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If the plaintiff
cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Med. Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.”  (Avivi, supra, 159
Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) 
Discussion 
Cross-Complainant’s only cause of action is for quiet
title.  “An action to quiet title is akin to an action for declaratory
relief in that the plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring his rights in relation
to a piece of property.”  (Ciara v. Offner (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
12, 24.)  The California quiet title statutes obligate a court hearing a
quiet title claim to examine “evidence of plaintiff’s title” along with “such
evidence as may be offered respecting the claims of any of the defendants,” in
order to determine whether title should be quieted in the plaintiff’s
favor.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.) On this summary judgment motion, Cross-Defendants
must present evidence showing Guillermina is not entitled to quiet title of the
Subject Property.
In support of the Motion for Summary Adjudication,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants present the following evidence:
·       
On or about January 2013, Vasquez and her
daughter Jazmin Vasquez purchased the real property commonly known as 11661
Burke Street, Whittier, CA 90606 (“Property”) evidenced by a Grant Deed that
recorded on March 28, 2013 as Doc No. 20130465785 in the Official Records of
the Los Angeles County Recorder. (UF # 1.) 
·       
Vasquez has secured Section 8 Housing benefits
since at least 2019. (UF # 4.) 
·       
Each Personal Declaration Form [for the Section
8 benefits] from 2019 to 2022 at “Section III- Assets” under “Section C.
Property” asks if Vasquez or anyone in her household owns or has any interest
in commercial/residential real estate or mobile home. (UF # 6.) 
·       
In each of the Personal Declaration Forms from
2019 to 2022, Vasquez writes “No.” (UF # 7.) 
·       
Each Personal Declaration Form from 2019 to
2022 is signed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
California that all the information contained in the documents is true and
correct. (UF # 5.) 
·       
In October 2021, the Makarys purchased the
Property from Jazmin. (UF # 9.) 
·       
The transfer of Jasmin Vasquez’s interest to
George Makary and Ayad Makary is evidenced by a Grant Deed recorded on October
26, 2021 as Doc No. 20211607895. (UF #10.) 
The Court determines Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants have made a
prima facie showing that Defendant/Cross-Complainant did not have an ownership interest
in the Subject property.  The burden now
shifts to Defendant/Cross-Complainant to raise a triable issue of material
fact. 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant has not filed an opposition.  Thus, Defendant/Cross- Complainant does not
present any evidence in opposition to Cross-Defendants’ motion.  
As noted above, the California quiet title statutes
obligate a court hearing a quiet title claim to examine “evidence of
plaintiff’s title” along with “such evidence as may be offered respecting the
claims of any of the defendants” to determine whether title should be quieted
in the plaintiff’s favor.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.) In this summary
judgment motion, Cross-Defendants have presented evidence that
Cross-Complainant declared under penalty of perjury in her application for Section
8 Housing that she held no property. Moreover, the property was listed in her
daughter’s name. It follows that there was no evidence of Cross-Complainant’s
title. 
Thus, Cross-Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED.
