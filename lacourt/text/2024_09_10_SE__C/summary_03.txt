And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by George Makary and Ayad Makary, the plaintiff/cross-defendants, against Guillermina Vazquez, the defendant/cross-complainant. The motion is granted. The judge finds that the plaintiff/cross-defendants have made a prima facie showing that the defendant/cross-complainant did not have an ownership interest in the subject property. The judge notes that the defendant/cross-complainant did not file an opposition to the motion and did not present any evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge concludes that the California quiet title statutes obligate a court to examine evidence of plaintiff's title and evidence offered by defendants to determine whether title should be quieted in the plaintiff's favor. In this case, the plaintiff/cross-defendants have presented evidence that the defendant/cross-complainant declared under penalty of perjury that she held no property, and the property was listed in her daughter's name. Therefore, the judge grants the motion for summary judgment and quiet title in favor of the plaintiff/cross-defendants.
