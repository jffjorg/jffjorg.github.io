And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this housing discrimination case, denying the ex parte application by the plaintiffs to prevent the defendants from taking further action on the rental application and to enjoin the defendants from engaging in discriminatory practices. The Judge found that the plaintiffs did not meet the necessary showing to warrant ex parte relief, and therefore denied the application. The Judge also noted that the plaintiffs are not foreclosed from filing and serving a noticed motion for the relief sought. The case will proceed to a hearing on September 10, 2024.
