And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant's motion for a deemed-admitted order regarding Requests for Admission Nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 21, 22, 23, and 26, as Plaintiff failed to provide a verified response to these requests. The judge has also granted Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $360, which is calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. The judge has ordered Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act within 30 days of notice.
