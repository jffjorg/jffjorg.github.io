Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Cesar Galarza, alleged that the defendant, Resource Environmental, Inc., was negligent in performing asbestos removal work, which caused him to slip and fall and sustain injuries. However, the court found that the defendant had met its initial burden of showing that one or more elements of the plaintiff's cause of action could not be established. Specifically, the court noted that the plaintiff had admitted through requests for admission that the defendant was not negligent, did not breach any duty to the plaintiff, did not cause any injuries to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had no evidence that the defendant was negligent. Since the plaintiff did not file any opposition to the motion, the court found that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
