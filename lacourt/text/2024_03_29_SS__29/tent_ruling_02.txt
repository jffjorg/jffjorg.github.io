Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Resource
 Environmental, Inc. 

 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Cesar Galarza (“Plaintiff”) filed
the complaint in this action on April 26, 2022, and the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) on August 3, 2022. In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts a claim for personal
injuries against Resource Environmental, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through
50; according to Plaintiff, on November 5, 2020, while he was performing a safety
inspection, he slipped on asbestos dust and debris that had accumulated as a
result of the conduct of defendants, fell, and sustained serious injuries.
 
Defendant filed its answer on September 9,
2022.
 
On January 3, 2023, the Court granted the
motion of Plaintiff’s counsel’s to be relieved. 
Since then, Plaintiff has been representing himself, in pro per.
 
On March 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion for an order deeming admitted as true the matters specified in Defendant’s
Requests for Admission (Set One). 
 
On July 7, 2023, Defendant filed this motion
for summary judgment, supporting evidence, and a request for judicial notice. The
moving papers were served on Plaintiff by mail, electronic mail, and personal
service.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary
to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c),
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
 
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s request to take judicial notice of South Coast Air Quality
Management District Rule 1403.
 
Discussion
 
In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant performed asbestos removal
work in a negligent fashion, allowing asbestos dust and debris to accumulate in
the area outside of, but adjacent to, Defendant’s work area. (FAC, ¶¶ 9-11.) Plaintiff
alleges that he slipped and fell on “the dangerously slippery asbestos dust and
debris that defendants had allowed to accumulate.” (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff’s claim is for negligence. The basic elements of the causes of
action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation;
and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11
Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Super.
Ct. Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th
1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994,
998.)
 
During discovery,
the Court granted Defendant’s motion for an order deeming admitted as true the
matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One). (Hopkins
Decl., Exhs. K-M.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has admitted (among other things)
that Defendant was not negligent, that Defendant did not breach any duty to
Plaintiff, that Defendant did not cause any injuries to Plaintiff, that
Plaintiff was not injured, and that Plaintiff has no evidence that Defendant
was negligent. (Hopkins Decl., Exh. K [Requests for Admission], at Nos. 1-4, 15;
see also Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], Nos.
35-61.)  
 
“[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a
nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all
matters contained therein.” (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973, 979.) Requests for admission “differ[] fundamentally from the other five
discovery tools (depositions, interrogatories, inspection demands, medical
examinations, and expert witness exchanges) . . . [because] admission requests
seek to eliminate the need for proof: ‘The purpose of the admissions procedure
. . . is to limit the triable issues and spare the parties the burden and
expense of litigating undisputed issues.’ Sometimes, the admissions obtained
will even leave the party making them vulnerable to summary judgment.”
[Citations.] Matters that are admitted or deemed admitted through RFA discovery
devices are conclusively established in the litigation and are not subject to
being contested through contrary evidence. [Citation.]” (St. Mary v.
Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775.)
 
In light of the Requests for Admission, the Deemed-Admitted Order, and
all of the other evidence in the record, Defendant has met its initial burden on
summary judgment of presenting facts that show that one or more elements of Plaintiff’s cause
of action cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) 
 
Once a defendant
has made such a showing, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that there
are triable issues of material fact. (Ibid.) Here, Plaintiff has not
filed any opposition at all and thus has not done so.
 
Accordingly, Defendant has shown on this record that it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice.
