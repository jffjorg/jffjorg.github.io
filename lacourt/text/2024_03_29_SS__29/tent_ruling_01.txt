  Case Number:  20STCV49328    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for an Order Deeming Admitted the
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
 
Tentative
The motions to compel are granted.
The request for sanctions are granted in
part.
Background
On December 28, 2020, Micael Nystrom
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Margaret E. Davis (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an accident on December 28, 2018, near the intersection of
Ventura Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.  Defendant filed her answer on March 14, 2022.
On November 16, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Castronovo Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff served objections
and unverified responses. (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. B.) Defendant followed up
with Plaintiff, but no verifications were provided.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)
On February 7, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for a
deemed-admitted order as to Requests for Admission Nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 21, 22,
23, and 26.  Defendant also seeks
sanctions.  Plaintiff filed an opposition
on March 15, 2024, limited to the issue of sanctions against counsel. 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)  
Discussion
On November 16, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Castronovo Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff served objections and unverified
responses. (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. B.)
Defendant now moves for a deemed-admitted order
as to Requests for Admission Nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 21, 22, 23, and 26.  Substantive responses to requests for admission
must be verified.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240,
subd. (a).)  An unverified response is the
equivalent of no response at all.  (See Appleton
v. Super. Ct. (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) 
Defendant
need not show anything more.  Plaintiff has
failed to provide a verified response to the requests for admission.  Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is also GRANTED in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a
motion for a deemed-admitted order, and the economies of scale associated with
filing multiple discovery motions (additional motions were scheduled for
hearing earlier this week), the Court sets sanctions on this motion in the
amount of $360.00, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied
by counsel’s billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Castronovo Decl., ¶ 10.)
No sanctions are awarded against
Plaintiff’s counsel.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for a
deemed-admitted order.
The Court ORDERS
that Plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in
Defendant’s Requests for Admission Nos. 1, 2, 5,
9, 11, 21, 22, 23, and 26.  
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act
in the amount of $360 within 30 days of notice.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
