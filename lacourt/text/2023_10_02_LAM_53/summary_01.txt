## English Summary:

The judge has denied defendant Soon Pill Kim's motion to overturn the court's previous order striking his answer. The judge found that Kim failed to meet the requirements for relief under California law, specifically Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, which outlines procedures for setting aside court orders.  

The judge stated that Kim did not demonstrate a sufficient excuse for his attorney's (Kelly Lawrence Casado) late filing of discovery responses, nor did he show that Casado abandoned him. While Kim argued that Casado's late filing and lack of communication constituted abandonment, the judge disagreed, noting that Casado eventually filed the responses and appeared at the hearing on the motion for terminating sanctions.  


The judge concluded that Kim failed to meet the required burden of proof for relief under the law and denied his motion.
