And here is the English text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by James Tseng, on behalf of himself and the Tseng and Jou Family Trust. The motion is based on the argument that the plaintiffs did not properly serve the defendant with the summons and complaint. The court finds that the proofs of service submitted by the plaintiffs are insufficient to show that the defendant was personally served, as required by law. The court also finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden to prove that they properly served the defendant. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and orders that the service of summonses on the defendant is quashed.
