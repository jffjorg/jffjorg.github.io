## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant James Tseng. The judge found that the proofs of service submitted by Plaintiffs were insufficient to show that Defendant was properly served because they stated that Defendant refused to accept service, but did not provide evidence that Defendant was actually notified of the service attempt and evaded it.  

Therefore, the judge granted Defendant's motion to quash service of summons, meaning that the service of the lawsuit on Defendant is considered invalid.

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of specially appearing defendant James Tseng to quash service of summons.

However, the court found that the proofs of service were not signed by a registered California process server and did not sufficiently show that the defendant was personally served. The court also found that the plaintiffs had not met their burden to prove that they properly served the defendant. The court therefore granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and ordered that the service of summonses on James Tseng and the Tseng and Jou Family Trust be quashed. The court also ordered James Tseng to give notice of this ruling.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is for the case 20STCV23621, scheduled for a hearing on October 2, 2023, at the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles – Central District. The judge, Robert B. Broadbelt III, grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendant, James Tseng, and the Tseng and Jou Family Trust. The plaintiffs, Nicolitsa Pitsos, Georgios Pitsos, Stavroula Pitsos, and Demetrios Pitsos, failed to prove that they properly served the defendants. The proofs of service were not signed by a registered California process server and did not show that the defendants were personally served. Additionally, the plaintiffs did not provide competent evidence that the defendants were notified and evaded service. Therefore, the court quashes the service of summonses on both defendants and orders them to give notice of this ruling.
