  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for terminating and/or
  evidentiary/issue sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Dignity Health      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Luz Reynozo
Motion for Terminating and/or Evidentiary/Issue Sanctions
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Dignity Health
(“Defendant”) moves the court for an order imposing terminating, issue, or
evidence sanctions against plaintiff Luz Reynozo (“Plaintiff”) based on her
failure to comply with the court’s May 24, 2023 order. 
If a party engages in a misuse
of the discovery process, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 provides, in relevant part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . . (d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”¿¿  
On May 24, 2023, the court
issued an order granting Defendant’s motion to compel further responses Form
Interrogatories – Employment, ordering Plaintiff to serve further, full and
complete answers to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories – Employment, numbers
200.2 through 200.5, 201.1, 201.3, 201.4, 202.1, 202.2, 203.1, 207.2, 208.1,
212.4, and 213.2 within 30 days of the date of service of the order.  (May 24, 2023 Order, p. 2:10-14.)  The court also ordered Plaintiff to pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,560 to Defendant.  Defendant filed and served a notice of ruling
on the motion on May 24, 2023.  Defendant
has presented evidence showing that Plaintiff did not serve timely responses
and that “no responses to the compelled interrogatories have been received” as
of the date that Defendant filed this motion. 
(Schwake Decl., ¶ 6.)  
Plaintiff, in her opposition
papers, represents to the court that she has since drafted supplemental
responses to the discovery at issue in this motion.  (Opp., p. 3:17-19.)  Further, in her declaration, she states that
she has “served the further responses sought.” 
(Reynozo Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Plaintiff has not attached a copy of the responses served on
Defendant.  Thus, Plaintiff has not
presented the court with sufficient evidence to show that she served
supplemental responses in compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure.  However, Defendant did not file reply papers
denying that Plaintiff has since served supplemental responses. 
First, the court finds that,
after considering the totality of the circumstances, terminating sanctions
against Plaintiff are not warranted.  (Los
Defensores, Inc., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.)  The court therefore denies Defendant’s
request for terminating sanctions. 
Second, the court finds that
imposing issue or evidence sanctions against Plaintiff would not be appropriate
to remedy the prejudice caused by Plaintiff’s incomplete and evasive discovery
responses to the subject interrogatories. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (b), (c) [“The court may
impose” issue or evidence sanctions] [emphasis added].)  To remedy the prejudice caused by Plaintiff’s
noncompliance with the court’s order, however, the court orders Plaintiff to
serve full and complete further answers to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories –
Employment, numbers 200.2 through 200.5, 201.1, 201.3, 201.4, 202.1, 202.2,
203.1, 207.2, 208.1, 212.4, and 213.2.
ORDER
The court denies defendant Dignity Health’s motion for terminating
and/or evidentiary/issue sanctions.  
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, the court orders plaintiff Luz
Reynozo to serve further, full and complete answers to defendant Dignity
Health’s Form Interrogatories (Employment), numbers 200.2 through 200.5, 201.1,
201.3, 201.4, 202.1, 202.2, 203.1, 207.2, 208.1, 212.4, and 213.2, which comply
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-203.220, and 2030.250, within 15
days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders defendant Dignity Health to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 2, 2023
