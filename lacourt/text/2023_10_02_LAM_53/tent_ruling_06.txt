[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Ogochukwu Victor Onwaeze  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Ogochukwu Victor Onwaeze
(“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Peter
Tamarat (“Plaintiff”). 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿¿ 
The court
finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has served Plaintiff with (1) the moving papers
by mail at Plaintiff’s last known address, which Plaintiff’s Counsel confirmed
within the past 30 days is current, and (2) the notice of continuance, which
states that the hearing on this motion was continued from September 14, 2023 to
October 2, 2023, by mail and email. 
(MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(a); Aug. 28, 2023 Notice of
Continuance, Proof of Service.)  The
court further finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has shown sufficient reasons why
counsel should be relieved and why counsel has brough the motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284, subdivision (1).  (MC-052,
¶ 2.) 
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion. 
The court,
however, notes that the proposed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil” is incomplete, because it does not state
Plaintiff’s current or last known telephone number in section 6.  The court will require Plaintiff’s Counsel to
provide Plaintiff’s current or last known telephone number at the hearing on
this motion. 
Ogochukwu
Victor Onwaeze will be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Peter Tamarat
effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the client. 
The court
orders Ogochukwu Victor Onwaeze to give notice of this ruling and the signed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to
plaintiff Peter Tamarat and to all other parties who have appeared in this
action. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 2, 2023
