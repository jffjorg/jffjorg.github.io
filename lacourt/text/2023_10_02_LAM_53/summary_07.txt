And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for terminating and/or evidentiary/issue sanctions filed by defendant Dignity Health against plaintiff Luz Reynozo. The motion is based on plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's May 24, 2023 order to serve further responses to defendant's interrogatories. Despite plaintiff's claims that she has served supplemental responses, the court has not been provided with sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court denies defendant's request for terminating sanctions, but orders plaintiff to serve full and complete further answers to defendant's interrogatories within 15 days of the date of service of this order.
