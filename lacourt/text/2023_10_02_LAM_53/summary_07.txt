**Summary:**

The document is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III of the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County - Central District, for case number 22STCV11124, scheduled for a hearing on October 2, 2023. The defendant, California Hospital - Dignity Health, filed a motion for terminating and/or evidentiary/issue sanctions against the plaintiff, Luz Reynozo, due to her failure to comply with a previous court order issued on May 24, 2023.

The May 24 order required the plaintiff to serve further, full and complete answers to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories – Employment, numbers 200.2 through 200.5, 201.1, 201.3, 201.4, 202.1, 202.2, 203.1, 207.2, 208.1, 212.4, and 213.2 within 30 days of the date of service of the order and pay monetary sanctions of $1,560 to the defendant. Despite the court order, the plaintiff did not serve timely responses, and no responses have been received as of the date the defendant filed the motion.

In her opposition papers, the plaintiff represented that she had drafted supplemental responses to the discovery at issue in this motion. However, she did not attach a copy of the responses served on the defendant. Consequently, the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that she served supplemental responses in compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court finds that terminating sanctions are not warranted, but imposing issue or evidence sanctions would not be appropriate to remedy the prejudice caused by the plaintiff's incomplete and evasive discovery responses. To remedy the noncompliance with the court's order, the court orders the plaintiff to serve full and complete further answers to Defendant's Form Interrogatories – Employment, numbers 200.2 through 200.5, 201.1, 201.3, 201.4, 202.1, 202.2, 203.1, 207.2, 208.1, 212.4, and 213.2 within 15 days of the date of service of this order. The defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
