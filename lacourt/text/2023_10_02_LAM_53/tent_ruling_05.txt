[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for terminating, issue,
  or evidence sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Consumer Advocacy
Group, Inc.     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Terminating, Issue, or Evidence Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.  
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court
for an order imposing terminating sanctions against defendants Midland Hardware
Co. No. 4 (“Midland”) and Kittrich Corp. (“Kittrich”) (collectively,
“Defendants”).  Alternatively, Plaintiff
requests that the court impose issue or evidence sanctions. 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service stating that
it served Defendants with the papers filed in connection with the pending
motion by mail and electronic service on that date.  However, the Proof of Service was not
signed.  (Proof of Service, p.
3:1-6.)  Thus, the court finds that the
Proof of Service is defective and does not establish that Defendants were
served with the papers filed in connection with this motion.  
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motion (1) to provide Plaintiff an opportunity to serve
Defendants with this motion and to file a valid proof of service, and (2) to
provide Defendants an opportunity to file opposition papers. 
ORDER
The court continues the hearing on plaintiff Consumer Advocacy Group,
Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions, or alternatively, issue or evidence
sanctions to October 27, 2023, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. (1) to serve
defendants Midland Hardware Co. No. 4 and Kittrich Corp. with (i) all the
papers filed in connection with plaintiff Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc.’s
motion for terminating sanctions, or alternatively, issue or evidence sanctions,
and (ii) the notice of ruling on this motion, by personal service, no later
than October 5, 2023, or by electronic service, no later than October 3, 2023,
and (2) to file the proof of service with the court no later than October 6,
2023. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 2, 2023
