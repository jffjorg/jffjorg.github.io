CASE
HISTORY:
·        
02/20/24: Petition to confirm arbitration award
filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an uninsured motorist action. Petitioner sustained injuries to
her sternum and wrists in a car accident. Petitioner’s claim proceeded to
arbitration, in which the arbitrator awarded Petitioner damages in the amount
of $189,000. 
 
Petitioner seeks an order
confirming the arbitration award and an order awarding costs of proof on three
requests for admissions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED to May 15, 2024 at 9:00 AM. 
 
            The
Motion for Order Awarding Costs of Proof is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
 
            Petitioner
seeks an order confirming an arbitration award. 
 
Any party to an arbitration award
may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and
filed, the court shall confirm the
award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1286, bold emphasis added.) A petition to confirm a binding arbitration must
name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name any other
parties to be bound by the award. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) The petition shall
(1) set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement; (2) set
forth the name(s) of the arbitrator(s); and (3) set forth or have attached a
copy of the award and written opinion of the arbitrator. (Code Civ. Proc. §
1285.4(a)-(c).)
 
The petition to confirm must be
served and filed no later than four years after the date of service of a signed
copy of the award on the petitioner (Code Civ. Proc. § 1288) but may not be
served and filed until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1288.4.) A freestanding petition must be served in the same manner as a
summons and complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1290, 1290.4.) 
 
Here, all parties to the
arbitration are named in the petition. (Petition p.2:2-4.) The agreement to
arbitrate is attached to the Petition. (Exh. 1.) The name of the arbitrator, the
Hon. Patricia Schnegg (ret.), is set forth in the Petition. (Petition p.2:7.)
 
A copy of the executed arbitration
award, dated January 25, 2024 is also attached to the petition and was served
on Respondent on February 5, 2024. (Petition Exh. 2.) The petition to confirm
was filed on February 20, 2024, and served the next day on February 21, 2024 by
email. (See Proof of Service.) These dates are all within four years from the
date the award was served and more than ten days after the award was served. That
said, the Petition was not served in the same manner as a summons and
complaint, as a summons and complaint may only be served by personal service,
substitute service, service by mail, or service by publication. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 415.10; 415.20; 415.30; 415.50; 1290.4.) However, Respondent filed and
served an opposition to the pending Motion for Costs of Proof, addressed infra,
on April 8, 2024. (Proof of Service in Opposition filed 4/8/24.) That
opposition does not object to the petition as improperly served. A defendant
(or respondent) makes a general appearance when that party “takes a part in the
particular action which in some manner recognizes the authority of the court to
proceed.” (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147;
accord. Sierra Club. v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 162, 171.) As Respondent appears to have done just that, the Court
finds that the Petition to Confirm was filed and served in accordance with the
time limit set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1288. 
 
No petition to vacate or correct
the award has been filed. A petition to vacate an award or correct an award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award on the party petitioning to vacate or correct the
award. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1288.) The Court may not correct or vacate an award
unless a petition or response requesting that the award be corrected or vacated
has been filed. (See, e.g., Valsan Partners Ltd. P’ship v. Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) The time to petition to
vacate or correct the award here does not expire until May 15, 2024. 
 
            As the time
to vacate or correct the award has not yet expired, the Court finds it
appropriate to continue this motion until after the last day to vacate or
correct the award, so as to avoid the Court entering an order that must
subsequently be corrected or vacated. The Court therefore continues this motion
to May 15, 2024, at 9:00 AM. As the current petition meets all the statutory
requirements, if no petition to vacate or correct the award is filed by that
date, the petition will be confirmed on that date. In the event a petition to
correct or vacate the award is filed, the Court will reschedule the hearing on
this matter so both petitions may be heard simultaneously. 
 
Motion for Order Awarding Costs of Proof
 
            Petitioner
also moves for an order awarding the costs of proof incurred to establish facts
set forth in three requests for admissions. 
 
Legal Standard for Costs of Proof
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.420 states:
 
If a party fails to
admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter when requested
to do so under this chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter
proves the genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party
requesting the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to
whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making
that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.420(a).) Pursuant to subdivision
(b), the Court “shall” issue the order unless it finds (1) an objection to the
request was sustained or a response to it was waived pursuant to section
2033.290; (2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance; (3) the
party failing to make the admission had reasonable ground to believe that party
would prevail on the matter; or (4) there was other good reason for the failure
to admit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.420(b).) The burden to prove the existence of
an exception lies with the party who did not make the admission. (Samsky v.
State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 517, 523-24 [trial
court erred in placing burden of proving non-existence of exception on moving
party in uninsured motorist action].) A party may not rely on their own
“belief” to assert a denial when faced with substantial contrary evidence. (Grace
v. Mansourian (2013) 240 Cal.App.4th 523, 530-32.) However, a
party’s reliance on its own evidence can constitute reasonable grounds to deny
a request. (Orange County Water Dist. v. The Arnold Engineering Co.
(2018) 31 Cal.App.5th 96, 116-17, 124.) 
Entitlement to Costs
 
            Petitioner
contends she is entitled to the costs of proof to establish matters stated in
three requests for admissions propounded to Respondent. 
 
            On July 14,
2022, Petitioner served requests for admissions on Respondent, including
Requests Nos. 10, 11, and 13 which are at issue on this motion. (Petitioner’s
Exh. 2.) These requests are set forth below:
 
Request No. 10:
Admit that Elaine Schock sprained both wrists in the INCIDENT.
 
Request No. 11:
Admit that Elaine Schock has required injections into both wrists because of
the INCIDENT; 
 
. . . 
 
Request No. 13:
Admit that all of Elaine Schock’s medical treatment to date for the INCIDENT
has been reasonable.  
 
(Petitioner’s Exh. 2 Nos. 10, 11, 13.) “INCIDENT” as defined
in the requests refers to “the collision between Elaine Shock [sic] and Micaela
Rabinowitz, in their respective vehicles, at the intersection of Ventura
Boulevard and Del Moreno Drive, on November 15, 2021.” (Id. p.2:2-4.) 
 
            Respondent
served responses on September 14, 2022 which denied these specific requests as
follows:
 
Response No. 10:
Deny. The claimant appears to have sustained only a bruise to her left wrist.
 
Response No. 11:
Deny. Claimant appears to have sustained only a bruised left wrist from the
INCIDENT.
 
. . . 
 
Response No. 13: Respondent
admits Elaine’s medical treatment to date has been reasonable to treat her
preexisting and traumatically induced injuries, but denies that all of the
treatment was necessary. Respondent denies that the treatment to her follow up
treatments and surgery to her left wrist, and treatment to the right wrist were
related to the incident.
 
(Petitioner’s Exh. 3. Nos. 10, 11,
13.) The arbitrator determined that the nature and extent of Petitioner’s
injuries stemming from the accident was the “sole issue for consideration,” and
the main dispute was whether her injuries to her thumbs and wrists were caused
by osteoarthritis or by the accident. (Petition Exh. 2 pp. 5:25; 6:9-10.) The arbitrator
concluded that the accident caused her injuries. (Id. p.7:24-25.) 
 
            Respondent
contends that, at the time the requests were propounded, the emergency room
records dated November 15, 2021 indicated that Petitioner had only bruised her
left wrist and was not suffering any ongoing pain. (Respondent’s Exh. B.) Respondent’s
counsel states that as of September 14, 2022, discovery “was still in the early
stages,” and there had been no expert depositions or independent medical
examination. (Declaration of Marvin Velastegui ISO Opp. ¶ 2.) Petitioner fails
to reckon with this argument in reply beyond characterizing Respondent’s
position as a “muddled rehash.” The relevant inquiry on a motion of this nature
is whether “the party who denied for lack of information or belief had access
to the information [confirming the fact] at the time requests for
admissions were propounded.” (Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 729, 752 as modified on denial of reh’g August 27, 2014; rev.
denied October 15, 2014 [internal citations omitted; emphasis added].) Whether
Respondent had a valid basis to maintain its position later is not at issue,
only whether it had reason to believe in its position on September 14, 2022.
Petitioner’s citation to Grace v. Mansourian is misplaced. That case
concerned a personal injury action arising from a vehicle collision in which
the defendant ran a red light and struck the plaintiff’s vehicle. (Grace,
supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at 526.) The defendant denied a request for
admission that the light was red based on nothing but his own belief that the
light was yellow, contrary to all other evidence. (Id. at 526-27, 530.) The
Court of Appeal concluded that the defendant’s belief was not reasonably held,
regardless of its sincerity. (Id. at 530.) 
 
            Here,
however, Respondent does not cite subjective belief but to documentary evidence
supporting its position at the time. (Respondent’s Exh. B.) More critically,
the defendant in Grace reasserted his denial twice in supplemental
responses, including once on the eve of trial. (Id. at 527.) Thus, in Grace,
the issue was not merely whether the defendant’s position was sound at the
outset but whether it was sound on the eve of trial. In this case, on the other
hand, no supplemental requests nor responses were served, and so the question
is only whether Respondent had reason to believe it would prevail on its
position on September 14, 2022, not whether that belief remained reasonable
thereafter. The Court finds Respondent’s showing supports its reasonable belief
at that time.
 
            Because
the Court finds that Respondent has demonstrated that it had a reasonable
ground for its denials on September 14, 2022, the Court finds that an award of
costs is not proper. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED to May 15, 2024 at 9:00
AM. 
 
            The
Motion for Order Awarding Costs of Proof is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
