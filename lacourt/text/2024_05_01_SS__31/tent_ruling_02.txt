Sonnega, Esq./BD&J, P.C. (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel contending relief is necessary because of a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has significantly impeded Counsel's ability to effectively prosecute this case and represent Plaintiff's interest.    Counsel declares he has served Plaintiff by mail at the last known address, which Counsel was unable to confirm after calling Plaintiff Ayala’s last known number and commissioning the services of a private investigator. No defendants have yet to appear in this action. Counsel has filed proof of service of the motion, declaration, and proposed order on Plaintiff and on the Clerk of Court. (California Rules Court, rule 3.1362(d).)      The motion is unopposed and granted; the ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. No trial date is currently set. Therefore, there is sufficient time for Plaintiff Ayala to seek other counsel or otherwise prepare prior to trial.     Moving Counsel is ordered to give notice.     PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 30th day of April 2024      Hon.
