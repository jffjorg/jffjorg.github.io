Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiff has agreed to settle his claims against Defendants for the total amount of $100,000 with the entirety being apportioned to Mario Molina-Guzman (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $17,700 will be used for medical expenses, $33,000 for attorneys’ fees, and $11,801.51 will be used for costs. The net balance of $37,498.49 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The Court reviews the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.¿The Court also finds the attorney’s fees fair and reasonable, in that it amounts to 33% of Claimant’s settlement. However, Petitioner did not file the Order Approving Compromise (MC-351) and Order To Deposit Funds In Blocked Account (MC-355). The most recent filing of MC-351 and MC-351 were rejected on February 16, 2024.   The Court therefore CONDITIONALLY GRANTS the March 26, 2024 petition upon the filing of MC-351 and MC-355 in connection with this petition.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
