**Case Summary**

The court is considering a motion by Defendant Frank Lobos to quash service of summons and complaint in a case filed by Plaintiff Marcela Pineda Sanchez. The Defendant argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him because the Plaintiff failed to show reasonably diligent efforts to personally serve him. The court agrees that the Plaintiff failed to properly effectuate substitute service of the summons and complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff's process server's declaration that service was accepted by "Sara Lobos" at the Residence is rebutted by evidence that Defendant's wife, Sarai Lobos, was not present at the Residence at the time of service. As a result, the motion to quash service of summons and complaint is granted. The motion to dismiss the action is denied.
