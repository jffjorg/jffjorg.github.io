Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff Joshua Johnson's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) to correct a typographical error in the case caption and to replace the misspelled name "Jorge Giraffe" with the correct name "George Graf". The judge finds that Plaintiff was not genuinely ignorant of Graf's identity at the time the complaint was filed, and that Graf's contention that Plaintiff was not genuinely ignorant of Graf's identity is not supported by the evidence. The judge also finds that Plaintiff has been dilatory in seeking to file the first amended complaint, but that Graf has not demonstrated any prejudice that would result from the amendment. The judge concludes that allowing the amendment will not cut against the policy of resolving the case on the merits, and grants the Plaintiff's motion.
