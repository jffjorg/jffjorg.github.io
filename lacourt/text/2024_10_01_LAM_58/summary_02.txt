And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant Ameriko, Inc.'s motion to enforce a settlement agreement and enter judgment against the cross-defendant Manmeet S. Sachdeva. The settlement agreement was reached between Ameriko and the plaintiff 3791 C-Store, Inc. (f/k/a Sach Stores, Inc.) on May 14, 2024, and provided for 3791 C-Store, Inc. to pay Ameriko $475,000.00 on or before July 15, 2024. The judge ruled that Sachdeva is not a party to the settlement agreement and therefore cannot be held liable for its terms. The judge also noted that the judgment entered against 3791 C-Store, Inc. in the amount of $475,000.00 cannot be enforced against Sachdeva. The judge suggested that Ameriko may request that the court reinstate its cross-complaint against Sachdeva and proceed on the guaranty, but this would require a new motion.
