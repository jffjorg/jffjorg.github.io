Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint by October 7, 2024. The plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer complaint against the defendants alleging that they failed to pay rent in the amount of $5,950.00 and failed to comply with a three-day notice to pay or quit. The defendants demurred to the complaint arguing that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge found that the complaint is properly verified and that the plaintiff has alleged an action for unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent. The judge also found that the defendants failed to show that the service of process was not effectuated and that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees and damages.
