On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff GFD
Wilcox LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this Unlawful Detainer (“UD”) Complaint against
Defendants Matthew Ludlow (“Ludlow”) and Richard Abrams (“Abrams”)
(collectively, “Defendants”). The UD Complaint alleges Defendants failed to pay
rent in the amount of $5,950.00, pursuant to a month-to-month written lease
agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant. (Compl., ¶6.) Plaintiff further
alleges Defendants failed to comply with the three-day notice to pay rent or
quit served on March 1, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶9-10.)
 
On April 15, 2024, the Court denied
Defendants Motion to Quash Service of Summons as premature. 
 
On July 9, 2024, the Court denied
Defendants Motion to Quash Service of Summons on the basis that Defendants
failed to show service of process was not effectuated. Defendants were ordered
to file an Answer by July 15, 2024. 
 
On August 2, 2024, the lawsuit was
stayed pending Defendants’ removal to federal court. 
 
On September 9, 2024, the lawsuit
was remanded to this Court with an automatic prevention of Default until
September 17, 2024. 
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant Demurrer to Complaint. On September 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
Opposition and Ex Parte Application to Advance Hearing Date on Demurrer.

 
On September 24, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application to Advance Hearing Date on
Demurrer. The hearing date on the Demurrer was advance from October 25, 2024 to
October 1, 2024, and Defendants were ordered to file and serve a Reply by
September 30, 2024. No timely reply was filed.
 
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“The primary function of a pleading
is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation],
and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be
said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica
(2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)¿¿ 
 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal
sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of
America, N.A.¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether
“the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses
a complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p.
240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿¿ 
 
 
Preliminary Issues
 
The Court notes that Defendants
state they “do not stipulate to a commissioner or judge for the time being
participating in any aspect of this matter and will submit this demurrer absent
actual appearance.” (Demurrer at 2:1-3; bold and capitalization deleted.) Defendants
cite to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1304, subdivision (c), which states
in pertinent part: “A party may give notice that he or she will not appear at a
law and motion hearing and submit the matter without an appearance unless the
court orders otherwise. The court must rule on the motion as if the party had
appeared.” (CRC, rule 3.1304, subd. (c).) To the extent Defendants attempt to
assert the filing of the instant Demurrer does not constitute a general
appearance in this lawsuit, California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1304, subdivision
(c) does not support such assertion. Per Code of Civil Procedure Section 1014,
the filing of a demurrer constitutes a general appearance in an action. 
 
The Court also notes Plaintiff
opposes the present demurrer on procedural grounds. Particularly, Plaintiff
argues the demurrer should be overruled because Defendants did not serve the
moving papers on Plaintiff’s counsel of record. (Opp’n at 4:14-19.) However,
the proof of service attached to the demurrer indicates Plaintiff’s counsel of
record, Rebecca Hufford-Cohen was electronically served with the moving papers
on September 16, 2024. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Generally, Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a) requires parties to meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or via videoconference before filing a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) This provision does not apply to unlawful detainer actions.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (d)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants Matthew Ludlow and
Richard Abrams demur to Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds that it fails to
state a cause of action and is uncertain. Specifically, Defendants argue (1) there
was no alleged attempt to personally serve the three-day notice, (2) the
complaint requests damages for a rental period for which the lease was still in
effect, (3) the complaint is not properly verified, and (4) no written
agreement providing for attorney’s fees is attached to the complaint. 
 
Verification of Complaint
 
“Section 446 of the Code of Civil
Procedure provides that ‘when a pleading is verified it must be by the
affidavit of a party, unless the parties are absent from the county where the
attorney resides, or for some cause unable to verify it, or the facts are
within the knowledge of his attorney, or other person verifying the same. When
the pleading is verified by the attorney, or any other person except one of the
parties, he must set forth in the affidavit the reasons why it is not made by one
of the parties.’ The reason given in this case for the verification of the
complaint by the agent is, that the facts are within his knowledge, and that
brings the case within the language of the section of the Code above cited. We
are therefore of the opinion that the complaint was properly verified.” (Newman
v. Bird (1882) 60 Cal. 372, 375.)
 
Like in Newman v. Bird,
Plaintiff’s authorized agent and property supervisor, George Yousefzadeh has
verified the Complaint on the basis that facts set forth therein are within his
knowledge. Therefore, the UD Complaint is properly verified. 
 
Unlawful Detainer Action
 
Generally, “[t]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of
rent ... are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that
possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment
of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day
notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has
elapsed.” (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v. Fitness Int'l, LLC, (2023) 95 Cal.
App. 5th 1032, 1045.) However, when a property is subject to the Tenant
Protection Act of 2019 under Civil Code section 1946.2, “[t]o plead a valid
unlawful detainer claim, the complaint must allege that the tenancy was
terminated for “just cause.” (Attenello v. Basilious (2022) 88 Cal. App.
5th Supp. 1, 6.)
 
The UD Complaint alleges on or
about April 12, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a written
month-to-month tenancy agreement for Defendants to rent the premises located
at  6505 West Flamingo Dr, Los Angeles, CA
90038 (“Premises”) for $5,950.00 per month. (Compl., ¶¶2, 6a-c.) The UD
Complaint alleges the written lease agreement provides for attorney fees.
(Compl., ¶15.) The UD Complaint further alleges the written agreement is not
attached because this is solely for nonpayment of rent pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1161, subdivision (2). (Compl., ¶6f.) The UD Complaint
further alleges Defendants were served with a written three-day notice to pay
or quit on March 1, 2024 by posting a copy on the Premises and mailing a copy
to Defendants at the Premises. (Compl., ¶¶9a, 10a.) The UD Complaint also
alleges Defendants failed to comply with the requirements of the three-day
notice, which expired on March 6, 2024. (Compl., ¶9b.) The UD Complaint also
alleges the tenancy is not subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 due to
exemption under Civil Code Section 1946.2, subdivision (e)(7). (Compl., ¶7a.)
 
Service of Three-Day Notice
 
Here, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges
an action for unlawful for nonpayment of rent. Code of Civil Procedure Section
1162, subdivision (a)(3) provides in pertinent part, three-day notices to pay
or quit may be served “by affixing a copy in a conspicuous place on the
property, and also delivering a copy to a person there residing, if such person
can be found; and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant
at the place where the property is situated” if a person of suitable age or
discretion there cannot be found. As shown above, the UD Complaint alleges
Plaintiff posted a copy of the three-day notice on the Premises and mailed a
copy to Defendants. The UD Complaint also alleges that a suitable person of age
or discretion could not be found at the Premises to deliver a copy of the
three-day notice. (Compl., ¶10a(3)(b).)
 
Request for Attorney’s Fees
 
As to Defendants’ argument that the
UD Complaint fails because there is no written agreement attached, which
provides for attorney’s fees requested, Plaintiff does not submit any rebuttal
arguments. However, a copy of the written lease agreement is not required where
the UD action is based solely on nonpayment of rent as alleged herein at
Paragraph 6f(2). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1166, subd. (d)(B)(iii).)
 
Request for Damages 
 
“It is well settled that damages
allowed in unlawful detainer proceedings are only those which result from
the unlawful detention and accrue during that time.” (Vasey v. California
Dance Co. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 742, 748.) Here, unlawful detention occurred
when Defendants purportedly failed to pay rent to Plaintiff. However, Plaintiff
requests damages only from the time period the three-day notice was served. As
such, the request for damages from March 1, 2024 is proper.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants
Matthew Ludlow and Richard Abrams’ Demurrer to Complaint is overruled. Defendants
are ordered to file an Answer to Complaint, no later than October 7, 2024.
