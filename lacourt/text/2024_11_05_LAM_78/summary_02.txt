And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for return of property, which is hereby taken off-calendar. The case was originally filed on October 17, 2022, by plaintiff John Brosnan against defendants RHS Surani Inc. d/b/a Popsicle Studio LA, Salima Surani, and Does 1 to 10, alleging that the defendants took property belonging to the plaintiff. The court previously ordered the dismissal of the action with prejudice on August 9, 2023, and denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal on June 11, 2024. The case remains dismissed, and the hearing on the motion for return of property is therefore taken off-calendar. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
