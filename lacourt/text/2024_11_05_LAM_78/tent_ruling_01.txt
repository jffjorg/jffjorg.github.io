BACKGROUND On April 15, 2022, plaintiff Juliana Payne (“Plaintiff”) filed her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendants Naima Richardson a.k.a. Kitty Bradshaw (“Richardson”), Christopher Valentin aka DJ Phlipz as Doe 1, Tiffany Elder aka Miss Tiffstarr the DJ as Doe 2, Marco Penta as Doe 3, Dustin Worswick aka DJ Epik as Doe 4, Timothy Everdyke aka DJ Tim Tones as Doe 5, Alva Villeta aka Deelite005 as Doe 6, Nina Mendoza as Doe 8, Lisa Weiser aka Lisa Sepassi as Doe 9, Sean Kwasi Anderson as Doe 10, Justin Green aka DJ Lowkey as Doe 11, Les Talusan Olmedo as Doe 12, Steven Hannigan a.k.a. Stevie Hannigan as Doe 13, Patrick Westgate aka Patricks Vinyl as Doe 14, Claudia Velasquez as Doe 15, Kathleen Dubrall (“Dubrall”) as Doe 16, Dave Henry aka DJ Dah Jah as Doe 17, Ryan Charles as Doe 18, and Michele Wilson as Doe 19. The complaint sets forth seven causes of action for (1) harassment, (2) invasion of privacy – false light, (3) defamation, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), (5) intentional interferences with prospective economic advantage, (6) negligence, and (7) injunctive relief. Defendants Naima Richardson, Tiffany Elder (Doe 2), Timothy Everdyke (Doe 5), Nina Mendoza (Doe 8), Les Talusan Olmedo (Doe 12), Steven Hannigan (Doe 13), Patrick Westgate (Doe 14), Claudia Velasquez (Doe 15), Dubrall (Doe 16), Dave Henry (Doe 17), Ryan Charles (Doe 18) and Michele Wilson (Doe 19) have been dismissed from the matter. On July 30, 2024, defendant Marco Penta (Doe 3) (“Penta”) filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the FAC fails to allege any cause of action against him. Plaintiff is in pro per. Any opposition was due on or before October 23, 2024; none has been filed to date.  II. LEGAL STANDARD A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (C.C.P. §438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).) “A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself. [Citation.]” (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)  “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (Citations Omitted).) The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)  III. DISCUSSION Here, the FAC’s allegations concerning false claims, harassment, and defamatory statements are all pled as conduct by Richardson. There are no specific allegations connecting any Doe defendant to Richardson’s conduct to constitute a cause of action against Penta as Doe 3. The burden is on Plaintiff to show in what manner she can amend the complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349; Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.) Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and therefore necessarily fails to meet her burden. Further, a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, Rule 8.54.) Accordingly, no leave to amend will be granted.  IV. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Penta’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend. Plaintiff’s action as to Penta is hereby dismissed.   Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 4, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
