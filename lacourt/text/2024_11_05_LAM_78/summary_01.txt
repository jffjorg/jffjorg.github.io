And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Marco Penta's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The motion was filed on July 30, 2024, and the plaintiff, Juliana Payne, did not oppose the motion. The Judge found that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to state a cause of action against Penta, and therefore, the plaintiff's action against Penta is dismissed. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff did not meet her burden to show how she could amend the complaint to state a cause of action against Penta.
