Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Nice Kicks Holdings, LLC, dismissing Isabel Rendon's complaint alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The court concludes that Rendon's allegations do not state a cause of action because she fails to allege a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and does not plead intentional discrimination. The court holds that a website cannot constitute a "place of public accommodation" under the ADA and that Rendon's allegations of intentional discrimination are insufficient. The court gives Rendon 30 days' leave to amend her complaint.
