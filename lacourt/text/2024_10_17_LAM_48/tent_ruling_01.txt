  CASE NO.: 21STCV47587
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO LIFT
  ARBITRATION STAY
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 17, 2024



 
On July 5, 2022, the Court ordered
the parties to arbitration and stayed the entire action pending the conclusion of
the arbitration.
On
September 20, 2024, Plaintiff Autumn Yancey-Estime filed a motion to lift the stay
and proceed in court because Defendant Tom Harrison waived his right to proceed
in arbitration.
In
a consumer arbitration that requires the drafting party pay certain fees and costs,
the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement if the fees
or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30
days after the due date.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(1).)  If the drafting
party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default, the consumer
may unilaterally elect to withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (b).)
A
defendant may be in material breach of the arbitration agreement even though the
delay in payment was inadvertent, brief, and did not prejudice the plaintiff.  (Espinoza v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 771.)  Section 1281.97 “statutorily defines a
material breach as a matter of law to be the failure to pay anything less than the
full amount due by the expiration of the statutory grace period.”  (Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81
Cal.App.5th 621, 644.)
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant is in material breach of the arbitration agreement by failing
to timely pay the arbitration fees.  On September
22, 2023, JAMS issued a notice of hearing and an invoice with a balance of $88,200.00,
due upon receipt.  (Horacek Decl. ¶ 4 &
Ex. A.)  Following the notice of bankruptcy
filed by former defendants Vanguard Management Group LLC and David Guc, JAMS entered
a Notice of Administrative Stay.  (Horacek
Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant did not pay the fees,
so on August 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel wrote a letter withdrawing Plaintiff
from arbitration.  (Horacek Decl. ¶ 6 &
Ex. B.)  As of September 19, 2024, the arbitration
fees remained unpaid.  (Horacek Decl. ¶ 7
& Ex. C.)
Defendant
did not file a full opposition, but he did file a declaration.  Defendant states that his former co-defendants
Vanguard Management Group LLC and David Guc filed for bankruptcy on October 20,
2023, which automatically stayed all proceedings.  (Harrison Decl. ¶ 3.)  He is “informed and believe[s] that the arbitration
hearing dates were then vacated by JAMS, the arbitration was placed on an administrative
stay and that no fees were due to be paid until 90 days before new arbitration hearing
dates were set by JAMS.”  (Harrison Decl.
¶ 3.)  According to Defendant, no fees are
due and a conference with the arbitrator is scheduled for November 4, 2024.  (Harrison Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)
It
is undisputed that Defendant failed to pay the September 22, 2023 invoice.  Vanguard Management Group LLC’s and David Guc’s
bankruptcy proceedings did not relieve Defendant from this obligation.  “Significantly, ‘the automatic stay of judicial
proceedings against a debtor in bankruptcy does not apply to nondebtor codefendants.’  [Citation.]” 
(Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973, 979.)  And regardless of any bankruptcy stay, the June
27, 2024 Status Conference Report indicated that the bankruptcy proceedings had
ended because the matters were either discharged or closed.
Because
Defendant materially breached the arbitration agreement, Plaintiff’s motion to lift
the stay and proceed in this court is GRANTED.
A
Case Management Conference is scheduled for _________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department
48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
