And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to bifurcate the trial of punitive damages. The motion was filed by Defendant California L&M Investments, Inc. and seeks to separate the trial of punitive damages from the trial of actual damages. The Judge finds that bifurcation is necessary and mandatory under the circumstances, and grants the motion. The Judge orders that the moving party give notice of the bifurcation, and that parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so. If all parties submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
