And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay and proceed in court. The Plaintiff, Autumn Yancey-Estime, argued that the Defendant, Vanguard Management Group, et al., failed to pay arbitration fees, which led to material breach of the arbitration agreement. The Defendant, Tom Harrison, claimed that the bankruptcy proceedings of former co-defendants Vanguard Management Group LLC and David Guc stayed all proceedings, including arbitration. However, the Court found that the bankruptcy proceedings did not relieve the Defendant from the obligation to pay arbitration fees. The Judge concluded that the Defendant's failure to pay the fees constitutes material breach of the arbitration agreement, allowing the Plaintiff to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court.
