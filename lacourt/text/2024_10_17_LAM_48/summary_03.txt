Summary:

The tentative ruling is on the demurrer filed by Defendants Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company and Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross to the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiff PMH Laboratory, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants violated the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and other laws by not paying full and fair value for COVID Testing and Services provided by PMH Laboratory, Inc.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged violation of the UCL, negligence, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit and goods and services rendered, but not sufficient allegations for money had and received, open book account or account stated.

The Court sustains the demurrer to the ninth cause of action (violation of Health and Safety Code section 1342.2) and the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action (money had and received, open book account or account stated) with 30 days' leave to amend. The Court overrules the demurrer to the other causes of action.
