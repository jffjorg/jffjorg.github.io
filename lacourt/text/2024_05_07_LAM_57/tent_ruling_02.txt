 Case Number:  23STCV30658    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint in this tenant’s rights action is sustained
with leave to amend as to every cause of action in the complaint. 
Plaintiff asserts
that she was a tenant of Defendants.  But
Plaintiff also says that there was no formal lease agreement between herself
and the Defendants.  From there, she says
the absence of a formal lease agreement “raises concerns about the rights and
responsibilities of both parties.”  That
does indeed raise concerns.  But the
concerns are not helpful to the Plaintiff. 
Rather, they support Defendants’ contention that the complaint is simply
too uncertain to survive their demurrer. 
Plaintiff makes no allegations in the complaint regarding her monthly
rental obligations.  Nor does she allege
what specific conditions of the premises in which she resides were allegedly
dangerous, substandard, or defective and when those conditions started.   All
told, the vagueness and uncertainty of the complaint’s allegations are so
pervasive that they render each cause of action in the complaint subject to the
demurrer.  Because it is reasonably
possible that Plaintiff can cure the pleading defects, the Court is sustaining
the demurer with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff shall file and serve an amended complaint by May 28, 2024.
The Court’s
ruling on Defendants’ demurrer renders moot heir separate motion to strike,
which is denied without prejudice.
