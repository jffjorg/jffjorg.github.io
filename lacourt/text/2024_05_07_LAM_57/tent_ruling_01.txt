  Case Number:  22STCV19730    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  57 Rescore Hollywood LLC's ("Rescore") motion for summary adjudication as to Texim's third cause of action for quantum meruit is denied.  Rescore's motion rests on the proposition that a subcontractor on a construction project  -- here, Texim -- never can have a claim for quantum meruit against the owner of the property on which the project is being constructed -- here, Rescore -- because there is no contractual privity between the subcontractor and the property owner.  Contractual privity exists only between the prime contractor and the subcontractor, one the one hand, and the prime contractor and the property owner, on the other hand.  The proposition is incorrect.   Claims for quantum meruit do not require the existence of contractual privity between the plaintiff and defendant.  No contract is necessary at all.  That is the point of quantum meruit.  (E.J. Franks Construction, Inc. v. Sahota (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1123,1127.)  The cases on which Rescore relies, Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, and  Rogers v. Whitson (1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 662, do not establish a blanket rule against prime contractors' claims for quantum meruit against a property owner.  Their holdings do not sweep that broadly.  Both of those cases involved property owners who paid their prime contractors,  who, in turn, did not pay the subcontractors.  The owners in those cases were not unjustly enriched by the provision of the prime and subcontractors' services. (In re DeLaurentis Entertainment Group, Inc. (9th Cir. 1992) 963 F.2d 1269, 1273 fn. 6 [applying California law and discussing the facts and holdings of Truestone and Rogers].) Whether the owners were unjustly enriched was critical because quantum meruit claims seek to prevent unjust enrichment. (Maglica v. Maglica (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 442, 449.)  Here in this case, there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether Rescore paid the prime contractor, Bernards Builders, with which Texim is in privity, and whether, as Texim alleges, Bernards Builders failed to pay Texim.  Thus, it cannot be determined as a matter of law on Rescore's motion for summary adjudication that there was no unjust enrichment of Rescore for which Texim cannot seek redress from Rescore on a claim for quantum meruit.
