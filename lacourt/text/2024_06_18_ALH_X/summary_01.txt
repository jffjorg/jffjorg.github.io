And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ratavous Shahverdi, et al. v. Narbeh Tovmassian, M.D., et al. The defendant, Narbeh Tovmassian, M.D., has moved for summary judgment, arguing that he did not breach the standard of care and that his actions did not cause the plaintiff's death. The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant's expert testimony is conclusory and lacks a reasoned explanation.

The judge has also denied the defendant's joinder, which would have allowed the defendant to join the motion for summary judgment with a separate motion for summary adjudication. The judge has also noted that the defendant failed to address the cause of action for lack of informed consent, which is a separate cause of action that is not dependent on the medical malpractice cause of action.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence and expert testimony presented in the case. The judge has found that the defendant's expert opinion lacks a reasoned explanation and is therefore not credible. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff must offer an expert opinion that contains a reasoned explanation for causation.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, as it will likely affect the outcome of the case and the parties' strategies moving forward.
