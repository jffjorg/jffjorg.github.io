**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Carrie J. Junisco and Lateef J. Cameron
* Defendant: Ford Motor Company and Caruso Ford Lincoln

**Summary Judgment**

* Ford Motor Company filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication

**Reasoning**

* Ford argued that the Subject Vehicle is not a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act

* The Court found that Ford failed to sufficiently distinguish the instant case from Jensen

**Additional Issues**

* Plaintiffs provided that Ford issued a new extended warranty of 36-month/36,000 mile under the "Ford ESP Program" as part of the sale of the Subject Vehicle
* The Court found that whether Ford issued new and actionable warranties creates a triable issue of material fact

**Orders**

* Plaintiffs' request for sanctions under section 128.5, subdivision (a) is DENIED
