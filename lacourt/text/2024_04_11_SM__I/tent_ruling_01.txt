  Case Number:  23SMCV00431    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  I The court is informed that, in a related case (in a
practical sense, not a technical one), the parties have reached a global
settlement.  That case includes a class
action claim, so court approval of the settlement is required.  The court is not sure what to make of
this.  If the point is that plaintiff
here is opting out of the class action, then the court will inquire as to the
effect such a decision has.  Plainly, the
motion to compel arbitration should be granted as to plaintiff’s individual
claims.  What the court does not know is
whether defendant contends that the settlement also resolves the PAGA
claims.  If plaintiff is not opting out,
then, of course, there is nothing to arbitrate. 
 
It appears that defendant is contending that the PAGA case
NOT be stayed pending arbitration, if there is one.  Plaintiff does want a stay. 
 
This is somewhat topsy-turvy.  Usually, it is the defendant moving to compel
arbitration and stay the case.  Here, it
is plaintiff’s motion and defendant does NOT want a stay.  
 
The court will discuss the matter with counsel.  It could be that the defense is essentially
conceding standing, in which case the court is unlikely to stay the matter but
would order plaintiff’s individual claim (if plaintiff is opting out of the
class) to be arbitrated.  But the court
might be missing the point.
