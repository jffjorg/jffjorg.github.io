And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration of their individual claims, while also seeking to stay the case. The defendant opposes the stay. The court notes that a related case has a global settlement, which includes a class action claim, and is seeking court approval. The court is unsure of the implications of the plaintiff opting out of the class action and whether the defendant contends that the PAGA claims are also resolved. The court will discuss the matter further with counsel.
