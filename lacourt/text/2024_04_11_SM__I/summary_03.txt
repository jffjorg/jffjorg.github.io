And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate a default judgment. The default was entered on October 4, 2023, after the defendant was served with the complaint on August 14, 2023. The Judge notes that the defendant's counsel, Browne, made a mistake in accepting the default and did not see the December 26, 2023, order to set aside the default. The Judge grants the motion to vacate the default, but conditions the order on the defendant paying the plaintiff $2475 in attorneys' fees. The Judge also warns counsel Browne to "step up his game" and pay closer attention to the case. The Judge notes that the court will set a new Case Management Conference date and get the case back on track.
