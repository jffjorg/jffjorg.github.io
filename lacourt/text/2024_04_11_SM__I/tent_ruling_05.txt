 Case Number:  24SMCV00887    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the declarations.  The court is inclined to GRANT the
application, but if plaintiff does not appear at future hearings (through
counsel or in proper person) the matter will be dismissed.  It is therefore important for counsel to
emphasize how vital it is that new counsel be retained.
