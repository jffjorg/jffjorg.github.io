 Case Number:  23SMCV04614    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  I The court continued the FSC to allow the parties to file
proper FSC papers (which ought to be joint for the most part) or to reach a
settlement at least as to possession. 
The court will discuss this with the parties to see if the case is going
to try next week or whether it should be put on the regular docket or whether
an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) should be set.  The court does not believe that new papers
were filed and therefore the parties have not complied with the court’s FSC
order.  To be clear, the court required
JOINT filings be provided.  So far,
neither party has done so and, so far as the court can tell, no real effort to
do so has been made.
 
The court hopes this is because settlement discussions were
successful.
