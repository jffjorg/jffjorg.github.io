English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23SMCV04614. The court has continued the Further Settlement Conference (FSC) to allow the parties to file proper papers or reach a settlement on possession. The court will discuss the case with the parties to determine if it will go to trial next week, be placed on the regular docket, or have an Order to Show Cause (OSC) set for dismissal or settlement. The court has not received new papers and believes the parties have not complied with the court's FSC order, which required joint filings.
