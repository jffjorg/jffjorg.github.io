Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions filed by the Plaintiff-in-Intervention, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company, to compel Leah and Elah Kesablyan, the minor plaintiffs, to appear for neurological examinations. The court finds that good cause exists to compel the examinations due to the injuries and continuing symptoms reported by the minor plaintiffs. However, the court notes that the Plaintiff-in-Intervention has not adequately specified the diagnostic tests and procedures that will be used in the examinations. The court orders the Plaintiff-in-Intervention to meet and confer with the plaintiffs and submit revised orders that comply with the applicable statutes. The court intends to finalize the orders on May 3, 2023.
