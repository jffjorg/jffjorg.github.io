Secondly, the judge denies Ouyang's request to set aside the Hearing Officer's decision, citing that the issues raised in the case are moot due to the expiration of the Eviction Moratorium. The judge also denies Ouyang's request to compel the Hearing Officer to issue a decision within the prescribed timeframe. Finally, the judge declines to decide the issues raised by Ouyang regarding the interpretation of regulations and laws.
