[1] Respondents request judicial notice of the following documents: (1) Order,
Decision of Award of the Labor Commissioner, CM-881723 (Ex. 1) and (2) the
court’s order sustaining the demurrer (Ex. 2). 
The request for Exhibit 1 is granted. 
Evid.  Code §452(c).  There is no need to judicially notice the
court’s order sustaining the demurrer; the court can always review the court
file for the pending case.

arguments regarding the courts’ backlog, cases involving undocumented parties,
allegations of Respondents seeking revenge against him, religious statements,
and criticism of the court.  For purposes
of the instant motion, these arguments were not considered.
