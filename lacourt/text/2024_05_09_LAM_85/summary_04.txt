And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two main issues. Firstly, the request for judicial notice of documents, specifically the Order, Decision of Award of the Labor Commissioner (Ex. 1), is granted. Secondly, the request to judicially notice the court's order sustaining the demurrer is denied, as the court can always review the court file for the pending case. The judge also rejects various irrelevant and improper arguments made by Richter, including claims of the court's backlog, undocumented parties, revenge allegations, religious statements, and criticism of the court.
