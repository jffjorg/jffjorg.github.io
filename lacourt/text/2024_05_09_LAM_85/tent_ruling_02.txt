[1] Respondents request
judicial notice of the following: (1) LAMC section 152.03 (Ex.1); (2) Rent
Adjustment Commission Regulations (“RAC Regulations”) sections 710.00-717.03
(Ex. 2); (3) the County’s Resolution dated January 25, 2022 (Ex. 3); and (4) a County
information bulletin regarding the expiration of eviction protections under the
COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution (Ex.4). 
Exhibits 1-3 are judicially noticed. 
Evid. Code §§ 452 (b).  Exhibit 4
is not an official act of the County and the request is denied.  See Evid. Code §452(c).  
Ouyang requests judicial notice of the following: (a) County
Tenant Protection Resolution issued January 25, 2022 (Ex. 1); LAMC sections 91.106,
152.00, 22.12-20, 22.600-606, 91.104, and 151.07 (Ex. 2); (3) RAC Regulations
710.00-717.03 (Ex. 3); and (4) County Covid-19 Tenant Protection Resolution
issued January 24, 2023 (Ex. 4).  The
requests are granted.  Evid. Code
§452(b).


[2]
Ouyang also seeks to (a) set aside the decision because portions of her
testimony are not included in the transcript because they were “inaudible”, and
(b) preclude the City from disputing the following statement of fact: the Hearing
Officer did not find that Ouyang’s documentary evidence (AR 236-300) was
submitted to him.  Mot. at 7-10.  Neither of these arguments is properly part
of a motion to augment or correct the administrative record.  They rather are arguments on the FAP’s merits
and have not been considered.
The court has ruled on Respondents’ evidentiary
objections to Ouyang’s declaration.  Many
of the objections were overruled because they dispute the evidence as complying
with CCP section 1094.5(e), which is the very matter at issue for the motion.  The clerk is directed to scan and
electronically file the court’s rulings.


[3] Four portions of Ouyang’s testimony are not audible on the audio
recording of the hearing.  AR 134:18-22,
138:23-24, 141:7-10, 163:16-18. 


[4] Four portions of Ouyang’s testimony are not audible on the audio
recording of the hearing.  In the
first inaudible portion – this is made plain in the next page of her testimony
(AR 135) -- Ouyang was rebutting Soto’s comments that the General Manager
hearing is not an appropriate venue to decide her removal of common areas and
square footage rent increase concerns. 
AR 134.    
In the second inaudible portion, Ouyang indicated that she
“was open” to a unit that was in an area covered by USC’s security service and,
after the inaudible portion, referred to the protection of her belongings from
damage or loss. AR 138.  The third
inaudible portion occurred as Ouyang was testifying about the common area and
tenants’ belongings in storage.  AR
141.  The fourth and last inaudible
portion occurred during Ouyang’s closing statement, and again occurred during a
reference to USC’s security guards.  AR
163.


[5] The Hearing Officer stated at the end of the hearing that he had
taken copious notes of the testimony and had quite a bit of documentary
evidence that had been presented before the hearing, up to and including
Ouyang’s 26-page objections.  AR
165.  


[6] Ouyang suggests
in her opening brief’s introduction that the Hearing Officer lacked the
authority to issue the decision because it was issued more than 60 days after
the September 19, 2022 service of the THP, relying on LAMC sections 151.07.A.3.f
 and 152.3.C.4.  Pet. Op. Br. at 1.  
She is
wrong.  LAMC sections 151.07.A.3.f is not
part of the Tenant Habitability Program ordinance.  IT sets forth a 45-day time limit to issue a
decision for a hearing over a rent adjustment application under the RSO and has
no application to a THP hearing.  LAMC section
152.03.C.4 does provide that a hearing officer for a THP hearing shall issue a
decision within ten days of the hearing date. 
The THP hearing was held on November 3, 2022, and the Hearing Officer
issued his decision almost two weeks late on November 30, 2022.  However, there is no remedy for a late
decision other than to compel the hearing officer to issue one.  LAMC section 152.03.C.4 provides no remedy
for a late decision and neither does the Remedies section of the THP article.  See LAMC §152.07.  See Opp. at 13-14.


[7]
Exhibits 11-14 are not in the Trial Notebook but they are in the court file.


[8] The City
notes that the Eviction Moratorium expired on March 31, 2023.  City’s RJN Ex. 4.  As such, the City argues that its legal
implications are moot.  This is not a
case in which there is a public interest sufficient to disregard the mootness
doctrine.  See Morehart v.
County of Santa Barbara, (1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 746) (a petition that is moot may still be decided if it involves an
issue of public interest that is likely to recur).  This case does not involve a situation likely
to recur as a THP is by its nature specific to the tenants.  Opp. at 8-9, 11.
Ouyang
replies that the expiration of the Eviction Moratorium does not moot the issue
that the City violated it during the pandemic. 
There is a public interest in the issue sufficient to disregard the
mootness doctrine.  Morehart v County
of Santa Barbara, (1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 746. The Resolution was an
emergency regulation that affects the well-being, the rights, health and
finance of the public at large.  It also
was a short-term legislation the violation of which generally evades judicial
review and is likely to recur.  These
circumstances warrant an exception from mootness.  Smith v. Board of Supervisors,
(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 862, 868.  Reply at
2.  The court need not address this
mootness issue.
 


[9] Ouyang contends that the City wrongly
concludes that the Hearing
Officer’s finding that the THP provides a comparable temporary unit is supported by substantial evidence.  The decision relies solely on
Landlord’s testimony: “[Landlord] went on to explain that the Appellant’s
current unit is approximately 600 square feet whereas the temporary unit is
approximately 1000 square feet.” AR 119-20. The unit on the THP has only 441
sq. ft., not 1000 square feet.  AR 4.
Thus, Landlord’s testimony was false.  Even
under the substantial evidence review, the Hearing Officer’s decision finding
of a comparable unit on the THP is not
supported by substantial evidence. 
Reply at 6-7.  This issue is moot
because Ouyang admits that she now has a 600 sq. ft. temporary unit.


            [10] The City adds (Opp. at 13)
that RAC Regulations section 716.07.1 does not require a temporary unit to have
comparable common areas.  City RJN Ex. 2.
 Ouyang contends that the City is
wrong.  RAC Regulations section 716.07.1
requires that the size of a unit be considered in deciding whether a unit is
comparable. This case involves a dormitory unit in which all housing
accommodations are in common areas except bedrooms.  The failure to consider common areas will
result in finding an untenantable unit comparable in violation of LAMC section 152.03.C.1 which requires
LAHD to determine whether the THP meet the standards set forth in Civil
Code section 1941.1.  Reply at 9-10.  The court need not decide the proper
interpretation of RAC Regulations section 16.07.1.


[11] The
parties also debate the prejudice to Ouyang if the Hearing Officer could
consider the common areas issue.  The
City argues that Ouyang did not include the lease in her initial evidentiary
submission (AR 236–300) but did so as part of her 26-page Objection, which the
Hearing Officer stated he received.  The
lease confirms that the only area for which Ouyang had exclusive possession was
her room.  Indeed, she referred to the
other spaces at the Property as common (shared) areas.  AR 140. 
Ouyang also testified and argued that she considered the common areas to
be part of her tenancy.  AR140 (“I think
the most important thing is that the THP unit or the owner of the property only
limited their consideration to my room. As I demonstrate in my evidence,
actually, the tenants have a shared space of common area.”).   
            Ouyang
replies that the City misunderstands her argument.  The lease included in Ouyang’s Objection was
submitted to dispute the terms of storage and parking in the outdated lease
submitted by the Landlord. AR 304; SAR 11, 13, 14.  She testified that the existing terms of her
tenancy provided storage.  AR
140-41.  Reply at 9.  She also testified that tenants share the
common areas. AR 140.  The Hearing
Officer found her testimony creditable. 
AR 120.  Nonetheless, her
documentary evidence was key to deciding whether the terms of her tenancy were
breached by remodeling work to convert a 26-unit dormitory into an apartment
building because it shows how the 14,820 sq ft space is distributed among the
existing 26 units and what the existing housing accommodations are.  AR 236–300. The lease does not contain such
information.  Reply at 8-9.  Again, this is an issue the court need not
decide.
