And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motions to compel the deposition of plaintiffs Anthony Chan and Le Le Aye, as well as their request for monetary sanctions. The ruling is based on the failure of the defendants to provide necessary supporting documents and to show good cause for the motions. The ruling also denies the plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The judge finds that the defendants failed to meet and confer with the plaintiffs before filing the motions, and that the defendants failed to provide a certified copy of the non-appearance of the plaintiffs. The ruling is made in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure and is intended to be a summary of the judge's tentative ruling.
