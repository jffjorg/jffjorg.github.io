BACKGROUND 
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint against Defendants for motor vehicle and general negligence arising
out of a multi-vehicle accident on September 9, 2022.  
 
On August 30, 2023, Defendants filed
their Answer.  
 
On February 23, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant two motions to compel the deposition of Plaintiffs, and request for
sanctions. On May 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated opposition, which
seeks sanctions against Defendants and their attorney of record. Defendants
filed their reply on the same day.

Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff

Defendants’ request for sanctions is DENIED.  
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.  
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (a), provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 subdivision (b)
requires that any motion under subdivision (a) set forth specific facts showing
good cause and a meet and confer declaration or, when a deponent fails to
attend the deposition, a declaration stating the moving party contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.¿ 
 
A motion to compel deposition shall be made no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b).) The record is completed once the entire inspection at
issue is finished, including the raising of objections during that process.
(See, e.g., Unzipped, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at pp. 134-136.) The
60-day timeframe is jurisdictional and if it is not met, the court is in excess
of its jurisdiction to act other than to deny the motion. (Id. at pp.
134-136; Weinstein v. Blumberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 316, 321-322 [the
failure to serve a notice of motion and motion to compel without the supporting
papers identified therein within the 60 days after the completion of the record
rendered the motion untimely].)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Defendants provide that they scheduled
the depositions of Plaintiffs for January 31, 2024. (Miller Decl. ¶ 4.)
Defendants provide that Plaintiff’s counsel notified Defendants the day before
the depositions were set to go forward that Plaintiffs would not appear at the
depositions. (Id. ¶ 6.) Defendants provide that despite attempts to meet
and confer, Plaintiffs failed to appear at the depositions, causing defense
counsel’s office to incur interpreter costs. (Id. ¶¶ 6-7.)¿ 
¿ 
Here, while Defendants provide that
Plaintiffs failed to appear at their deposition, Defendants submit a certified
copy of the non-appearance as to Plaintiff Chan only. Defendant failed to
submit the same as to Plaintiff Aye in the moving papers. Defendants
acknowledge this failure in their reply brief and submit a certified copy of
the non-appearance as to Plaintiff Aye. However, Defendants should have filed
the motion with the supporting documents. Additionally, Defendants do not
provide that they inquired about Plaintiffs’ nonappearance as required by Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b). The declaration in
support of each motion merely provides that Defendants met and conferred prior
to Plaintiffs’ failure to appear.  
 
Defendants’ motions to compel deposition
are denied, and the parties’ respective requests for sanctions are
denied.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Le Le Aye (2713) is denied.  
 
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Anthony Chan (4929) is denied.  
 
Defendants’ request for sanctions is
denied.  
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied.
