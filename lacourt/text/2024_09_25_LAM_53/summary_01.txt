And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendant Adroit Private Security, Inc. to determine that certain settlements were made in good faith. The settlements in question were entered into between Adroit and several other parties, including the plaintiff, David Dallakian, and several defendants who were sued and served as "Doe" defendants. The judge finds that Adroit has not met its burden to submit evidence permitting the court to determine that the settlements were made in good faith. Specifically, the judge notes that Adroit's motion does not set forth the ground of good faith for each settlement and did not file evidence in support of its motion. The judge also notes that Adroit did not serve a declaration in support of its motion on the parties involved. As a result, the judge denies Adroit's motion, without prejudice, and orders Adroit to give notice of this ruling.
