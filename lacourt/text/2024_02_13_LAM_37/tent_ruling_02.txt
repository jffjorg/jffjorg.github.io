Pursuant to CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5(a), counsel
for Cross-Defendants attempted to meet and confer with counsel for
Cross-Complanants but the effort were unsuccessful. (Corelius Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4,
Ex. 1.) “Any determination by the
court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to
overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet
and confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court
continues to the merits.
