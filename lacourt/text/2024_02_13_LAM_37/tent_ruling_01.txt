Background
 
This is an action for quiet title arising
in connection with various properties with APN numbers 4419-015-196,
4419-015-197, 4419-015-022 and 4419-015-026 (the “Properties”). Plaintiff
Emsaffa Corporation (“Emsaffa”) alleges that Defendants, Steven Powers, as
trustee under Amended and Restated Trust Agreement for R.E.I. 401(k) Trust
entered into December 29, 2009, and effective as of January 1, 2009 (“Powers”),
Marcos Vivian (“Vivian”) and Marquez Pacific View, LLC (“MPV”) each claim an
interest in the Properties. Emsaffa alleges that because it is the lender and
beneficiary of the Properties, it holds a Deed of Trust secured by the
Properties and now seeks to secure that interest.¿¿ 
 
Emsaffa’s Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) quiet
title; and (2) declaratory relief.¿¿ 
 
On January 20, 2021, Marquez filed a
Cross-Complaint against Emsaffa and Cross-Defendants, Ahmad M. Alomani
(“Alomani”), Vicino Limited Partnership (“Vicino”), Markab Capital Will, a
Kuwait Company (“Markab”). According to the Cross-Complaint, Cross-Defendants,
who are lenders and investors, have allegedly implemented a scheme to obtain
property owned by Marquez by preventing Marquez from redeeming on the loan,
charging usurious interest, and conducting other improper lending practices.¿¿ 
 
The Cross-Complaint alleges ten causes of action: (1)
declaratory relief as to the existence of usury and amount due on usurious
contract against Emsaffa, (2) declaratory relief as to the 18% default interest
rate against Emsaffa, (3) declaratory relief as to other amounts demanded by
Emsaffa, (4) declaratory relief as to notice of default against Emsaffa, (5)
cancellation of instrument against Emsaffa, (6) breach of contract against
Emsaffa, (7) intentional interference with prospective economic relations
against all cross-defendants, (8) intentional interference with economic
relations against Alomani and Markab, (9) fraudulent concealment against all
cross-defendants, (10) conspiracy against all cross-defendants, (11) unfair,
unlawful and fraudulent business acts and practices against all
cross-defendants.¿¿ 
 
On June 29, 2021, Emsaffa’s demurrer to the Cross-Complaint
was sustained as to the eighth cause of action. On July 29, 2021, MPV filed the
operative First Amended Cross-Complaint. (“FACC”).¿
 
On August 23, 2021, Emsaffa filed a Request for Dismissal
as to Vivian.¿¿
 
On October 1, 2021, Emsaffa filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging identical causes of action.  
 
On June 8, 2022,
Emsaffa filed its Motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, Summary
Adjudication. Defendant Powers opposed the motion. On November 8, 2022, the
court denied the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. 
 
On December 1,
2023, Cross-Defendants Ahmad M. Alomani (“Alomani) and Markab
Capital General Trading Co. SPC (“Markab”) filed a demurrer to the seventh, eighth,
ninth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action in the FACC with a motion to strike
attorneys’ fees as to Alomani and Markab and punitive damages.
Cross-Complainant MPV opposes the demurrer and motion to strike. The matter is
now before the court. 
 
demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for
Judicial Notice
 
“A recorded deed is an official act of the executive branch, of
which this court may take judicial notice.” (Ragland
v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 182, 194; see also Evid. Code, §§ 452(c), 459(a).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents
or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S.
Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
Cross-Defendants
request judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
That certain NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND
ELECTION TO SELL UNDER DEED OF TRUST, which was recorded in the official
records of the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on December 14, 2018, as
Instrument No.: 20181268882, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

 
2)     That
certain ASSIGNMENT OF DEED OF TRUST, which was recorded in the official records
of the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on October 25, 2019, as Instrument
No.: 20191147840, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. 
 
Cross-Complainant MPV objects to Cross-Defendants request
for judicial notice on the basis that Exhibit 2 is not properly authenticated
and that Exhibit B “does not bear adequate evidence of recording or that it
correlates with the original document recorded. 
 
There is no requirement that documents subject to judicial
notice “be sworn or certified before a court can take judicial notice of
the documents.” (Thayer v. Kabateck Brown Kellner
LLP (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 141, 156.)
Cross-Complainant MPV fails to explain how the above documents are reasonably
subject to dispute such that the court may not take judicial notice of these
records. (Evid. Code § 451(f).) 
 
“Where, as here, judicial
notice is requested of a legally operative document—like a contract—the
court may take notice not only of the fact of the document and its recording or
publication, but also facts that clearly derive from its legal effect.
[Citation.] Moreover, whether the fact derives
from the legal effect of a document or from a statement within the document,
the fact may be judicially noticed where, as here, the fact is not reasonably
subject to dispute.” (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 754 [italics
original].)
 
The court overrules Cross-Complainant MPV’s objections to the
request for judicial notice and grants Cross-Defendants’ request for judicial
notice. 
 
Cross-Complainant MPV requests judicial notice of the following:
 
1)    
The Court’s (Judge Burdge) June 29, 2022,
Minute Order. (See Declaration of Benjamin S. Tragish in Support of Request for
Judicial Notice, ¶ 3.)
 
A court may take judicial
notice of contents of its own records. (Dwan v. Dixon (1963) 216
Cal.App.2d 260, 265; Foster v. Gray (1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 434,
439.) 
 
Accordingly, the court grants Cross-Complainant MPV’s request for
judicial notice. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Summary of
Allegations in FACC
 
The FACC alleges that Cross-Defendant Alomani is the Chairman of
Cross-Defendant Markab. (FACC ¶ 4.) Cross-Defendant Alomani is also the Chief
Executive Officer, Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer of Plaintiff Emsaffa.
(FACC ¶ 3.) 
 
On August 5, 2015, Cross-Complainant MPV borrowed $1,600,00 from
Cross-Defendant Vicino pursuant to a Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust
(the “Promissory Note”). (FACC ¶ 10, Ex. A.) MPV asserts that the 12% interest
rate on the Promissory Note “was usurious under California law. (FACC ¶ 15, Ex.
A, ¶ 1.1.) Moreover, the Promissory Note contains an “Interest on Default”
provision of 18% that amounts to “unenforceable liquidated damages under
California law and is unconscionable.” (FACC ¶ 19.) The FACC alleges that
Streit Capital, the broker who made or arranged the loan, is the alter ego of
Vicino. (FACC ¶¶ 12, 13, 16.) Concurrently with the Promissory Note, MPV
executed a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases, Rents, Fixture Filing, and Security
Agreement (the “Deed of Trust”) on several parcels of land owned by MPV
described as APN Nos. 4419-015-196, 4419-015-197, 4419-015-022, and
4419-015-026 (the “Property”). (FACC  ¶
14, Ex.B.)
 
In 2016, Cross-Defendants Alomani and Markab purchased a
membership interest in PMV via their affiliates, the Alomani Members. (FACC ¶
33.) The FACC alleges that Alomani and Markab brokered the investments without
proper licensing from the state of California and that Alomani and Markab
represent the Alomani Members in their dealings with MPV. (FACC ¶ 34.) 
 
In August 2017, the Third Modification of the Promissory Note and
Deed of Trust was executed between MPV and Vicino, but Vicino withheld
$624,600.00 from the load and because those funds were not disbursed, it “damaged
[MPV’s] ability to develop the Property and prevented it from fulfilling its
loan obligations.” (FACC ¶ 24.) The parties
entered into a fourth loan modification on May 11, 2018, but the loan was never
recorded and the maturity date of the Promissory Note was extended to August 1,
2018. (FACC ¶ 26.) 
 
MPV was in negotiations
with Vicino regarding a modification and/or forbearance of the Promissory Note
when, in December 14, 2018, Best Alliance Foreclosure and Lien Service, Corp.
(“Best Alliance”), pursuant to instructions from Vicino, recorded a Notice of
Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust against the Property (the
“Notice of Default”), asserting that MPV had defaulted under the loan. (FACC ¶
27; Cross-Defendants RJN Ex. A.) 
 
On April 1, 2019, MPV
entered into a Forbearance Agreement, wherein Vicino agreed to forbear filing a
Notice of Trustees Sale or any other remedy under the loan documents until
October 1, 2019. (FACC ¶ 38.) During this time, MPV and Vicino continued to
discuss another modification or forbearance of the loan, negotiations of which
Alomani and Markab were aware of (FACC ¶40.) 
 
In September 2019,
Vicino stopped any further discussions with MPV about the loan because Emsaffa
informed Vicino it was interested in purchasing the Property. (FACC ¶¶ 41-44.)
On September 26, 2019, Vicino and Emsaffa entered a Letter of Intent (“LOI”)
whereby Emsaffa would purchase the loan from Vicino for $3,384,484.02, a fact
that was not disclosed to MPV. (FACC ¶ 48.) Alomani negotiated the Loan Sale
Agreement with Vicino, which consummated the purchase on or about October 3,
2019. (FACC ¶ 49.) This fact was also not disclosed to MPV. (FACC ¶ 49.)
Emsaffa recorded an Assignment of Deed of Trust of the First, Second, and Third
Modification from Vicino to Emsaffa Corp on or about October 25, 2019. (FACC ¶
52.) The FACC alleges that because the Assignment of the Deed of Trust does not
assign the Fourth Modification from Vicino to Emsaffa, Emsaffa is not the true
owner or beneficial holder of the Loan. (FACC ¶53.) 
 
The FACC alleges that in
March 2019, Alomani and Markab tried to purchase the Loan but the sale fell
through.  Then, Alomani and Marab created
Emsaffa to purchase the Property knowing that an invalid and void Notice of
Default had been recorded. (FACC ¶¶ 56, 58.) Alomani, Markab, and Emsaffa
threatened to foreclose on the loan unless PMV sold the Property at a greatly reduced
price. (FACC ¶ 59.) 
 
On November 3, 2020, MPV
offered to redeem the loan, but the itemized payoff statement included
miscellaneous charges that were unexplained, unsupported, and failed to reflect
“several hundred thousand dollars or payments.” (FACC ¶¶ 61, 62, 74.) The December
22, 2020, and December 30, 2022, payoffs also included fees and a usurious
interest rate that MPV was not required to pay under the loan. (FACC ¶¶ 65,
66.) “Emsaffa Corp.’s gamesmanship and refusal to
provide an accurate accounting of the Loan is wrongful and transparently
designed to prevent Marquez Pacific from redeeming the Loan so that Alomani and
Markab Capital can obtain a favorable purchase price for the Property either in
negotiations or at a wrongful foreclosure sale.” (FACC ¶ 67, see also ¶ 69.)
 
Cross-Defendants Alomani and Markab (hereinafter
“Cross-Defendants”) demur to the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh
causes of action as alleged against them in the Cross-Complaint on the grounds that
those causes of action fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action and it is uncertain and vague. (CCP § 430.10(e), (f).)
 
            B.        Seventh
Cause of Action - Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Relations 
 
The
tort of intentional interference with prospective economic relations is the
tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. (See Della
Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th
376, 378 [Analyzing the burden of proof and the “the elements of the tort
variously known as interference with ‘prospective economic advantage,’
‘prospective contractual relations,’ or ‘prospective economic relations’[.]”].)  Subsequently, in Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1153 and Ixchel Pharma, LLC v. Biogen, Inc. (2020) 9 Cal.5th
1130, 1141, the California Supreme Court reiterated that the correct name of
the tort was intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. 
 
To state a claim for the
tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage (IIPEA),
the claimant must allege: (1) an economic relationship between the claimant and
some third party, with the probability of future economic benefit to the
claimant; (2) the defendant or cross-defendant’s knowledge of the relationship;
(3) intentional acts on the part of the defendant or cross-defendant designed
to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5)
economic harm to the claimant proximately caused by the acts of the
defendant.¿(Marsh v. Anesthesia Services Medical Group, Inc. (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 480, 504.)
 
“[A]s our Supreme Court has said time and again, an actor’s
breach of contract, without more, is not ‘wrongful conduct’ capable of
supporting a tort [citations], including the tort of intentional interference
with a prospective economic advantage.” (Drink Tank Ventures LLC v. Real
Soda in Real Bottles, Ltd. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 528, 533.).
“[A]n act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful, that is, if it is
proscribed by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other
determinable legal standard.” (Korea Supply, supra, 29 Cal.4th at
p. 1138.) “[W]e treat[] interference with
contractual relations and interference with prospective economic advantage as two
species of the same tort. [Citation.] Each tort contained the same
elements with the exception that interference with contractual relations
required the existence of a binding contract.” (Ixchel Pharma, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1141.) 


The
FACC alleges that MPV has an existing contractual relationship with Vicino
consisting of the Loan and Forbearance Agreement and that MPV was in “negotiations
with Vicino regarding a further forbearance and/or modification of the Loan
that would have been beneficial to [MPV].” (FACC ¶ 108.) Emsaffa and
Cross-Defendants knew or should have known of MPV’s contractual relationship
with Vicino and induced Vicino to conceal the sale of the Loan to Emsaffa and
cease negotiations regarding forbearance and modification of the loan so that
MPV was unable to secure forbearance and/or modification under the loan. (FACC
¶¶ 109, 110.) Cross-Defendants acted wrongfully to conceal the sale of the Loan
to Emsaffa. (FACC ¶ 110.)
 
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer asserts that the
seventh cause of action fails to plead an independent wrongful act that
Cross-Defendants engaged in a wrongful act as “proscribed by some constitutional, statutory,
regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal standard.” (Korea Supply,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1159.) “[S]uch an act must be wrongful by some
legal measure, rather than merely a product of an improper, but lawful, purpose
or motive.” (Id, at fn. 11.) The court agrees the FACC fails to allege
how Cross-Defendants engaged in an independent wrongful act sufficient to
support a cause of action for IIPEA. The mere assertion that Cross-Defendants
acted wrongfully to conceal the sale of the Loan is insufficient to show an
independent wrongful act, because Cross-Complaint fails to explain why the
concealment by Cross-Defendants was unlawful. 
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant MPV
alleges that a UCL claim and both fraudulent and misrepresentation and
fraudulent concealment, are sufficient wrongful conduct to support an IIPEA
claim. While the court agrees that such conduct would constitute an independent
wrongful act, such allegations are conclusory and not pled in the seventh cause
of action. Facts not alleged in the pleading are presumed to not exist. (Schick v. Lerner (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327.)
Moreover, to the extent that MPV asserts that Cross-Defendants caused Vicino to
misrepresent its intentions regarding the Loan, the legal doctrine of
conspiracy may be used to impose liability on persons who do not actually
commit the tort but share with the immediate tortfeasor a common plan or design
in the preparation of the tort. (See City of Industry v. City of Fillmore (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211–212.) However, no claims of a conspiracy by
Cross-Defendant to perpetrate fraudulent misrepresentations are alleged in the
seventh cause of action to show an independent wrongful act by
Cross-Defendants. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the seventh
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            C.        Eighth Cause of Action - Intentional
Interference with Economic Relations
The
FACC alleges that Cross-Defendants intentionally interfered with MPV’s
relationship with Emsaffa by causing Emsaffa Corp. to improperly inflate that
amounts due under the Loan to force MPV to sell the Property to
Cross-Defendants at a reduced price. (FACC ¶ 114-116.) 
In
addition, Cross-Defendants knew that MPV had an existing contractual
relationship with the Alomani Members and intentionally interrupted this
relationship by requiring MPV to use over $1,000,000 of the money invested by
the Alomani members to purchase an unrelated loan from “Shata Family Holdings
Limited” at an inflated price. (FACC ¶ 120.) 
 
To state a claim for the tort of intentional interference
with prospective economic advantage (IIPEA), the claimant must allege: (1) an
economic relationship between the claimant and some third party, with the
probability of future economic benefit to the claimant; (2) the defendant or
cross-defendant’s knowledge of the relationship; (3) intentional acts on the
part of the defendant or cross-defendant designed to disrupt the relationship;
(4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5) economic harm to the
claimant proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.¿(Marsh, supra,
200 Cal.App.4th at p. 504.) 
 
Cross-Defendants again demur to the eighth cause of action on
the grounds that it fails to allege what independent wrongful act
Cross-Defendants engaged in to support an IIPEA claim. Even if the loan is
usurious, the FACC fails to allege that Cross-Defendants were responsible for
the usurious loan or induced MPV to accept a usurious loan. Similarly, with
respect to “Shata Family Holdings Limited,”
Cross-Complainant MPV fails to allege what in wrongful independent act
Cross-Defendants engaged in that related to this transaction. Cross-Complainant
also fails to explain how agreeing to this loan disrupted the contractual
relationship with the Alomani Members. 
 
Moreover,
the FACC alleges that Cross-Defendants own and control Emsaffa. (FACC ¶¶ 3, 45,
58.) The Cross-Defendants are also alleged to control the Alomani Members.
(FACC ¶¶ 33, 34.) 
“The tort duty not to interfere with the
contract falls only on strangers—interlopers who have no legitimate interest in
the scope or course of the contract's performance.” (Applied
Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503,
514 (Applied Equipment).) For this reason, a party who is not a
stranger to the contract or economic relationship cannot be held liable in tort
for conspiring to interfere with its own contract. (Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. v. Actelion Ltd. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 945, 961; Mintz v. Blue Cross of California (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 1594, 1603.) As IIPEA is part of the same tort as intentional
interference with contract rights, the Cross-Complainant cannot allege that
Cross-Defendants interfered with their own prospective economic relationships
because Cross-Defendants and Emsaffa and the Alomani Members are alleged to be
controlled and represented by Cross-Defendants. 
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant MPV
alleges that Cross-Complainants caused Emsaffa to improperly inflate the
amounts due under the loan and that this was legally and ethically wrong. (FACC
¶ 116.) However, this allegation is conclusory and devoid of facts to show how
such conduct was wrongful as “proscribed by some constitutional, statutory,
regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal standard.” (Korea Supply,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1159.)


Based on the above, the demurrer to the
eighth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            D.        Ninth Cause of Action - Fraudulent Concealment
“[T]he elements of an
action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are:(1) the defendant must
have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been
under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) Specificity “necessitates pleading
facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Id. at 631.)
 
The
FACC alleges that Cross-Defendants fraudulently concealed from MPV that (1)
they were in discussions regarding the sale of the Loan to Emsaffa, (2) that
the sale was consummated, (3), that the interest rate on the Loan was usurious,
(4) that the 18% default interest rate was inapplicable to MPV’s alleged
default, and (5) that Vicino never disbursed all the Loan Proceeds. (FACC ¶¶
123-124.) Cross-Defendants assert the ninth cause of action fails because they
owed no duty to disclose to Cross-Complainant MPV. MPV argues that a duty to
disclose may arise out of the existence of a confidential relationship, even if
there is no fiduciary duty. (See Richelle L. v. Roman Catholic
Archbishop (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 257, 272.) 
 
While
the court agrees that the existence of a confidential relationship is a
question of fact, the court finds that the FACC contains no facts that would
permit the court to conclude that a confidential relationship exists between
Cross-Defendants and MPV. The fact that Alomani Members bought
membership interests in MPV is not sufficient to support a finding that a
confidential relationship exists between the parties. Cross-Complainant MPV
fails to cite case law showing that the purchasing of a membership interest in
an entity creates a confidential relationship between the members and that
entity. 
 
“The prerequisite of a confidential relationship is
the reposing of trust and confidence by one
person in another who is cognizant of this fact.” (Vai v. Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 329, 338.) A confidential relationship also “refers to an
unequal relationship between parties in which one surrenders to the other some
degree of control because of the trust and confidence which he reposes in the
other.” (Richelle L., supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 272.) Here, there are no facts to show that MPV placed trust and
confidence in the Cross-Defendants or the Alomani Members and that they
accepted the relationship, such that a confidential relationship existed
between the parties. 
 
The demurrer to the ninth cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend.
 
            E.        Tenth Cause of Action – Conspiracy
 
“Conspiracy is not a cause of action, but
a legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who, although not actually
committing a tort themselves share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan
or design in its perpetration.” (Applied Equipment, supra, 7
Cal.App. at pp. 510-511.) “Standing alone, a conspiracy does no harm and
engenders no tort liability. It must be activated by the commission of an
actual tort.” (Id. at p. 511.) 


The Cross-Defendants’ demurrer asserts
that the tenth cause of action is not a cause of action. In City of Industry
v. City of Fillmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, the appellate court construed
“the fifth count for fraud and the tenth count for conspiracy together as a
single count for fraud.” (Id. at pp. 211-212.) The court finds that the
conspiracy cause of action must be subsumed into the applicable tort cause(s)
of action and cannot be pled independently. 
 
The demurrer to the tenth cause of action
is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
            F.        Eleventh Cause of Action – Unlawful,
Unfair, and Fraudulent Business Acts and Practices
 
Business & Professions Code § 17200 (“UCL”) prohibits
“any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50
Cal.4th 605, 610.) To plead this statutory claim, the pleadings must state with
reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the
violation. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)
 
“An unlawful business practice
or act is an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is
at the same time forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc.
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969.) “A business practice is unfair within the
meaning of the UCL if it violates established public policy or if it is
immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers
which outweighs its benefits.” (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1473.) Lastly, a fraudulent business practice claim under
section 17200 “is not based upon proof of the common law tort of deceit or
deception, but is instead premised on whether the public is likely to be
deceived.” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490,
1499.)
 
The
eleventh cause of action states that Cross-Defendants “committed acts constituting unfair, unlawful,
and fraudulent business acts and practices pursuant to Business and Professions
Code section 17200 by, among other things, (1) interfering with Marquez
Pacific’s negotiations with Vicino regarding an extension and/or modification
of the Loan, (2) brokering a business opportunity without a California real
estate license, and (3) requiring over $1,000,000 of the money the Alomani
Members purported “invested” in Plaintiff be used to purchase an unrelated loan
from “Shata Family Holdings Limited” at an inflated price.” (FACC ¶ 141.) 
 
Cross-Defendants assert that none
of the conduct Cross-Defendants allegedly engaged in is wrongful sufficient to
support a UCL claim. While the brokering of a business opportunity without a
license is wrongful, Cross-Complainant fails to allege if this conduct violates
the unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent prong of the UCL. The specificity
requirement of pleading a UCL requires that each wrongful act must be pled
under either the unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent prong of the UCL. Neither the
court nor the Cross-Defendants should have to guess under which prong of the
UCL is the conduct alleged to be wrongful. Moreover, because the demurrer has
been sustained as to the other causes of action and the UCL claim relies on
those causes of action, the demurrer to the eleventh cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
 
Cross-Defendants move to strike
the following from the FACC: 
 
1)    
All references to punitive damages as to Alomani
and Markab Capital;
2)    
Page 26, ¶ 9: “For punitive and exemplary
damages” as to Alomani and Markab Capital; 
3)    
All references to attorneys’ fees as to Alomani
and Markab Capital; and 
4)    
Page 26, ¶ 11: “For reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs” as to Alomani and Markab Capital.         
 
In their opposition,
Cross-Complainants admit that they do not pray for attorney’s fees as to
Cross-Defendant Alomani and Markab. Accordingly, the motion to strike
attorney’s fees as to Cross-Defendants is granted without leave to amend. 
 
As the demurrer to the FACC is
sustained, the motion to strike punitive damages is granted with leave to
amend. 
 
Conclusion
