And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel production of witnesses. The defendant had requested witnesses to testify on several topics, including fair market value, rates for commercial buyers, and rates paid to Medicare and Medi-Cal. The plaintiff had objected to producing witnesses on some of these topics, citing concerns about premature expert testimony, privileged information, and relevance.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel with respect to topic 1, which relates to fair market value, as the plaintiff has agreed to provide a witness to testify on this topic. The court has also denied the motion to compel with respect to topic 3, which relates to rates for commercial buyers, as the plaintiff has offered to provide a witness to testify on this topic.

The court has granted the motion to compel with respect to topic 4, which relates to rates paid to Medicare and Medi-Cal, as the plaintiff has refused to produce a witness on this topic and the information is publicly available. The court has also granted the motion to compel with respect to topics 14-17, which relate to the costs of the services provided, as the defendant has demonstrated that this information could lead to relevant evidence for the purposes of the case.

Finally, the court has granted the motion to compel with respect to topic 29, which relates to the nature and quality of the plaintiff's services, as the plaintiff's offered witness should be able to testify on this topic.
