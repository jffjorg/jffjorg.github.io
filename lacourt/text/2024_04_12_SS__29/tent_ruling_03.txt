Interrogatories (Set One)
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories (Set

Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Production (Set

Background
Plaintiff Guadalupe Mercado (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint
in this action on December 14, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence
and premises liability against 99 Cents Only Store LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 50 for injuries arising out of an alleged slop and fall at Defendant’s
store on Romana Boulevard in El Monte. 
Defendant filed an answer on January 6, 2022.
On July 10, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel
to be relieved.  Plaintiff is now
representing herself, in pro per.
As it relates to these motions, on January 6, 2023, Defendant
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Margolin Decls., ¶ 1 & Exhs. A.)  These discovery requests were properly served
on Plaintiff’s counsel, prior to the granting of the motion for counsel to be
relieved.  Plaintiff never responded to
the discovery.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
On March 13, 2024, Defendant filed these three motions to
compel initial responses to discovery. 
The motions were properly served on Plaintiff by mail at her address on
file.
Plaintiff did not file any opposition to these motions.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) on
January 6, 2023.  (Margolin Decls., ¶ 1
& Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff never served
responses.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are
DENIED.  Defendant seeks sanctions under section
2030.290, subdivision (c), section 2031.300, subdivision (c), and section
2023.030.  Section 2030.290, subdivision
(c), and section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize an award of sanctions
against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to
compel initial responses; here, no opposition was filed.  And sections 2023.030 does “not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The Court is aware
that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25,
2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including
“for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice
Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
