```

Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Numark's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff's former counsel, Jennie Levin, in part. The judge finds that Numark has shown "extremely" good cause for the deposition and has satisfied the requirements of the three-part test. The judge orders Ms. Levin to appear for her deposition and give testimony at a date and time to be arranged by counsel within 30 days of notice. The judge also orders Ms. Levin to produce documents responsive to Document Requests Nos. 1-6, as narrowed by the order. The judge denies both parties' requests for sanctions.
