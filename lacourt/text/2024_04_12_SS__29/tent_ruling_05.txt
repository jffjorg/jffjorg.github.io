 Case Number:  21STCV46280    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Deem Admitted Matters Specified in Requests for
Admission, filed by Defendants Sportsmen’s Lodge Owner, LLC and Midwood
Management Corp.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On December 20, 2021, Plaintiff Jody
Swafford (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants County of Los
Angeles (“County”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority (“LAHSA”), State of California (“State”), Sportsmen’s Lodge Owner,
LLC (“Owner”), Midwood Management Corp. (”Management”), and Does 1 through 100,
asserting causes of action for negligence, violation of Government Code sections
815.2(a) and 820(a), and dangerous condition of public property, arising out of
a slip and fall incident on March 15, 2021.
County filed its answer on July
7, 2022.  Owner and Management filed
their answer on September 9, 2022.  
City filed its answer on July 5,
2023.  On the same day, City filed a
cross-complaint against LAHSA, Owner, Management, and Roes 1 through 20. 
On December 8, 2023, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.
On January 12, 2024, Owner and Management (collectively
“Defendants”) served Plaintiff with discovery, including Requests for Admission
(Set One).  (Carpenter Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh
A.)  Defendants served Plaintiff by mail
(Id., Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶ 4.)
On February 21, 2024, Defendants filed this motion
for an order deeming admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admission.  The motion was served on
Plaintiff by mail.
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendants served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admission (Set One) on January 12, 2024. 
(Carpenter Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh A.) 
Plaintiff has not served a response. 
(Id., ¶ 4.)
Defendants need not show anything more.  Their request for a deemed admitted order is
granted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendants’ request for sanctions is granted
in part.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of this motion, as well as the economies of scale
associated with preparing multiple discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions
in the amount of $560, calculated based on two hours of attorney time
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $60
filing fee.  (Carpenter Decl., ¶ 5.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion.
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to
have admitted, as between Plaintiff and Defendants, the truth of the matters
specified in Defendants’ Requests for Admission (Set One). 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for sanctions in
part.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Defendants
in the amount of $560 within 30 days of notice of this order.
The Court ORDERS
moving parties to give notice.
