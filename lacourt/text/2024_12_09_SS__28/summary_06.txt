And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Roberto Izarraras to compel Richard Manzanares's responses to supplemental interrogatories and to award sanctions. The motion was set for hearing on December 9, 2024. Izarraras served form interrogatories, set one, on Richard Manzanares on November 14, 2023, but Richard Manzanares did not respond. Izarraras then served supplemental interrogatories on Richard Manzanares on August 21, 2024. The judge denies the motion because Izarraras did not show that Richard Manzanares served answers to the form interrogatories, and the supplemental interrogatories do not seek later-acquired information bearing on Richard Manzanares's answers to the form interrogatories.
