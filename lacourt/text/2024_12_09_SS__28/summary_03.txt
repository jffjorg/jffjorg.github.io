And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. to compel Jose Rodriguez's independent psychological examination. The motion was set for hearing on December 9, 2024, but Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing that Uber's demand for the examination does not satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310. Specifically, the demand does not specify the scope and nature of the examination, and Uber did not provide the required information. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
