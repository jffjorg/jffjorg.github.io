PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Izarraras asks
the Court to compel Richard Manzanares’s responses to supplemental
interrogatories, set one, and to award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.070 provides: 
“(a) In addition to the number of interrogatories
permitted by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a party may propound a
supplemental interrogatory to elicit any later acquired information bearing on
all answers previously made by any party in response to interrogatories. 
“(b) A party may propound a supplemental interrogatory
twice before the initial setting of a trial date, and, subject to the time
limits on discovery proceedings and motions provided in Chapter 8 (commencing
with Section 2024.010), once after the initial setting of a trial date. 
“(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), on
motion, for good cause shown, the court may grant leave to a party to propound
an additional number of supplemental interrogatories.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.070.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On November 14, 2023, Izarraras served form interrogatories, set
one, on Richard Manzanares. 
According to Izarraras, “[o]n January 4, 2024, [Richard
Manzanares] responded to Discovery Set No. One.”  (Motion p. 3.)  Izarraras
does not specify the nature of this purported response or attach a copy.  Meanwhile, the declaration attached to Izarraras’s
motion states that Richard Manzanares did not respond to form interrogatories,
set one.  (Hemati dec. ¶ 3.) 
Despite Richard Manzanares’s apparent failure to
respond to Izarraras’s form interrogatories, set one, Izarraras did not move to
compel Richard Manzanares’s responses under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290.  Instead, on August 21, 2024, Izarraras
served supplemental interrogatories on Richard Manzanares.  Izarraras has not attached a copy of the
supplemental interrogatories to his motion or described their content.  Izarraras now moves to compel Richard Manzanares’s
responses to the supplemental interrogatories. 
The Court denies the motion.  A party “may propound a supplemental
interrogatory to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers
previously made by any party in response to interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd. (a),
emphasis added.)  Here, Izarraras has not
shown that Richard Manzanares served answers to the form interrogatories.  Even if Richard Manzanares served answers to
the form interrogatories, Izarraras has not shown that the supplemental interrogatories
seek later-acquired information bearing on Richard Manzanares’s answers to the
form interrogatories. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Roberto Izarraras’s motion to compel Plaintiff Richard
Manzanares’s responses to supplemental interrogatories, set one, and for
sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
