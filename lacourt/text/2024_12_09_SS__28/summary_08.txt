And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies a petition to approve a compromise of a minor plaintiff's action, filed by the guardian ad litem and petitioner, Araseli Bucher. The petition was filed on October 23, 2024, and the hearing is set for December 9, 2024. The Court finds that the petition does not adequately account for all medical expenses, and that there is a discrepancy between the reduction figure listed in the petition and the actual reduction in medical expenses. The Court also finds that there is no documentation to support the payment of medical expenses by The Rawlings Company. Additionally, the Court determines that an attorney's fee award of 30% is reasonable, but limits the award to $150,000.00. The petition is denied, and the petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
