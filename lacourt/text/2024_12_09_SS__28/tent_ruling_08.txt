 Case Number:  22STCV32699    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules
as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 5, 2022, Plaintiff Beau Anthony Bucher (“Plaintiff”), a minor by and through
his guardian ad litem Araseli Bucher, filed this action against Defendants
Thomas Ray Allen, Amber Regina Ellis, and Does 1-50 for
strict liability, statutory liability–dog bite statute, and negligence. 
On
October 14, 2022, the Court appointed Araseli Bucher to serve as Plaintiff’s
guardian ad litem. 
On
October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
October 23, 2024, Petitioner Araseli Bucher (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action. 
The petition was set for hearing on December 9, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff
Beau Anthony Bucher. 
DISCUSSION 
The petitions provide the following information: 
Gross settlement amount:                              $500,000.00
Total medical expenses:                                 $36,882.77
Medical expenses paid:                                  $12,831.07
Reductions:                                                    $3,460.06
          To be
paid/reimbursed from proceeds:            $8,971.49
          Liens:                                                             $8,971.49
          Attorney’s
fees:                                             $166,666.66
          Costs:                                                             $2,241.61
          Net
balance:                                                   $322,120.24

 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $36,882.77.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that the total medical expenses were reduced by $3,460.06.  This should mean that the remaining amount ($33,422.71)
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition
states that only $8,971.49 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds.  This
leaves $24,451.22 in medical expenses that are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot approve a petition unless it
shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be
paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Although
Section 12a(3) states that total medical expenses were reduced by $3,460.06, Section 12b(5)(b) lists a $11,621.15 reduction by Kaiser.  Petitioner should make sure that the reduction figure in Section 12a(3) includes all reductions of medical expenses. 
The
proposed order states that $7,531.40 is to be paid to The Rawlings
Company.  The petition, however, does not
contain any letter or other paperwork from The Rawlings Company discussing its
payment of medical expenses or request for reimbursement. 
The
petition requests $166,666.66 in attorney’s fees. California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a
trial court, in determining reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's
interest in fair compensation with the protection of the interests of a minor
client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz
v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz),
quoting Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955, including counsel’s
declaration and the retainer agreement, and concludes that an attorney’s fee
award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case. 
(See Schultz, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is
no benchmark starting point for attorney fees in cases under California Rules
of Court, rule 7.955, a court may of course reasonably determine that 25
percent is an appropriate percentage in a given case”].)  Therefore, the Court will not award
attorney’s fees that exceed $150,000.00. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to
approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Beau Anthony Bucher’s action filed by Petitioner
Araseli Bucher on October 23,
2024. 
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling with the Court within five days.
