And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The case was filed by Puneh Kitchen, Jonathan Kitchen, and Jesse Kitchen against Tesla, Inc., Tesla Energy Operations, Inc., and Does 1-100 for general negligence. The defendants filed an answer, and the case has been marked by multiple failures by Plaintiffs' counsel, Thomas G. Stolpman, to appear at status conferences. As a result, the Court has imposed sanctions on Stolpman Law Group and has dismissed the case with prejudice and without prejudice.

The defendant has now filed a motion for sanctions against Stolpman Law Group, requesting an amount of $15,325.90. The Court has denied the motion, finding that, since the case has been dismissed, the Court does not have jurisdiction to award sanctions against Stolpman Law Group. The Court cites Estate of Garrett (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 831, 838, which states that a dismissal terminates an action and deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the parties.
