 Case Number:  22STCV16348    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.   BACKGROUND  On  May 17, 2022, Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Hollywood Park Land Company, LLC,  Stadco LA, LLC, and Does 1-30 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  July 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the same  defendants.  On  May 30, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Apex  Security Group, Inc. (“Apex”) as Doe 1 and GMR Event Services, LLC as Doe 2.  On  August 24, 2023, the Court dismissed GMR Event Services LLC without prejudice  at Plaintiff’s request.  On  September 7, 2023, Apex filed an answer.   On October 13, 2023, Defendants Hollywood Park Management Company, LLC  (erroneously sued as Hollywood Park Land Company, LLC) (“Hollywood Park”) and  Stadco LA, LLC (“Stadco”) filed an answer.  On  October 7, 2024, Apex filed a motion to compel responses to special  interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, and for  sanctions.  (Apex should have filed two  motions, one for each kind of interrogatory.)   The motion was set for hearing on December 6, 2024.  On November 26,  2024, Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition.  The Court continued the hearing to December 9,  2024.  Also  on October 7, 2024, Apex filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to  requests for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on December 9,  2024. On November 26, 2024, Defendants  filed a notice of non-opposition.  On  October 9, 2024, Apex, Hollywood Park, and Stadco (“Defendants”) filed a motion  to compel Plaintiff to attend a deposition and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on December 9,  2024.  On  November 26, 2024, Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition.  On December 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a late declaration  in response to Apex’s motions to compel responses to requests for production of  documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  The Court  declines to consider the late declaration.  Trial  is currently scheduled for August 4, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS            Apex asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to  Apex’s requests for production of documents, set one, special interrogatories,  set one, and form interrogatories, set one.   Apex also asks the Court to award sanctions.            Defendants ask the Court to compel Plaintiff to attend a  deposition and to award sanctions.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand            Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:          “If a party to whom a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely  response to it, the following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling  a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent  exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or  any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored  information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of  the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:          “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            C.  Party deposition  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in  part:  “(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party  to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section  2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce  for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move  for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the  production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,  or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  both of the following:  “(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice.  “(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to  attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored  information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration  stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the  nonappearance.  * * *  “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,  the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against  the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the  court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust. . . .”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).)  DISCUSSION  A.   Apex’s requests for production of documents, special  interrogatories, and form interrogatories        On July  11, 2024, Apex served requests for production of documents, set one, special  interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff.   On August 19, 2024, Apex re-sent the requests  for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories  to Plaintiff.  On August 30, 2024,  Plaintiff’s counsel’s office emailed Apex’s counsel stating, “Responses will be  served today.”  However, Plaintiff did  not serve timely responses and had not served responses by the time Apex filed  these motions on October 7, 2024.  As  noted, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a late declaration on Friday December 6,  2024, three days before the hearing scheduled for Monday December 9, 2024.  The Court declines to consider the late  declaration.  The  Court grants Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for  production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff to serve verified  code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the documents,  electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without  objections by January 8, 2025.  The  Court grants Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories,  set one, orders Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special  interrogatories without objections by January 8, 2025.  The  Court grants Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form  interrogatories, set one, orders Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant  responses to the form interrogatories without objections by January 8, 2025.  Apex  requests monetary sanctions on each motion to compel. Under Code of Civil  Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary  sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for  inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ.  Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand  for inspection].)  Plaintiff  did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a  demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of  Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for these motions.   In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17  Cal.5th 46 (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It is already  well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section  2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other applicable  sanctions provision in the [Civil Discovery] Act. A court may invoke its  independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030  only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of  abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And where it  invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally  governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp.  74-75.)  Code  of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,  subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)  the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to  interrogatories or inspection demands.   Because these statutes address this issue, the Court will not invoke its  independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,  supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 74-75.)  B.   Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition            On or about January 29, 2024, Hollywood Park noticed  Plaintiff’s deposition for February 6, 2024.  (Brinson dec. ¶ 5  & exh. B.)  Although Plaintiff did not  object to the deposition notice, Plaintiff and her counsel did not appear for the noticed deposition.  Hollywood Park took a certificate of non-appearance.  (Brinson dec. ¶¶ 6-7 & exh. C.)  Defendants’ counsel  contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to inquire about the non-appearance.  (Brinson dec., ex. D.)  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not  cooperated with efforts to reschedule the deposition.            The Court grants Defendants’ motion and orders Plaintiff to  appear for a deposition by January 8, 2025.            Defendants ask the Court to impose $4,202.15 in sanctions  on Plaintiff and her counsel, consisting of (1) $2,161.65 to compensate Apex for the fees and  costs it incurred in filing the motion, (2) $1,000.00 to Defendants “to deter  Plaintiff and her counsel from additional abuses of the discovery process,” and  (3) $1,040.50 for costs associated with Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the  February 6, 2024 deposition.            Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1), authorizes the Court to “impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party  who noticed the deposition . . . .”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)   Hollywood Park, not Apex, noticed the motion.  (See Brinson dec., exh. B.)  The Court denies Apex’s request for $2,161.65  in sanctions.  Hollywood  Park incurred $901.00 in expenses as the result of Plaintiff’s failure to  appear for the February 6, 2024 deposition.   (Hogoboom dec. ¶ 15, exh. G.)  The motion does not explain the basis for Defendants' request for an additional $139.50 in sanctions associated with Plaintiff's failure to appear at the February 6, 2024 deposition. The  Court awards Hollywood Park $901.00 in sanctions.  The  Court denies Defendants’ request to impose an additional sanction of $1,000.00  “to deter Plaintiff and her counsel from additional abuses of the discovery  process.”  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri’s responses to requests for  production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri to serve  verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for production of documents  without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored  information, and/or other things requested without objections by January 8, 2025.  The Court GRANTS Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri’s responses to special  interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri to serve  verified, code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without  objections by January 8, 2025.  The Court GRANTS Defendant Apex  Security Group, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri’s  responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri  to serve verified, code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without  objections by January 8, 2025. The Court ORDERS Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc. to pay the Court an additional $60.00 filing fee by January 8, 2025 based on the failure to file separate motions to compel responses to the special interrogatories and form interrogatories.  The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants Apex  Security Group, Inc., Hollywood Park Management  Company, LLC (erroneously sued as Hollywood Park Land Company, LLC), and  Stadco LA, LLC to compel Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri to appear at a  deposition.  The Court orders Plaintiff  Swati Vutukuri to appear for a deposition by January 8, 2025.  The Court GRANTS Defendant Hollywood  Park Management Company, LLC (erroneously sued as Hollywood Park Land Company,  LLC)’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri and her  counsel to pay Defendant Hollywood Park Management Company, LLC $901.00 by  January 8, 2025.  In all other  respects, the Court DENIES Defendants’ requests for sanctions.  Moving  parties are to give notice of the Court’s ruling.  Moving  parties are to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
