(“Defendants”) filed an answer.  On June 18, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Thomas G. Stolpman  (“Stolpman” or “Plaintiffs’ counsel”) did not appear at the final status  conference.  Based on the parties’  stipulation, the Court continued the trial and extended motion and discovery deadlines.  On September 18, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel did not  appear at the continued final status conference.  The Court ordered Stolpman  Law Group to pay $250.00 in sanctions to the Superior Court of California,  County of Los Angeles by 09/30/2024 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section  177.5 for failure to comply with the 8th Amended General Standing Order to be  ready for the final status conference pursuant to Sections 12 & 15.  On October 1, 2024, the day set for trial, Plaintiffs’  counsel phoned the Court at 8:35 a.m. saying he would not appear in the courtroom  until 9:30 a.m.  Plaintiffs’ counsel appeared  in the courtroom at 9:36 a.m. but did not have the exhibit binders.  The Court continued the trial to October 2,  2024, ordered counsel to bring all trial and exhibit binders to the courtroom  on the trial date, and ordered all counsel to appear personally in the  courtroom at 8:30 a.m.  The Court stated  that if counsel are late or fail to appear the case may be dismissed.  The Court admonished Plaintiffs’ counsel that  the case would be dismissed if he was late again.  On October 2, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendant Tesla,  Inc. with prejudice at Plaintiffs’ counsel’s request.  The Court continued the trial to October 21,  2024 because no trial courtrooms were available.  The Court repeated its admonition that if  counsel were late or failed to appear the case could be dismissed.  On October 9, 2024, Defendant Tesla Energy Operations,  Inc. (“Defendant”) filed a motion for sanctions against Plaintiffs’  counsel.  The motion asked the Court to  impose sanctions of $16,587.22 on Plaintiffs’ counsel under Code of Civil  Procedure sections 128.5 and 575.2 based on counsel’s “actions on September 18,  2024 and on October 1, 2024.”  The motion  was set for hearing on November 5, 2024.  On October 21, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel phoned the Court  at 8:30 a.m. to say he would be in the courtroom shortly.  By 9:05 a.m., Plaintiffs’ counsel had not  appeared.  The Court dismissed the case  without prejudice at Defendant’s counsel’s oral request.  On October 30, 2024, Defendant filed another motion  for sanctions against Plaintiffs’ counsel.   The motion was set for hearing on December 3, 2024.  On November 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an  opposition.  On November 22, 2024,  Defendant filed a reply.  The Court  continued the hearing to December 9, 2024.  On November 5, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s October  9, 2024 motion for sanctions based on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s failures to appear  ready for trial.  The Court awarded  Defendant $3,630.00 and ordered Plaintiffs’ counsel to pay Defendant this amount  within 30 days.  On December 2, 2024, the Court entered judgment in  favor of Defendant and against Plaintiffs.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Defendant asks the Court to impose $15,325.90 on Plaintiffs’ counsel under Code  of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 575.2 based on counsel’s October 21, 2024  actions.  Plaintiffs dispute the reasonableness of the sanctions amount which Defendant is  requesting.  DISCUSSION            “A dismissal terminates an action. [Citation.]  The dismissal of an entire action deprives  the court of subject matter jurisdiction of the matter, as well as of personal  jurisdiction over the parties.”  (Estate  of Garrett (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 831, 838 [trial court dismissed case for  failure to prosecute].)            Here, the Court has dismissed the complaint and entered  judgment against Plaintiffs.  As a  result, the Court does not appear to have jurisdiction to award sanctions  against Plaintiffs’ counsel.  At a  minimum, Defendant has not explained the basis for the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction  to award sanctions.            The Court denies the motion.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES the motion of Defendant Tesla Energy  Operations, Inc. to impose sanctions on counsel for Plaintiffs Puneh Kitchen, Jonathan Kitchen, and Jesse Kitchen  filed on October 30, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
