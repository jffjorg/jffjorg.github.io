English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains LAHSA's demurrer to the complaint, with 15 days leave to amend, as to the first cause of action (negligence) and without leave to amend as to the second cause of action (premises liability). The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to plead compliance with the Government Claims Act, which requires that any civil complaint for money or damages first be presented to and rejected by the pertinent public entity. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's cause of action for premises liability is duplicative of the general negligence cause of action and therefore fails to state a claim.
