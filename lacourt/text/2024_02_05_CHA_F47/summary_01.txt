And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Minor Yazmin Adwani v. Mariana Ashamalla. The case arises from a motor vehicle collision on April 28, 2021, in which the minor plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her mother, Jeanette Adwani, which collided with a vehicle driven by the defendant, Mariana Ashamalla. As a result of the collision, the minor plaintiff suffered injuries, including insomnia, headaches, neck pain, back pain, and chest pain. However, the minor plaintiff has since recovered from these injuries after receiving chiropractic treatment.

The parties have agreed to a settlement of $9,000.00, which will be paid by the defendant to the minor plaintiff. The settlement amount will be reduced by $1,669.00, which was previously paid by the minor plaintiff's medical providers, and the remaining $2,000 will be paid from the settlement amount. The minor plaintiff's attorney will receive a fee of $2,250.00, and the minor plaintiff will be responsible for paying $232.19 in costs.

The court has granted the petition and ordered that the settlement amount of $4,517.81 be placed in a blocked account for the minor plaintiff.
