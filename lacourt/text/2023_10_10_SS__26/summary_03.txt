Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Defendant Vicki Rider and Terry Holden's Motion to Tax Costs, granting the motion in the amount of $803.70. The judge found that the costs sought by Plaintiff Keith McComb were not reasonably necessary to the litigation and were an unreasonable amount. The judge also noted that the legislature's inclusion of a mandatory attorney's fees provision in the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not necessarily mean that a prevailing party should be awarded costs, and that the court retains discretion to deny costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033, subdivision (b)(1). The judge's decision is based on the facts of the case, including the simplicity of the fact pattern and the plaintiff's sophistication with respect to similar cases.
