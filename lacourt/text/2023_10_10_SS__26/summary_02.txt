And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Helena Yeboah's Motion to Correct Clerical Error. The First Amended Complaint, which was received by the court on October 20, 2022, is deemed filed as of that date. The judge has ordered the clerk's office to post-date the pleading. The motion was filed on July 14, 2023, after the Plaintiff's continued attempts to request default judgment were rejected. The judge has the power to correct orders by a nunc pro tunc order where there has been a clerical error, as stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). The judge has found that the clerk's office was unable to explain the delay in filing the First Amended Complaint, and has therefore deemed it filed as of the date it was received.
