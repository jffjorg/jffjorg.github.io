ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Helena Yeboah (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Crenshaw Collision Center, Inc.
(“Defendant”) on July 8, 2021. Defendant’s default was entered on September 27,
2021. Plaintiff’s request for default judgment was rejected on April 25, 2022
due to the Complaint failing to include the monetary damages sought. (Notice of
Rejection, 04/25/22.) On October 20, 2022, Plaintiff attempted to file a First
Amended Complaint, which was received by the Court but never filed. Plaintiff’s
continued attempts to request default judgment were also rejected.
 
On July 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Correct Clerical Error pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). Courts have inherent powers to correct
orders by a nunc pro tunc order where there has been clerical error by clerk or
by the judge himself, or where some provision of, or omission from, order or
judgment was due to inadvertence, or mistake of court. (Lane v. Superior
Court of Siskiyou County (1950) 98 Cal App 2d 165, 219; Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (d).) Here, the clerk’s office could not explain why the First
Amended Complaint was never filed, despite being received. (Motion, ¶3.)
Accordingly, the Court deems the First Amended Complaint received on
October  20, 2022 to be filed as of that
date and orders the clerk’s office to post-date the pleading. 
 
Conclusion
 
PLAINTIFF HELENA YEBOAH’S MOTION TO CORRECT CLERICAL ERROR
IS GRANTED. THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT RECEIVED ON OCTOBER 20, 2022 IS DEEMED
FILED AS OF THAT DATE.
