McComb v. Rider, et al.MOTION TO TAX COSTS(CRC Rule 3.1700)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendants Vicki Rider and Terry Holden’s Motion to Tax
Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $803.70. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On December 6, 2021, Plaintiff Keith McComb (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“the UCRA”) against Defendants Vicki
Rider, as Trustee Of The Marlem F. Mason And Helen A. Mason Revocable Trust
Dated June 26, 2001 FBO Vicki Rider (“Defendant Rider”) and Terry Holden As
Trustee Of The Marlem F. Mason And Helen A. Mason Revocable Trust Dated June
26, 2001 FBO Terry Holden (“Defendant Holden”) (collectively, “Defendants”). The
case came for trial on June 5, 2023, at which time the trial court entered
judgment in Plaintiff’s favor in the amount of $4,000.00. (Minute Order,
06/05/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on June 12, 2023 and a proposed
judgment on June 20, 2023. Defendant filed the instant Motion to Tax Costs on
June 21, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition on June 30, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
“Any notice of
motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service
of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period
is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost
memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) The Memorandum of Costs was served on Defendant on June
9, 2023 by mail. (Memo of Costs, filed 06/12/23, p. 11.) The instant Motion to
Tax Costs was timely filed and served 12 days later. 
 
Defendant moves to tax certain itemized costs set forth in the Memorandum
of Costs. Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth the costs
recoverable by the prevailing party. To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing
in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) In other words, the burden is first on Defendant to demonstrate
that the costs to which it is objecting were not reasonably necessary to the
litigation or were an unreasonable amount. 
 
Defendant first moves to
tax all the costs sought in the memorandum of costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033, subdivision (b)(1), which states in relevant part: 
 
(b) When a prevailing
plaintiff in a limited civil case recovers less than the amount prescribed by
law as the maximum limitation upon the jurisdiction of the small claims court,
the following shall apply:
 
(1) When the party could
have brought the action in the small claims division but did not do so, the
court may, in its discretion, allow or deny costs to the prevailing party, or
may allow costs in part in any amount as it deems proper.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1033, subd. (b)(1).) Defendant argues that Plaintiff and his counsel only filed
this action in the limited jurisdiction court, instead of the small claims court,
in order to obtain attorney’s fees, which is their true motive for bringing
this case. Defendant contends this motive is apparent from Plaintiff’s motion
for attorney’s fees, which seeks an amount well beyond the $4,000.00 judgment. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff
concedes that he could have filed this action in the small claims court but
argues that it was appropriate to file it in a court where attorney’s fees
could be sought. Plaintiff contends that the legislature’s inclusion of a mandatory
attorney’s fees provision in the UCRA reflects its desire for persons who were
discriminated against to hire attorneys and that this should guide this Court
in determining whether costs should be struck. None of the cases to which
Plaintiff cites, however, expressly discusses what value the legislature placed
on a prevailing party’s recovery of costs by making an attorney’s fee
award mandatory. (See Jankey v. Lee (2012) 55 Cal.4th 1038, 1052,
fn. 14 [pointing out that different plaintiffs might place different values on
the mandatory state rule as compared to the federal rule, under which attorney’s
fees can be denied due to special circumstances].) 
 
Nor is Plaintiff’s reliance on Almanor Lakeside Villas
Owners Association v. Carson (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 761 appropriate. The
Court of Appeal in Almanor Lakeside Villas made no finding regarding the
Court’s authority to reduce or deny attorney’s fees under Civil Code section
1033 when there is a provision for mandatory attorney’s fees. (Almanor
Lakeside Villas Owners Association v. Carson (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 761,
778-779.) A federal district court did make such a finding with respect to an
action for unpaid wages under Labor Code section 203, holding that it lacked
the discretion to deny attorney’s fees in their entirety. (Drumm v.
Morningstar, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2010) 695 F.Supp.2d 1014, 1024.) 
 
Importantly, none of these cases demonstrate that the
legislature intended for plaintiffs to bring UCRA actions worth less than
$10,000.00 in the limited jurisdiction court when they could have been filed in
the small claims court. As to the discretion to deny an award of costs under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033, the Court finds that it retains such
discretion and there is no legal authority to the contrary. Whether a plaintiff
decides to file a UCRA action in the limited jurisdiction court in order to
obtain attorney’s fees, or in the small claims court, requires them to weigh
competing interests subject to the Court’s discretion to deny costs under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033, subdivision (b)(1). These interests include
whether being represented by an attorney is even necessary to vindicate their
rights, especially in a case such as this one. This action involves a very
simple fact pattern: the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff encountered a
non-compliant toilet seat cover and grab bars in the bathroom at Defendant’s
establishment. (Compl., ¶5.) Plaintiff is also extremely sophisticated with
respect to these types of cases, having filed dozens of such actions over the
past decade, a fact of which the Court take judicial notice from its own records.
(See Cal. Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) Accordingly, the Court exercises its
discretion to deny Plaintiff an award of costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033, subdivision (b)(1). 
 
For Item 14,
electronic filing or service fees, Plaintiff argues that the Court lacks
discretion to tax these costs because they are the subject of a fee waiver and
must be awarded to the Court. (Citing Govt. Code, § 68637, subd. (b)(1).) The
question of the Court’s discretion to tax the costs does not address whether
the costs were appropriate in the first instance. Following Defendant’s
legitimate challenge, the burden is on Plaintiff to show that the costs are
proper, whether they are to be paid to Plaintiff or the Court. Neither the
memorandum of costs nor the opposition demonstrates how the $171.50 was
incurred. Therefore, the Court taxes the costs set forth in Item 14, as well.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Vicki Rider and Terry Holden’s Motion to Tax
Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $803.70.
