And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to stay proceedings or discovery pending the resolution of a criminal matter. The motion was filed by the defendants, Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, Pedro Bacio, Jr., Pedro Bacio, Jr. (d/b/a Bacio's Trucking), and Sasan Salmi, seeking to stay the civil action pending the resolution of a criminal matter related to one of the collisions. The judge found that the defendants did not demonstrate that the civil action would be prejudiced by proceeding with discovery and that the criminal matter is still in its early stages. The judge also noted that the defendants have already responded to discovery requests and that the burden of proof and evidence lies with the defendants. The judge concluded that the factors weigh against a stay and denied the motion.
