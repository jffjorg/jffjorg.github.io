And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to stay proceedings or discovery pending the resolution of a criminal matter. The motion was filed by the defendants, Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, Pedro Bacio, Jr., Pedro Bacio, Jr. (d/b/a Bacio's Trucking), and Sasan Salmi, seeking to stay the civil action pending the resolution of a criminal matter related to one of the collisions. The judge found that the defendants did not demonstrate that the civil action would be prejudiced by proceeding with discovery and that the criminal matter is still in its early stages. The judge also noted that the defendants have already responded to discovery requests and that the burden of proof and evidence lies with the defendants. The judge concluded that the factors weigh against a stay and denied the motion.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case:** 21STCV38168

**Plaintiffs:** Alexis Bell, Latiffany Draper, Harmony Ellis, Latiffany Ellis

**Defendants:** Sasan Salmi, Kayhan Salmi, Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, Pedro Bacio, Jr., Pedro Bacio, Jr. d/b/a Bacioâ€™s Trucking

**Date:** October 2, 2023

**Hearing:** Motion to Stay Proceedings or Alternatively Stay Discovery

**Summary:**

This case involves two separate motor vehicle collisions. 

* **Collision 1:** On November 26, 2019, Plaintiffs Alexis Bell, Latiffany Draper, Harmony Ellis, and Latiffany Ellis were involved in a collision with Defendants Sasan Salmi and Kayhan Salmi.
* **Collision 2:** On October 14, 2022, Plaintiff Alexis Bell was involved in a collision with Defendant Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, while driving a semi-truck.

The two cases were consolidated. Defendant Barboza is currently facing criminal charges in Kern County Superior Court related to the second collision. He has asked the court to stay proceedings in the civil case, or at least stay discovery related to him, until the criminal case is resolved.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

The judge denied the motion because:

* **Insufficient Evidence:** Defendants did not provide enough information about the criminal case, including the nature of the charges or the potential length of the proceedings. They also did not demonstrate how Barboza's Fifth Amendment rights would be implicated by responding to discovery. 
* **Delay:** A stay would significantly delay the civil case, preventing Plaintiffs from pursuing justice and potential compensation for their injuries.
* **Prior Discovery:** Barboza had already responded to written discovery in the civil case, including questions about alcohol consumption before the second collision. This suggests he may not be compelled to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in future discovery.

**Important Points:**

* The judge emphasized that defendants do not have an absolute right to a stay simply because a related criminal case is pending.
* The court is open to reconsidering the motion if defendants provide more specific information about the criminal case and how Barboza's rights would be implicated.

**Overall:** The judge found that the arguments in favor of a stay were not persuasive and that the potential harm to Plaintiffs from a delay outweighed the benefits.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to stay proceedings or discovery pending the resolution of the criminal matter in Kern County. The case involves two separate motor vehicle collisions that occurred in Los Angeles County, and the Plaintiffs are seeking damages for their injuries. The Defendant, Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, has a pending criminal matter in Kern County related to one of the collisions.

The Judge has also considered the other factors set forth in Avant! and Keating, including the extent to which the party seeking the stay's Fifth Amendment rights are implicated, the interest of the party opposing the stay in proceeding expeditiously with the litigation, the burden which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the party seeking the stay, the convenience of the Court in the management of its cases, and the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation.

Ultimately, the Judge has determined that the factors weigh against a stay, and the motion to stay proceedings or discovery is denied. The parties are ordered to give notice of the ruling.

English text:
This is a summary of the tentative ruling in case number 21STCV38168, scheduled for hearing on October 2, 2023 in department 31 of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles - Central District. The case involves Plaintiffs Alexis Bell, Latiffany Draper, Harmony Ellis, and Latiffany Ellis, and Defendants Sasan Salmi, Kayhan Salmi, Jesus Alejandro Rosas Barboza, and Pedro Bacio, Jr., doing business as Bacioâ€™s Trucking. The matter concerns two motor vehicle collisions that occurred on November 26, 2019 and October 14, 2022 in Los Angeles County.

On May 13, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint against Defendants Salmi and Salmi for injuries arising from the first accident. On October 27, 2022, Plaintiff Bell filed a Complaint against Defendants Barboza, Bacio, Jr., and Bacioâ€™s Trucking for injuries arising from the second accident. On February 24, 2023, the two actions were deemed related, and on March 24, 2023, the parties stipulated to consolidate the two actions.

On July 10, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion to stay proceedings or in the alternative to stay discovery proceedings against Barboza. Defendants argue that a stay is necessary because Barboza is a defendant in a criminal matter pending before Kern County Superior Court (LM125521A) and Los Angeles County Superior Court (MA084719) that arises out of the same incident as alleged in Plaintiff Bellâ€™s civil action. However, the Court notes that after the filing of the instant motion, the matter was disposed of in Los Angeles County on August 10, 2023, wherein Barboza was sentenced to 16 months state prison.

The Court will determine whether a stay is appropriate using the factors set forth in Avant! and Keating. The factors considered include the extent to which the party seeking the stay's Fifth Amendment rights are implicated, the interest of the party opposing the stay in proceeding expeditiously with this litigation or any particular aspect of it, the burden which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the party seeking the stay, the convenience of the Court in the management of its cases, the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation, and the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal litigation.

The Court finds that the factors, overall, weigh against a stay. Defendants have not sufficiently demonstrated that Barbozaâ€™s Fifth Amendment rights would be implicated or that there is a basis to assert the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, a stay would significantly delay litigation in this matter and delay the potential recovery of Plaintiff Bell and the other named Plaintiffs in this consolidated action. Therefore, Defendantsâ€™ motion for a stay of proceedings or alternatively to stay discovery against Barboza is DENIED.
