## English Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a request for default judgment against Defendant Aric Cho in a case brought by Plaintiff Kye Hyun Lee.  

The lawsuit alleges assault and battery by Cho, resulting in injuries to Lee's eye, shoulder, and arm, as well as emotional distress. While Lee originally sought $55,487.60 in damages, the Judge is only prepared to grant $19,072.60 due to insufficient evidence supporting the full amount requested.

Specifically, the Judge reduced Lee's general damages request from $50,000 to $13,719 because there was no evidence to substantiate claims of permanent eye damage, trauma, or depression. The Judge also noted the importance of having a properly signed document related to the default judgment request. 


If the Plaintiff provides the required documentation, the default judgment will be finalized.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kye Hyun Lee vs. Aric Cho, et al. The Plaintiff, Kye Hyun Lee, is seeking a default judgment against the Defendant, Aric Cho, in the amount of $55,487.60. However, the Judge has conditionally granted the request for default judgment in the amount of $19,072.60, which includes $18,292 in principal damages and $780.60 in costs. The Judge reduced the Plaintiff's request for general damages from $50,000 to $13,719 due to the lack of supporting documentation. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the Plaintiff's statement of damages provides that medical expenses amount to $4,573, and the Court may only grant medical expenses up to this maximum amount. Additionally, the Judge notes that courts may not award speculative damages, and therefore reduces the Plaintiff's request for general damages. The ruling is conditional upon the filing of a properly signed document.
