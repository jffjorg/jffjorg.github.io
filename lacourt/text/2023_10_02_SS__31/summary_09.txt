And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Kye Hyun Lee, in the amount of $19,072.60 against defendant Aric Cho. The plaintiff is seeking damages for negligence, battery, and assault, and has obtained Cho's default. The judge has reduced the plaintiff's request for general damages from $50,000 to $13,719 due to the lack of supporting documentation. The plaintiff is also seeking costs of $780.60, which the judge has granted. The request for default judgment is conditionally granted, and will be effective once the properly signed document is filed.
