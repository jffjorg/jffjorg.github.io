And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from November 16, 2023 to a date in September 2024 or thereafter. The court finds good cause to continue the trial date to allow the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition to be heard and to provide sufficient time for discovery prior to trial. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the court notes that this is the first request for a trial continuance. The court will continue the November 2, 2023 Final Status Conference and all related dates to reflect the new trial date.
