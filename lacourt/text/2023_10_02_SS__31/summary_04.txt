## English Summary

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Zaydell Falk's motion to set aside the dismissal of her case against Defendant Enrique Caballero. 

The case was dismissed without prejudice back in August 2022 because neither party appeared for a scheduled trial. Plaintiff's attorney argues that the missed trial date was due to a calendaring error and that this constitutes excusable neglect.

The Court agrees with the attorney's argument and finds that the dismissal was the result of a reasonable mistake. Therefore, the dismissal is vacated, and the case is reinstated.

The complaint was dismissed on August 25, 2022, after no appearances were made by or for either party. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal on November 28, 2022, citing excusable neglect due to a calendaring issue on the part of the plaintiff's counsel.

**Summary:**

The Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District, grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case filed against the Defendant for damages arising from a motor vehicle incident. The Judge bases the decision on the Plaintiff's counsel's affidavit that the non-jury trial date was not correctly entered into Counsel's calendar, which the Judge considers as excusable neglect. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff filed the motion within six months of the dismissal and establishes that the dismissal was the result of Counsel's neglect for failure to appear due to a calendaring issue. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. The Judge may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing.
