And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the non-jury trial date was not correctly entered into their calendar, and they relied on an employee or calendaring system to calendar deadlines, which failed. The judge finds that this is excusable neglect and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice. The judge has set a hearing date of October 2, 2023, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
