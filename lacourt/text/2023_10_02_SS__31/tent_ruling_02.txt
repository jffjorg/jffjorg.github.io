 Case Number:  20STCV28471    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/02/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV28471 CENTURY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY vs JONATHAN J RIOS, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Jonathan J. Rios; and Maria Luisa Rios Selva RECOMMENDATION:  DENY   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the amount it paid for its insured’s damages in the principal amount of $33,657.74 in this subrogation claim against Defendants Jonathan J. Rios (“Rios”) and Maria Luisa Rios Selva (“Selva”). Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $484.   The request for default judgment submitted on June 23, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Plaintiff declares that Rios was the driver of the vehicle, and Selva was the owner of the vehicle. Plaintiff may not seek damages against Rios and Selva jointly and severally for the amount of $34,190.74, because defendants are necessarily not equally responsible for the damages. Per Vehicle Code §17151(a), the owner of the automobile’s liability is limited to $5,000 for property damage and $15,000 for injury to one person. The exact amount sought against Selva is unclear.   Plaintiff’s proposed judgment against both Rios and Selva must notate on JUD-100, item 7, specifically limiting Selva’s liability to no more than permissible per Vehicle Code § 17151. Plaintiff must specify the amount sought against Selva within the limitations of Vehicle Code § 17151, and Plaintiff may recover the remainder of the judgment sought against Rios, the driver.  Plaintiff must file all new documents with the above defects cured at Plaintiff’s earliest convenience.  No later than __________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _______________.   Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
