And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by BJ's Restaurants, Inc. against Duwan Norris. The case involves a slip and fall incident on the defendant's property, and a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) was granted in favor of the defendant. Norris filed a motion for new trial, which was denied. The defendant argues that the motion for new trial was frivolous and made in bad faith, and seeks sanctions in the amount of $6,675 for attorneys' fees and costs incurred in opposing the motion for new trial. The Judge finds that while the motion for new trial was unsuccessful, it was not made in bad faith, and therefore denies the motion for sanctions. The Judge also notes that the primary purpose of section 128.7 is to deter filing abuses, and not to compensate those impacted by those abuses.
