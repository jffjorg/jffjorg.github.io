As for the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion for sanctions, which was filed in response to Plaintiff's allegedly frivolous motion for new trial. The Judge denies the motion, finding that Plaintiff's attempt to relitigate the Court's grant of Defendant's motion for summary judgment was not necessarily made in bad faith. The Judge notes that Plaintiff's motion for new trial was not entirely without merit, and that the primary purpose of Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7 is to deter filing abuses, rather than to compensate those impacted by them. The Judge also finds that Defendant combined two separate motions into one, which is improper. As a result, the Judge declines to issue sanctions either under section 128.5 or section 128.7.
