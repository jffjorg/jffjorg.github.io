And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial date in a premises liability lawsuit brought by Nancy Monteros against Albertsons Companies, Inc. and others. The defendant has requested a continuance to April 12, 2024 or a later date due to the plaintiff's delay in serving discovery responses and the need for additional discovery time. The parties have stipulated to continue the trial, but the initial request was rejected because it was beyond 24 months after the filing of the complaint. The judge has found good cause to continue the trial date to allow the parties sufficient time to conduct and complete discovery prior to trial. The October 16, 2023 trial date is continued to a later date to be determined, and all discovery and expert cutoff dates are continued to reflect the new trial date.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial date. The case, filed by Nancy Monteros against Albertsons Companies, Inc., was initially set for trial on October 16, 2023. However, the defendant has requested a continuance due to the plaintiff's delay in serving discovery responses, which has hindered the defendant's ability to complete discovery and prepare for trial. The judge has found good cause to continue the trial date, citing the need for the parties to complete discovery and the fact that this is the first request for a trial continuance. The new trial date has been set for April 12, 2024, or a later date. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and the court may adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court if no objections are filed.
