And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Dwayne Lamont Brown, due to the plaintiff's failure to use the required CIV-100 form in their submission. The plaintiff was previously denied a default judgment on April 17, 2023, and submitted a new package on September 15, 2023. The judge is unable to locate the CIV-100 form, which is mandatory according to California Rules of Court 3.1800(a). The plaintiff is given a deadline to correct these defects and resubmit their package. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary penalties and/or dismissal. The OSC (Order to Show Cause) for entry of default judgment is continued to a future date.
