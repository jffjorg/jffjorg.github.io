## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Jonathan J. Rios and Maria Luisa Rios Selva. The plaintiff is seeking reimbursement for damages paid to its insured. 

The judge's reasoning is that the plaintiff cannot seek joint and several liability against both defendants for the full amount requested, as Vehicle Code §17151(a) limits the owner's liability to $5,000 for property damage and $15,000 for injury to one person. The exact amount sought against Selva is unclear. 

The plaintiff must revise its default judgment request to specify the amount sought against Selva within the statutory limits and to clearly indicate Selva's liability is limited to that amount. The plaintiff has been ordered to submit a corrected default judgment package by a specified date, failure to do so may result in sanctions.
