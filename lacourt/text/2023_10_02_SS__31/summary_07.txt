Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the complaint filed by Jason Gray, alleging that the City of Rancho Palos Verdes, ET AL. was responsible for his injuries sustained on September 26, 2020. The City of Rancho Palos Verdes, ET AL. has filed a demurrer, arguing that the claim was not timely presented to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, a public entity that was also involved in the incident. The Judge has found that the complaint does not demonstrate compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements, and therefore sustains the demurrer. The Judge grants the plaintiff twenty (20) days to amend the complaint to include the required information.

English summary:

The case number is 21STCV17331, and the hearing is scheduled for October 2, 2023, in the Superior Court of the State of California, Central District, Los Angeles County, Dept. 31. The plaintiff, Jason Gray, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Gregory Gray, filed an action against the defendants, City of Rancho Palos Verdes, City of Rolling Hills Estates, and Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, for injuries related to riding his bike on a sidewalk. The underlying incident occurred on September 26, 2020. On May 7, 2021, Plaintiff filed the complaint, and on June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint. On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff presented a Government Claim form to the District. The District demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint, arguing that Plaintiff did not timely present a government claim to the District in accordance with the Government Claims Act. Plaintiff opposes the motion and requests leave to file a First Amended Complaint.

The District contends that Plaintiff did not present a claim within six months of the accrual of the action, nor did Plaintiff present a late claim application to the District at any time. Furthermore, the time period to present a late claim application has expired because it has been more than one year after the accrual of Plaintiff’s action. Plaintiff filed a claim for damages with the District on May 2, 2023, after Defendant Rancho Palos Verdes sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel alleging that the subject sidewalk was within the control and jurisdiction of the District. Plaintiff argues his claim is timely because his claim was made within 180 days from the time period that Plaintiff discovered the information. Plaintiff requests leave to file a First Amended Complaint to plead compliance with the claim presentation requirement as to the District.

The court found that the district has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement prior to filing the demurrer. The court sustained the District’s demurrer on the grounds of failure to allege facts in the complaint demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements and granted 20 days leave to amend. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
