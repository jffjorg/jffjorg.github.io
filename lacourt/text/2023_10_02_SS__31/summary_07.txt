The City of Rancho Palos Verdes, ET AL. has filed a demurrer, arguing that the claim was not timely presented to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, a public entity that was also involved in the incident. The Judge has found that the complaint does not demonstrate compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements, and therefore sustains the demurrer. The Judge grants the plaintiff twenty (20) days to amend the complaint to include the required information.
