And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice defendant Nancy Rodriguez's motions to compel plaintiff Ada Mazariegos to serve responses to interrogatories and request for production of documents. The defendant did not comply with California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 1005, which requires that all moving and supporting papers be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The defendant filed and served the motions on September 8, 2023, which is only 16 court days before the hearing on October 2, 2023. The judge notes that the defendant should have filed and served the motions by September 6, 2023, to account for the method of service by electronic mail. The judge orders the defendant to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must email the court with specific information.
