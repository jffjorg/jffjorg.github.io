English text:
This tentative ruling pertains to Case Number 20STCV08021, scheduled for a hearing on October 2, 2023, in Department 31 of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles - Central District. The plaintiffs are Ada Mazariegos and others, and the defendants are Nancy Rodriguez and others.

On March 31, 2023, defendant Nancy Rodriguez propounded form interrogatories and request for production of documents on plaintiff Ada Mazariegos. After granting Mazariegos an extension to serve responses, Rodriguez claims that Mazariegos has not served any responses. However, plaintiff did not oppose the motion.

The court notes that Rodriguez's motions to compel were filed on September 8, 2023, which is exactly 16 court days from the hearing set for October 2, 2023. Rodriguez served the moving papers on Plaintiffs’ counsel by electronic mail on September 8, 2023. According to CCP § 1005, all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. Therefore, the motion should have been filed and served by at least September 6, 2023 or earlier, to account for the method of service.

Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied without prejudice for failure to comply with CCP § 1005. The moving defendant is ordered to give notice.

The court is not available to hear oral argument on this date. If the parties do not submit on the tentative and want oral argument, the hearing will have to be continued, and the parties must work with the clerk to find an available date for the continuance. Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement.

If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court at sscdept31@lacourt.org with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number. The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.

Unless all parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument. The court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave. After the court has issued a tentative ruling, the court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
