Background On May 7, 2021, Plaintiff Jason Gray, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Gregory Gray (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants City of Rancho Palos Verdes and City of Rolling Hills Estates, for injuries related to Plaintiff riding his bike on a sidewalk. The underlying incident occurred on September 26, 2020.  As relevant to this proceeding, on June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint naming Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District (“District”) as Doe 1. The District, a public entity, now demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint, arguing that Plaintiff did not timely present a government claim to the District in accordance with the Government Claims Act. Plaintiff opposes the motion, and the District filed a reply.   Moving Argument  The District contends Plaintiff’s counsel presented a Government Claim form to the district on May 2, 2023. After, on June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint naming the District as Doe 1. The District argues that Plaintiff did not present a claim within six months of the accrual of the action, nor did Plaintiff present a late claim application to the District at any time. Furthermore, the time period to present a late claim application has expired because it has been more than one year after the accrual of Plaintiff’s action.  b. Opposing Argument Plaintiff filed a claim for damages with the District on May 2, 2023, after Defendant Rancho Palos Verdes sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel alleging that the subject sidewalk was within the control and jurisdiction of the District. Plaintiff argues his claim is timely because his claim was made within 180 days from the time period that Plaintiff discovered the information. Plaintiff requests leave to file a First Amended Complaint to plead compliance with he claim presentation requirement as to the District.  c. Reply Argument The District argues Plaintiff ignores the procedural claims presentation requirement, which is a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action against it. Plaintiff only offered proof that he presented timely government claims to Defendants Rancho Palos Verdes and City of Rolling Hills Estates, but not to the District. Defendants are each separate and distinct public entities.   II. Demurrer A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) “Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.) In ruling upon demurrers, judges “consider matters shown in exhibits attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference.”  (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American Homes of California, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 659, 665.) “[A] pleading valid on its face may nevertheless be subject to demurrer when matters judicially noticed by the court render the complaint meritless.”  (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604.) Courts will not consider affidavits filed in opposition to a demurrer, but only the pleading and judicially noticeable matters.  (Knickerbocker v. City of Stockton (1988) 199 Cal. App. 3d 235, 239.)  Meet and Confer  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), before filing a demurrer, the objecting party shall meet and confer with the opposing party for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the objections to the pleading. The meet and confer shall be completed at least five (5) days before the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) The meeting and conferring party is required to “identify all of the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with legal support the basis of the deficiencies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(1).) The meet and confer shall be by telephone or in person. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds the district has fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Decl. Herrera ¶ 10-11.)  Analysis Government Code § 945.5 provides, “No suit for damages may be maintained against a public entity unless the claim has been presented to it.” Further, California Government Code § 911.2(a) states, “[a] claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property or growing crops shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915) not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.” Upon presentation of the claim, the entity may: 1) approve the claim, (2) reject the claim, (3) give notice the claim is insufficient, or (4) do nothing. (Gov. Code § 912.6.) If the public entity sends proper written notice of the rejection, plaintiff has six months thereafter to file suit against the entity. (Gov. Code § 945.6, subd. (a)(1); see Gov. Code §§ 912.6, 912.8.) If the public entity fails to send proper written notice of the rejection, plaintiff has two years from the accrual of the cause of action to file suit against the entity. (Gov. Code § 945.6, subd. (a)(2).) “The Tort Claims Act requires that any civil complaint for money or damages first be presented to and rejected by the pertinent public entity [Citation]. The act creates a bond between the administrative claim and the judicial complaint. Each theory of recovery against the public entity must have been reflected in a timely claim. In addition, the factual circumstances set forth in the claim must correspond with the facts alleged in the complaint.”  (Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.) “A public entity cannot be sued for tort unless (1) a timely written claim has previously been presented to the governmental entity, (2) any late claim has been presented to the public entity and been excused by it or the court, or (3) conditions described by Government Code section 946.4 … have been met.”  (Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. County of Santa Clara (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 483.)   “The failure to timely present a proper claim … bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity. [Citation.]”  (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.)  Thus, “[e]ven if the public entity has actual knowledge of facts that might support a claim, the claims statutes still must be satisfied. [Citation.]”  (DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012) 55 Cal.4th 983, 990.)  “The filing of a claim is a condition precedent to the maintenance of any cause of action against the public entity and is therefore an element that a plaintiff is required to prove in order to prevail.”  (Del Real v. City of Riverside (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 761, 767.)    Failure to allege facts in the complaint demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements subjects the complaint to a general demurrer. (State of Calif. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239; see also V.C. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 499, 509 [affirming trial court decision to sustain demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that plaintiff’s failure to timely comply with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act barred her action].) A plaintiff must comply with the claim presentation requirements even if the entity has actual knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim. (City of San Jose v. Sup. Ct. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 455.)   Here, the Complaint provides that Plaintiff filed a timely claim with Defendants City of Rancho Palos Verdes and City of Rolling Hills Estates, and the Complaint attached as exhibits the claims presented to these defendants. Because an amendment to complaint was filed to name the District as Doe 1, there are no allegations or attachments to the Complaint demonstrating compliance with the presentment claim pertinent to the District. The timely presentation of a claim under the Tort Claims Act is not merely a procedural requirement but is an actual “element of the plaintiff's cause of action.” (Creighton v. City of Livingston (2009) 628 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1225.) On these grounds alone, the District’s demurrer is sustained. A demurrer may be sustained without leave to amend when an amendment would be futile. (Long v. Century Indemnity Co. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1460, 1468.) Presentation of the damages claim must be within six months of the claim’s accrual, and a late claim must be presented within a reasonable time to not exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action; when an application to file a late claim is itself not timely filed, a court is without jurisdiction to grant relief. (Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Superior Ct. (Crystal B., Steven G., Anita G.) (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1303, 1314.) Plaintiff concedes that he did not present a claim to the District until May 2, 2023, over two and a half years after the accrual of the action. Counsel for the District provides a copy of Plaintiff’s May 2, 2023 claim to the District as an attachment to his declaration. (Decl. Kocaj, Exh. J.) However, on a demurrer, the Court is limited to the face of the complaint and matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice. (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.) “‘[D]efendants cannot set forth allegations of fact in their demurrers which, if true, would defeat plaintiff's complaint.’” (Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1144.) The District did not move to judicially notice Plaintiff’s filed claim with the District.   Based on the foregoing, the Court sustains the District’s demurrer on the grounds of failure to allege facts in the complaint demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements.   The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted twenty (20) days leave to amend.¿  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: The Court is not available to hear oral argument on this date.  If the parties do not submit on the tentative and want oral argument, the hearing will have to be continued, and the parties must work with the clerk to find an available date for the continuance. Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 29th day of September 2023      Hon.
