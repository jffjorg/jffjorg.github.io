The original hearing was scheduled for March 12, 2024, but was continued due to a defect in the publication of the Order to Show Cause. The court does not reflect that the defect was corrected, so the hearing is continued to June 14, 2024. Prior to the new hearing date, the petitioner must comply with the publication requirements.
