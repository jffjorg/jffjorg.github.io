And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Burbank and La Cienega, LLC's (BLC) motion for reconsideration of the court's previous denial of BLC's motion to compel arbitration. The court found that BLC failed to carry its burden of proving that the lease agreement between the parties involves interstate commerce, which is necessary to trigger Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preemption. The court also denied Cadlac, Inc.'s motion to compel the deposition of Alex Cohen, finding that the notice of deposition was technically flawed due to the incorrect name of the person to be deposed. The court declined to impose sanctions against Cadlac and its counsel.
