  Case Number:  20STCV15846    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  57 JURY INSTRUCTIONS The following reflects the Court's decision on the proposed jury instructions that Plaintiffs submitted last week.Upfront, the Court makes four observations.  First, the Plaintiffs did not include CACI 450A --Good Samaritan Non Emergency and 450C -- Negligent Undertaking.  The Plaintiffs previously had urged through pocket briefs that both of these instructions be given.   Because it appears that the Plaintiffs have withdrawn their request that these two instructions be given, the Court will not give them. Second, it would appear that CACI 3800 - Comparative Fault Between And Among Tortfeasors -- should be given because this instruction covers indemnity claims and the Defendant County of Los Angeles has a cross-complaint for indemnity against Cristian Gonzalez Valdez.Third, the County had requested that the Court give the County's proposed special instruction on duty arising from a special relationship.  The Court is declining to give this instruction.  Duty, including whether a special relationship creates a duty on a law enforcement agency, is a legal question for the Court.  It is not a question for the jury.  The County failed to move for summary judgment on the existence of a special relationship.  Nor has the County moved for a directed verdict on the issue.   Based on the evidence at trial, the Court concludes that the County owed a duty to the Plaintiffs because the Sheriff's Department created a special relationship with the Plaintiffs (and others at the scene of the incident giving rise to the Plaintiffs' suit) when Deputies assumed control of directing traffic at the intersection of Arizona and Whittier on the night of July 7, 2019 without shutting off the traffic lights at the intersection.  Fourth, if Defendant wants the Court to give an instruction on negligence per se, based on the notion that Carlos Turcios violated the basic speed law statute when driving through the intersection, then the Defendant's counsel must request it and draft it.Instructions in Plaintiffs' Proposed Set That Will Be Given200  Obligation to Prove -- More Likely True Than Not True202  Direct and Indirect Evidence 203  Party Having Power to Produce Better Evidence204   Willful Suppression of Evidence 205    Failure to Explain  or Deny Evidence208     Deposition as Substantive Evidence 209    Use of Interrogatories of a Party212      Statement of a Party Opponent217  Evidence of Settlement 219  Expert Witness Testimony 220  Experts -- Questions Concerning Assumed Facts 221   Conflicting Expert Testimony223   Opinion  Testimony of Lay Witnesses400  Negligence 401  Basic Standard of Care402   Standard of Care for Minors 405  Comparative Fault of Plaintiffs406  Apportionment of Responsibility.     Plaintiffs' counsel is directed to modify the draft instruction along the lines discussed at the conference on December 12, 2024.412  Duty of Care Owed Children 430      Causation -- Substantial Factor  [Bracketed sentence at end should be included]431 Causation --  Multiple Causes 700  Basic Standard of Care 706  Basic Speed Law   ( Vehicle Code Section 22350)  This instruction applies to Carlos Turcios, the driver of the vehicle that hit the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' counsel is direct to fill in the blanks in the instruction to reflect Turcios's role in the incident.710     Duty of Care for Pedestrians and Drivers in Crosswalk  (Vehicle Code Section 21950)703   Definition of Immediate Hazard.  This instruction will be given after 710, which uses the phrase "immediate hazard."3900  Introduction to Tort Damages 3902  Economic and Noneconomic Damages3903  Items of Economic Damage3903A   Medical Expense -- Future  (Economic Damage)3905  Items of Noneconomic Damage3905A  Physical Pain, Mental Suffering and Emotional Distress (Non Economic Damage)   Include the bracketed last sentence.3924  No Punitive Damages3925  Arguments of Counsel Not Evidence Of Damages3932 Life Expectancy3964 Jurors Not to Consider Attorney's Fees 5000  Series  The Court will give the instructions in the 5000 series that were in the proposed stack of instructions submitted by Plaintiffs' counsel , except 5004 (which deals with services provided to a juror with a disability), and 5005 (which deals with mulitiple parties and already was given as part of the 100 series at the start of the trial.)   The Court directs Plaintiffs' counsel to email to the Court a word  document containing the proposed 5000 series instructions.Instructions in Plaintiffs' Proposed Set That Remain Under Consideration To Be Given206  Evidence Admitted for Limited Purpose 210  Requests for Admission213 Adoptive Admission215 Exercise of a Communication Privilege432  Affirmative Defense -- Third Party Causation as a Superseding Cause3930  Mitigation of Damages (Personal Injury)206, 210, 213, and 215 will be given if, in the remaining days of the trial, the evidence supports that they be given. To date, the evidence does not support this.   432 and 3930 will only be given if the  Defendant seeks leave to amend its answer to assert the affirmative defenses referenced in those two instructions and the Court grants the Defendant leave to amend, which, according to the Plaintiffs, should not be granted.Instructions in Plaintiffs' Proposed Set That Will Not Be Given423  Public Entity Liability for Failure to Perform Mandatory Duty428  Parental Liability3929  Subsequent Medical Treatment or AidSPECIAL VERDICT FORM The Court has reviewed the Plaintiffs' proposed special verdict form.  Here are the Court's comments.Question 2 asks whether the County's negligence was a substantial in causing harm to Melanie or Magie.    "Or" probably should be changed to "and."  Alternatively, the question should be broken down into two questions, one for Melanie and one for Magie.  The same comment applies to Question 6 (as to Carlos Turcios' negligence) and Question 8 (as to Cristian Valdez Gonzalez's negligence).Past medical damages must be removed from questions 3 and 4.
