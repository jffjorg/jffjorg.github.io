And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The defendant sought to strike the complaint because it lacked sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge ruled that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant's managing agents authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct constituting malice, oppression, and fraud. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the corporate managing agents, including Benik Navi, Mitesh Kalthia, and Ashu Kalthia, ratified Zagar's conduct. The judge granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the tentative ruling regarding the motion to strike hearing.
