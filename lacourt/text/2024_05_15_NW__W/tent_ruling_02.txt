BACKGROUND
 
This action involves mortgage foreclosure.
Plaintiffs Kimberly Davis and Jonathan M. Davis filed a complaint against
Defendants U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee of Mstr Adjustabl-Rate
Mortgages Trust 2006-OA2 (“U.S. Bank”); Nationstar Mortgage LLC d/b/a Mr.
Cooper (“Nationstar”) and Quality Loan Service Corporation for 1) Breach of
Contract; 2) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 3)
Violations of the Rosenthal Act; 4) Violations of the Military and Veterans
Code Sections 400 et seq. and 800 et. seq; 5) Violation of the California Consumer
Credit Reporting Agencies Act, Calif. Civ. Code § 1785.25(a); 6) Violations of
the Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.); 7)
Violations of Civil Code § 3273.10; and 8) Violation of Civil Code § 2924.17.
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. 
 
On March 24, 2023, the instant action was related to
Davis, et al. v. Hemmis, et al. (22VECV01458). In that action, the
Davis’ allege when they were absent from the subject
property, Defendants Hemmis and Short unlawfully entered the subject property
and remained in possession of the property until early July 2022. While Defendants
Hemmis and Short were in possession of the property, the Davis’ allege they
were engaged in a dispute with their mortgage lender, U.S. Bank, related to a settlement
agreement that was entered into to address the payoff of a mortgage loan. The
Davis’ further allege Hemmis, Short, and other named defendants engaged in a
conspiracy to attempt to steal title to the Plaintiffs’ home.

I.                   
PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DEPOSITION OF PERSON MOST QUALIFIED OF NATIONSTAR
MORTGAGE LLC AND FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE LLC AND
ANDREA HICKS
 
Plaintiffs move the Court for an order compelling
Nationstar Mortgage, LLC d/b/a/ Mr. Cooper (“Nationstar”) to provide the
person(s) most qualified for Nationstar to be further deposed. Plaintiffs make
the motion on the grounds that Nationstar has failed to provide a person most knowledgeable
for Nationstar for deposition, which seek basic information that is highly
material to the adjudication of this matter. This motion is further made in
that Nationstar failed to produce highly relevant documents – their purported
policies for providing relief under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act – on
the day of the deposition, despite the fact that they were specifically
requested. Plaintiffs also request monetary sanctions in the amount of
$12,075.00. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.480 provides in
relevant part that “[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce
any document…under the deponent's control that is specified in the deposition
notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court
for an order compelling that answer or production.” (CCP §2025.480(a).) The motion
must be made “no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2025.480(b); see also Weinstein v. Blumberg
(2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 316, 321 [the 60-day deadline is mandatory].) Not less
than five days prior to the hearing on the motion, the moving party “shall
lodge with the court a certified copy of any parts of the stenographic
transcript of the deposition that are relevant to the motion.” (CCP §2025.480(h).) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice 
 
Plaintiffs request this court take judicial notice
of the following documents: (1) Declaration of Jonathan M. Davis in Support of
Opposition to Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association’s Motion to Amend
Default Judgment and Correct Writ of Sale (Exh. 1); (2) Kimberly M. Davis and
Jonathan M. Davis’s First Amended Complaint (Exh. 2); (3) Order Granting Cost
of Proof Sanctions – Yue v. Alvernaz Partners, LLC, et al. (Exh. 3); (4)
Opinion on Appeal – Yue v. Alvernaz Partners, LLC, et al. (Exh. 4); and (5)
Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff Han’s San Jose Hospitality, LLC – Han’s San
Jose Hospitality, LLC v. Le Holdings (Beijing) Co. Ltd., et al. (Exh. 5). 
 
In Reply, Plaintiffs further request this court take
judicial notice of several more court documents (RJN, Exhs. 1-3). 
 
The court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for judicial
notice. 
 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and California
Military and Veterans Code
 
Plaintiffs argue they have a right to ask the deponent
questions about the documents regarding Nationstar’s policies regarding Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act as the documents were produced after the deposition. (Topics
4, 41.) Specifically, after the deposition, Plaintiffs’
counsel provided with the SCRA policies and procedures which was produced and
labeled as Confidential NSM_Davis 004732-004752. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ counsel
was unable to depose Mr. Brown regarding SCRA guidelines as requested in the
deposition notice. 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff argues Mr. Brown
was unable to discuss when the program for the CMVC was set up internally or
when it came about but acknowledged that a program was created in his review
with Nationstar’s legal department. Therefore, further deposition should be
provided as the creation of this program is extremely important to this case.
Plaintiff also argues Plaintiff’s counsel was not provided with the policies
and procedures regarding the CMVC nor did Mr. Brown make an effort to look into
whether Chris Dixon still worked at Nationstar. (See Topics 4, 5, 40, and 41.) 
 
In opposition, Nationstar argues Mr.
Brown provided extensive testimony on these topics. Specifically, Mr. Brown’s
testimony on these topics spanned at least an hour and close to 50 pages of
testimony. (See Exhibit 1 19:15-66:12.) Moreover, these topics seek legal
conclusions which, again, is inappropriate for a PMQ deposition. Nationstar
further argues Defendants cannot—and will not—address any purported
“qualification” for protection under the CMVC by Plaintiffs prior to
Nationstar’s involvement with the Subject Loan. Further, the creation of
Nationstar’s policies and procedures for the CMCV are neither relevant to the
subject matter of this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. 
 
.  
 
The court agrees now that Plaintiff has
the documents regarding the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, they should be
able to inquire about them with Mr. Ward. As for the CMCV Topics, the court
also finds them relevant and the qualification topics appropriate at this
juncture. Accordingly, the court grants the motion to compel further as to
these topics. 
 
2021 Draft Long Form 
 
Plaintiffs argue Mr. Brown was unable
to provide a clear response to Topic No. 35, “Whether the SEPTEMBER 2021 DRAFT
LONGFORM AGREEMENT was in compliance with the E-MAIL AGREEMENT.” Plaintiffs
contend Mr. Brown was unable to provide a clear response to the topic as he
could not recall what was in the e-mail agreement. 
 
In opposition, Nationstar this Topic
calls for testimony regarding a legal conclusion. Nationstar contends Testimony
regarding a legal conclusion is not appropriate for a PMQ deposition.
Nationstar further argues Plaintiffs wanted in-depth testimony related to the
subject email correspondence, they should have provided it as an exhibit to the
deposition and allowed Mr. Ward Brown to review the document to refresh his
recollection. Plaintiffs’ failure to do so does not permit Plaintiffs to burden
Nationstar to produce a witness again for further deposition on the topic.
 
The court agrees with Nationstar that
the question calls for a legal conclusion and Nationstar need not further
respond. 
 
Identity of Witnesses 
 
Plaintiffs argue the court should grant
the Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further deposition testimony over the identity
of individuals of Nationstar’s legal department, title officers, and lenders.
Specifically, during the deposition, in response to Topic Nos. 1, 3, 15, 16,
32, and 34, Mr. Brown could not provide an adequate response stating, “I don’t
recall,” and “I do not.” 
 
In opposition, Nationstar argues
Plaintiffs’ contention is inaccurate. When asked if he knew the identity of all
individuals who participated in the decision to enter into the 2018 Settlement
Agreement, Mr. Brown responded: “The parties that executed the agreements and
our internal legal department.” (See Exh. 4 96:4-13.) Nationstar contends the
identity is irrelevant and as to Topics 1 and 3, they call for testimony
related to legal conclusions, opinions, legal theories, or other work product
of their counsel or their consultants, this information is protected by the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege. 
 
The court finds the identity of some of
the witnesses relevant and may lead to discovery of admissible evidence. Specifically,
the PMQ should be able to identify the names of the individuals who signed the
settlement agreement on behalf of the company, and the involved title officers
and lenders.  The PMQ does not need to
divulge the names of the lawyers involved. 
 The court orders further
responses to by a PMQ as to the identity of these individuals.  
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs seek $12,075.00 in sanctions
against Nationstar on the grounds Nationstar refused to produce a competent
witness on topics numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 32, 34, 35, 40, 41 and then also
refused to provide critical documents that were specifically requested, which
was a violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480. 
 
The court denies Plaintiffs’ request
for sanctions as Nationstar’s position at the PMQ deposition was substantially
justified and they did produce an individual to respond to the great bulk of
plaintiff’s questions.   
 
II.                 
MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AND REQUESTS FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST U.S. BANK AND
NATIONSTAR AND ANDREA HICKS
 
Plaintiffs move this court for an order
compelling Defendants U.S. Bank National Association and Nationstar to provide
further responses to certain requests contained in Plaintiffs’ First Set of
Special Interrogatories and First Set of Requests for Production. Plaintiffs
make the motion on the grounds each request is necessary to discern the basis,
if any, for the factual contentions set forth in Defendant’s pleadings,
Defendant’s claims, Defendant's defenses thereto, and the responses they did
serve do not satisfy Defendant’s discovery obligations. Plaintiff also requests
that this Court award Plaintiff an award of $11,240.00 against Defendants U.S.
Bank and Nationstar and its counsel, Andrea Hicks, as sanctions for having to
file this motion.
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel
further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying
the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).) It
is not necessary for the motion to show that the material sought will be
admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where
specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial
preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist.
Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also CCP §§
2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1).) 
 
A motion to compel further responses to
form or specially prepared interrogatories may be brought if the responses
contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or
insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a
substantive response; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2030.300(a).)   
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiffs request this court take
judicial notice of several court documents (Exhs. 1-5). The court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ request for judicial notice. 
 
SROG Nos. 2, 3, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 25, 38, 40 and RFP Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 2, 3, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
25, 38 and 40 and Request for Production of Documents 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22,
and 25. 
 
Plaintiffs first argue the objections
to the SROGs are frivolous. For example, Defendants’ responses to SROGs Nos. 2,
3, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 38, and 40 are predicated upon their theory
that the instant action is barred by res judicata, which this court has already
rejected. Plaintiffs also argue Defendants argument that the Plaintiffs
complaint is barred by their contention that the Plaintiff violated the 2018
settlement agreement is also meritless. Moreover, Defendants’ responses to SROGs
Nos. 15, 16, and 17 are also insufficient as they do not answer the question. In
regards to SROGs Nos. 18, 19, and 38, Plaintiffs argue Defendants’ responses
that Plaintiffs “already have” records or communications is not proper. Turning
to Special Interrogatories Nos. 20, 21, 25, and 40, Plaintiffs contend a general
category of the occupation of or employing company of the relevant witness is
not sufficient and should be supplemented. 
 
As for Plaintiffs’ request for
production of documents, Plaintiffs argue similarly argue the objections are
frivolous and in direct contradiction to what the court has already ordered in
this case. This specific issue arises in RFP Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. In
addition, the responses to Requests for Production Nos. 22 and 25 should be
supplemented. The information responsive to this request is not protected by
any privilege and relevant to the case. 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue their
discovery responses are full and complete. As to Special Interrogatory Nos. 2,
3, and 7, Defendants’ responses state that these Interrogatories call for legal
conclusions. Defendants contend whether Plaintiffs “qualify” for relief under
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is a legal conclusion. As for Special
Interrogatory Nos. 15, 16, and 17, Defendants state they have produced a June
14, 2019 payoff statement. Thus, no further response is necessary. As for SROG
18, Defendants contend it is proper to refer to documents that it has produced
in response to an interrogatory that necessitates creating a compilation or
summary of information pursuant to Section 2030.230. Similarly, Plaintiffs are
requesting information already within their possession for SROG 38. Defendants
also argue that their response is full to SROG 19, 20, 21, and 40. As to
Special Interrogatory No. 25, as set forth in Defendants’ response, Defendants
do not have any identifying information for any individual that visited the
property after June 2019.
 
As for Plaintiffs’ RFPs, Defendants
argue RFP Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, and 25 are complete. Defendants contend
if a response was not amended or additional documents were not produced, there
is no additional information for Defendants to provide and Nationstar has
produced all of the relevant, non-privileged documents it has located in its
custody and control.
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to SROG Nos. 2, 3, 7 15-17, 18, 19, and 38. Stating
Plaintiff has some of the documents in their possession is not a proper answer.
Moreover, SROG Nos. 2, 3 and 7 are contention interrogatories and therefore, it
is not a valid objection. (See CCP §2030.010(b); Grace v. Mansourian (2015)
240Cal.App.4th 523, 530.) However, the court agrees Defendants have properly
responded to SROG Nos. 20, 21, and 25. They have answered the interrogatory by
code. 
 
As for the RFPs, the court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 13, 14, 16, 22, and
25. The court agrees RFP 12 is duplicative of 11 and RFP 15 is duplicative of
14.  
 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses is GRANTED, in part, as to SROG Nos. 2, 3, 7 15-17,
18, 19, and 38 and RFP Nos. 13, 14, 16, 22, and 25
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions
in the amount of $11,240.00. The court finds both parties acted with
substantial justification and denies the request for monetary sanctions.
