And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has set an order to show cause re: dismissal for failure to file a request for default judgment. The plaintiff amended the complaint on November 22, 2023, to change the defendant's name from Arman Belgaryan to Arman Beglaryan. The defendant filed a notice of errata stating that the correct name is Arman Beglaryan. The court continues the order to show cause re: dismissal and orders the parties to submit briefing on whether the amended complaint "opened" the default, requiring the court to vacate the March 6, 2023 default. The parties may stipulate to set aside the March 6, 2023 default or stipulate that the default is valid and constitutes a default of Defendant Arman Beglaryan. The court will set a briefing schedule and will provide a date for further action on February 22, 2024.
