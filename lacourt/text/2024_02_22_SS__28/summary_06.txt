And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motions to compel Plaintiff Hermenejildo Banuelos' responses to Church's discovery requests are moot. The Church had filed the motions, requesting sanctions, after Plaintiff failed to provide timely responses. However, Plaintiff's counsel has submitted a declaration stating that Church's discovery has now been answered, and Church's counsel confirmed that they received the responses. The Court concludes that the motions to compel are no longer necessary. Additionally, the Court finds that the statutes do not authorize the Court to grant Church's request for sanctions, as the sanctions can only be awarded against a party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel. Therefore, the Court denies Church's sanctions requests.
