Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit brought by Maria Guadalupe Valadez Vallejo against TLC Laundry, LLC, James Lee Carson, Crocker Holdings Group LLC, California Coin Laundries, and Does 1-50. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants knew or should have known about a dangerous condition and failed to take corrective action, resulting in the plaintiff's injuries.

The key issue in this ruling is whether Jameswood Holdings, LLC, one of the defendants, can file a cross-complaint against Carson, another defendant. Jameswood Holdings, LLC filed an answer to the complaint but failed to file a cross-complaint, and later filed a motion for leave to do so. Carson opposes the motion, arguing that the contract on which the cross-complaint is based does not establish a contractual relationship between Jameswood Holdings, LLC and Carson, and that Jameswood Holdings, LLC's delay in serving the motion prejudices Carson.

The judge has granted Jameswood Holdings, LLC's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint in the interest of justice. The judge also orders Jameswood Holdings, LLC to file and serve the cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing.
