PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set
one, and impose sanctions. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied:  
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230.  
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as
for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION  
On
November 28, 2023, Defendant served requests for admission, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Responses were due on January
2, 2024.  Plaintiff did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed this motion. 
Plaintiff
argues the Court should deny the motion because page one of the motion states,
“TO PLAINTIFF CESAR ALBERTO ELLIS INTERIANO . . . .”  The erroneous reference to a non-party is not
a reason to deny the motion, which clearly concerns Plaintiff Felicia Patterson. 
Plaintiff
also argues that the matters specified in the requests for admission are not
properly deemed admitted because they are questions of law.  However, Plaintiff has waived this objection to
the requests for admission under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision
(a). 
Plaintiff
also argues that her counsel has lost contact with Plaintiff and has filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
Plaintiff cites no authority that prevents the Court from granting a
motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission based on an
attorney’s loss of contact with the client or filing of a motion to be relieved as counsel. 
The
Court grants the motion and deems admitted the matters specified in requests
for admission, set one. 
Defendant
asks the Court to award sanctions of $1,257.00 based on 5.7 hours of attorney
time at a rate of $210.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent 4.7 hours conducting legal
research and drafting the moving papers and anticipated spending 1.0 hour to
appear at the hearing. 
The
Court awards sanctions of $480.00 based on two hours of attorney time and one
filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS Defendant Shannon Yao Wang’s motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one.  The Court deems the matters admitted. 
          The Court GRANTS Defendant
Shannon Yao Wang’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Felicia Patterson
to pay Defendant Shannon Yao Wang $480.00
in sanctions by March 21, 2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
