And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Shannon Yao Wang's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one. The Court finds that Plaintiff Felicia Patterson waived her objections to the requests for admission and failed to serve timely responses. The Court also grants Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $480.00, based on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee. The hearing is currently scheduled for January 13, 2025.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff's arguments that the matters specified in the requests for admission are questions of law and that the Court should deny the motion based on an attorney's loss of contact with the client or filing of a motion to be relieved as counsel are without merit. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses to the requests for admission necessitated this motion and that the Defendant is entitled to sanctions.
