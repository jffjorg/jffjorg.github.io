interrogatories, set one.  Church also
asks the Court to award sanctions.

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
On June
22, 2023, Church served (1) request for production of documents, set one, (2)
special interrogatories, set one, and (3) form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Church filed these motions. 
Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted a declaration
stating that Church’s discovery “[has] now been answered. [Plaintiff's] responses were
emailed to [Church’s] attorney on February 15, 2024.”  (Opposition p. 2.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not submit copies of
the discovery responses for the Court’s review. 
At the February 22, 2024 hearing, Church’s counsel stated
that he received Plaintiff’s discovery responses.  Church’s counsel found the responses inadequate
but confirmed that the responses were verified and did not include objections. 
The Court concludes that the motions to compel are
moot.  If Plaintiff’s discovery responses
are deficient, Church may file one or more motions to compel further responses
and schedule an informal discovery conference with the Court.  
In addition, although Plaintiff’s lengthy delay in
serving discovery responses made it necessary for Church to file these motions,
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 do not appear to authorize
the Court to grant Church’s requests for sanctions.  The statutes authorize a sanctions award
against a party, person, or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion
to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  Plaintiff’s late-filed
opposition was successful.  Therefore,
the Court denies Church’s sanctions requests. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES as moot Defendant The Universal Church’s motion to
compel Plaintiff Hermenejildo Banuelos’s responses to request for production of
documents, set one. 

The Court
DENIES as moot Defendant The Universal Church’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Hermenejildo Banuelos’s responses to special interrogatories, set one. The Court
DENIES as moot Defendant The Universal Church’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Hermenejildo Banuelos’s responses to form interrogatories, set one. 
The Court
DENIES Defendant The Universal Church’s requests for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
