The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Cross-Defendants Estate of Westin Lee Stewart, Deceased, and Nancy Stewart to continue the trial to October 7, 2024, and to extend all discovery and related cutoff dates. The motion was made because Forte, the defendant, failed to provide court-ordered discovery responses that Cross-Defendants need to prepare for trial. The Court found good cause for the continuance and granted the motion to extend discovery deadlines. The new trial date will be October 7, 2024, and all discovery and related dates will be based on this new date.
