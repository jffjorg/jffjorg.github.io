ALL HEARING DATES IN DEPARTMENT 26 OF THE
SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE ARE VACATED. ANALYSIS:
 
On March 11, 2024, Petitioner California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration (“Petition”) filed the
instant “Petition for Third Party Claim.” However, the Petition does not seek
monetary damages. Instead, it seeks the Court’s determination regarding the validity
of a third-party claim. (Pet., p. 1.) The
limited jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief
sought in the Petition. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) 
 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Petitioner is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.
