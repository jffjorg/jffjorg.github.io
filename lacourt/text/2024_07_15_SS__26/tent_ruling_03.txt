LLC aka West Los Angeles Academy of Dance”) on October 16, 2023. Defendant

Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The parties entered into a subletting agreement on October 20, 2021.
(Compl., ¶5.) Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Defendant
purchased the “Student Register” and rented studio space from Plaintiff at the
Dance Studio No. 1 (“DS1”) located at 1212 Pico Blvd. in Santa Monica,
California (“Premises”) for $120,000. (Ibid.) Defendant promised to pay
Plaintiff $10,000.00 per month to rent the Premises, the right to use
Plaintiff’s programs, Plaintiff’s help with the transition, evaluations, and
ISTD exams in March. (Ibid.) Defendant breached the agreement on
September 14, 2022 by failing to make final payments to Plaintiff in the amount
of $20,000.00. (Id. at ¶6.) Plaintiff suffered damages of $20,000.00
plus interest of ten (10) percent per annum from September 14, 2022. (Id.
at ¶8.) These allegations support causes of action for breach of contract, open
book account, and account stated. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests the Court take
judicial notice of (1) the contract between Plaintiff, Dance Studio No. 1,
Inc., and Defendant, West LA Academy of Dance LLC, dated December 20, 2021; and
(2) the transcript of Deposition of Elizabeth Banke, Person Most Knowledgeable
at Dance Studio No. 1, Inc. dated March 5, 2024. The request is broadly brought
pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452 and 453, without citation to specific
statutory language or subdivisions. (RJN, p. 2:1.) Plaintiff objects to the
request on the grounds that the documents are not authenticated or verified,
nor documents of which the Court can or may take judicial notice. In reply,
Defendant argues that courts routinely take judicial notice of documents
referenced in the pleadings, citing
Zakk v. Diesel (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 431, in support of this proposition. Zakk, however, is not a
case that discusses the legal standard for taking judicial notice of a contract
attached to a complaint. It merely refers to the fact that in the trial court
proceeding, the trial court judge took judicial notice of the parties’ agreement.
(Zakk v. Diesel (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 431, 444.) The Court of Appeals
did not address the plaintiff’s objections to the request for judicial notice.
(Id. at 446.) Nor has Defendant shown that judicial notice of a
deposition transcript is proper. No specific authority is cited for this
request. Therefore, Defendant’s request for judicial notice is denied. 
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff objects to admission of
the transcript of Deposition of Elizabeth Banke, Person Most Knowledgeable at
Dance Studio No. 1, Inc. dated March 5, 2024 as evidence on the grounds that
the document was not authenticated. In reply, Defendant correctly argues that a
deposition transcript can be authenticated by including the court reporter’s
signed certification page. (Citing Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 486, 523.) As the copy of the deposition transcript includes the
signed certification page, it is properly authenticated.  (Motion, Exh. 2, p. 82.) The objection to the
deposition transcript is overruled. 
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of
Proof
 
A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
An action for breach of contract
must demonstrate the following elements: (1) the existence of the contract, (2)
the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s
breach; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (D’Arrigo Bros. of
California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790,
800.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot
prove the elements of breach and/or damages.
 
Regarding breach of the contract
terms, Defendant argues it paid $20,000.00 on January 1, 2022 for the student
registry in accordance with the contract terms. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 5; Exh. 5 “Banke Depo.”, p. 50:1; Exh. 3 “MacFarlan Decl.”, p. 2:6.) The
contract thereafter provides that Plaintiff will pay $10,000.00 per month due
on the first of every month, with the first payment due January 10, 2022, to
rent the studio, the right to use Plaintiff’s programs, help with the
transition, evaluations, and ISTD exams in March. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 7; Exh. 1.) Defendant paid $10,000.0 every month from January 2022 to
August 2022 pur. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; No. 6; Exh. 6 “Banke
Depo.”, p. 49:6-11; MacFarlane Decl., p. 1:6; Exh. 4 “Kalantaryan Decl.”, p.
1:13.) Defendant contends that January 2022 through August 2022 was the
duration of the agreement because Defendant’s landlord terminated its lease
effective August 24, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Exh 1, p.
2; MacFarlane Decl., ¶¶5-6.) The agreement states that Defendant would be
required to continue paying Plaintiff $10,000.00 a month, up to $120,000.00, if
Defendant (1) contracts directly with Plaintiff’s landlord; and (2) Defendant
wishes to purchase the inventories from Plaintiff. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 7; Exh 1, p. 2; MacFarlane Decl., ¶6.) Defendant never contracted
directly with Plaintiff’s landlord. ((Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 8;
MacFarlane Decl., ¶¶6-7.)
 
This evidence carries Defendant’s
initial burden of proof to demonstrate that it did not breach the terms of the
parties’ agreement. Defendant made payments as required by the agreement until
the termination of Plaintiff’s lease agreement by the landlord. This also
demonstrates that Plaintiff was not damaged in the amount of $20,000.00, as
there was no agreement between the parties for Defendant to pay that amount to
Plaintiff. Likewise, for the open book account and account stated causes of
action, for which it is alleged Defendant owes Plaintiff a balance of
$20,000.00, Defendant has carried its initial burden of proof that the
undisputed facts show no such balance due. (See Compl., ¶¶8, 12, 15.)
 
The burden now shifts to
Plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact
regarding Defendant’s breach of the agreement and damages incurred by
Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s Burden to
Demonstrate the Existence of a Triable Issue of Material Fact
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that Defendant misstates the terms of the agreement. Specifically, in addition
to requiring payment of $20,000.00 for Plaintiff’s student registry, the
agreement required Defendant to pay other amounts if it wanted to purchase
Plaintiff’s assets and to make monthly payments to sublease Plaintiff’s studio.
(Opp., Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 5-7; Banke Decl., ¶7; Exh. 1 at ¶¶3-5, 7;
Exh. 2 “Banke Depo.” pp. 43:4-14; 49:12-50:1; 60:15-61:1.) The separate
statement cites “the third, fourth, fifth and seventh un- numbered paragraphs”;
paragraph 7 sets forth the conditions for additional payment: “If Mariah at a
later date gets a contract directly with the landlord and wishes to purchase
the inventories from DS1, Mariah will keep paying $10,000 per month up to the
agreed sum of $120,000.” (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Banke Decl.,
Exh. 1 at ¶¶3-5, 7.) As noted above, there are two conditions for the
additional payment: Defendant contracts directly with Plaintiff’s landlord and
wishes to purchase Plaintiff’s inventories. While Plaintiff presents evidence
that Defendant did purchase its inventories it does not show that Defendant
entered into a direct contract with the landlord. (Opp., Separate Statement,
Fact Nos. 7-8; Banke Decl., ¶7; Exh. 1 at ¶¶3-5, 7; Exh. 2 “Banke Depo.” pp.
43:4-14; 49:12-50:1; 60:15-61:1.) In fact, Plaintiff admits that it lacks
evidence regarding any direct agreement Defendant made with the landlord.
(Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 8.) Therefore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated
the existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding the lack of any
breach of the terms of the agreement or any resulting damages. 
 
The Court additionally notes that
Plaintiff confusingly argues in its opposition memorandum that “there is a
genuine dispute over the terms of the contract regarding whether or not the
Defendant was required to make additional payments for the material assets of
Plaintiff’s dance studio.” The opposition, however, does not explain why the
Court should find is such a dispute over the terms exists, other than that
Plaintiff believes there is a dispute. The opposition does not explain why
Plaintiff’s belief overrides the terms of the parties’ written agreement or
otherwise creates a balance due and owing. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore,
Defendant West LA Academy of Dance, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF
THIS ORDER.
