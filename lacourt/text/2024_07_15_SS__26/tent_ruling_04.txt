ANALYSIS:
 
On April 11, 2024, Defendant City of
Whittier (“Defendant Whittier”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One and
Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”).
(Motions, Verska Decl., Exh. A.) Despite
a meet and confer effort by defense counsel through multiple phone calls to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm, Plaintiff has not served responses to the
discovery. (Id. at ¶¶4-9.) Defendant Whittier filed the instant (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions, on May 29, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on July
1, 2024 and Defendant Whittier replied on July 5, 2024.

 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant Whittier is entitled to an order
compelling them to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Plaintiff’s
opposition fails to provide a reasonable explanation for failing to timely
serve responses. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that the assigned attorney left
the law firm in October or November 2023 but the assigned attorney’s email
address was not being monitored such that service of the discovery requests
went unnoticed. (Opp., Clift Decl., ¶¶4-5.) This failure to monitor the
attorney’s email address, or to provide either the Court or opposing counsel
with new contact information for the attorney of record for more than eight
months is inexcusable. 
 
Therefore, sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed.
Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in
the amount of $980.00 based on four hours of attorney time billed at $245.00
per hour. (Motions, Verska
Decl., ¶11.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant City of Whittier’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions,
are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA
ANDA IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE INTERROGATORIES, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS,
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA AND COUNSEL
OF RECORD ARE ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $980.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
