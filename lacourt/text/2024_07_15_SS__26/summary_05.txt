And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition for third-party claim will be placed off calendar and the case will be reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for reassignment to an Independent Calendar Court. The Petitioner, California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, is ordered to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days. The case was originally filed on March 11, 2024, and was scheduled for a hearing on July 15, 2024, but this has been vacated. The Judge found that the limited jurisdiction court lacked jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief sought in the Petition, and therefore the case must be reclassified and transferred.
