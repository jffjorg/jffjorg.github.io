And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on Respondent Tracy Fontenette's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's prior ruling on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. The Motion was filed on May 13, 2024, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider its prior ruling because the Motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Respondent's arguments, that the Petition would be unduly prejudicial to them and that Petitioner failed to comply fully with the Arbitration Act, do not constitute new or different facts, circumstances, or law and could have been raised in the opposition to the Petition or at oral argument. Therefore, the Court denies the Motion for Reconsideration.
