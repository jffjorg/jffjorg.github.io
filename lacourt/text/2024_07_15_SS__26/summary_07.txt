Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants American Contractors Indemnity Company's motion for an assignment order, restraining order, and accounting against Bich Hoang Tran. The assignment order will require Tran to assign payments from his customers to American Contractors Indemnity Company, pending an order lifting the bankruptcy stay. The customers include various companies and individuals who have paid Tran. The judge also grants the request for a restraining order to prevent Tran from assigning or disposing of the payments. Finally, the judge grants the request for an accounting every other month to ensure that payments are being made as ordered.
