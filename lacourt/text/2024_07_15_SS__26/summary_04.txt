And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Whittier's motion to compel responses to discovery requests and request for sanctions. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of the order. Additionally, Plaintiff and her counsel are ordered to pay sanctions of $980.00 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of the order. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and is inexcusable. The Court has ordered the Plaintiff to serve the responses because the Defendant has a right to obtain discovery and the Plaintiff's failure to respond has caused a delay in the litigation. The Judge has also awarded sanctions to the Defendant because the Plaintiff's failure to respond was unreasonable and the Plaintiff's counsel failed to monitor the attorney's email address and notify the court or opposing counsel.
