California Casualty Indemnity Exchange v. Young, et
al.MOTION
TO VACATE JUDGMENT
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s Motion to Vacate
Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff California Casualty Indemnity Exchange
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action for insurance subrogation against Defendant
Jawaun De Anthony Young (“Defendant”) on September 22, 2022. Default judgment
was entered against Defendant on February 8, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment on June
20, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
First, the Motion is not accompanied by any proof of service
demonstrating service of the motion papers or notice of hearing on Plaintiff. Failure
to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
 
Also, the Motion is not
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).) The Motion, however, cites no legal authority in support of
the request for relief. (Motion, pp. 3:1-5:4.) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to
provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the
[request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s
Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
