And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the application for a writ of possession filed by Ally Bank (Plaintiff) against Marine Nersisyan, Devine Motorworkz Corp., and Grigor Cholakyan (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks to obtain possession of a 2013 Mercedes-Benz G Class vehicle, which is currently being wrongfully detained by the Defendants. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown entitlement to possession of the vehicle and that it is being wrongfully detained by the Defendants. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has shown probable cause to believe that the vehicle is located at 9601 Glenoaks Blvd., Unit 6, Sun Valley, CA 91352, which is the principal place of business of Devine Motorworkz Corp. The judge grants the application for a writ of possession, but strikes references to an additional address, 630 S. Lake St. Apt 104, Burbank, CA 91502, which was not supported by the Plaintiff's showing. The judge notes that the Defendants are currently in default and have admitted all allegations of the Complaint, making it nearly certain that the Plaintiff will obtain a judgment against them.
