Here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is that the motion to serve Defendant CR Newbury Street Corp. through the California Secretary of State is denied without prejudice. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo, who has been unable to serve Defendant's agent for service, Cynthia Rowley, via personal service at the business address and her residence. While Plaintiff has demonstrated an inability to serve Defendant's agent for service, she has not demonstrated exhaustion of all alternative methods of service enumerated in Corporations Code section 1702 before seeking service upon the Secretary of State. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not exhausted all possible methods of service and therefore denies the motion without prejudice.
