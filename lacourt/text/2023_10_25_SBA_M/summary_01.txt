**Plaintiff:** Federal Insurance Company
**Defendants:** Toto U.S.A., Inc., Lavelle Industries, Inc.

**Tentative Ruling:**

The motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The motion for summary adjudication is DENIED as to Issues 1, 2, and 3 (as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action) and GRANTED as to Issue 4 (as to the 3rd cause of action).

The case involves a subrogation complaint filed by Federal Insurance Company against Toto U.S.A., Inc. and Lavelle Industries, Inc. for product liability, negligence, and breach of warranty based on losses sustained at 2229 Via Guadalana, Palos Verdes Estates.
