BACKGROUND
On December 2, 2020, Federal
Insurance Company filed a subrogation complaint against Toto U.S.A., Inc. and
Lavelle Industries, Inc. for (1) product liability, (2) negligence, and (3)
breach of warranty based on losses sustained at 2229 Via Guadalana, Palos Verdes
Estates.  
            On February 24, 2021, the case was
removed to federal court.
            On September 10, 2021, a notice of
remand from federal court was filed.
            On April 18, 2022, the case was
referred to Dept. 1 from the PI Hub for reassignment.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Toto U.S.A., Inc. requests
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to each of the
causes of action:
            Issue No. 1:  Plaintiff cannot prevail on its strict
liability cause of action against Toto because plaintiff and/or a third party’s
misuse of the subject toilet is a complete defense to Toto’s liability.
            Issue No. 2:  Plaintiff cannot prevail on its negligence
cause of action against Toto because there is no evidence that Toto was the
legal cause of plaintiff’s damages.
            Issue No. 3:  Plaintiff cannot prevail on its breach of
warranty cause of action against Toto because there was no privity of contract
between plaintiff’s insured and Toto; as such, the express warranty did not
apply to plaintiff’s insured.  In
addition, plaintiff’s insured did not fulfill the required conditions of the
subject toilet’s warranty.
            The complaint alleges that prior to
July 2018, defendants designed, manufactured, distributed, specified, and sold
a toilet, fill valve, and associated components to plaintiff’s insured.  As a result of premature failure and
unintended catastrophic damage and flooding in and about the subject toilet and
fill valve, and consequent damage to the premises, the insured suffered damages
totaling $4,091,961.  Pursuant to its
policy of insurance, plaintiff paid its insured.
            The parties do not dispute that on
September 2, 2010, plaintiff’s insureds (“Choo family”) purchased a residence
located at 2229 Via Guadalana, Palos Verdes Estates through a broker and have
lived in the home for over ten years with their son.  Defendant’s Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts (“DUMF”) 1.  Someone other
than plaintiff’s insureds previously owned the subject property.  DUMF 2. 
The toilet that is the subject of this litigation was already installed
in the residence at the time that plaintiff’s insured’s purchased the
residence.  DUMF 3.  The subject toilet was located in the Choo
family son’s bathroom.  DUMF 4.  The Choo family’s housekeeper, Marta, cleans
the residence three or four times per week. 
DUMF 5.  The housekeeper has
cleaned the Choo family residence since 2010. 
DUMF 6.  The housekeeper bought
the cleaning supplies that she used to clean the residence during the timeframe
that the incident occurred.  DUMF 7.  The housekeeper was responsible for cleaning
the bathrooms in the residence. DUMF 8. 
The housekeeper cleaned the subject toilet each time she cleaned the
residence.  DUMF 9.  The housekeeper was the only individual in
the residence who cleaned the subject toilet. 
DUMF 10.  The housekeeper had
discretion on how to clean the bathrooms. 
DUMF 11.  The housekeeper used
Clorox tablets in the subject toilet. 
DUMF 12.  The housekeeper had used
Clorox tablets in the Choo family toilets for years.  DUMF 13. 

            The parties also do not dispute that
the residence experienced a flood on July 10, 2018.  On that day or shortly thereafter, the
housekeeper and the Choo family’s previous repairman, Uriel Perez, told Mrs.
Choo by phone that they observed a flood coming from the subject toilet.  DUMF 15. 
Toto manufactured, designed, assembled, supplied, and distributed a
product known as a Supreme, 1.6 Gpf toilet, elongated, power gravity, ADA, 12”
rough-in, one-piece toilet, Model No. MS864114L.  DUMF 18. 
The toilet at issue is a Toto’s Supreme, like the one described in DUMF
18.  DUMF 19.  The subject toilet was manufactured in
2007.  DUMF 20.  The subject toilet contains a fill valve in
the toilet tank.  DUMF 21.  Lavelle manufactured the fill valve that is
contained in the subject toilet.  DUMF
22.  The subject fill valve is secured to
the floor of the subject toilet tanks using a mounting nut.  DUMF 23. 
The average expected service life and “useful life” for the subject
toilet and its component parts, including the fill valve, is dependent upon the
environment in which the toilet and its component parts are placed, by the user
and/or by the consumer.  DUMF 26.  The subject toilet was not designed to be or
was advertised as being chlorine-resistant. 
DUMF 27.  Toto provides warnings
and instructions for the Toto Model No. MS864114L with respect to safe
operation of the toilet model.  DUMF 28.
            The parties also do not dispute that
in his deposition testimony, Mr. Choo admitted that he did not know if the
seller provided him any warranties when he purchased the residence, including
any warranties on the plumbing system or any type of home warranty policy.  DUMF 37. 
Mrs. Choo first testified that the subject premises did not come with
any warranties with the Choo family purchased the subject premises.  DUMF 38. 
Mrs. Choo changed her response to state that the subject premises came
with a one-year warranty and/or insurance policy and that that warranty was not
renewed.  DUMF 39.
            The parties also do not dispute that
the parties held a joint inspection of the subject toilet and tank components
on January 23, 2019.  DUMF 40.  Toto’s representative, Eddie Lee Johnson, and
Toto’s consultant, David Nichols-Roy, a mechanical engineer, and Toto’s
consultant, James A. Doi, Ph.D., a materials science and failure analysis
expert for plumbing components, attended the inspection.  DUMF 41. 
Toto’s representative and Toto’s expert witnesses acknowledged that
there was a chlorine-cleaning tablet inside the subject toilet tank at the time
of the inspection.  DUMF 42.  Toto’s expert witnesses photographed the
tablet that resided inside the toilet tank at the time of the January 23, 2019
inspection of the subject toilet.  DUMF
43.  When shown a picture from the
January 23, 2019 inspection of the toilet, which depicted a chlorine tablet
inside the toilet tank, Mrs. Choo testified that the housekeeper would have
placed the tablet in the tank.  DUMF
44.  Mrs. Choo further testified that the
housekeeper worked for the Choo family since prior to the Choo family’s 2010
purchase of the home and that the housekeeper used the same type of
chlorine-cleaning tablets at the Choo family’s previous home.  DUMF 45. 
A label/sticker was affixed to the inside of/underneath the subject
toilet tank lid, which stated:  “DO NOT
USE CHLORINE-BASED DISINFECTANTS IN THE TOILET TANK AS THEY MAY DEGRADE THE
COMPONENTS.”  DUMF 46.
            The parties also do not dispute that
at the inspection Nichols-Roy visually examined, performed examinations, and
photographed the subject toilet, subject fill valve assembly, the flapper
assembly, and the subject toilet’s other component parts.  DUMF 50. 
At the inspection, Dr. Doi visually examined, performed an examination
of and photographed the subject toilet, subject fill valve assembly, and the
subject toilet’s other component parts. 
DUMF 53.
            Defendant Toto asserts that plaintiff
had no information to dispute or confirm the following facts presented by
defendant:  Prior to being sold, all Toto
MS 864114L toilet models undergo an extensive flush test to ensure that the
products meet Toto’s flush performance standards.  Eddie Lee Johnson decl., ¶8.  Toto provided the following instructions and
warnings with the sale or delivery of the subject toilet:  (1) installation instructions; (2) a large
warning label affixed to the lid of the tank; and (3) an ASME sticker located
on the exterior of the subject toilet. 
Johnson decl., ¶13.  It is the
custom and practice of Toto to provide a copy of the Installation Manual to
buyers-consumers, as well as to affix a large label to the inside of the lid of
the tank of its toilets which reads:  “DO
NOT USE CHLORINE-BASED DISINFECTANTS IN THE TOILET TANK AS THEY MAY DEGRADE THE
COMPONENTS.”  Johnson decl., ¶14.  A warning in the Installation Manual under
“Care and Cleaning” warns against the use of chlorine-containing products in
the tank. This warning states:  “WARNING!
DO NOT USE IN-TANK BOWL CLEANERS.  The
use of high concentration of chlorine or chlorine-related products can
seriously damage fittings in the tank. 
This damage can cause leakage and property damage.  Toto shall not be responsible or liable for
any tank fitting failure or damage caused by the use of in-tank bowl
cleaners.”  Johnson decl., ¶17, Exh. F at
page 7.  The “Warranty” clause in the
Installation Manual also states: 
“WARNING! Toto shall not be responsible or liable for any failure of, or
damage to, this Product caused by either chloramines in the treatment of public
water supply or cleaners containing chlorine (calcium hypochlorite). NOTE:  The use of a high concentrate chlorine or
chlorine related products can seriously damage the fittings.  This damage can cause leakage and serious
property damage.”   Johnson decl., ¶17,
Exh. F at page 8.  The Installation
Manual includes the warning: 
“CAUTION:  Do not over-tighten the
nut at the fill valve.”  Johnson decl., ¶16,
Exh. F at page 4.  Under the maintenance
instructions for replacing the fill valve, the Instruction Manual reads twice
on one page:  “NOTE:  Do not over-tighten.”  Johnson decl., ¶16, Exh. F at page 5.  The Toto warranty reads in part:  1. 
Toto warrants its vitreous china products to be free from defects in
materials and workmanship during normal use when properly installed and
serviced, for a period of one year from date of purchase.  This limited warranty is extended only to the
ORIGINAL PURCHASER of the product and it not transferable to any third party. .
. . 3. This warranty does not apply to the following items:  . . . b. Damage or loss resulting from any
accident, unreasonable use, misuse, abuse, negligence, or improper care,
cleaning, or maintenance of the Product. 
Johnson decl., ¶18, Exh. F at page 8. 
The subject toilet only came with a one-year warranty.  Johnson decl., ¶¶18-19.
Issue No. 1: 
Plaintiff cannot prevail on its strict liability cause of action against
Toto because plaintiff and/or a third party’s misuse of the subject toilet is a
complete defense to Toto’s liability.
“The elements of a strict products
liability cause of action are a [1] defect in the  manufacture or design of the product or a
failure to warn, [2] causation, and [3] injury.”  County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318 (citation omitted).  “A manufacturer is liable only when a defect
in its product was a legal cause of injury. 
A tort is a legal cause of injury only when it is a substantial factor
in producing the injury.”  Soule v.
General Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 572.
 Defendant argues that as supported by the
evidence, the subject toilet and its component parts are not defective.  Defendant asserts that the evidence shows
that all Toto MS864114L toilet models undergo an extensive flush test to ensure
that the products meet Toto’s flush performance standards.  DUMF 24. 
They are inspected and tested before being placed into the stream of
commerce pursuant to Toto’s standard operating procedure and pursuant to
domestic and international standards for mechanical engineers and plumbing
officials.  DUMF 25.  Toto created several warning labels to assist
in the proper use and functioning for this particular type of toilet, including
the subject toilet.  DUMF 28-35.  
Further, defendant argues, product
misuse is a complete defense to strict product liability if plaintiff’s injury
resulted from an unforeseeable abuse or alteration of the product.  Campbell v. Southern Pacific Co.
(1978) 22 Cal.3d 51, 56.  “A manufacturer
is required to foresee some degree of misuse and abuse of a product and to take
reasonable precautions to minimize the resulting harm.”  Id. 
If the manufacturer could have foreseen the misuse, it remains liable
unless it provides an adequate warning.  Bunch
v. Hoffinger Industries, Inc. (2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 1278,
1302-03.  Defendant contends that it
warns consumers that using chlorine-containing tablets can result in
degradation of the toilet’s components. 
DUMF 30-32, 35.  The installation
manual contains multiple warnings.  DUMF
31-35.  The subject toilet lid contained
a label to not use chlorine-based disinfectants in the toilet tank  DUMF 46-47. 
Defendant argues that it is uncontroverted that the Choo family
“flagrantly failed to follow the clear, conspicuous warnings plastered on the
lid of the subject toilet tank and mentioned numerous times in the Installation
Manual.”  The Choo family (via their
housekeeper) adopted a pattern and practice of using chlorine-containing
tablets in their toilet tanks.  The
housekeeper continuously used chlorine tables in their toilets for the eight
years they lived in the home prior to the incident.  DUMF 12-13. 
There was a chlorine tablet in the toilet tank at the time of the
January 23, 2019 inspection of the subject toilet.  DUMF 42. 
Toto’s experts “thoroughly examined and studied and photographed the
subject toilet and found that the degradation and corrosion are the root cause
of the leak resulting in the flood on the day of the incident.”  According to defendant’s expert David
Nichols-Roy, he opines that the introduction of the in-tank bowl cleaners in
the subject toilet tank, which allowed for a high concentration of chlorine,
was the proximate cause of the deterioration of multiple tank components.  “This led to the failure of the latching
rails on the subject fill valve’s inlet riser tables, which holds the valve
together under pressure.  That failure
then allowed the valve to separate and resulted in uncontrolled flow of water
into the Plaintiff’s insured’s residence.” 
Nichols-Roy decl., ¶¶9-10. 
According to defendant’s expert James Doi, Ph.D., plastics are subject
to a failure mechanism called Environment Stress Cracking (“ESC”) wherein a
mechanical part will fracture along stress lines when the part is in contact
with corrosive environments.  Doi decl., ¶7.  ESC occurs with some plastics in wet
environments with high chlorine concentrations. 
Id., ¶8.  He opines that the
subject fill valve stem, which is plastic, fractured because of the presence of
the bromine and chlorine-containing cleaning tablets placed in the subject
toilet tank.  Id., ¶10.
Defendant also notes that during
the January 29, 2019 inspection, it was observed that there had been
overtightening of the mounting nut on the fill valve.  DUMF 59. 
Defendant asserts that the presence of tool marks on the mounting nut is
evidence that the mounting nut was tightened after the toilet left Toto’s
control, as the type of socket took that Toto uses at its manufacturing plant
to tighten the mounting nut on the fill valve does not leave visible contact
marks on the mounting nut.  As such,
defendant argues, the mounting nut on the fill valve was overtightened by a
third party, although the Installation Manual stated to not over-tighten the
nut at the fill valve.  
In opposition, plaintiff argues
that the use of in-tank cleaning tablets did not cause or contribute to the
incident.  Plaintiff contends that the
chemical degradation only occurred after the subject fill valve was sealed in a
pool of water with an in-tank cleaning tablet for six months.  Plaintiff presents the declaration of expert
Bruce Agle who explains that after the incident, on July 23, 2018, he inspected
and photographed the subject toilet at the insureds’ home.  The interior tank contained a white cleaning
table, a flush valve flapper, and the subject fill valve, which had separated
inside the tank   The latching rails (aka
as “tables”) of the fill valve were fractured and were floating in the tank.  Agle decl., ¶7.  On July 26, 2018, the toilet and component
parts were removed to 4xForensic for storage. 
Id., ¶8.  On July 27, 2018,
further photographs were taken.  The
fractured latching tabs were sealed in a plastic bag and placed inside the
tank.  The fill valve remained in the
tank in approximately ¼ to ½ inch of standing water with the in-tank cleaning
tablet.  The toilet was wrapped in
plastic and stored.  Id., ¶9.  A joint inspection was held on January 23,
2018, and he attended four other inspections. 
Id., ¶11.  He opines that the
initial inspection of the toilet on July 27, 2019 did not reveal any
significant degradation to the subject fill valve, fractured latching tabs, or
any other component parts.  Id., ¶13.  At the time of the inspection, however, the
fill valve and toilet tank were severely degraded and no longer in their
post-loss condition.  The toilet and fill
valve degraded due to being sealed with the chlorine tablet in the tank for
nearly six months.  Id., ¶14.
According to expert Agle’s
declaration, the subject fill valve did not fail due to the use of in-tank
cleaning tablets because (1) no bleaching patters indication of chemical
degradation were present on the fill valve at the time of the initial
inspection on July 27, 2018.  Rather, the
pattern of in-service degradation found on the latching tab fracture surfaces
was due to stress whitening consistent with a creep rupture failure, not
chemical degradation; (2) the fracture of the latch tabs originated in the
region of the tabs with the most stress and the least amount of chlorine
degradation, consistent with stress causing the failure, not degradation; (3)
the metallographic evaluation of the latch tabs revealed that the sharp inner
corners had significantly less material degradation than the rest of the
latching tab.  Had degradation been the
major cause of failure, the fracture would not have originated in the center of
sharp inner radius; and (4) the metallographic evaluation revealed that the
sharp inner corners had less chlorine and bromine than the outer regions of the
latching tab, consistent with degradation not being the primary factor.  Id., ¶18.
Agle further opines that the
subject fill valve failed due to defects in the design, manufacturing, and
assembly of the product, including inadequate design of the stress risers, the
improper alignment of the glass fibers, poor bonding of materials, the location
of the mold gate, porosity at the location of the latching tabs, and
overtightening of the mounting nut by manufacturer Toto.  Id., ¶¶19-24. 
Agle further opines that the incident was not caused by environmental
stress cracking, explaining that ESC is demonstrated with evidence of cracking
and crazing on the surface, and that the fractured surface of the latching tabs
showed no evidence of cracking and crazing. 
Id., ¶25.  He opines that had
Lavelle properly manufactured the fill valve to avoid improper alignment of the
glass fibers and porosity and had Toto properly assembled the fill valve to
avoid overtightening of the mounting nut, the product would not have
failed.  Id., ¶27.
Plaintiff also presents the
declaration of expert Duane B. Priddy, Ph.D, who also opined that the use of
in-tank cleaning tablets did not cause or contribute to the subject
incident.  Priddy decl., ¶9.  He states that the subject fill valve failed
due to defects in the design and manufacturing of the product.  Id., ¶¶10-15. 
He opines that had the mold of the subject valve been properly designed
to avoid improper fiber alignment and undue stress on the latching tabs, the
product would not have failed.  Id., ¶17.
In reply, defendant disputes that
there was no degradation at the time of the incident and that plaintiff’s
photographs from that date show that the outlet restrictor is a different color
from its “pristine” state and depict only about 5% of the original size and
that the flapper is deformed, wrinkled, and discolored.  Defendants also assert that plaintiff’s
storage “compromised the evidence and led to spoliation of the evidence.”  The court declines to consider as it was
raised for the first time in the reply. 
Defendant further argues that plaintiff’s contention that Toto
overtightened the mount nut has no bearing. 
Defendant also contends that plaintiff’s claim that environmental stress
cracking is not the cause of the failure is flawed because the testing
conducted by Dr. Priddy is inappropriate testing.
The court finds that there are
triable issues of material fact as to whether the subject toilet and/or its
component parts were defective and whether such defects caused the
incident.  There are experts on both
sides that opine as to what caused the incident and to what extent, including whether
it was from defective parts, or overtightening of the mounting nut, or
plaintiff’s insured’s use of chlorine tablets.
 
            Issue No. 2:  Plaintiff cannot prevail on its negligence
cause of action against Toto because there is no evidence that Toto was the
legal cause of plaintiff’s damages.
“As with an action asserted under a
strict liability theory, under a negligence theory the plaintiff must prove a
defect caused injury.”  Chavez v.
Glock, Inc. (2012) 207 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1304-05 (citation omitted).
Defendant argues that plaintiff’s
claim for negligence fails for all the same reasons as its products liability
claim because there is a lack of proof of causation.
In opposition, plaintiff argues the
same as under Issue 1.
The court finds that triable issues
exist as to whether a defect existed and what caused the incident.
 
            Issue No. 3:  Plaintiff cannot prevail on its breach of
warranty cause of action against Toto because there was no privity of contract
between plaintiff’s insured and Toto, as such, the express warranty did not
apply to plaintiff’s insured.  In
addition, plaintiff’s insured did not fulfill the required conditions of the
subject toilet’s warranty.
            Defendant contends that the express
warranty states that a consumer is only entitled to the warranty on the subject
toilet for one year.  DUMF 35-36.  The Choo family purchased the property in
2010, which already housed the subject toilet. 
DUMF 1, 3.  No claim was brought
within a year.  Also, defendant argues, a
warranty may be excluded by a disclaimer established through an adequate
written warning accompanying the product. 
It asserts that it included several disclaimers pertinent to the matter
including the warning that Toto “shall not be responsible or liable for any
failure of, or damage, to this Product caused by either chloroamines in the
treatment of public water supply or cleaners containing chlorine. . . .”  Defendant reiterates that the evidence shows
that the Choo family housekeeper used chlorine-containing tablets in the toilet
tank and that it caused degradation of some level to the toilet tank.  Further, defendant  asserts, one of the disclaimers was that the
warranty was only available to the original purchaser, and that the Choo family
did not purchase the toilet and thus was not in privity with Toto.
            Plaintiff does not address in the
opposition, and thus, has not met its burden to raise a triable issue of
material fact.   
            Evidentiary objections
            Plaintiff’s objections are
OVERRULED.
            Defendant Toto’s objections are
OVERRULED.
            Accordingly, the motion for summary
judgment is DENIED.  The motion for
summary adjudication is DENIED as to Issues 1 and 2 and GRANTED as to Issue 3.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of ruling.

BACKGROUND
On December 2, 2020, Federal
Insurance Company filed a subrogation complaint against Toto U.S.A., Inc. and
Lavelle Industries, Inc. for (1) product liability, (2) negligence, and (3)
breach of warranty based on losses sustained at 2229 Via Guadalana, Palos Verdes
Estates.

removed to federal court.
            On September 10, 2021, a notice of
remand from federal court was filed.
            On April 18, 2022, the case was
referred to Dept. 1 from the PI Hub for reassignment.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Lavelle Industries, Inc. requests
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to each of the
causes of action:
            Issue No. 1:  Plaintiff cannot establish that its insured
was using the product in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.
            Issue No. 2:  The misuse and modification of the product
constitutes a superseding cause and bars recovery under the 1st and
2nd causes of action. 
            Issue No. 3:  Lavelle is not liable under the 1st
and 2nd causes of action because said injuries were caused by a
third party’s product (Clorox) and Lavelle has no duty related thereto.
            Issue No. 4:  With express to express warranty, the 3rd
cause of action has no merit as admitted by plaintiff and with respect to
implied warranties, the 3rd cause of action fails due to lack of
privity.
            The complaint alleges that prior to
July 2018, defendants designed, manufactured, distributed, specified, and sold
a toilet, fill valve, and associated components to plaintiff’s insured.  As a result of premature failure and
unintended catastrophic damage and flooding in and about the subject toilet and
fill valve, and consequent damage to the premises, the insured suffered damages
totaling $4,091,961.  Pursuant to its
policy of insurance, plaintiff paid its insured.
            The parties do not dispute that the
subject toilet (model MS864114L) was manufactured by Toto in 2007.  Defendant’s Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts (“DUMF”) 1.  The subject
fill valve (a PGT5 model) was assembled by Lavelle in 2007.  DUMF 2. 
The PGT5 model fill valve was an OEM part sold by Lavelle to Toto in
bulk.  DUMF 3.  The subject fil valve left Lavelle’s
possession in 2007, and Lavelle did not thereafter possess the fill valve at
any time.  DUMF 4.  Lavelle never had possession of the subject
toilet.  DUMF 7.  The Choos (the Insured) purchased the subject
residence in 2010.  DUMF 8.  Plaintiff issued a policy of insurance to the
Choos and received premiums.  DUMF
9.  The insured was not the original
purchaser of the subject toilet or subject fill valve.  DUMF 10. 
The insured’s housekeeper admits to using Clorox tablets in the tank of
the toilet for years.  DUMF 11.  The remains of an in-tank toilet cleaner
tablet were visible in the toilet’s tank at the January 23, 2019
inspection.  DUMF 12.  The underside of the toilet’s tank lid
stated, “DO NOT USE CHLORINE-BASED DISINFECTANTS IN THE TOILET TANK AS THEY MAY
DEGRADE THE COMPONENTS.”  DUMF 13.  The housekeeper did not read any warning
label on the subject toilet.  DUMF
19.  She does not read English or any
instructions on how to use Clorox tablets. DUMF 20, 21.  Lavelle does not manufacture, sell or
distribute any in tank cleaning tablets containing chlorine/bromine.  DUMF 22. 
Lavelle did not provide the Choos with any express warranties with
respect to the subject fill valve.  DUMF
23.  Plaintiff does not have any evidence
to support the cause of action for breach of express warranty.  DUMF 24.
            Plaintiff did not have any
information to dispute that the PGT5 model fill valve sold as an OEM part by
Lavelle to Toto did not include any mounting nut to secure the fill valve to
the floor of the toilet tank.  The mounting
nut is not a Lavelle product.  Kevin Guthie
decl., ¶9.  At the time the toilet left
the Toto factory it was accompanied by an Installation Manual.  Julia Gower decl., Exh. L.  The Installation Manual contained warnings,
including “DO NOT USE IN-TANK BOWL CLEANERS” and to not overtighten the nut at
the fill valve.  Gower decl., Exhs. J, K,
L.
            Superior equities doctrine
            Defendant argues that the superior
equities doctrine bars plaintiff’s subrogation complaint against Lavelle.  “California . . . has adopted the superior
equities doctrine in all cases of equitable or conventional subrogation.”  State Farm General Ins. Co. v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (2006) 143 Cal. App. 4th 1098, 1109.  “When an insurer pursues a cause of action
based on equitable subrogation, it must prove the following elements: . . . .
(5) justice requires that the loss should be entirely shifted from the insurer
to the party to be charged, whose equitable position is inferior to that of the
insurer; . . . The fifth element reflects the rule of superior equities, which
holds that the right of equitable subrogation ‘may be invoked against a third
party only if that party is guilty of some wrongful conduct which make the
party’s equity inferior to that of the surety or insurer.’”  AMCO Ins. Co. v. All Solutions Insurance
Agency, LLC (2016) 244 Cal. App. 4th 883, 897-898.  Defendant contends that plaintiff and its
insured were in the best position to avoid the loss because the insured
procured and paid for insurance to cover property damage and plaintiff received
premiums to cover said property damage. 
The insured had possession of and access to the subject toilet and
subject fill valve from 2010 to 2018 and the insured failed to read or heed any
of the warnings/disclaimers.
            In opposition, plaintiff argues that
the rule of superior equities does not bar plaintiff’s subrogation claim
against Lavelle because it is wholly inapplicable because it is well
established that where a party is alleged to have participated in causing the
loss, the doctrine of superior equities does not apply.  See Dobbas v. Vitas (2011) 191 Cal.
App. 4th 1442, 1451.  As
argued below, plaintiff contends that Lavelle, as manufacturer of the failed
product, was the direct cause of plaintiff’s harm.
 
Issue No. 1: 
Plaintiff cannot establish that its insured was using the product in an
intended or reasonably foreseeable manner under the 1st cause of
action.
“The elements of a strict products
liability cause of action are a [1] defect in the  manufacture or design of the product or a
failure to warn, [2] causation, and [3] injury.”  County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318 (citation omitted).  “A manufacturer is liable only when a defect
in its product was a legal cause of injury. 
A tort is a legal cause of injury only when it is a substantial factor
in producing the injury.”  Soule v.
General Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 572.
Defendant argues that the subject
fill valve was not defective.  Defendant
contends that the use of in-tank cleaning tablets and over-tightening of the
mounting nut, which were contrary to warnings not to do so, cannot be deemed an
“intended or reasonably foreseeable” use. 
Defendant asserts that the subject fill valve was safe for use if the
toilet’s instructions and warnings had been followed.
Defendant presents the declaration
of expert Scott Meek who opines that in-tank cleaning products in a toilet that
is not frequently flushed will release chemicals—primarily chlorine—into the
tank and can degrade the toilet components. 
Meek, ¶5.  The chemical
degradation within the toilet tank was evidenced by modifications to the rubber
flapper of the flush valve.  It was also
evidenced by the whitening/bleaching of multiple components of the fill
valve.  The inlet riser was the component
that had failed, causing the subject water loss.  Id. 
Evidence indicated that the degradation of the fill valve components
resulted from in-tank cleaning chemicals having been added to the water in the
toilet tank and not from potable water being supplied to the toilet.  The surfaces of the inlet riser and its latch
tabs, which had been exposed to water in the toilet tank, had been bleached to
a light gray color.  Chemical analyses
revealed concentrations of chlorine and bromine on the fill valve’s inlet
riser.  Id.  The chemical degradation to the inlet riser’s
failed latch tabs was evidenced by both the presence and the pattern of
bleaching on their surfaces.  Id.  Degradation penetration was documented in the
cross section of a fractured latch table of the inlet riser, the site of the
fill valve failure.  Id.  The chemical degradation was also evidenced
by Oxidative Induction Time (OIT) testing. 
Id.  The toilet and its components
displayed evidence that most of the degradation from exposure to in-tank
cleaning chemicals had occurred during service and not during storage of the
toilet after loss.  Id., ¶6.  Components of the subject toilet fill valve
displayed evidence of the mounting nut having been over tightened, after
leaving the manufacturer’s possession, because the corner at the underside of
the riser flange displayed a pattern of cracking.  Over tightening was also evidenced by the
permanent deflection of the riser flange and contact tool marks on the mounting
nut.  Id., ¶7.  The failure was the result of environmental
stress cracking, in which cracking is produced by the combination of stress and
a corrosive environment.  Id., ¶8.  The failure did not result from creep
rupture.  Id., ¶9.  The design of the fill valve was evaluated by
means of a finite element analysis.  It
indicated that the valve would not fail in normal service, that the valve
design was not defective, and the valve design had not caused the failure.  Id. 
The possibility of reinforcing the fiber orientation and of porosity
having contributed to the failure was evaluated.  Id. 
Meek concludes that there was no evidence of any design defect,
manufacturing defect, or material defect having caused the fill valve
failure.  Id., ¶10.
In opposition, plaintiff argues
that there are triable issues as to whether the use of an in-tank cleaning tab
was the actual cause of the fill valve’s failure and whether the mounting nut
was overtightened by the manufacturer. 
Plaintiff contends that the use of in-tank cleaning tablets did not
cause or contribute to the incident. 
Plaintiff asserts that the chemical degradation only occurred after the
subject fill valve was sealed in a pool of water with an in-tank cleaning
tablet for six months.  
Plaintiff presents the declaration
of expert Bruce Agle who explains that after the incident, on July 23, 2018, he
inspected and photographed the subject toilet at the insureds’ home.  The interior tank contained a white cleaning
table, a flush valve flapper, and the subject fill valve, which had separated
inside the tank   The latching rails (aka
as “tables”) of the fill valve were fractured and were floating in the tank.  Agle decl., ¶7.  On July 26, 2018, the toilet and component
parts were removed to 4xForensic for storage. 
Id., ¶8.  On July 27, 2018,
further photographs were taken.  The
fractured latching tabs were sealed in a plastic bag and placed inside the
tank.  The fill valve remained in the
tank in approximately ¼ to ½ inch of standing water with the in-tank cleaning
tablet.  The toilet was wrapped in plastic
and stored.  Id., ¶9.  A joint inspection was held on January 23,
2018, and he attended four other inspections. 
Id., ¶11.  He opines that the
initial inspection of the toilet on July 27, 2019 did not reveal any
significant degradation to the subject fill valve, fractured latching tabs, or
any other component parts.  Id.,
¶13.  At the time of the inspection,
however, the fill valve and toilet tank were severely degraded and no longer in
their post-loss condition.  The toilet
and fill valve degraded due to being sealed with the chlorine tablet in the
tank for nearly six months.  Id., ¶14.
According to expert Agle’s
declaration, the subject fill valve did not fail due to the use of in-tank
cleaning tablets because (1) no bleaching patters indication of chemical
degradation were present on the fill valve at the time of the initial inspection
on July 27, 2018.  Rather, the pattern of
in-service degradation found on the latching tab fracture surfaces was due to
stress whitening consistent with a creep rupture failure, not chemical
degradation; (2) the fracture of the latch tabs originated in the region of the
tabs with the most stress and the least amount of chlorine degradation,
consistent with stress causing the failure, not degradation; (3) the
metallographic evaluation of the latch tabs revealed that the sharp inner
corners had significantly less material degradation than the rest of the
latching tab.  Had degradation been the
major cause of failure, the fracture would not have originated in the center of
sharp inner radius; and (4) the metallographic evaluation revealed that the
sharp inner corners had less chlorine and bromine than the outer regions of the
latching tab, consistent with degradation not being the primary factor.  Id., ¶18.
Agle further opines that the
subject fill valve failed due to defects in the design, manufacturing, and
assembly of the product, including inadequate design of the stress risers, the
improper alignment of the glass fibers, poor bonding of materials, the location
of the mold gate, porosity at the location of the latching tabs, and
overtightening of the mounting nut by manufacturer Toto.  Id., ¶¶19-24. 
Agle further opines that the incident was not caused by environmental
stress cracking, explaining that ESC is demonstrated with evidence of cracking
and crazing on the surface, and that the fractured surface of the latching tabs
showed no evidence of cracking and crazing. 
Id., ¶25.  He opines that had
Lavelle properly manufactured the fill valve to avoid improper alignment of the
glass fibers and porosity and had Toto properly assembled the fill valve to
avoid overtightening of the mounting nut, the product would not have failed.  Id., ¶27.
Plaintiff also presents the
declaration of expert Duane B. Priddy, Ph.D, who also opined that the use of
in-tank cleaning tablets did not cause or contribute to the subject
incident.  Priddy decl., ¶9.  He states that the subject fill valve failed
due to defects in the design and manufacturing of the product.  Id., ¶¶10-15. 
He opines that had the mold of the subject valve been properly designed
to avoid improper fiber alignment and undue stress on the latching tabs, the
product would not have failed.  Id., ¶17.
The court finds that there are
triable issues as to whether the fill valve was defective and, if so, whether
it substantially caused the incident or if the failure of the fill valve was
the result of the insured’s chlorine tablet use.  There are experts on both sides that opine as
to what caused the incident and to what extent, including whether it was from
defective parts, or overtightening of the mounting nut, or plaintiff’s
insured’s use of chlorine tablets.
 
            Issue No. 2:  The misuse and modification of the product
constitutes a superseding cause and bars recovery under the 1st and
2nd causes of action. 
            Lavelle argues that it cannot be
held liable for any product defect because the incident was caused by the
misuse (use of chlorine/bromine based cleaning tablets) and modification
(overtightening of the mounting nut) of the toilet and fill valve, after leaving
the manufacturer’s possession, constituting a superseding cause.  Lavelle also argues that there is no evidence
of any design defect, manufacturing defect, or material defect having caused
the failure of the subject fill valve. 
See expert Scott Meek decl.
            See under Issue No. 1 for
opposition.  Plaintiff disputes that the
insured’s use of the chlorine tablets caused the fill valve to fail.  Plaintiff contends that the fill valve failed
due to design, manufacturing, and assembly defects.
            The court finds that triable issues
of material fact exist.  See under No. 1.
 
            Issue No. 3:  Lavelle is not liable under the 1st
and 2nd causes of action because said injuries were caused by a
third party’s product (Clorox) and Lavelle has no duty related thereto.
            Defendant argues that the loss was
caused by the insured’s use of Clorox tablets in the tank.  See expert Scott Meek decl.
            See opposition under No. 1.
            The court finds that triable issues
of material fact exist.  See under No. 1.
 
            Issue No. 4:  With express to express warranty, the 3rd
cause of action has no merit as admitted by plaintiff and with respect to
implied warranties, the 3rd cause of action fails due to lack of
privity.
            Plaintiff does not dispute that it
has no evidence to support express warranty. 
See DUMF 23, 24.  Defendant argues
that with respect to implied warranties, the 3rd cause of action
fails because of lack of privity as the insured was not the original purchaser
of the toilet and the subject fill valve was an OEM part sold by Lavelle to
Toto in bulk.
            Plaintiff does not address in its
opposition.
            The court finds that defendant has
met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot establish the elements for
breach of warranty.  Plaintiff has not
provided substantial evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.
            Evidentiary objections
            Plaintiff’s objections are
OVERRULED.
            Defendant Lavelle’s objections are
OVERRULED.
            Accordingly, the motion for summary
judgment is DENIED.  The motion for
summary adjudication is DENIED as to Issues 1, 2, and 3 and GRANTED as to Issue
4.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
