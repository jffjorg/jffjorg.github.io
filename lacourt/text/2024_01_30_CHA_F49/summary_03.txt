And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Mizuho Sato's claim to one-third of the surplus funds from the foreclosure sale of the property at 22227 Shadow Valley Circle. The surplus funds, totaling $330,091.24, were interpleaded with the court. Mizuho Sato, as personal representative of Daniel Rizor's estate, claimed a one-third interest in the surplus funds. However, Steve Rizor, on behalf of his sister January Rizor, filed an opposition to Mizuho Sato's claim, citing documents that show Daniel Rizor relinquished his claims to the property to January Rizor in 2019 and that the court ordered the property to be given to January Rizor in 2022. The judge found that Exhibit A, signed by Daniel Rizor in 2019, shows that he assigned all his interest in the property to January Rizor, and therefore his estate would have no claim to the surplus funds. The judge also found that Exhibit B, a court order, does not mention Daniel Rizor and therefore does not indicate any interest he may have had in the property. As a result, the judge denied Mizuho Sato's claim and ordered the surplus funds to be distributed to January Rizor.
