CLAIMS TO DETERMINE DISBURSEMENT OF SURPLUS FUNDS ON
DEPOSIT
 
MOVING PARTY: Mizuho
Sato, Personal Representative of the Estate of Daniel Kiyoshi Rizor
RESPONDING
PARTY: Steve Rizor on behalf of January Rizor
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Ms. Sato is
requesting that one-third of the funds be distributed to her as personal
representative of the Estate of Daniel Kiyoshi Rizor
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This filing concerns
the disbursement of surplus funds from the foreclosure sale of the property
located at 22227 Shadow Valley Circle, Los Angeles, California, 91311-1253. The
property was sold at a foreclosure sale on April 6, 2023. Surplus funds in the
amount of $330,091.24 have been interpleaded with the Court. 
 
The property
was originally owned by Keiko Rizor. Keiko had three children: Steven Rizor,
Daniel Rizor, and January Rizor. Keiko died intestate on January 18, 2017, and
after her estate was probated, a Final Distribution Order on May 29, 2019,
vested title into her three children.
 
Daniel Rizor
died on March 22, 2022. His wife, Mizuho Sato, was appointed personal
representative of his estate on May 2, 2023. As personal representative, Ms.
Sato now claims a one-third interest in the surplus funds from the sale of the
property
 
Steven Rizor,
on behalf of his sister January Rizor, has filed an opposition to Ms. Sato’s
claim. Steven’s opposition is based on a document that shows that Daniel Rizor
relinquished his claims to the property to his sister January Rizor on November
20, 2019. (Opposition, Ex. A, “Assignment of Inheritance to January Rizor under
Probate Code Section 11604.”) Further, another document was filed with the
opposition that shows that the property was ordered by the Court to be given to
January Rizor on June 3, 2022. (Opposition, Ex. B.)
 
RULING: No
surplus funds shall be distributed to Ms. Sato.
 
Exhibit A to
the opposition, signed on November 20, 2019, shows that Daniel Rizor assigned
all his interest in the property located at 22227 Shadow Valley Circle to his
sister, January Rizor. Therefore, his estate would have no claim to the surplus
funds to be distributed from the foreclosure sale of the property.
 
As for Exhibit
B to the opposition, this court order just shows that Steven Rizor’s interest
in the property was confirmed to January Rizor. It does not mention Daniel
Rizor. Therefore, it is not indicative of any interest that Daniel Rizor may
have had in the property at the time.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Mizuho Sato’s claim to one-third of the surplus funds is denied. The
surplus funds should be distributed to January Rizor.
