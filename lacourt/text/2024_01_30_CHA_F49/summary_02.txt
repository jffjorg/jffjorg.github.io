And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay on the proceedings and re-assign the case to the Court's docket. The plaintiffs may also re-file and re-serve their demurrer and motion to strike. However, the judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to file and serve their First Amended Complaint, which adds Tiana Goshorn as a defendant. The judge found that the plaintiffs' motion did not provide sufficient information to justify the addition of a new defendant and did not comply with the procedural requirements for amending a pleading.
