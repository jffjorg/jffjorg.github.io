And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add several causes of action to the complaint, including a cause of action for fraud. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that it is procedurally defective and that the plaintiff has not explained the delay in bringing the motion. The judge states that the motion does not meet the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which requires that the motion state what allegations are proposed to be added or deleted and provide a clear explanation of the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, and when the facts were discovered. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's motion attempts to add punitive damages allegations back to the complaint that were previously stricken by the court.
