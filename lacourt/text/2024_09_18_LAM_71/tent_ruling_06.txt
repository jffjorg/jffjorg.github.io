[1] Defendant is admonished for violating CRC, Rule
2.108(1), which requires that line on each page must be one and one half
spaced.  Pages 9 to 10 of Defendant’s
opposition includes a bulleted list of objections to Plaintiff’s requested fees
with line spacing that is less than one- and one-half spaces.  Further, Defendant’s lines do not align with
the consecutive line numbers in the left margin of the page.  The Court interprets this formatting to be a
means of submitting an overlong opposition without leave of this Court.  Defendant’s disregard for the Rules of Court
is not acceptable.
