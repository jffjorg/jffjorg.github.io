         vs.
 
GENERAL
  MOTORS, LLC.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV03729
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 18, 2024



 
Defendant General
Motors, LLC’s demurrer to Plaintiff Matthew Vaughn’s first amended complaint is
sustained as to the 5th cause of action with 20 days leave to amend.
Defendant’s
motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
          Defendant General
Motors, LLC (“GM”) (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiff Matthew Vaughn’s (“Vaughn”)
(“Plaintiff”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) on the grounds Plaintiff cannot
state his 5th cause of action[1] for
fraudulent inducement – concealment against it because the cause of action is
barred by the applicable statute of limitations; the claim fails to plead
essential elements to state a cause of action; and fails to allege a
transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
          Defendant
also moves to strike portions of Plaintiff’s FAC.  (Notice of MTS, pg. 2.)
 
1.    
Demurrer
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendant’s counsel declares that
on June 27, 2024, counsel for Defendant met and conferred telephonically with
Plaintiff’s counsel, and the parties were unable to reach an agreement.  (See Decl. of Quezada ¶2.)  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendant’s demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed his initial Complaint on February 14, 2024, against Defendant.  Plaintiff filed the operative FAC against
Defendant on May 9, 2024, alleging five causes of action: (1) violation of
Civil Code §1793.2(D); (2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(B); (3) violation of
Civil Code §1793.2(A)(3); (4) breach of implied warranty of merchantability
(Civ. Code §§1791.1, 1794, 1795.5); and (5) fraudulent inducement-
concealment.  Plaintiff’s causes of
action arise from his entry into a warranty contract with Defendant on January 3,
2021, regarding the purchase of a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 at AutoNation
Chevrolet Valencia (“Subject Vehicle”). 
(See FAC.)
          Defendant
filed the instant demurrer and accompanying motion to strike on June 28,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on September
5, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on September
6, 2024.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendant demurs
to the 5th cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment on the basis the
claims is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, fails to plead essential
elements to state claims, and fails to allege
a transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose.  (Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Fraudulent
Concealment (5th COA)
The required
elements for fraudulent concealment are: “(1) concealment or suppression of a
material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the
plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally
concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact
and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the
concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact.”  (See Bank of America Corp. v. Superior
Court (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 862, 870; Civ. Code §1710(3); CACI 1901.)  The rule of specificity of pleading is only
intended for affirmative fraud cases not fraud by concealment.  (See Alfaro v. Community Housing
Improvement Systems & Planning Association, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th
1356, 1384.)
Plaintiff failed
to plead with sufficient particularity the defect Defendant allegedly
concealed. The FAC merely describes a list of ways in which Chevrolet Silverado
1500 transmissions may be defective – e.g. “hard or harsh shifts, jerking,
lurching, hesitation on acceleration, surging and/or inability to control the
vehicle’s speed, acceleration, or deceleration (“Transmission Defect”)” and
hazardous driving conditions relating generally to the purported transmission
defect in technical service bulletins (“TSBs”).  (FAC ¶¶63-72). Plaintiff does not allege what
the defect is, let alone the defect in the Subject Vehicle, which is
insufficient to establish Plaintiff’s fraud claim.  (See Santana v. FCA US LLC (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 334, 345 [“The very existence of a warranty presupposes that some
defects may occur. Thus, the occurrence of a few defects that . . . mostly
involved vehicles Santana did not own, is not enough to demonstrate an intent
to conceal a defect.”].)
Further,
Plaintiff fails to allege what representations GM made to this particular
Plaintiff regarding the Transmission Defect that this Plaintiff relied on in
purchasing the Subject Vehicle.  Plaintiff does not plead that GM made any
specific representations directly to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff does not allege
any direct contact with GM before purchasing the Subject Vehicle where
representations regarding the Transmission Defect at issue should or could have
been revealed.  Merely alleging that GM omitted facts about an alleged
Transmission Defect in TSBs is not sufficient to establish: (1) knowledge of a
particular defect in a particular vehicle, or (2) intent to conceal this
particular knowledge from this particular Plaintiff.  (See Tenzer v.
Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 18, 30 [“something more than
nonperformance is required to prove the defendant’s intent not to perform his
promise”]; American Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1367, 1378 [“A TSB is not and cannot fairly be construed by a trial
court as an admission of a design or other defect, because TSBs are routinely
issued to dealers to help diagnose and repair typical complaints.”].) 
Plaintiff has
also failed to show GM had a duty to disclose to Plaintiff.  (LiMandri
v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336 [“There are ‘four circumstances
in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the Plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the Plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the Plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts.’”].)  Plaintiff fails to allege a transactional
relationship with GM that would invoke a duty on the part of GM to disclose to
Plaintiff.  (Id. at pgs.
336-337.)  
Further,
Plaintiff fails to allege that GM had exclusive knowledge of the purported
transmission defect at the time of sale to trigger a duty to disclose.  (Id. at pg. 337 [stating duty to
disclose may exist “when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material
facts not known to the Plaintiff”]; see FAC ¶73.)  First, Plaintiff’s allegation regarding
“pre-production testing data” is insufficient to allege what the testing
revealed or tie it to the alleged defects at issue here.  Second, Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations
regarding consumer complaints fail to allege any connection between the issues
raised in those unspecified consumer complaints and Plaintiff’s experiences
with the Subject Vehicle.  Finally, assuming
GM’s knowledge of each consumer complaint relating to the Chevrolet Silverado
1500 transmission, it does not follow that GM knew the Subject Vehicle’s
transmission was defective, much less that there was any supposed common
defect.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
Statute of
Limitations
A demurrer lies
only where the dates in question are shown on the face of the complaint. If
they are not, there is no ground for general or special demurrer. (Union
Carbide Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 15, 25.)  A court may sustain a demurrer on the ground
of failure to state sufficient facts if “the complaint shows on its face the
statute [of limitations] bars the action.”  (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Services
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)  A
demurrer is not sustainable if there is only a possibility that the cause of
action is time-barred; the statute of limitations defense must be clearly and
affirmatively apparent from the allegations in the pleading.  (Id. at pgs. 1315-1316.)
When evaluating
whether a claim is time-barred, a court must determine (1) which statute of
limitations applies and (2) when the claim accrued.  (Id. at pg. 1316.)  The statute of limitations under C.C.P §338(d)
states: “An action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake. The cause of
action in that case is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the
aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.”  (C.C.P §338(d).)
Here, the
operative portion of the statute is “until the discovery, by the aggrieved
party, of the facts constituting the fraud.”  (C.C.P. §338(d); see also Britton v.
Girardi (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 721, 734 [stating cause of action is not
deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the
facts constituting the fraud].)
Defendant’s
argument that the Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment occurred at the time of the
sale of the Subject Vehicle in or around January 3, 2021, and Plaintiff filed
this action on February 14, 2024, is misplaced. 
Under C.C.P. §338(d), the cause of action accrues once the plaintiff
discovers the facts constituting the fraud.  (C.C.P. §338(d).)  
That the alleged
fraudulent inducement-concealment occurred on the date of sale does not
establish that Plaintiff discovered the facts constituting fraud on that date.  (See Broberg v. Guardian Life Insurance Co.
of America (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 912, 921 [“When a plaintiff reasonably
should have discovered facts for purposes of the accrual of a cause of action .
. . is generally a question of fact, properly decided as a matter of law only
if the evidence (or, in this case, the allegations in the complaint and facts
properly subject to judicial notice) can support only one reasonable
conclusion.”].) 
Here, Plaintiff
allege that GM’s fraudulent inducement-concealment occurred, not only at the
time of sale, but every time that Plaintiff presented Subject Vehicle to Defendant’s
dealership(s) with concerns related to the Transmission Defect and up through
the time that Plaintiff filed his Complaint. (FAC ¶¶23-24.)  Consequently, the statute of limitations
defense is not clearly and affirmatively apparent from the allegations in the
FAC and cannot be asserted on demurrer.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend.
Moving Party to
give notice.
 
2.    
Motion to Strike
In light of this
Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendant’s motion to strike is denied as moot.
