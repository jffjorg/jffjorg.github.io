And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $31,978.00. The plaintiff, Linda Lee-Tucker, is seeking attorneys' fees and costs related to her lemon law action against General Motors, LLC. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion, but reduced the amount of the award from the requested $53,135.04.

The court found that the plaintiff's counsel's hourly rates were reasonable, and that the fees incurred were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The court also denied the defendant's objections to some of the billed hours, finding that they were not well-taken.

The court did not award the plaintiff's requested costs of $2,448.49, as the proper procedure for determining costs was not followed. The court will not rule on the plaintiff's request for costs until a Memorandum of Costs is filed.

The court's decision is based on California Civil Code §1794(d) and California Code of Civil Procedure §998. The full text of the tentative ruling is included above.
