Background
On
August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award Denying
Removal of the Case “Crupi v. USC” From Jams, and/or Requesting to Remove the
Case from Jams (“Petition”).  Plaintiff’s
Petition arises out of an arbitration between Plaintiff and the University of Southern
California (“USC”) over which JAMS is presiding, JAMS Case No. 5220000062
(“Underlying Arbitration”).  The
Underlying Arbitration, which was initiated on November 12, 2021, and is still
pending, involves a whistleblower employment dispute between Plaintiff and the
USC.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.) 
On June
16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request in the Underlying Arbitration to remove the
case from JAMS.  (D-RJN, Exh. B.)  On January 18, 2023, Hon. Jackson Lucky issued
a ruling denying the request for removal, finding that Plaintiff’s request
failed both procedurally and substantively, in part because Plaintiff had
waived her right to request removal.  (D-RJN,
Exh. C.)  Plaintiff then informally requested
an appeal of Hon. Jackson Lucky’s decision regarding removal.  (D-RJN, Exh. D.)  On July 26, 2023, Hon. Jackson Lucky denied
the request for appeal, explaining that Plaintiff did not have a right to
appeal the ruling.  (D-RJN, Exh. E.) 
JAMS
filed its Motion to Dismiss Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award (“Motion to Dismiss”)
on January 19, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on February 8, 2024.  After a hearing on May 20, 2024, this Court
issued an order granting Defendant’s motion and dismissing Plaintiff’s
Petition.  (5/20/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on June 17, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on September 5, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
While styled as a “Motion to Vacate,”
Plaintiff’s Motion is in fact a request that the court reconsider its May 20,
2024, Order. 
C.C.P. §1008(a) provides that a party affected
by a court’s order may apply to the court “to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order” “based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law.”  (C.C.P.
§1008(a).)
A motion for reconsideration must be made
within 10 days after service of written notice of entry of an order.  (C.C.P. §1008(a).)
 
Discussion
Defendant served the Notice of Entry of Minute
Order on Plaintiff via email on May 23, 2024.  (5/23/24 Notice of Entry of Minute Order POS.)

Plaintiff did not file the instant motion for
reconsideration until June 17, 2024, well past the 10-day deadline required
under C.C.P. §1008(a).
Having failed to timely file her motion, this
Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the motion.  (See In re Marriage of Furie (2017) 16
Cal.App.5th 816,
831 [a judge does not have jurisdiction to
consider a motion for reconsideration that is untimely].)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
denied. 
Moving Party to give notice.
