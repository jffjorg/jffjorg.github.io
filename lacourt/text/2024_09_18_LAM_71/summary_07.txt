And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Annunziata Crupi's motion for reconsideration of the May 20, 2024, order that granted Defendant JAMS, Inc.'s motion to dismiss her petition to vacate an arbitration award. The judge found that the motion was filed outside of the 10-day deadline required under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1008(a) and therefore has no jurisdiction to consider it. The judge notes that Plaintiff's motion is actually a request to reconsider the order, which must be made within 10 days after service of written notice of entry of the order.
