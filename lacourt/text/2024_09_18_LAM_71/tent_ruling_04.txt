 Hearing Date:  September 18, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Linda Lee-Tucker’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $31,978.00.
The
Court does not rule on Plaintiff’s request for costs in the instant motion.

 
Plaintiff Linda Lee-Tucker (“Lee-Tucker”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding her a total of $53,135.04 in attorneys’
fees against Defendant
General Motors, LLC (“GM”) (“Defendant”), consisting of (1) $34,953.00 in
attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (“SLP”); (2) a 1.35 multiplier
enhancement on the attorney fees (or $12,233.55); (3) $2,448.49 in costs and
expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500.00 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review
Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and attend the hearing on this Motion. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. i; Civ. Code §§1794(d), 998.)  
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s 9/11/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Ryan Kay (“Kay”) is sustained as to Nos. 1, 2,
and 3. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff’s 6/24/24 request for
judicial notice of Exhibits 1-19 is denied as irrelevant.
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”).  Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s C.C.P. §998
offer of compromise (“998 Offer”) on March 25, 2024,
in the amount of $45,000.00 plus attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses by
motion.  (Decl. of Castro ¶40, Exh. 3.)  
On
June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  On September 5, 2024, Defendant filed its
opposition.  On September 11, 2024,
Plaintiff filed her reply.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
C.C.P. §998(c)(1) provides as follows:
“If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to
obtain a more favorable judgment or
award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her post offer costs and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the time of the
offer.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(1).) 
“In determining whether the plaintiff obtains a more
favorable judgment, the court . . . shall exclude the post offer costs.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(2)(A).)  “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,
the costs under this section, from the time of the offer, shall be deducted
from any damages awarded in favor of the plaintiff.”  (C.C.P. §998(e).)
Section 998’s plain language only
penalizes plaintiffs who “fail[] to obtain a more favorable judgment or award”
than a §998 offer by cutting off their post-offer costs and requiring them to
pay “defendant’s [post-offer] costs” out of any “damages awarded.”  (C.C.P. §§998(c)(1), (e).) 
A party who settles cannot “fail” to
obtain a more favorable “judgment or award.” “Fail[ure]” connotes defeat,
abandonment, or “[i]nvoluntarily” falling short of one’s purpose.  (Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor America (2023)
90 Cal.App.5th 385, 413-414, citing Burton’s Legal Thesaurus (3d ed. 1998) p.
228, col. 1, Black’s Law Dict. (rev. 4th ed. 1968) at pg. 711, col. 1; accord
Cambridge Dict. Online (2023) [“fail” means “to not succeed in what you are
trying to achieve”].)  Section 998(d) is
explicit: A “judgment or award entered pursuant to this section shall be deemed
to be a compromise settlement.” 
(C.C.P. §998(d).) 
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the 998 Offer.  (See Decl. of Castro ¶40, Exh. 3 at
¶3.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is
proper.
 
Civil Code §1794(d)
Civil Code §1794(d) provides, “[i]f the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates: (1) Mana Arabi at $525 per hour;
(2) Hector Calderon (legal assistant) at $285 per hour; (3) Eve Canton (law
clerk) at $325 per hour; (4) James Carroll at $595 per hour; (5) Christian
Castro at $475 per hour; (6) Tionna Carvalho at $550 per hour in 2022, and $595
in 2024; (7) Mark Gibson at $495 per hour; (8) Daniel Law at $495 per hour; (9)
Regina Liou at $475 per hour in 2023, and $525 in 2024; (10) David Lunn at $650
per hour; (11) Maro Orte at $495; (12) Ian McCallister at $595 per hour; (13)
Nino Sanaia at $425 per hour; (14) Tyson Smith at $525 per hour; (15) Rosy
Stoliker at $425 per hour; and (16) Anna Weiser at $525 per hour.  (Decl. of Shahian ¶¶46-77, 79, Exh. 20 at pg.
4.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently
demonstrated her counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in their community of
practice in their specialized area of law. 
(Decl. of Shahian ¶¶46-77, 79, Exh. 20 at pg. 4.)  Further, Defendant’s opposition does not
object to the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate to be reasonable and does not warrant a
reduction.  
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Plaintiff’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on 71.8 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this
case through the instant motion.  (See Decl. of Shahian
¶79, Exh. 20 at pg. 3.)  The fees
incurred are reasonable, as captured in the billing records submitted to this
Court.  (Decl. of Shahian ¶79, Exh. 20.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect
the actual time and clear descriptions of services performed in connection with
litigating this case.  Although the
submission of such detailed time records is not necessary under California law,
if submitted, such records “are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.”  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
Defendant objects[1] to several of Plaintiff’s
requested fees on the basis they were not reasonably incurred.
First,
Defendant objects to Tionna Carvalho’s November 17, 2022, billing of 0.5 hours
($275.00) to review and finalize Plaintiff’s Complaint for filing.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant’s objection is not well taken;
Defendant merely speculates, “It could not have taken Ms. Carvalho more than
fifteen minutes to review and otherwise modify these documents for use in this
case.”  (See Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564 [“[G]eneral arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice”].) 
Therefore, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Second,
Defendant objects to James Carroll’s March 28, 2023, billing of 4.1 hours
($2,439.00) to draft and finalize discovery responses and organize document
production on the basis Plaintiff’s responses were templated.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant’s objection is not well taken;
Defendant does not cite any authority stating discovery responses that are
presumed to be templated should be reduced. 
Further, Defendant’s objection assumes that mechanisms to create
efficiencies in the discovery process should be disfavored by this Court,
resulting in greater overall costs to the public, and is also speculative.  Therefore, Defendant fails to meet its burden
to challenge this fee.
Third,
Defendant objects to 3.0 hours ($1,275.00) billed on June 22, 2023, and
December 7, 2023, to draft and finalize meet and confer letters.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  For the same reasons stated with respect to
the second objection, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Fourth,
Defendant objects to Nino Sanaia’s October 18, 2023, billing of 8.0 hours
($3,400.00) to draft a motion to compel further responses to her Request for
Production and requests this Court reduce the request by 7.0 hours ($2,975.00).  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant argues the time billed on this
matter is excessive and unnecessary because Defendant had already produced all
responsive documents.  (Id.)  Plaintiff’s reply does not argue these fees
were reasonably incurred, thereby conceding her argument on these billed
fees.  (See Reply, pg.
7.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees is reduced by $2,975.00.
Fifth,
Defendant objects to Nino Sanaia’s January 22, 2024, billing of 3.0 hours ($1,305.00)
to draft and finalize a reply brief on a motion to compel on the basis the
reply brief was not “original.” 
(Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant’s
objection is not well taken; Defendant does not cite any authority stating that
a brief presumed to be templated should be reduced.  Further, Defendant’s objection assumes that
mechanisms to create efficiencies in the discovery process should be disfavored
by this Court, resulting in greater overall costs to the public, and is also
speculative.  Therefore, Defendant fails
to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Sixth, Defendant
objects to Nino Sanaia’s October 5, 2023, Anna Weiser’s December 5, 2023, Rosy
Stoliker’s January 30, 2024, Tyson Smith’s March 1, 2024, Mana Arabi’s March
15, 2024, and David Lunn’s March 25, 2024, billing of 9.5 hours total
($4,979.50) to prepare and attend an IDC, attend a hearing on a motion to
compel RFPs, final status conference, and draft an outcome memo, respectively.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant objects on the basis the hours were
block-billed and are too vague to convey what counsel did.  (Id.)  Defendant’s
objection is not well taken because the billing entries are not too vague, nor
are they block billed.  Therefore,
Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge these fees.
Seventh,
Defendant objects to Ian McCallister’s February 6 and 7, 2024, billing of 3.4
hours ($2,023.00) to draft and review motions in limine on the basis the
motions were templated.  (Opposition, pg.
10.)  For the same reasons stated with
respect to the second objection, Defendant fails to meet its burden to
challenge this fee.  For the same reasons
stated with respect to the second objection, in the context of motions in
limine, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Eighth,
Defendant objects to 19 hours ($9,565.00) billed on March 4, 6-8, 11, 14, and
20-21, 2024 to draft Plaintiff’s trial documents, subpoenas, and email exchanges,
on the basis the entries were block-billed. 
(Opposition, pg. 10.)  Some of
Defendant’s objections are indeed block-billed. 
For example, Maro Orte’s March 4, 2024, billing entry for 3.20 hours ($1,584)
is block-billed: “Draft P’s trial documents including exhibit list, witness list,
jury list and instructions, special jury instructions, verdict forms and
statement of the case.”  (Decl. of Shahian
¶79, Exh. 20 at pg. 2.)  While this entry
is not vague, each task billed should be accounted for in a separate billing
entry.  However, the hours billed do not
on their face appear unreasonable or not actually incurred.  Further, the tasks were prepared by a single
attorney, presumably to avoid inefficiencies in delegating related documents.  Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce
Plaintiff’s hours billed for the preparation of trial documents.
Finally, Defendant
objects to Christian Castro’s 7.6 hours ($3,610.00) billed to prepare the
instant attorneys’ fees motion, reply, and to attend this hearing, on the basis
the instant motion is “virtually identical to fee motions Counsel has recently
filed in other Song-Beverly cases against GM.” 
(Opposition, pg. 10.)  For the
same reasons stated with respect to the second objection, Defendant fails to
meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount of
$31,978.00.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court
denies Plaintiffs’ request for a 1.35 lodestar multiplier.  Given the routine work done in this case and
the results obtained in this lemon law area, a multiplier is not appropriate.
Any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in the hourly rates, which
the Court has found to be reasonable.
 
Costs
Plaintiff
requests a total of $2,448.49 in costs in the instant motion.  Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s request for
the costs on the basis Plaintiff failed to file a Memorandum of Costs.  (Opposition, pg. 11.)  Defendant’s objection is well taken because
the proper procedure for determining if costs should be awarded is to file a
Memorandum of Costs that can be challenged by a Motion to Tax Costs.  Further, Plaintiff’s reply indicates she will
file a Memorandum of Costs.
Accordingly,
the Court will not rule on Plaintiff’s request for costs in this motion.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $31,978.00.
The Court does not rule on Plaintiff’s
request for costs in the instant motion.
Moving Party to give notice.
