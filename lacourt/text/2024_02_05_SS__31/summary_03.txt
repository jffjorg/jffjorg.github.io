And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Bird Rides, Inc.'s motion to dismiss or stay the action on the grounds of forum non conveniens. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Bird Rides, Inc. has not met its burden to establish that Utah is a more convenient forum for the litigation. The judge has also considered the private and public interests of the parties and the court, and has found that California has a greater interest in the matter due to the company's headquarters and incorporation in California, and the plaintiff's residency in California. The judge has given notice to the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and has set a hearing date for February 5, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
