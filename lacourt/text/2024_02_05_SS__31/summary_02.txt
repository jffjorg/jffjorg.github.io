And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Diane Hudock-Pleeter et al. to approve a compromise of pending action of a minor, Avery Pleeter, and has denied the petition. The court found that the petition was incomplete and missing several necessary attachments and documentation. Specifically, the court noted that Item 3(g) was not completed, and that the petition failed to provide a copy of Avery Pleeter's medical records and the latest statements from all medical service providers. Additionally, the court found that the petition did not properly indicate the disposition of the net balance and did not provide a signed and printed name on page 7. The court has ordered the petitioner to reserve a new date and file an amended petition, curing the above-noted defects, at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
