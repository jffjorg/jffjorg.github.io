And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, Case No. 22SMCV01175 and Case No. 23SMCV03392, filed by Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee of Upland Mortgage Loan Trust A. The motion is denied.

The judge has granted judicial notice of several documents, including the First Amended Complaint in Case No. 23SMCV03392 and the complaint in the present action. The California FAIR Plan Association, a defendant in Case No. 23SMCV03392, has also requested judicial notice of several documents, including the First Amended Complaint and the Court's minute order.

The judge has considered the factors for consolidation, including timeliness, complexity, and prejudice. The judge has determined that the motion is untimely, as it was filed after the Court had already deemed the cases not related. The judge has also determined that consolidation would be complex and would prejudice the rights of the parties. Therefore, the motion to consolidate the two cases is denied.
