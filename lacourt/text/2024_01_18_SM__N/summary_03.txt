And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Kory Jackson's motion for summary judgment, as there is no triable issue of fact regarding the Plaintiff's claim for nonpayment of rent. The Defendant, Brittne Allen, failed to pay rent owed to the Plaintiff and did not file an opposition to the motion. The Court notes that the Plaintiff informed the Court on May 22, 2023, that possession was no longer at issue, and therefore focuses its analysis on monetary damages only. The Plaintiff provided undisputed evidence that the Defendant was in possession of the premises and failed to comply with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. As a result, the Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment.
