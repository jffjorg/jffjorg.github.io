Analysis
The trial court has discretion to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).) The purpose of consolidation is “to promote trial convenience and economy
by avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues
common to both actions.” (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471,
485.)
 
In deciding whether to consolidate actions, the Court
generally considers the following factors: (1) timeliness of the motion, i.e.,
whether granting consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases
involved; (2) complexity, i.e., whether joining the actions involved would make
the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice, i.e., whether
consolidation would adversely affect the rights of any party. (See State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430-431; Todd-Stenberg
v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Carrington
Mortgage Services, LLC and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee of
Upland Mortgage Loan Trust A (“Plaintiffs”) move to
consolidate this case with Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23SMCV03392 (Hughes
v. California FAIR Plan Association) on the grounds the two cases involve common
issues of fact, law, and common witnesses, and consolidation would save
judicial resources by avoiding two separate cases adjudicated and would avoid
potentially inconsistent results.
 
Notably, this motion was filed on November 13, 2023, and on
November 16, 2023, this Court issued a minute order deeming that the cases were
not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). Further,
Case No. 23SMCV03392 is pending in Department 207, while the present action is
in Department N. Los Angeles Superior Court, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g) provides
that “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department,”
and “[a] motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after
the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been related into a
single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.” Los
Angeles Superior Court, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g) makes clear that “[c]ases may
not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.” Plaintiffs argue
only that the Court’s order deeming the cases not related “appears to have been
in error” (Reply, p. 8, l. 5), but this is not the proper procedure for the
Court to reconsider its order or for Plaintiffs to seek relation of the
actions. Accordingly, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Carrington Mortgage
Services, LLC and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee of Upland
Mortgage Loan Trust A’s Motion to Consolidate Cases 22SMCV01175 and 23SMCV03392
and Vacate Dates is DENIED.
