And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on Defendant Gilbert Azafrani's motion to set aside the default entered against him on March 8, 2022, and to quash the service of summons and dismiss the action. The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The default is set aside because Plaintiff Isabell Jansen failed to serve a statement of damages before entry of default, as required by law. However, the motion to quash the service of summons is denied, and Defendant must file a separate motion for this relief. The judge has also noted that defense counsel's inconsistent use of font and space formatting in the motion and reply makes the motion unnecessarily difficult to read, and has advised counsel to limit font and spacing changes to only necessary changes.
