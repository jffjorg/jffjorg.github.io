[1] The Cross-Complaint erroneously lists two causes of
action labeled “Sixth Cause Of Action.” 
State demurs to the negligence cause of action, which is the last cause
of action alleged in the Cross-Complaint. 
Therefore, to avoid confusion, the Court refers to the negligence cause
of action as the seventh cause of action.
