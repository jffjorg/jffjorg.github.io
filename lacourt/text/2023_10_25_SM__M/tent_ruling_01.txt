Confirm Standard
 
Any party to an arbitration may petition the court to
confirm an arbitration award. (CCP § 1285.) If a petition to confirm an
arbitration award is duly served and filed, the court must confirm the award as
made, unless the court corrects or vacates the award pursuant to a response to
the petition or a petition to correct or vacate the award. (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818
[no authority to alter terms of award absent petition to correct]; see Thriftimart, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 421, 425-26 [an objection to the granting of a motion to
confirm an award is equivalent to a motion to vacate].)
 
A petition to confirm an arbitration award must set forth
the substance of or attach the arbitration agreement, include the name of the
arbitrator, and attach a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrator, if any. (CCP § 1285.4.) The petition must be served no earlier than
10 days, but no later than 4 years, after service of the award on the
petitioner. (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.) If the agreement sets forth a method of
service for the petition, that method holds. (CCP §1290.4(a).) If the arbitration
agreement does not set forth a method, service shall be made in the manner
provided by law for service of summons in an action if the party has not
appeared. (CCP § 1290.4(b).) If the party upon whom the petition is to be made
has appeared, service can be made by noticed motion. (CCP § 1290.4(c).) 
 
A response to a petition must be served and filed within 10
days after service of the petition. The time for response may be extended by an
agreement in writing between the parties or for good cause by order of the
court. (CCP § 1290.6.) 
 
Every
presumption is in favor of the arbitration award. (Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. v. United Rubber Workers of America (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 444,
449.) CCP section 1286.2 provides that “the court shall vacate the award if the
court determines any of the following: (1) [t]he award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue
means.” (CCP § 1286.2(a).) The defendant moving for vacation of an arbitration
award due to corruption, fraud, or other undue means must demonstrate a nexus
between the award and the alleged undue means used to attain it. (Pour Le
Bebe, Inc. v. Guess? Inc. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 833-34.) 
 
Vacate
Standard
 
A request to
vacate or correct an arbitration award must be filed and served within 100 days
of service of the award. (CCP § 1288.) “In order to comply with the purpose of
expeditious resolution of disputes through arbitration, time limits in which to
challenge arbitration awards must be strictly enforced.” (Knass v. Blue
Cross of California
(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 390, 395.) Service of a petition within California shall
be made in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons. (CCP
§1290.4(b)(1).) The timing requirements for filing and serving a petition to
vacate an arbitration award are jurisdictional. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1212; Knass, supra, 228 Cal.App.3d at 395[section 1288’s
timing requirements must be strictly enforced]; Santa Monica Coll. Faculty
Assn. v. Santa Monica Cmty. Coll. Dist. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 538, 545 [“the
filing and service deadline for a petition to vacate is jurisdictional;
noncompliance deprives a court of the power to vacate an award unless the party
has timely requested vacation.”].) Section 1286.4 expressly limits the
court's power to vacate an award, stating that a “court may not vacate an award
unless… a petition or response requesting the award be vacated has been duly
served and filed…”  
 
Judicial review of private arbitration awards is generally
limited to the¿statutory grounds for vacating or correcting an award. (ECC Capital
Corp. v. Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 885,
899-900.) These grounds include: 
 
(1) the
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; 
(2) there
was corruption in any of the arbitrators; 
(3) the
rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral
arbitrator; 
(4) the
arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without
affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted; 
(5) the
rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the
arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor
or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the
controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions
of this title; or
(6) an
arbitrator making the award either: (A) failed to disclose within the time
required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator
was then aware, or (B) was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified
in section 1281.91 but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify
himself or herself as required by that provision. 
 
(CCP § 1286.2(a).) “On its face, the statute leaves no
room¿for discretion. If a statutory ground for vacating the award exists, the
trial court must vacate the award.” (Ovitz v. Schulman (2005) 133
Cal.App.4th 830, 845.)  
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1286.6 provides that the court “shall correct the award and
confirm it as corrected if the court determines that: [¶] (a) There was an
evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of
any person, thing or property referred to in the award; [¶] (b) The arbitrators
exceeded their powers but the award may be corrected without affecting the
merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted; or [¶] (c) The award is
imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the
controversy.”  
 
Analysis
 

Petitioners Patrick DeCarolis and the
DeCarolis Family Law Group (DFLG) move to confirm the Final Arbitration Award
entered by the Honorable Elizabeth R. Feffer (LASC Judge Ret.) (“Arbitrator”)
on April 21, 2023. Respondent Michael Grecco opposes and moves to vacate the
award. Petitioners request sanctions against Respondent and counsel of record,
Melinda Ebelhar of Benedon & Serlin, LLP, in the sum of $7,200.00, on the
grounds that Grecco’s Opposition/Request to Vacate is frivolous and interposed
solely for improper purposes.  The
sanctions matter is scheduled to be heard on November 17, 2023.
 
Petitioners provide a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrator. (Hinds Decl., Ex. A.) Petitioners also attach the subject arbitration agreement.  (Hinds Decl., Ex. B.) On August 24,
2021, Respondent made an arbitration demand for legal malpractice against
Petitioners following the conclusion of the underlying dissolution action.
(Hinds Decl., ¶5.) On November 17, 2021, DFLG made a counterclaim in arbitration
for breach of contract and account stated. (Id. ¶6, Ex. D.) The arbitration
took place from October 31, 2022, to November 15, 2022, via ADR Services, Inc.
The case was arbitrated by Hon. Elizabeth R. Feffer (ret.) (“Arbitrator”). (Id.
¶ 7.) The Arbitrator issued an Interim Award on January 27, 2023. On March 30,
2023, DFLG timely filed a motion to fix the amount of attorneys’ fees and other
awardable costs concurrently with a memorandum of costs and a compendium of
documentary evidence. (Id. ¶ 8.) On April 21, 2023, the Arbitrator held a
hearing on the motion to fix the amount of attorneys’ fees and other awardable
costs. (Id. ¶9; Ex. A at p. 2 ¶3.) The final arbitration award (the “Final
Award”) was issued on April 21, 2023. (Id. at p. 2 ¶3.) 
 
In the Final Award, the Arbitrator
concluded that Respondent’s argument that Petitioners’ presence on February 13,
2020, at an ex parte hearing in family court, or submission of a written
opposition in that matter would have caused the court to deny a second
extension was based “wholly on speculation” and that the Respondent failed to
meet his burden of proving that “the non-appearance at an in-chambers ex parte
proceeding was the proximate cause of the ultimate outcome.” (Id. at pp. 26-28.)
The Arbitrator similarly dismissed all of Respondent’s other contentions of
legal malpractice by Petitioners and additionally concluded that, even if the
Respondent could have met his burden of proof, which he could not, the Respondent
did not establish entitlement to any damages. (Id., at pp. 28-33.)
 
The Arbitrator issued a total award
of $451,146.59 for Petitioners on their counterclaim. The Arbitrator found that
DFLG “met the burden of establishing entitlement to recover on its breach of
contract and account stated theories” and awarded DFLG $69,307.39 in unpaid
legal fees and costs which included interest pursuant to the Professional Services
Agreement. (Id., at p. 33-34.) The Arbitrator also found that DFLG is entitled
to prejudgment interest as well as interest in the amount of $18.90 per day
from the date of the hearing on the motion and until the fees are paid. (Id.,
at p. 40.) The Arbitrator additionally ruled that DFLG was entitled to
recoverable costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to the attorneys’ fees provision
set forth in the Professional Services Agreement which stated that the
prevailing party in legal proceedings pursuant to the Agreement would be
entitled to receive attorneys’ fees and costs. (Id., at pp. 34-40.) The
Arbitrator awarded $257,531 in attorneys’ fees for the work on the arbitration,
$3,600 in attorneys’ fees in connection with the attorney fee motion, costs in
the amounts of $67,595.37, and $36,004.35 in costs pursuant to CCP § 998. (Id.
at 40.)
 
Petitioners meet the procedural
requirements for confirmation. Respondents therefore
have the burden to show one of the statutory grounds for vacating or correcting
the award.
 
Respondents move to vacate pursuant
to section 1286.2(a)(2) and (3), on the grounds that “there was corruption in …
the arbitrator,” and/or “the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced
by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.” Grecco provides a statement attempting
to show this corruption: 
 
“During the arbitration hearing
there were multiple occasions when the participants went ‘off the record’ to
take short breaks. At least twice during those breaks, on two different days, I
personally observed and heard Arbitrator Feffer look at and speak directly to
Patrick DeCarolis, reminding him that she was an experienced family law judge
and that she was available for family law mediations at any time.”
 
(Grecco Decl., ¶ 4.) Grecco does not give any other details
on this subject. Respondents thereby contend that the arbitrator, a former
family law judge and now a private neutral specializing in family law related
mediations and arbitrations, created a substantial impression of possible bias
by “soliciting” DeCarolis for private family law appointments during the
pendency of the arbitration. Respondents argue that this solicitation is in
direct violation of the Ethics Standards for Neutral Arbitrators in Contractual
Arbitration.
 
The Court agrees that such a
statement would show possible bias, if made in the context of an arbitration
hearing. (See Ceriale v. AMCO Ins. Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 500, 506
[“the question is whether ‘a person aware of the facts might reasonably
entertain a doubt that the [arbitrator] would be able to be impartial’ given
the particular circumstances of the case”].) That said, the Court finds that,
as a matter of fact, the arbitrator did not make those solicitations. Grecco
provides an entirely self-serving allegation that he heard the Arbitrator twice
solicit opposing counsel during breaks in the Arbitration. Aside from this
conclusory statement, with contain no details, Grecco provides no corroborating
evidence. For example, Grecco does not provide the declaration of anyone else
who was present and may have heard the comments, including his counsel at the
time. Grecco fails to explain why, for example, his counsel at the arbitration
did not object to the statements at the time or submit a declaration
corroborating Grecco’s assertions. On the other hand, Hinds, DeCarolis and the
Arbitrator herself submitted declarations that the Arbitrator did not make such
comments. (Feffer Decl., ¶¶5-7; Supp. Hinds Decl., ¶ 12; DeCarolis Decl., ¶¶
6-10.) Notably, Grecco did not raise this issue until he submitted a State Bar
complaint against opposing counsel, apparently after the award was
issued. (DeCarolis Decl., ¶ 12.)  The
Court also notes that the family law judge, Judge Giza found that Grecco lacked
credibility and engaged in “suspect” litigation behavior, as well as
sanctioning him $8,000 pursuant to Family Code § 271 for intentionally trying
to frustrate the divorce proceedings or unreasonably increasing the cost of
litigation.  Combined, the Court
concludes that Grecco’s allegations lack credibility.  
 
Therefore, the Court finds no
grounds for vacating or correcting the award. Accordingly, the motion to
confirm the final arbitration award is GRANTED.
