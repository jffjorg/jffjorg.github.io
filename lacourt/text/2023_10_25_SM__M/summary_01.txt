And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to confirm an arbitration award in the case of DeCarolis et al. v. Grecco. The arbitrator, Elizabeth R. Feffer, issued a Final Award on April 21, 2023, ordering Michael Grecco to pay Patrick DeCarolis and DeCarolis Family Law Group (DFLG) $451,146.59 in damages.

Grecco opposes the confirmation of the award and moves to vacate it, alleging that the arbitrator showed bias during the arbitration hearing. However, the Court finds that Grecco's allegations lack credibility and that his motion to vacate the award is frivolous.

The Court grants the motion to confirm the Final Award and finds that the award is not subject to vacatur or correction. The Court also awards sanctions against Grecco in the amount of $7,200.00 for filing a frivolous motion.

The hearing on this matter is scheduled for October 25, 2023.
