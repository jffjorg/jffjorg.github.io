MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Roberta F. Morrissey,
as trustee to the Roberta F. Morrissey Trust, dated September 15, 1993          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Redwood Holdings, LLC, as plaintiff in Case No. 24PDUD02239,
and as a defendant in the pending action
Motion to Relate and Consolidate Cases
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Roberta F. Morrisey, as trustee to the Roberta F. Morrissey
Trust, dated September 15, 1993 (“Morrisey”) moves the court for an order (1) deeming
this action, filed by Morrisey on June 24, 2024 against defendants Mortgage
Assets Management, LLC, PHH Mortgage Corporation, and Redwood Holdings, LLC
(“Redwood”) on June 24, 2024 (Case No. 24STCV15755) (the “Civil Action”), and the
unlawful detainer action filed by Redwood on June 26, 2024, against Morrisey
(Case No. 24PDUD02239) (the “Unlawful Detainer Action”), to be related cases
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300, and (2)
consolidating the Civil Action and Unlawful Detainer Action for all purposes. 
            The court finds that Morrisey did
not properly serve the parties in the Civil Action and Unlawful Detainer Action
with this motion.
A motion to consolidate “[m]ust be served on all attorneys of record
and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated .
. . .”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.350,
subd. (a)(2)(B).) 
Morrisey filed and served this motion on the named defendants by mail
on July 15, 2024, before the defendants appeared in this action.[1]
 (July 15, 2024 POS-030, p. 1, ¶¶ 3, 5,
and p. 3 Mailing List.)  However, because
the defendants had not yet appeared in this action, service by mail was
improper.  Morrisey also did not file a
revised proof of service stating that counsel for the defendants were served
with this motion following their appearance in this action.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.350, subd.
(a)(2)(B).)  Moreover, defendants PHH
Mortgage Corporation and Mortgage Assets Management, LLC did not file an
opposition to this motion or other papers with the court indicating that they
had been served with the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.
The court further notes that, on August 20, 2024, Redwood filed an
opposition to Morrisey’s motion, stating that, although the proof of service
states that Morrisey served Redwood’s agent for service of process with this
motion by mail, Redwood’s agent did not receive the mailing.  (Turner Decl., ¶¶ 5-8; Turner Decl., Ex. 2.)  As of the date that Redwood filed its
opposition, Redwood, its agent for service of process, and its counsel had not
been served with Morrisey’s motion. 
(Turner Decl., ¶ 9.)
             The court therefore denies Morrisey’s motion
to relate and consolidate cases, without prejudice to Morrisey’s filing a
revised motion to consolidate that complies with the service requirements set
forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.350.
 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Roberta
F. Morrissey, trustee to the Roberta F. Morrissey Trust dated September 15,
1993’s motion to relate and consolidate cases, without prejudice. 
            The court orders Roberta F.
Morrissey, trustee to the Roberta F. Morrissey Trust dated September 15, 1993 to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 4, 2024
