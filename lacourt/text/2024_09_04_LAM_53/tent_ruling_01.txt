MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Shahrouz Jahanshahi            
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Corey Parker and Trisha Parker
(1)  
Motion
to Vacate Void Judgment or Order
(2)  
Motion
to Strike and Tax Costs
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion. 
MOTION TO VACATE VOID JUDGMENT OR ORDER
Plaintiff Shahrouz Jahanshahi
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order setting aside the court’s June 15,
2023 order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant Corey Evan Parker
(“Defendant”) and against Plaintiff on the ground that the court’s order and
subsequent judgment are void under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d).
“The court may, upon motion of
the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment
or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and
may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any
void judgment or order.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (d).)  
First, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant (1) committed fraud on the court by
filing an ex parte application to set aside his default, or (2) committed fraud
by concealing evidence from the court regarding Defendant’s failure to timely
file a petition on behalf of Plaintiff, since Defendant’s declaration, filed in
support of his motion for summary judgment, expressly stated that he did not
timely file the petition.  (Mot., pp.
7:26-8:1, 9:1-3 [arguing that Defendant failed to state that the petition was
denied due to Defendant’s missing the deadline]; Nov. 14, 2022 Parker Decl., ¶
14 [“Unfortunately, due to a calendaring error[,] I missed the deadline to file
the petition”].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff
has not shown that the court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment is void on the ground that Defendant did not notify Plaintiff of the
information set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.320.  (Mot., p. 9:4-23.) 
Third, the court notes that
Plaintiff appears to contend that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment,
itself, was void.  (Mot., p. 9:24
[“Parker’s MSJ Is Void On Its Face”].) 
However, section 473, subdivision (d) applies only to “void judgment[s]
or order[s].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (d).)  Moreover, even if Plaintiff
had shown that Defendant’s retainer agreement was invalid, Plaintiff did not
present argument or authority showing that the invalidity of the parties’
retainer agreement rendered the court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment void.  (Ibid.) 
Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that (1) the court’s June 15, 2023
order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant, and (2) the judgment
entered in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on January 4, 2024, are
void.  
The court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate void judgment or order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).)
 
 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE AND TAX COSTS
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) striking Defendant’s
memorandum of costs filed on January 24, 2024, in its entirety, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$6,790.
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant did
not timely file the memorandum of costs because (1) judgment was entered in
this action on January 4, 2024, in which Defendant was awarded costs, (2)
notice of entry of the judgment was served on January 4, 2024, by mail, and (3)
Defendant filed and served his Memorandum of Costs on January 24, 2024, consisting
of 15 days after service of the cost memorandum plus 5 calendar days for
service by mail.  (Jan. 4, 2024 Judgment,
p. 2:5-9; Jan. 4, 2024 Notice of Entry of Judgment, pp. 1, 2 [Certificate of
Mailing]; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1); Code Civ. Proc., §
1013, subd. (a).) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant is
not entitled to costs.  While Plaintiff
contends that Defendant is not permitted to recover costs pursuant to Civil
Code section 1717 (which provides for the recovery of attorney’s fees and costs
in an action on a contract), Plaintiff did not show that Defendant is not
entitled to costs as the prevailing party in this action pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032.  Moreover,
the court finds that Defendant is entitled to costs as the prevailing
party.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds.
(a)(4), (b) [“Except as otherwise provided by statute, a prevailing party is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding”];
Jan. 4, 2024 Judgment.) 
            Third, the court notes that
Plaintiff has not challenged specific requests for costs.  (Mot., p. 4:10-14 [challenging the memorandum
of costs in its entirety].)  “A ‘verified
memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the items
listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486.)  Thus, the court
finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden (1) to challenge specific costs
requested in Defendant’s verified cost memorandum, and (2) to demonstrate that
they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ibid.)  Moreover, even if Plaintiff had met this
burden, the court finds that Defendant has supported his request for costs in
opposition.  (MC-010, ¶¶ 1-2, 4, 11;
Lupton Decl., ¶¶ 3-6; Lupton Decl., Ex. 1 [e-filing fees in the amount of $4,166.50],
Ex. 2 [$150 in jury fees], Ex. 3 [$4,733.75 in deposition costs], Ex. 11 [$5,105.18
in court reporter’s fees].)
            The court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion to strike and tax costs. 
 
            The court also denies Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions. 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Shahrouz Jahanshahi’s motion to
vacate void judgment or order.
            The court denies plaintiff Shahrouz Jahanshahi’s motion strike
and tax costs. 
            The court orders defendants Corey
Parker and Trisha Parker to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  September 4, 2024
