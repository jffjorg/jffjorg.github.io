And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to relate and consolidate two cases: a civil action filed by the plaintiff against Mortgage Assets Management, LLC, PHH Mortgage Corporation, and Redwood Holdings, LLC, and an unlawful detainer action filed by Redwood against the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not properly serve the defendants with the motion, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.350. The court notes that the defendants had not yet appeared in the action at the time of service, and that the plaintiff did not file a revised proof of service stating that counsel for the defendants were served with the motion. The court also notes that Redwood's agent did not receive the mailing of the motion. As a result, the court denies the motion to consolidate without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile a revised motion that complies with the service requirements. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
