ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Minjing Wang (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondent Automation Alliance
Group, LLC (“Respondent”) on February 10, 2023. The Petition initially came for
hearing on April 26, 2023, at which time it was continued to allow Petitioner
to file proof of service of the Petition and the notice of hearing in
accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. (Minute Order, 04/26/23.) The
hearing on the Petition was continued multiple times to allow Petitioner an
opportunity to demonstrate proper service of the papers. Petitioner filed proof
of personal service on February 29, 2024. No response to the Petition has been filed to date. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petitions and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The parties’
arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of service of the
Petition and Notice of Hearing. (Petition, Attachment 4(b), ¶10(c).) It follows
that the Petition and Notice of Hearing must be served in the manner provided
by law for service of a summons, which is set forth at Code of Civil Procedure
section 415.10 to 415.95. Proof of personal service of the Petition and Notice
of Hearing has been filed. Therefore, Petitioner has now demonstrated
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4.
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) No
proof of service is attached to the arbitration award. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).)
However, service of the award with the instant Petition satisfies compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6.
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The Petition was timely served on
February 22, 2024, two years after the award was issued on December 14, 2022.
The Court finds this complies with Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and the
name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4-6.) A copy of the arbitration award is also
provided. (Id. at Attachment 8(c).) Substantively, the Petition
demonstrates that Petitioner is entitled to an award of $24,970.00 from
Respondent. (Id. at Attachment 8(c) at p. 2.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Minjing Wang’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS TO BE
ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER MINJING WANG IN THE AMOUNT OF $24,970.00.
PETITIONER IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
