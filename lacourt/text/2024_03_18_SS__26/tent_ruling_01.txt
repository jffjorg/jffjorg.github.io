ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Toby Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Maya
Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) on March 18, 2020. The
case was not at issue until Defendants filed an answer on May 10, 2023. On
February 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motions to compel Plaintiff’s
initial responses to discovery requests. (Minute Order, 02/20/24.) Defendants filed the instant Motion to
Continue Trial on February 15, 2024. A motion to compel further discovery
responses is set for hearing on March 25, 2024. No opposition to the instant
Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Defendants argue that good
cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for June
11, 2024, because additional discovery needs to be conducted. Specifically,
Defendants explain that they have sought discovery but Plaintiff has repeatedly
delayed, causing Defendants to bring discovery motions that were granted on
February 20, 2024. (Motion, Rickett Decl., ¶5.) Even Plaintiff’s supplemental
responses have necessitated a motion to compel further responses, which is set
for March 25, 2024. (Id. at ¶6.) Defendants’ attempt to meet and confer
with Plaintiff regarding these discovery delays have been unsuccessful. (Id.
at ¶¶5-7.) These circumstances are reasonable grounds to continue the trial
date. Defendants are not responsible for the delays in bringing this action to
trial despite it being filed four years ago. After the filing of Defendants’
answer, trial was set for July 11, 2024 and there has been no continuance since
that time. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the factors of Rule
3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance of the trial date. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Maya
Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel’s Motion to Continue the Trial Date is
GRANTED. TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 12, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN
THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. DISCOVERY AND MOTION CUTOFF DATES TO FOLLOW THE
NEW TRIAL DATE.
