The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Continue the Trial Date filed by Defendants Maya Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel. The trial date is continued to November 12, 2024 at 8:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Judge finds that the factors in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance due to the need for additional discovery and the delays caused by the plaintiff's repeated failures to provide timely responses to discovery requests.
