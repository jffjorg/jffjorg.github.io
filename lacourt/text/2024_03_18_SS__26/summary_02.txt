And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Defendants/Cross-Complainants Toryalai Melgerai and Maricela Saucedo. The proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint adds a cause of action for fraud and misrepresentation based on new information obtained in November 2023. The new information shows that the sheer wall installed by Cross-Defendant was installed without a foundation, contrary to representations made by Cross-Defendant. The Court finds that the Cross-Complainants have demonstrated the basis for seeking leave to amend and that Cross-Defendant will not be prejudiced. The First Amended Cross-Complaint is to be filed and served within 20 days of this order.
