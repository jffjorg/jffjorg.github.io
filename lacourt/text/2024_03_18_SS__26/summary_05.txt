And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint filed by specially appearing defendants On the House Homes and Loans, Inc. and Mark Gershick as to On the House Homes and Loans, Inc., but denies it as to Mark Gershick. The Court finds that service on On the House Homes and Loans, Inc. was not compliant with statutory requirements because service was attempted on Diana Gershick, who is not an agent for service of process for the corporation. The Court also finds that service on Mark Gershick was compliant with statutory requirements because service was attempted at his office, which is presumed to be his usual place of business. The Court orders Mark Gershick to file a responsive pleading to the Complaint within 20 days of this order.
