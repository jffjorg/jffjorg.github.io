And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's objections to the document requests. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to provide sufficient responses to the document requests, but the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the defendant's further responses, which were served on March 12, 2024. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declarations filed in support of the motion and reply, in violation of California Rules of Court 3.1110(f)(4). Therefore, the judge could not determine whether the plaintiff's arguments were addressing deficiencies in the original responses or the further responses.
