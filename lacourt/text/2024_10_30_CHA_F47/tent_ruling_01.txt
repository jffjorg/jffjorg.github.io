SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Jorge Arambula Ruiz’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan (the Vehicle) on 5/7/22.  Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.
(Defendant) warranted the Vehicle.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that the Vehicle was delivered to him with
defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty.  Plaintiff
contends that he presented the Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair
facility for warranty repairs on multiple occasions.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was unable
to conform the Vehicle to the applicable express warranty after a reasonable
number of repair attempts.  Plaintiff
contends that the issuance of Technical Service Bulletins evidences the fact
that Defendant had knowledge of the defects with the Vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has failed
to either promptly replace the Vehicle or make restitution in accordance with
the Song-Beverly Act.  
 
On 10/18/23, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty and (3)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2.  The complaint also includes a cause of action
for Negligent Repair against Defendant Neftin Cars, Inc. dba Neftin Volkswagen.  On 11/17/23, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 12/7/23, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, by electronic mail.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.3).  Because Plaintiff’s electronic service of the
discovery was not in accordance with the parties electronic service agreement,
the parties subsequently agreed the discovery would be deemed electronically
served on 1/9/24 making Defendant’s responses due 2/13/24.  (Oaks Decl. ¶6).  On 2/13/24, Defendant served responses to the
document requests by email which asserted objections.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.4; Oaks Decl., Ex.C).  Thereafter, the parties met and conferred
regarding the responses.  (Sogoyan Decl.
¶¶20-26, Ex.5-8; Oaks Decl. ¶¶8-9, Ex.D-E). 
On 3/12/24, Defendant served further responses to the subject document
requests and produced 132 pages of documents. 
(Sogoyan Decl. ¶18, Oaks Decl. ¶¶10-11, Ex.F-1, Ex.F-2).  
 
On 4/1/24, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter.  (Sogoyan Decl. ¶27, Ex.9; Oaks Decl. ¶12,
Ex.G).  On 4/15/24, Plaintiff filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order striking Defendant’s objections and
compelling further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set 1, Request Nos. 1-31.  On 5/30/24,
Defendant served 520 pages of its confidential policy and procedure documents,
subject to the Stipulated Protective Order between the parties.  (Oaks Decl.. ¶14, Ex.H).  On 10/17/24, Defendant filed and served an
opposition to the motion.  On 10/25/24, 2
days late, Plaintiff filed and served a reply. 
See CCP 1005(b) (A reply is due 5 court days, not 5 calendar days
before the hearing date).  Despite the
late filing and service of the reply, it was considered by the Court.  CRC 3.1300(d). 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Although Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant served
further responses to the subject document requests on 3/12/24, Plaintiff fails
to provide a copy of the further responses. 
(See Sogoyan Decl. ¶18). 
Contrary to Plaintiff’s counsel assertion in the supporting declaration,
a copy of Defendant’s further responses are not included as part of Exhibit 4
to the declaration.  (See Sogoyan
Decl., Ex.4).  Nor are the further
responses attached as a separate exhibit to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration.  Although Defendant has provided a copy of the
further responses served on 3/12/24, in violation of CRC 3.1345, Plaintiff has not
included the further responses in the separate statement filed in support of
the motion.  See CRC 3.1345(c)(2);
(See Oaks Decl., Ex.F-1; See Opposition, p.1:13-15).  As a result, the Court cannot determine
whether Plaintiff’s arguments are addressing deficiencies in the original
responses or the further responses which are not included.  Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to establish
that the further responses served on 3/12/24 are deficient.     
 
Additionally, while not the basis for the denial of the
motion, the Court notes that in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4), Plaintiff’s
counsel has also failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the
declaration filed in support of the motion and the declaration filed in support
of the reply.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
