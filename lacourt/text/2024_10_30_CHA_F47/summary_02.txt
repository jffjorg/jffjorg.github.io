And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Diane Taylor vs. Geico General Insurance Company. Geico has filed a motion to compel arbitration of the uninsured motorist claims of its insured, Diane Taylor, with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Taylor has filed a petition to compel arbitration and for an order appointing a neutral arbitrator. The judge has granted Geico's motion and denied Taylor's petition. The parties are ordered to arbitrate their dispute through the AAA. The judge notes that Geico has failed to electronically bookmark its exhibits attached to its motion and opposition papers, and warns counsel for the parties that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in sanctions.
