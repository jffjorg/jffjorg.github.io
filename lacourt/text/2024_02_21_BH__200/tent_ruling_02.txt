[1] Moreover, the Court of Appeal already denied a
petition for writ of mandate concerning denial of the motion. Though the Court
recognizes that this decision does not preclude this motion ((Kowis v.
Howard (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 888, 894), it is still of some
significance that the Court of Appeal reviewed Judge Beaudet’s order denying the
motion to dismiss and found there were not the necessary circumstances to
intervene. 


[2] LASC Rules permit a motion to relate cases to be made
to Dept. 1 if the assigned judge declines to relate cases.


[3] An order is presumed correct even if the record is
silent. The burden is on the challenging party to show otherwise. (People v.
Torres (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 984, 989)


[4]
The Court acknowledges Defendants’ claim of prejudice from delay in an expert
becoming unavailable in the interim. The Court will address this issue
separately at the final status conference. 
 


[5] The Court therefore does not need to reach the issue
whether there would be additional tolling after the period of impossibility is
over. See Chin, supra.  


[6] For these reasons, the Court necessarily rejects the various
calculations on p. 3 of the Reply that support Defendants’ claim that the
five-years and six months would have expired before the stipulation reached on
November 22, 2023. For example, Defendants argue that the period during which it
was not possible to try the case must have ended when Judge Beaudet reiterated on
March 20, 2023 that she would not be trying the case. However, the
impossibility would still be true because there was no other courtroom that by
then had been assigned so CAG could bring the case to trial.
