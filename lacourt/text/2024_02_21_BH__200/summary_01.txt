  - "The primary basis for this motion is that Judge Beaudet's inability to try this case was not the cause of its not being heard within the statutory deadline. Rather, it is that CAG was not ready to try the case (and had not exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting the action) regardless of the backlog of cases in Judge Beaudet's courtroom."
  - "The Court finds that the applicable tolling during which it was impossible for CAG to bring this action to trial to be from November 9, 2022 (when Judge Beaudet announced she was unavailable to try this case) to October 27, 2023 (when Dept. 1 took over handling of the case for reassignment to another judge)."
```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case based on the five-year statute of limitations. The defendants argued that the case was subject to mandatory dismissal because the statute had expired, while the plaintiff argued that the statute was tolled due to the impossibility of bringing the case to trial within the time limit. The judge found that the defendants' argument was unfounded because the statute was tolled during the period when Judge Beaudet was unavailable to try the case, and that the plaintiff was not responsible for the delay. The judge also found that the defendants' renewed motion to dismiss was untimely and that the defendants did not demonstrate sufficient basis to reconsider Judge Beaudet's earlier ruling. The case is set to proceed to trial on April 15, 2024.
