And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Myung Shin v. Elizabeth Yang, et al. The case involves claims of general negligence, premises liability, and violations of various health and safety codes. The plaintiff, Myung Shin, filed motions to compel the defendant, Trustee Elizabeth Yang, to respond to special interrogatories and to deem admitted specified matters in requests for admission. The trustee failed to serve timely responses to these requests, and the plaintiff filed the motions.

The court has denied the motions to compel and deem admitted as moot, as the trustee has since served late responses to the special interrogatories and requests for admission. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for $2,810.00 in sanctions, as the trustee did not unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to compel a response to interrogatories.

However, the court granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $810.00 for the motion to deem admitted. The court also ordered the trustee and her former counsel to pay the plaintiff $810.00 in sanctions. The court's ruling is final and effective as of October 31, 2024.
