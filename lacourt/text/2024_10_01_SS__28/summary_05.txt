And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiffs, Yochonon Baitelman and Yochonon Baitelman on behalf of Mushka Baitelman, Rivka Baitelman, and Esther Baitelman, minors, filed this action against the Defendants, John Alphonse Marasco, Amie Jennet Morris, The Los Angeles Fire Department, and Does 1-10, for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Defendants, including the City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Los Angeles Fire Department, and Marasco, filed their answers and cross-complaints.

The Plaintiffs' counsel, Jamie Lefkowitz, has filed motions to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mushka Baitelman, Rivka Baitelman, and Esther Baitelman. The Court has reviewed the required paperwork and finds that Counsel has provided the necessary information to support the motions.

Accordingly, the Court grants the motions to be relieved as counsel for the three Plaintiffs, and Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of service on each of the clients of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053).
