Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by Plaintiff Vera Merhavi regarding her deposition and independent medical examination. Plaintiff has Alzheimer's disease and seeks to accommodate her physical and cognitive disabilities by attending her deposition via Zoom and having her independent medical examination conducted at her residence or at a doctor's office on the first floor. The court grants Plaintiff's request to attend her deposition via Zoom, but denies her request to have her independent medical examination conducted at her residence or at a doctor's office on the first floor. The court orders Plaintiff to attend an independent medical examination at a doctor's office with an elevator, and denies Plaintiff's request for transportation, a wheelchair, and a nurse to be provided. The court also denies Plaintiff's request to reconsider its previous ruling on Plaintiff's motion for a protective order.
