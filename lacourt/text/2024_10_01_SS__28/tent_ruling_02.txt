LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff’s December 5, 2023 deposition was suspended when
Plaintiff “began yelling and cursing at Defendant’s counsel.”  (Motion p. 3.) 
Counsel
for Plaintiff and Defendant later agreed to complete the deposition on August 19,
2024.  On August 5, 2024, Defendant
served notice of the August 19, 2024 deposition.  Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed with Plaintiff
that she would appear for the deposition. 
(Labat dec. ¶ 8.)  However, on
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff did not appear. 
Defendant’s counsel took a certificate of non-appearance. 
Plaintiff’s
counsel has submitted a declaration stating that Plaintiff informed counsel
that she was hospitalized when the August 19, 2024 deposition took place and she lacked access to a
phone.  (Labat dec. ¶ 10.)  These statements are hearsay and the Court
does not consider them.  The declaration
also states that Plaintiff’s counsel has lost contact with Plaintiff and has filed
a motion to be relieved as counsel which is set for hearing on October 28, 2024. 
The
Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition by October
31, 2024. 
Defendant
requests $3,325.00 in sanctions based on 6.5 hours of attorney time at a rate
of $350.00 per hour, $600.00 for the court reporter at the August 19, 2024
deposition, and $450.00 for the videographer at the August 19, 2024
deposition.  Counsel spent or anticipated
spending one hour to review the file, three hours to prepare the moving papers,
1.5 hours to review the opposition and prepare a reply, and one hour to attend
the hearing. 
The
Court orders Plaintiff to pay Defendant $1,800,00 based on three hours of
attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and the charges for the
court reporter and the videographer.  The Court does not impose sanctions on Plaintiff's counsel. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Toya Rozanna Lewis to attend a deposition and orders Plaintiff to attend her deposition by October
31, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Toya Rozanna Lewis to pay Defendant $1,800.00 in sanctions by October 31,
2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
