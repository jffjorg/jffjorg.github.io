BACKGROUND 
On April
29, 2022, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“Plaintiff”) filed this subrogation action
against Defendants Thomas McKinney (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for motor
vehicle tort. 
On
June 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service of
the summons, complaint, and other documents on May 17, 2022. 
On
November 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages listing $142,558.77 in
medical expenses to date and $6,943.60 in property damage. 
On January
24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on
Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on January 19, 2024. 
On
February 29, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against
Defendant.  On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff
filed another application for default judgment against Defendant. 
On
July 31, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against Defendant and to award
Plaintiff $236,763.56, consisting of $236,142.10 in special damages and $621.00
in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides:
 “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).)  
DISCUSSION 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
Here,
Plaintiff requests damages in an amount that exceeds the amount listed in
Plaintiff’s statement of damages.  The
statement of damages listed $142,558.77 in medical expenses to date and
$6,943.60 in property damage.  The application for default judgment seeks $236,142.10. 
The Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff City of Los Angeles’s application for default judgment
against Defendant Thomas McKinney filed on July 24, 2024 and July 25, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
