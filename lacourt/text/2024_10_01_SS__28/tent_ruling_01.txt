  Case Number:  20STCV39224    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 13, 2020, Plaintiffs Christopher Dillon, Martha Dillon, Samantha Eva
Dillon, a minor, and Vivian Christine Dillon, a minor, filed this action
against Defendants Dale Alan Deinsteinand ("Defendant") and Does 1
through 50 for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. 
On
October 26, 2020, the Court appointed Christopher Dillon to serve as guardian
ad litem for Plaintiffs Samantha Eva Dillon and Vivian Christine Dillon. 
On
January 7, 2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant’s
correct name, Dale Alan Deinstein. 
On
November 15, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an amended proof of service showing
personal service of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Defendant on
January 15, 2021 at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility.  Plaintiffs also filed a proof of service
showing personal service of a statement of damages on Defendant on August 22,
2022 at the California Men’s Colony. 
Also
on November 15, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
June 30, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants with prejudice at
Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
October 3, 2023, the Court denied without prejudice Plaintiffs’ requests for
default judgment based on deficiencies in the applications. 
On
January 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a statement of damages listing, for each
Plaintiff: (1) $1,000,000.00 in general damages (pain and suffering), (2)
$26,400.00 in special damages—past medical expenses, (3) $31,200.00 in special
damages—future medical expenses, and (4) $2,500,000.00 in punitive damages. 
Also
on January 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed requests for Court judgment (form CIV-100)
for Plaintiffs Vivian Christine Dillon and Samantha Eva Dillon. Plaintiffs did
not file requests for Court judgment (form CIV-100) for Plaintiffs Christopher
Dillon and Martha Dillon. 
On
March 5, 2024, the Court found that Plaintiffs' requests for entry of default
judgment were incomplete. The Court directed Plaintiffs to submit a new
corrected and complete default judgment packet for each Plaintiff. The Court
explained that it needed a JUD-100 form and CIV-100 form for each Plaintiff at
least 10 days before the next hearing date. Noting that the case had been
pending for over three years, the Court also advised Plaintiffs’ counsel that
the Court might exercise its discretion to dismiss the action due to
Plaintiffs’ failure to timely prosecute the matter. 
On
June 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed proposed judgments (form JUD-100) and supporting
declarations for each Plaintiff. Plaintiffs also filed a declaration by
Plaintiff Christopher Dillon about the cost of counseling. 
On
June 24, 2024, the Court denied without prejudice the applications for default
judgment filed by Plaintiffs Martha Dillon, Christopher Dillon, Samantha Eva
Dillon, and Vivian Christine Dillon on June 4, 2024. 
On
August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed new CIV-100 (Request for Court Judgment) and
JUD-100 (Judgment) forms, a new statement of damages (omitting the previous punitive
damages requests), a proof of service by mail, and Christopher Dillon’s
declaration about the cost of counseling. 
Aside from the declaration about the costs of counseling, Plaintiffs did
not file new supporting declarations. 
PLAINTIFFS’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to enter default judgments against Defendant and to award each
Plaintiff $1,057,709.30, consisting of $57,600.00 in special damages,
$1,000,000.00 in general damages, and $109.30 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiffs have failed to submit new declarations
supporting their applications for default judgment.  As the Court noted in its June 24, 2024 order
denying Plaintiffs’ previous applications for default judgment, after the Court
denies an application for default judgment, the plaintiff must submit a
complete new default judgment application (or “packet”), including new CIV-100
and JUD-100 forms and a new supporting declaration. 
          Plaintiffs’ CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms ask the Court to
award each Plaintiff $109.30 in costs, but the “Memorandum of costs” (item 7)
in each CIV-100 form lists $437.25 in costs. 
As a result, the forms are internally inconsistent.  If Plaintiffs wish to apportion the costs among
themselves, they should modify the memorandum of costs figure in the CIV-100
forms. 
          The “Declaration of mailing” (item 6) in each CIV-100 form
states that Plaintiffs mailed the CIV-100 forms to Defendant on February 7,
2023.  However, February 7, 2023 appears
to be the date on which Plaintiffs mailed previous versions of the CIV-100
forms to Defendant.  Plaintiffs should
correct the date in the CIV-100 forms. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Martha Dillon's application for
default judgment filed on August 23, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Christopher Dillon's application for
default judgment filed on August 23, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Samantha Eva Dillon's application for
default judgment filed on August 23, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Vivian Christine Dillon's application
for default judgment filed on August 23, 2024. 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
