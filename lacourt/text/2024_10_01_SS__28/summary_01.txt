And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted by the plaintiffs in support of their request for default judgment. The plaintiffs have filed an action against the defendant, Dale Alan Deinstein, alleging assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant failed to respond to the summons, and the clerk entered his default.

The plaintiffs have filed multiple requests for default judgment, but each request has been denied due to deficiencies in the applications. The latest request, filed on August 23, 2024, is also denied because the plaintiffs failed to submit new declarations supporting their applications.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs' requests for default judgment are incomplete and inconsistent. The CIV-100 forms ask the court to award each plaintiff $109.30 in costs, but the "Memorandum of costs" in each form lists $437.25 in costs. The judge orders the plaintiffs to correct the date of mailing in the CIV-100 forms.

The judge also notes that the plaintiffs have failed to provide adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against the defendant. The statute requires that the notice be provided to ensure that the defendant has a day in court to contest the judgment.

As a result, the judge denies the plaintiffs' applications for default judgment without prejudice. The judge orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
