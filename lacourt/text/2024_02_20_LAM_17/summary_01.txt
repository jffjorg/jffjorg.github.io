Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motions to compel deposition of the plaintiffs, Steve Rodriguez, Diego Rodriguez, and Andrew Rodriguez. The court finds that the plaintiffs, being minors, did not provide alternative dates for deposition and therefore waived their objection to the deposition notice. The court also sanctions plaintiffs' counsel $700.00 per motion, totaling $2,100.00, for failing to oppose the motions. The court orders the plaintiffs to provide the defendants with three available dates for deposition within 10 days of the order.
