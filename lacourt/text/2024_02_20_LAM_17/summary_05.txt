Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Prashant and Mita's motion for an order compelling the Govind Parties to pay $2.5 million, which was due and not paid on December 29, 2023, plus $73,972.60 in interest. This motion is an extension of previous motions for missed installment payments required by the Settlement Agreement. The Court finds that the Govind Parties have not presented persuasive arguments to deny the payment and that the instant motion must be granted. The Judge notes that the payment was not received despite a Notice of Default being issued on December 31, 2023. The Court denies the Govind Parties' request for a discretionary stay and their request to determine a surety bond posting or accept a lis pendens.
