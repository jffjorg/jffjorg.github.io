And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of her seventh cause of action, which alleged unlawful entry into dwelling. The plaintiff argued that she was entitled to summary adjudication because the defendant repeatedly entered the property without notice, in violation of Civil Code section 1954. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's "dwelling" within the meaning of section 1954 was only her room, and did not cover the scope of the common areas of the house. The court rejected this interpretation, finding that section 1954 applies to the entirety of the subject property, including common areas such as kitchens and bathrooms.

The court concluded that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the defendant's entries were lawful, as the defendant submitted evidence that certain repairs were requested by the plaintiff herself, and that other tenants consented to or requested the defendant's presence during certain entries. Therefore, the motion for summary adjudication was denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
