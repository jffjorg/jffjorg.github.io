And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Abraham Assil v. Volkswagen Group of America, granting in part and denying in part the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the Defendant. The Court finds that some of the Plaintiff's requests for production are overly broad, but also finds that certain objections by the Defendant are unfounded. As a result, the Court orders the Defendant to produce specific documents and information, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual", internal analysis and investigation, customer complaints, and policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time and sets the matter for a hearing on February 20, 2024.
