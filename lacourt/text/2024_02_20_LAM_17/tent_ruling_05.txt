Prashant and
Mita’s motion for an order compelling the Govind Parties to pay the sum of $2.5
million, plus accrued interest is GRANTED. 
 
On 7/3/2018,
Plaintiffs Govind Vaghashia (Govind) as an individual and on behalf of Graphic
Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan Systems filed a second amended complaint (SAC)
against Prashant Vaghashia (Prashant), Graphic Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan
Systems (GRI), alleging: (1) involuntary dissolution; (2) breach of fiduciary
duty; (3) accounting; and (4) violation of Corporations Code sections 1601 and
1602. 
 
            On
2/1/2024, Prashant and Mita moved for an order enforcing the compliance of the
Govind Parties with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
 
Discussion
 
Prashant and
Mita seek an order awarding Prashant and Mita Vaghashia the sum of $2.5
million, which was due and not paid on December 29, 2023, plus $73,972.60 (for
interest at a rate of 10% for 108 days between December 29, 2023 and April 15,
2024), and interest accruing after April 15, 2024 at a daily rate of $684.93
 
            As
noted by Prashant and Mita, this motion is nearly identical to the relief
already ordered by the Court with respect to the $5.5 million that was not paid
on December 30, 2022, and the $2.5 million that was not paid on June 1, 2023,
and the $10 million not paid on December 29, 2023. The Court entered orders on
all three of those missed installment payments required by the Settlement
Agreement. 
 
            This
motion is an extension of those motions, in that it concerns the next payment
missed, i.e., the $2.5 million due on December 29, 2023. The payment was not
received on or about December 29, 2023. (Shah Decl. ¶ 3.). Counsel for Prashant
and Mita transmitted a Notice of Default on December 31, 2023. (Shah Decl. ¶ 2
& Ex. A.) Despite the issuance of the Notice of Default, the payment has
still not been received. (Shah Decl. ¶ 2.) For the same reasons the Court
entered orders on past missed installment payments, the Court finds the instant
motion must be granted. 
 
            In
opposition, the Govind Parties did not set forth persuasive arguments to show
otherwise, and set forth the same arguments which have already been rejected by
this Court with regard to the validity and enforceability of the Settlement
Agreement. The Court denies their request for a discretionary stay, and denies their
request that “the court in alternative determine a surety bond posting in the
amount of $12.5m or in the alternative accept the lis pendens placed by
Prashant in the amount of $20m and stay any posting of surety bond or enforce
the collateral security given by Govind.” (Opp., 17: 5-8.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Prashant and Mita’s motion for an order compelling the Govind
Parties to pay the sum of $2.5 million, which was due and not paid on December
29, 2023, plus $73,972.60 (for interest at a rate of 10% for 108 days between
December 29, 2023 and April 15, 2024), and interest accruing after April 15,
2024 at a daily rate of $684.93 is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
