And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges defamation, violations of the Unruh, Bane, and Ralph Acts, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant argued that the plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge found that the plaintiff has alleged facts that could show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, which is sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
