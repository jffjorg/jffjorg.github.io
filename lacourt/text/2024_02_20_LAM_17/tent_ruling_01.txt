 Case
  No.:  21STCV45586
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 20, 2024



 
 
Defendants’ motions to compel
deposition are GRANTED. Within 10 days of entry of this order, Plaintiffs Steve Rodriguez, Diego Rodriguez, and
Andrew Rodriguez are to provide Defendants with three available dates
for deposition.
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel is sanctioned $700.00 per motion, for a total of $2,100.00.  
 
            On
12/15/2021, Plaintiff Juan Rodriguez, Leticia Rodriguez, Diego Rodriguez, Steve
Rodriguez and Andrew Rodriguez, minors, through their guardian ad litem Juan
Rodriguez filed suit against Maricela Paz and Jose Paz, alleging: (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) breach of implied
warranty of habitability; (4) negligence per se; (5) negligence; (6) private
nuisance; (7) violation of California Civil Code section 1942.4; (8) violation of California Civil Code
section 1950.5; (9) premises liability; (10) fraud; (11) violation of Unfair
Business Practices; (12) intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED);
and (13) constructive eviction. 
 
            On 1/25/2024, Defendants Maricela
and Jose Paz (collectively, Defendants) moved for an order to: (1) compel
Plaintiff Steve Rodriguez to appear for deposition; (2) compel Diego Rodriguez
to appear for deposition; and (3) compel Andrew Rodriguez to appear for
deposition.
 
            The motions are unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
            On 11/30/2023, Defendants noticed
the depositions of Plaintiffs Steve Rodriguez, Diego Rodriguez, and Andrew
Rodriguez. 
 
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiffs objected to Defendants’
deposition notice based on the grounds that Plaintiff and counsel were
unavailable but did not provide alternative dates for deposition. (Garcia Decl.
at ¶4; Exh. B.) Plaintiffs also objected to the notices on the grounds that they
are minors. 
 
Plaintiffs did not oppose this motion, and are thus
considered to have conceded to the merits of the motions. Plaintiffs did not
set forth any argument that show good cause as to why Plaintiffs should not be
deposed. Moreover, California Evidence Code
Section 700 says, “Except as otherwise provided by statute, every person,
irrespective of age, is qualified to be a witness and no person is disqualified
to testify to any matter.
            
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel deposition are granted. Within
10 days of entry of this order, Plaintiffs are to provide Defendants with three
available dates for deposition. Given that Plaintiffs are minors, the Court
declines to sanction them directly. Rather, Plaintiffs’ counsel is sanctioned $700.00
per motion ($350/hr x 2 hr.) 
 
 
It is so ordered.
