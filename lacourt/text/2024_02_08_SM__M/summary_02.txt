And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash service of summons brought by Defendant Emanuele Filiberto Di Savoia is denied. The Judge finds that the Court has jurisdiction over Di Savoia due to his personal involvement in the performance of the employment contract within California. Di Savoia was the registered agent for service of process in California and was the CEO of Spaghetti Connections, a California corporation. The Judge also finds that Di Savoia subjected himself to the laws of California by operating a business in Los Angeles County, which directly relates to the Plaintiff's claims. Therefore, the exercise of jurisdiction would be reasonable.
