And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is about a motion for summary adjudication filed by the defendants, United Healthcare Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare Benefits Plan of California. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for reimbursement for services rendered to two patients, Patient 1 and Patient 2.

The judge's analysis focuses on the following issues:

* Whether Patient 1 received emergency or post-stabilization services, and whether the claims for services rendered to Patient 1 are barred by the Knox-Keene Act regulations.
* Whether Patient 1's surgery was non-emergent, and whether the plaintiff can recover payment for the services rendered to Patient 1.
* Whether Dr. Khurana exhausted administrative remedies before filing the lawsuit.
* Whether Patient 2 received emergency services, and whether the claims for services rendered to Patient 2 are barred by the Knox-Keene Act regulations.
* Whether Dr. Nazarian exhausted administrative remedies before filing the lawsuit.

The judge finds that there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Patient 2 received emergency services, and therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication on this issue. The judge also finds that there is no evidence to support UHCBPC's liability on claims related to Patient 2, and grants the motion for summary adjudication on this issue.
