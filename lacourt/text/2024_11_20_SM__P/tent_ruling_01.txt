Plaintiffs’ Motion for Order
Assigning Right to Payment of Earnings and Appointment of Receiver
Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §708.510 states: “except as otherwise provided by law, upon
application of the judgment creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the
judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or to a receiver appointed
pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 708.610) all or part of a right
to payment due or to become due.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§564, 568 and 708.610
expressly allow the court to appoint receiver.
Plaintiffs
assert no part of the 8/11/21 judgment has been satisfied (Decl. Mekari para. 2)
and an order assigning right to payment is necessary to collect on the
judgment. Plaintiffs seek a receiver, as defendants failed to satisfy the
judgment. Plaintiffs nominate Richardson C. Griswald as receiver.
The
motion is unopposed. Defendants failed to begin to satisfy their obligations
under the judgment, which is over three years old. GRANTED.
