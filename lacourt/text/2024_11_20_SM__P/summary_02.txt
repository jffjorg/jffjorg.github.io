And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendants' motions to vacate default judgments that were entered against them. The defendants, Dozier and Hagopian, argue that the default judgments were entered in error and that they had excusable neglect in not responding to the plaintiff's complaint. The judge notes that the defendants' motions were filed late, and that the plaintiff argues that the defendants fail to provide evidence of mistake, fraud, or inadvertence. The judge grants the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of their previous ruling denying the defendants' motions to vacate. The judge also notes that the defendants' claims about service of the complaint and summons may be relevant, but they must be supported by evidence, such as declarations under penalty of perjury. The judge grants the defendants' request for leave to file declarations and orders them to be filed within 5 court days.
