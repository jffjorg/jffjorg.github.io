Kamson v. Breathless Group LLC,
Case no. 23SMCV01170
Hearing date November 20, 2024
Defendants’
Motions to Vacate Default Judgments
Plaintiff
Kamson sued defendants Breathless Group LLC, Hagopian, Weinerman, Ho and Dozer
for breach of contract and fraud. Default was entered against Dozier 7/13/23
and Hagopian on 10/3/23. Defendants Dozier and Hagopian, in pro per,
moved on 9/16/24 to set aside the defaults under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473.
Plaintiff opposed. The court continued the matter to review defendants’ untimely
filings and granted plaintiff permission to file a reply. Min. Order 11/7/24. 
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of the court’s 11/7/24 tentative ruling denying
defendants’ motions to vacate is GRANTED.
Under
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken
through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Relief under
§473 should be liberally granted because public policy favors resolution of
disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default. E.g., Fasuvi
v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 685.
Plaintiff
argues defendants needed to file their motions within 6 months of default being
entered. Defendants Dozier and Hagopian filed their motions 9/16/24, 9 and 5
months past the deadline respectively. Plaintiff argues defendants fail to
provide and facts demonstrating mistake, fraud or inadvertence per Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §473(b). 
In
memoranda of points and authorities filed 11/7/24 defendants argue plaintiff’s
opposition to the initial motions to vacate was untimely. Defendants incorrectly
rely on Cal. Rules of Court 8.54 to assert an opposition must be filed within
15 days of a motion. Section 8 rules apply to appellate courts, not to trial
courts. The operative rule is Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1005(b), which states
opposition papers shall be filed at least 9 court days prior to hearing.
Plaintiff’s opposition papers were timely.
Defendants
assert “defendant’s default was through excusable neglect in not responding to
plaintiff's complaint.” Hagopian Motion 7:4-5, Dozier Motion 7:4-5. This alone is
insufficient to establish excusable neglect. 
In
the 11/7/24 memorandums defendant Hagopian asserts service was not proper, as the
complaint and summons were served at an office she no longer occupied. Hagopian
memo. 2:10-12. Defendant Dozier asserts service was not proper, as the
complaint and summons were served to a different apartment within his apartment
building. Dozier memo. 2:9-11. These allegations would likely warrant vacating
the defaults, but defendants must proffer this information as evidence the
court can consider, such as via declarations under penalty of perjury. 
California
has a strong preference for resolving issues on their merits instead of by
default. The court grants leave to allow defendants to file declarations under
penalty of perjury evidencing their claims about service, to be filed within 5
court days.
