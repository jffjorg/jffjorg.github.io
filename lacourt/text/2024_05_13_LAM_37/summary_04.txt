```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants had sought to compel arbitration based on a mutual agreement to arbitrate signed by the plaintiff on her first day of work. The plaintiff argued that the agreement was unconscionable because she did not fully understand its terms due to her limited English proficiency. The court found that the plaintiff's claims for sexual harassment were barred by the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which became effective on March 3, 2022. The court further found that the act applies to the entire case, not just the claims for sexual harassment.
