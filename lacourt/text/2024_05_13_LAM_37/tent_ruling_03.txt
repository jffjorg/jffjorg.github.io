Background
 
On May 22, 2023, Jeryl Smith (“Plaintiff”), filed a Complaint
against the Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD” or “Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 20.  
 
The Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges seven causes of
action: (1) violation of Ed. Code § 22458, (2) negligence, (3) conversion, (4)
negligent misrepresentation, (5) fraudulent misrepresentation, (6) elder abuse,
and (7) retaliation.  
 
On October 4, 2023, Defendant LAUSD’s demurrer and motion to
strike the SAC was sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint
(“TAC”) alleging six causes of action: (1) violation of Ed. Code § 22458, (2)
negligence, (3) conversion, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) intentional
misrepresentation, and (6) elder abuse, and (7) retaliation.  
 
On January 30,
2024, the court sustained LAUSD’s demurrer with leave to amend the first and
third causes of action and denied leave to amend the second, fourth, and sixth
causes of action. LAUSD’s motion to strike was also granted with leave to
amend.
 
On February 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) alleging
two single causes of action for violation of Ed. Code § 22458 and conversion. 
 
LAUSD now demurs
and moves to strike the 4AC. Plaintiff opposes the motion. The matter is now
before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer
 
A.        Failure to Meet and Confer 
 
The court notes that Defendant LAUSD
has failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5(a)
which requires the parties to meet and confer before filing a demurrer or
motion to strike. Defendant’s motion is void of any declaration reflecting the Defendant’s
efforts to meet and confer prior to filing this Motion. “Any determination by
the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be
grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) However,
“[i]f upon
review of a declaration under 430.41(a)(3), a court learns no meet and confer
has taken place, or concludes further conferences between counsel would
likely be productive, it retains the discretion to order counsel to
meaningfully discuss the pleadings with an eye toward reducing the number of
issues or eliminating the need for a demurrer, and to continue the hearing date
to facilitate that effort.” (Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020)
45 Cal.App.5th 348, 356, fn. 3; see also Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc.
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967– 968 [courts have inherent authority to regulate
proceedings in ways consistent with statutes]; CCP § 430.42(c) [“Nothing in
this section [§ 430.41] prohibits the court from ordering a conference on its
own motion at any time or prevents a party from requesting that the
court order a conference to be held.”] [italics added].) 
 
Accordingly, the court retains the
discretion to continue the hearing and order the parties to comply with the
meet and confer requirement. However, the court exercises its discretion and
addresses Defendant’s motion on the merits. 
 
            B.        Plaintiff’s Claims Do Not Appear to Be
Barred by the Statute of Limitations
 
Defendant LAUSD argues that the
delayed discovery rule does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims because Plaintiff
did not start making inquiries about the alleged discrepancies in her
retirement benefits until October 2019, despite retiring on August 26, 2008.
(4AC ¶¶ 6, 9, 10.) The 4AC states that it was not until October 2019, when the Plaintiff
filed for Social Security benefits and was required to provide a Verification
of Benefits letter from CalSTARS, that she discovered payment discrepancies.
However, the 4AC is devoid of facts as to when CalSTRS provided Plaintiff with
the Verification of Benefits letter. (4AC ¶ 10.) Plaintiff states that COVID 19
had set in and that she could not reach CalSTRS or LAUSD for clarifications
until the end of 2020. (4AC ¶ 10.) 
 
“A demurrer on the ground of the bar of
the statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not
necessarily barred. It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the
face of the complaint [and matters of which the court may properly take
judicial notice], the right of action is necessarily barred.” (Favila v. Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 189, 224 [internal citations and quotation marks omitted]. Here,
Plaintiff properly alleges that due to the onset of COVID-19, she had
difficulty contacting and discovering the nature and source of the
discrepancies in her retirement benefits. Defendant LAUSD asserts that when
Plaintiff retired in 2008, “she
would have been provided with every necessary piece of documentation to know
that she disagreed with the retirement date provided by the District, yet she
did not do so at the time.” (Reply at p. 2:16-18.) Whether Plaintiff was
provided with all the documentation required to know her date of retirement was
erroneously reported to CalSTRS in 2008 is a disputed issue of fact not subject
to demurrer. Moreover, the 4AC alleges that Plaintiff did not see Exhibit C,
showing the wrong termination date until October 14, 2021. (4AC ¶ 14.) 
 
Moreover, the court has previously found
that even if the delayed discovery rule did not apply to the Plaintiff’s
claims, the continuing violation doctrine applied to the Plaintiff’s claims for
present and future payments as the Plaintiff had a continuing right to correct
pension benefits and her claims accrued each time a deficient payment was made.
(Dryden v. Board of Pension
Com'rs of City of Los Angeles (1936) 6 Cal.2d 575, 580–581 [“The right to pension
payments is a continuing right. Petitioner by her conduct may
have barred herself from collecting payments which have accrued, but this does
not mean that she is without means to enforce the right to present and future pension payments, as distinguished from
past and accrued pension payments”] [italics original]; see
also Blaser v. State Teachers' Retirement System (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 349, 367 [continuous accrual theory applied to CalSTRS monthly
pension payments].)
 
Based on the above, the demurrer based on
the claim that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations is
overruled.
 
C.        Plaintiff’s
Alleges Damages and is Required to Comply with the Government Tort Claims Act 
 
The
court has previously noted that Plaintiff’s claims may fall under Gov. Code §
905(f) because “[a]pplications or claims or money or benefits under any public
retirement or pension system” were exempt from the Government Tort Claims Act.
(See 10/04/2023 Order; 01/30/2024 Order.) However, because Plaintiff’s prior
pleadings requested damages, Plaintiff was required to comply with the
Government Tort Claims Act unless Plaintiff amended her pleadings to limit her
relief to correct payment of money due rather than damages. (01/30/2024 Order
at p. 5.)
 
Plaintiff’s opposition acknowledges
Plaintiff failed to exercise the request for damages and allegations that she
was deprived of her property rights in violation of the California Constitution
from the 4AC but asserts that the errors were an oversight and an inadvertent
inclusion. (Opp. at p. 2:19-25.) As the 4AC continues to assert claims for
damages, these are sufficient grounds to sustain the Defendant’s demurrer with
leave to amend. 
 
Moreover, Defendant LAUSD cites Dalton
v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566 for the
proposition that only nontortious claims can be exempt from Gov. Code § 905: 
 
[C]ommentators
have construed the section 905 exceptions as essentially nontortious claims
“for  which some other adequate claims
procedure has already been devised or for which the procedural protection of
the Tort Claims Act is believed to be unnecessary.” [Citation.] The instant action is
not such a case. Plaintiffs are basically alleging tortious wrongdoing by
defendants.


(Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1574.) 
 
Defendant LAUSD asserts that because the
second cause of action for conversion sounds in tort, Plaintiff is required to
comply with the Government Tort Claims Act. The court agrees. 
 
In Hanson v. Garden Grove Unified
School Dist. (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 942, the Plaintiff requested
damages stemming from the defendant’s refusal to rehire him under the
preference provisions of the Ed. Code. (Id. at p. 945.) The request for
damages included “salary
and other monetary benefits he could have earned had he been reemployed when
requested[.]” (Ibid [internal quotations omitted].) The court found the
relief requested to be “a
clear request for damages proximately flowing from District's alleged tortious
conduct.” (Id. at p. 946.) 
 
Here, the Plaintiff’s conversion claim
sounds in tort and seeks damages rather than money for services already
rendered. The Hanson court noted that the
Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim would have been exempt under Gov. Code §
905(c) because in Longshore v. County of Ventura
(1979) 25 Cal.3d 14, 22, the California Supreme Court held
that a claim for compensation owed by an employee for services already
performed is contractual and exempt from the Tort Claims Act, which expressly
excludes actions arising on contract. (Hanson, supra, 129
Cal.App.3d at p. 947.) In Baillargeon v. Department of
Water & Power (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 670,  the plaintiff was permitted to bring a claim
infliction of emotional distress along with a breach of contract claim premised
on estoppel and a request for declaratory relief because the parties entered a
stipulation allowing the plaintiff to file a government claim. (Id. at
p. 178.)
 
Here, Plaintiff fails to point to case
law that would allow Plaintiff to bring a tort-based cause of action without
having to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act, even if the damages
requested were for wages or money or benefits due. (Gov. Code, § 905(c)(f).)
Accordingly, the court sustains LAUSD’s demurrer to the second cause of action
for conversion without leave to amend. 
 
As Plaintiff’s first cause of action for
violation of Ed. Code § 22458 requests damages, the demurrer is also sustained
as the first cause of action with leave to amend as the Plaintiff has shown
that amendment is possible. 
 
As the demurrer has been sustained, the
motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
LAUSD’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend the first cause of action and
without leave to amend the second cause of action. The motion to strike is
denied as moot. Plaintiff
is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint
for June 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
