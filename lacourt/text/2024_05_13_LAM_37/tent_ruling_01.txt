Background
 
On February 21, 2023, Shoneke Williams, Alina Berry, Dillon
Brant, India Castillo, Guillermo Diaz, Joanne Fowler, Alaiyjah Gates, Kimberly
Herring, Ahmad-Jamal Herring, Michael Jones, Mariam Malik, Nelli Mirakyan and
Joselyn Sanders (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendant
Equity Residential Management LLC (“Defendant” or “Equity”). 
 
Plaintiffs Alina Berry, Alaiyjah Gates, and Nelli Mirakyan
have been dismissed. 
 
The operative Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1)
Violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act; (2) Invasion
of Privacy; and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
Defendants now demurrer to the second and third causes of
action with a motion to strike the Complaint. Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer.
The matter is now before the court. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
The court may take judicial notice of records of any court of
record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may
only judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are
the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
On reply,
Defendant Equity seeks judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Order on Demurrer of Equity
Residential Management, LLC to Plaintiffs’ Complaint; and Motion to Strike,
filed January 4, 2023, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los
Angeles in Cary Singleton et al v. Equity Residential Management, L.L.C.,
Case No. 22VECV01307, attached as Exhibit A.
 
2)    
Notice of Ruling re:
Defendant Equity Residential Management, L.L.C.’s Demurrer and Motion to
Strike, filed January 18, 2023, 2023 in the Superior Court of California,
County of Los Angeles in Wayan Palmieri, et al v. Equity Residential
Management, L.L.C., Case No. 22BBCV00656, attached as Exhibit B.
 
3)    
Order re: Demurrer and
Motion to Strike Against Complaint, filed January 24, 2023, in the Superior
Court of California, County of Los Angeles in Soraya Viray, et al v. Equity
Residential Management, L.L.C., Case No. 22VECV01496, attached as Exhibit
C.
 
4)    
Ruling on Demurrer of
Equity Residential Management, L.L.C. to Plaintiffs’ Complaint; and Motion to
Strike, filed September 28, 2022, in the Superior Court of California, County
of Los Angeles in Kywane Thomas et al. v. Equity Residential Management,
L.L.C., Case No. 22STCV23730, attached as Exhibit D.
 
The court denies
Defendant Equity’s request for judicial notice. First, it is improper to submit
new evidence on reply. (Scott v. CIBA Vision Corp. (1995) 28 Cal.App.4th
307, 322.) Second, Defendant seeks judicial notice of trial court rulings in
other cases which are unpublished rulings with no precedential value in this
court, and the opinions are submitted not as evidence but are being cited as
precedent. Such citation is beyond the scope of judicial notice and is legally
improper. (Budrow v. Dave & Buster’s of California, Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 875, 884-885.) 
 
Plaintiffs
request judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
The November 9, 2022, Order
on the Demurrer and Motion to Strike by Defendant Equity Residential
Management, LLC, in the case of Dwight Evans, et al. v. Equity Residential
Management, LLC, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles
case number 22VECV01174 (Exhibit 1). Plaintiffs seek judicial notice under
Evid. Code § 452(d).
 
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice is denied for the same reason stated above, that
the prior trial court ruling is being cited as precedent rather than as
evidence. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in Complaint 
 
Defendant Equity
manages and operates a series of residential buildings in California. (Compl. ¶
19.) Plaintiffs were prospective tenants of Defendants. (Compl. ¶¶ 6-18.)
Plaintiffs applied for housing at Defendant’s residential complexes and
completed a mandatory “Application” which included a release of information
allowing Defendants to obtain private and personal information from third
parties about Plaintiffs. (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 30.) Defendant obtained investigative
consumer reports about the Plaintiffs without complying with the mandatory
requirements, disclosure, and authorization required by the Investigative
Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). (Compl ¶¶ 6, 34-40.) 
 
Defendant Equity now moves to
strike the second cause of action for Invasion of Privacy and the Third Cause
of Action for Declaratory Judgment on the basis that the Complaint fails to
state sufficient facts to support the causes of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).)
 
B.        2nd Cause of Action – Invasion of
Privacy
 
“[A] plaintiff alleging an invasion of
privacy in violation of the state constitutional right to privacy must
establish each of the following: (1) a
legally protected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in
the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion
of privacy.” (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 39–40.) 
 
Defendant demurs to the second cause of
action on the basis that the Complaint fails to state facts to show that
Plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances
because Plaintiffs signed a release. (Compl. ¶¶ 27, 29.) 
 
The Complaint alleges that the
Application contained “a
release of information permitting the Defendants to get private and personal
information from third parties about the Plaintiffs” and that Plaintiffs
completed the Application, including the release. (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 29.) “The
application documents stated that Equity Residential Management, LLC may screen
for criminal background and previous evictions.” (Compl. ¶ 27.) “Defendants
required a purported authorization to perform credit and background checks in
the process of screening Plaintiffs for the Hikari Apartments, the Mozaic at
Union Station Apartment, the Eleve Lofts and Skydeck Apartments, and the Aero
Apartments, which, although defective, evidences Defendants’ awareness of and
willful failure to follow the governing laws” of ICRAA. (Compl. ¶ 42.) 
 
As the Complaint acknowledges that
Defendant obtained a release to perform a credit and background check on
Plaintiffs, the Complaint fails to state facts to show that despite the
Defendant obtaining Plaintiffs consent for a report, the Plaintiffs had a reasonable
expectation of privacy under the circumstances. 
 
Plaintiffs’ opposition focuses
on the fact that Plaintiffs have a legally protected privacy interest in
investigative consumer reports and the allegation that the Defendant failed to
comply with ICRAA in obtaining the report. But the Plaintiffs fail to cite case
law to support the allegation that Defendant Equity’s failure to comply with
ICRAA revoked or voided Plaintiffs’ consent to a background check and credit report
such that the Plaintiffs then obtained a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to
the second cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.        3rd Cause of Action – Declaratory Relief
 
To
state a declaratory relief claim, the plaintiff must allege a proper subject of
declaratory relief and an actual controversy involving justiciable questions
relating to the party’s rights or obligations.  (See CCP § 1060; Jolley
v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909.) 
 
‘A complaint for declaratory relief is
legally sufficient if it sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual
controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the parties under a
written instrument or with respect to property and requests that the rights and
duties of the parties be adjudged by the court .... If these requirements are
met and no basis for declining declaratory relief appears, the court should
declare the rights of the parties whether or not the facts alleged establish
that the plaintiff is entitled to favorable declaration.’ [Citation.]
 
(Cardellini v. Casey
(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 389, 394) 
 
The third cause of action seeks
declaratory judgment “regarding the legality and effect of the Defendants’
Application” and because “Defendants demands all leases must be renewed or
re-certified, and because the same forms are always used, which authorizes the
Defendants to obtain investigative consumer reports about the Plaintiffs, a
judicial determination is necessary to prevent the Defendants’ continued violations
of the ICRAA.” (Complaint, ¶ 59.)
 
Defendant Equity
asserts that the third cause of action fails because Plaintiffs do not allege
that they are required to submit a new Application to renew their leases or
that Equity requires them to do so. Defendant Equity also asserts that future
violations of ICRAA are fictional and hypothetical and there is no actual
present controversy. 
 
Whether Plaintiffs will
have to complete a new Application when they renew their leases and whether
said Application will comply with ICRAA is a disputed issue of fact not subject
to demurrer. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.) Because
the Plaintiffs seek permanent injunctive relief against Equity to stop ongoing
and future violations of ICRAA, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendant
Equity seeks to strike the following from Plaintiffs’ Complaint: Paragraphs 1, 5, 41, 53, and 55, and Paragraphs 4, 8, 9, and 10 of
the Prayer for Relief.
 
As the
demurrer to the third cause of action is overruled, the motion to strike
Paragraphs 1, 5, 41, 53, and 55 from the Complaint and Paragraphs 8 through 10
from the Prayer for Relief is denied as moot. 
 
When the defendant is a¿corporation, “the
oppression, fraud, or malice must be perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly
ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson
v. Southern California Edison Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see
Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) Here, the Complaint
is devoid of facts as to which officer, director, or managing agent of
Defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. Accordingly, the request to
strike punitive damages from Paragraphs 5, 41, and 53 of the Complaint and Paragraph
4 in the Prayer for Relief is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Equity’s
demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained with 30 days leave to amend
and overruled as to the third cause of action. The motion to strike is denied
as moot as to Paragraphs 1, 5, 41, 53, and 55 from
the Complaint and Paragraphs 8 through 10 from the Prayer for Relief and
granted with leave to amend as to the request for punitive damages. The Case
Management Conference is taken off calendar and the Court sets an OSC Re:
Amended Complaint for June 27, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Defendant to give notice.
