And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, R S Innovations, Inc. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Principal Property Management, alleging breach of contract, accounts stated, and open book account. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the breach of contract cause of action, finding that the complaint lacks sufficient facts regarding the terms of the purported oral agreement. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the accounts stated and open book account causes of action, finding that the complaint sufficiently articulates the elements for these claims. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended pleading and has set a case management conference for September 6, 2024.
