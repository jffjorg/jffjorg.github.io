And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order brought by Anita Pourshalimy (Plaintiff) against Markel Insurance Company (Markel), which is a non-party to the action. The motion seeks to prevent Markel from conducting additional Defense Medical Examinations without leave of Court, as well as monetary sanctions. The Court notes that Markel was not properly served with the motion, but exercises its discretion and considers Markel's untimely opposition. The Court finds that the dispute between Plaintiff and Markel is currently in arbitration proceedings and that the Court does not have jurisdiction over the dispute. Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for a protective order and directs Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
