```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of justiciability in the case. The judge notes that justiciability involves the intertwined criteria of ripeness and standing. Standing requires that a party have an actual and substantial interest in the outcome of the case, and that the party's arguments be presented with vigor and intensity. Ripeness refers to the requirement that the controversy be current, meaning that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made. The judge cites City of Santa Monica v. Stewart (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 43, 59, which holds that an action not founded upon an actual controversy between the parties will not be entertained. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the case may not be ripe for consideration due to the lack of a current controversy.
