[1]              As a result of this investigation,
which involved Patino providing a witness statement, an investigation (IA
AA20-004) was initiated against Patino pertaining to his conduct. (AR 0023.)
McLean also initiated an administrative investigation into Le on February 19,
2020. (AR 0231.) 


[2]              Petitioner also purports to seek
relief pursuant to Government Code § 3309.5 but has not filed a concurrent
action pursuant to this provision. “[T]he review contemplated under section
3309.5 is limited to whether the public entity employer violated an officer’s
rights under the Act. A mandamus action filed pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, on the other hand, contemplates a review of a
different nature. It requires inquiry into the validity of the final
administrative decision made by a public entity employer.” (Gales v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1602-1603.) 
.


[3]              Governor Newsom’s Executive Order
N-40-20, issued on March 30, 2020, extended the deadline under POBR (Gov. Code
§ 3304, subd. (d)) “for opening and completing investigations of alleged
misconduct by public safety officers” by 60 days. (City’s RJN, Exh, A, ¶ 15).
The Notice of Intent to Discipline is dated December 17, 2020. (AR 0112.)


[4]              The court notes that Patino
disavowed having a conversation with Petitioner about Petitioner’s conversation
with Le and could not recall having a conversation with Petitioner about the
content of the memorandum. (AR 0498 and AR 0500.)


[5]              Petitioner’s counsel’s February 28,
2022 letter to the Personnel Commission raised concerns with respect to the
statute of limitations issue only; it did not address any purported affirmative
defense of whistleblower retaliation.
