And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the case involving Patino and Le, including the investigation into Patino's conduct and the administrative investigation into Le. The judge notes that Patino disavowed having a conversation with Petitioner about Petitioner's conversation with Le and could not recall having a conversation with Petitioner about the content of the memorandum. The judge also discusses the statute of limitations issue and the affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation. The judge references Governor Newsom's Executive Order N-40-20, which extended the deadline for opening and completing investigations of alleged misconduct by public safety officers. The judge intends to review the administrative decision and may consider a mandamus action.
