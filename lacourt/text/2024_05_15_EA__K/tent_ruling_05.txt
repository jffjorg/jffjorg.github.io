Discussion
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Liberty
Mutual Insurance Company (“Judgment Creditor”) opposes the Claim of Exemption
submitted by Cao.
TIMELINESS:
A claim of exemption may be made by the judgment debtor any time during the
withholding period. (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.105, subd. (a).) An exemption may
be claimed only once, however, unless there has been a “material change in
circumstances” since the time of the last prior hearing on the earnings
withholding order. (Id.)
A
judgment creditor wishing to oppose a claim of exemption must file a notice of
opposition with the levying officer within 10 days after the notice of claim of
exemption was mailed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.105, subd. (d).) “(This 10–day period is not extended where the
claim of exemption was served by mail; see CCP § 684.310 and Comment to CCP §
706.105.).” Ahart, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: ENFORCING JUDGMENTS AND DEBTS (The Rutter
Group 2023) ¶ 6:1192.
“If a notice of
opposition to the claim of exemption is filed with the levying officer within
the 10-day period, the judgment creditor is entitled to a hearing on the claim
of exemption.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 706.105, subd. (e).) “If the judgment creditor desires a hearing on the claim of
exemption, the judgment creditor shall file a notice of motion for an order
determining the claim of exemption with the court within 10 days after the date
the levying officer mailed the notice of claim of exemption.” (Id.) “(This 10–day period is not extended where the claim of exemption
was served by mail; see CCP § 684.310 and Comment to CCP § 706.105.).” Ahart, supra,
at ¶ 6:1195. “If the notice of motion is so filed, the hearing on the
motion shall be held not later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion
was filed unless continued by the court for good cause.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.105, subd.
(e).)
The judgment creditor must give written
notice of the hearing to the levying officer at least 16 court days prior to
the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.105, subd. (e); Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) The judgment creditor must also serve a copy of the notice of
opposition and notice of hearing at least 16 court days before the hearing on
the judgment debtor at the address set forth in the claim of exemption. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 706.105, subd. (e).) “After receiving the notice of the hearing and before the
date set for the hearing, the levying officer shall file the claim of exemption
and the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption with the court.” (Id.)
The Notice of Filing
Claim of Exemption states it was mailed on March 12, 2024. The Notice of
Hearing on Claim of Exemption and the Notice of Opposition to Claim of
Exemption were served on Cao and the levying officer (i.e., the Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Department) on March 19, 2024 and filed with the court on March
20, 2024 and stamped received by the levying officer on March 20, 2024.
The court determines
that the opposition is timely.
MERITS:
“Except
as otherwise provided in this chapter, the maximum amount of disposable
earnings of an individual judgment debtor for any workweek that is subject to
levy under an earnings withholding order shall not exceed the lesser of the
following:
(1)
Twenty percent of the individual's disposable earnings for that week.
(2)
Forty percent of the amount by which the individual's disposable earnings for
that week exceed 48 times the state minimum hourly wage in effect at the time
the earnings are payable. If a judgment debtor works in a location where the
local minimum hourly wage is greater than the state minimum hourly wage, the
local minimum hourly wage in effect at the time the earnings are payable shall
be used for the calculation made pursuant to this paragraph.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 706.050, subd. (a).)
“For
any pay period other than weekly, the following multipliers shall be used to
determine the maximum amount of disposable earnings subject to levy under an
earnings withholding order that is proportional in effect to the calculation
described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), except as specified in paragraph
(1):
(1)
For a daily pay period, the amounts shall be identical to the amounts described
in subdivision (a).
(2)
For a biweekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum wage by 96
work hours.
(3)
For a semimonthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum wage by
104 work hours.
(4)
For a monthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum wage by 208
work hours.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 706.050, subd. (b).) “Disposable earnings” are
those earnings remaining after deduction of any amounts required by law to be
withheld. (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.011, subd. (a).)
In addition to the automatic exemption for nonsupport
withholding orders, that portion of an employee's earnings necessary for the
support of the judgment debtor or his or her family is exempt from nonsupport
earnings withholding orders (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.051, subds. (a),(b)).
Cao represents that all of her earnings are needed to
support herself or her family. (Claim, ¶ 2). Cao is not willing to withhold
anything from her earnings each pay period during the withholding period. (Id.,
¶ 4). Cao specifies that she is paid every two weeks (Id., ¶ 5), that
her gross monthly pay is $5,176.27 (Financial Statement [“FS”], ¶ 2) and that
her total monthly income is $3,683.43 (Id., ¶ 2(e).)
Cao fails to identify whether or not she has a spouse or any
dependents. (Id., ¶¶ 1 and 9). Cao represents that she has $152.00 in
cash and another $2,447.20 in “Chase Bank checking and saving,” $2,784.60 in
“East West Bank checking.” (Id., ¶ 3). Cao also represents that she owns a 2005
Toyota Camry worth $800.00, a 2007 Lexus RX350 worth $2,000.00 and a 2010
Toyota Prius worth $2,000.00. (Id.) Cao disavows having any real estate
equity or other personal property. (Id.) Cao also disavows having any
other income sources. (Id., ¶ 2).
Cao claims that her monthly expenses total $4,285.00, as
follows: (1) $2,900.00 for rent or house payment and maintenance; (2) $300.00
for food and household supplies; (3) $415.00 for utilities and telephone; (4)
$50.00 for clothing; (5) $80.00 for medical and dental payments; (6) $250.00
for insurance (life, health, accident, etc.); (7) $0 for school, child care;
(8) $0 for child, spousal support; (9) $240.00 for transportation and auto
expenses (insurance, gas, repair); (10) $0 for installment payments; (11)
$50.00 for laundry and cleaning and (12) $0 for entertainment.
Cao advises that an earnings withholding order is now in
effect with respect to her earnings, but fails to provide any further
information in this regard. (Id., ¶ 7).
The exemption claimant has the burden of proof. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 703.580, subd. (b).) Cao’s Financial Statement appears to be
incomplete, in that she reports a monthly deficit of $ 601.57 and fails to
identify whether she is married.
The court
will continue the hearing, to June 3, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., in order to allow Cao
to submit additional proof. Cao is to submit a more complete Financial
Statement addressing Paragraphs 1, 2(d), 7 and 9 in particular, no later than May
24, 2024.
