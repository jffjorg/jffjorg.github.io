  Case Number:  22PSCP00250    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  K The Petition for Writ of
Mandate is DENIED.
Petitioner Jorge Huerta
(“Petitioner”) petitions for a writ of administrative mandate directing Respondent
City of Baldwin Park (“City”) to set aside an administrative decision to
suspend Petitioner from his position as a police officer with the Baldwin Park
Police Department (“Department”) for 15 days without pay.
Background
1.                 
The Underlying Incident 
On September 22, 2019, City
police officers were involved in a vehicle pursuit and arrested the vehicle’s juvenile
passenger. (Administrative Record [“AR”] 0126.) There was subsequently a “use
of force incident” in the report writing room involving the arrested juvenile
and another officer, Sergeant Joseph Meister (“Meister”). (Id.) Officer
Tuan Le (“Le”) was present in the report writing room and witnessed the
incident. (AR 016-020, 0126.)
On October 7, 2019, former
interim Chief Johnny Patino (“Patino”) instructed Petitioner to contact Le to
obtain a memorandum from Le regarding the incident. (AR 0126, 0524-0526.) That
day, Petitioner contacted Le and told Le that Paterno wanted him to prepare a
memorandum regarding the incident. (AR 0411-AR 0412.) Le was off work that day.
(AR 0172.)  Le prepared the memorandum at
home and emailed the draft to Petitioner. (AR 0412.) Petitioner asked Le to
make spelling and grammar revisions to the memorandum and also asked Le to
include additional factual information. (AR 0126.) Throughout that afternoon,
Le sent Petitioner four separate versions of the memorandum. (AR 0202-0211; AR
0412-0416; AR 1813-1814.) Le sent Petitioner the fourth version of the
memorandum following an eight-minute conversation with Petitioner. (AR 0171-0174;
AR 1847-1848.) The fourth version of the memorandum added the word
“unhandcuffed” and the statement “Are you the guy who shot my officer?” (AR
0173-AR 0174.) Computer metadata from Petitioner’s work computer reflects that
minor alterations were made to the fourth version of the memorandum after it
was received. (AR 0174.) This fifth version of the memorandum was used in an
administrative investigation against Meister. (AR 0158.)
2.                 
The Investigation into Petitioner 
Le subsequently told
Sergeant Ray Findley (“Findley”) that he “had felt singled out when he was
directed to write the memorandum” and that he “felt pressured by ranking
members of the department” to write it. (AR 0224.) Findley informed Acting
Captain Chris Kuberry of Le’s statements. (Id.). On December 20, 2019,
Findley also informed Patrol Bureau Watch Commander Chris Hofford (“Hofford”)
of Le’s statements. (Id.).
On December 23, 2019, Hofford
sent an inter-department memorandum to the City’s then-Chief of Police, Steven
McLean (“McLean”), informing him of Le’s allegations that Petitioner had
instructed Le to write the October 7, 2019 memorandum containing factually
false information which was known would become part of an official
administrative investigation involving Meister and that Petitioner had provided
the wording Le was to use in the false statement. (AR0224-0227.) Hofford
recommended that the facts be investigated further in order to confirm or
dispel whether or not Petitioner committed violations of Department Policy
Manual Standards of Conduct sections 319.3.1, 319.3.2(c) and 319.5.8(a), as
follows:
319.3.1
           UNLAWFUL OR CONFLICTING ORDERS 
Supervisors shall not knowingly issue orders or directives that, 
if carried out, would result in a violation of any law or 
department policy. 
 
319.3.2            SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Supervisors and 
managers
are required to follow all policies and procedures and
may be
subject to discipline for: 
(c)
Directing a subordinate to violate a policy or directive, 
acquiesce
to such a violation, or are indifferent to any such 
violation
by a subordinate. 
 
318.5.8            PERFORMANCE 
(a) Failure to disclose or misrepresenting material facts, or
making 
any false or misleading statement on any application, 
examination form, or other official document, report or form, or 
during the course of any work-related investigation. (Id.)
 
On December 23, 2019,
McLean reviewed the materials from Hofford and agreed that Le’s statements required
further investigation. (AR0228.) McLean directed that this investigation be
conducted by an independent investigator selected by the Human Resources
Department. (AR0228). McLean directed Hofford to act as the liaison between the
department and the independent investigator. (AR0228.)
On December 26, 2019, McLean
notified Petitioner that the City was initiating an Internal Affairs
Investigation “in regard to a[n] allegation of dishonesty and issuance of an
unlawful order. . . alleged to have occurred on or about October 7, 2019.”
(AR0001.)[1]
As part of the
investigation, independent investigator Don Wood (“Wood”) interviewed multiple witnesses
and gathered evidence. (AR0023-0100.) Wood interviewed Le, who was represented
by counsel, on February 28, 2020 and April 8, 2020. (AR 0050; AR Exh. No. 12;
AR 0058; AR Exh. No. 33.) Wood interviewed Patino on February 28, 2020 (AR0045;
AR Exh. Nos. 13-15), Acting Sergeant Frank Real (“Real”) on March 25, 2020
(AR0081; AR Exh. No. 16) and Officer Jose Jimenez (“Jimenez”) on April 6, 2020
(AR0086; AR Exh. No. 10). Wood interviewed Petitioner, who was represented by
counsel, on March 17, 2020 and on April 21, 2020. (AR0060; AR0242; AR0071; AR
Exh. No. 32.) Wood interviewed Le’s wife, Arianna Le, telephonically. (AR0087;
AR Exh. No. 11.) Wood also obtained emails between Petitioner and Le, five
versions of the memorandum, metadata from Petitioner’s and Le’s computers, and
phone records. (AR088-0100.) A summary of the interviews was included in Wood’s
report. (AR 0045-0087.)
On April 23, 2020, Wood
finalized his Investigative Report and sent it to the City’s counsel, Liberty
Cassidy Whitmore, for review. (AR0021-0100; AR0125.) Wood’s report investigated
the following five allegations:
            ALLEGATION #1
Officer
Le alleges that on or about October 7, 2019, Acting Lieutenant Huerta 
called
Officer Le after Officer Le submitted the first draft of the memorandum, 
and
told Officer Le to write in the memorandum that Officer Le heard Sergeant 
Meister
ask the juvenile if he was the person who shot at Sergeant Meister's 
officer.

 
ALLEGATION
#2 
 
Officer
Le alleges he told Acting Lieutenant Huerta that he did not hear 
Sergeant
Meister ask the juvenile if he was the person who shot at Sergeant 
Meister's
officer. 
 
ALLEGATION
#3(a) 
 
Officer
Tuan Le alleges that on or about October 7, 2019, Acting Lieutenant 
Huerta
called Officer Le a second time after Officer Le submitted the second 
draft
of the memorandum without the requested statement to ask why the 
statement
was not included. 
 
ALLEGATION
#3(b) 

Officer
Le alleges that he told Acting Lieutenant Huerta that he was not 
comfortable
writing that Officer Le heard Sergeant Meister ask the juvenile if 
he was
the person who shot at Sergeant Meister's officer, because the statement 
was
false. 
 
ALLEGATION
#4 
 
Officer
Le alleges that Acting Lieutenant Huerta only accepted the final draft of 
the
memorandum after he wrote in his memorandum that he heard Sergeant Meister 
ask the
juvenile if he was the person who shot at Sergeant Meister's officer. 
 
Wood concluded that Allegations
Nos. 1 and 4 were sustained. (AR 0024, AR 0038.) 
On August 6, 2020,
Findley retired from the Department. (AR 0125.) Lopez reassigned the
investigation to Sergeant David Leon (“Leon”) and directed Leon to act as the
liaison between the department and Wood. (Id.).
On November 16, 2020,
Leon received Wood’s investigation report from Lopez, with instructions to
complete the administrative investigation review. (Id.) Leon completed
internal affairs investigation No. AA19-013 and made findings. (AR 0171-0199.)
Leon’s report issued findings that were based on violations of Department
Policy Manual Standards of Conduct sections 319.3.1(b), 319.3.2(d) and
319.5.8(b), as previously identified by Hofford. (AR 0127-0128, 0185.) Leon
identified additional allegations (Nos. 5-7) during the investigation, as
follows:
319.5.2
           ETHICS 
                                    (b) The wrongful or unlawful
exercise of authority on the part of 
any member for malicious purpose, personal gain, willful deceit, 
or any other improper purpose.
 
319.5.8            PERFORMANCE
                        (b) The falsification of
any work-related records, making misleading 
entries
or statements with the intent to deceive, or the willful and unauthorized
removal, alteration, destruction, and/or mutilation of 
any
department record, public record, book, paper or document. 
 
319.5.8            PERFORMANCE
(c) Failure to participate in, or giving false or misleading
statements, 
or misrepresenting or omitting material information to a
supervisor 
or
other person in a position of authority, in connection with any investigation
or in the reporting of any department-related 
business.
 
319.5.8            PERFORMANCE
(d) Being untruthful or knowingly making false, misleading, or 
malicious statements that are reasonably calculated to harm the 
reputation,
authority, or official standing of this department or its members. 
 
(AR 0171-0199.)
Commander Andrew Velebil
(“Velebil”) reviewed the administrative report No. AA19-013 and its findings.
(AR 0115-0121.) On December 15, 2020, Velebil sent a “Findings and
Recommendation” memorandum to then-acting Chief Lopez, which he advised were
based on the results of the administrative investigation, AA19-013, the
interviews conducted by Wood, analysis of phone records, email records, and
document metadata. (Id.) Velebil determined that Huerta was not in
violation of Allegations #1-4 but was in violation of Allegations #5-7 and recommended
that Petitioner be separated from his employment. (Id.)
On December 17, 2020,
Lopez sent Petitioner a “Notice of Intent to Discipline,” based on
Investigation AA19-013. (AR 0112-0114.) Lopez decided not to follow Velebil’s
recommended discipline and instead notified Petitioner of his intent to demote
him from Sergeant to Officer and impose a 30-day suspension without pay.
(AR0112). Lopez concluded that Petitioner had committed violations of five Department
Policy Manual Standards of Conduct: (1) § 319.3.2(c)—Supervisor
Responsibilities; (2) § 319.5.2(b)—Ethics; (3) § 319.5.8(b)—Performance; (4) §
319.5.8(c)—Performance and (5) § 319.5.8(d)—Performance. (AR 0006-0008.) The
“Notice of Intent to Discipline” included Velebil’s findings, Report No.
AA19-013 and Wood’s report and informed Petitioner of his right under Personnel
Rule 14.4 to have an informal meeting with Lopez prior to discipline, upon
written request made within five calendar days. (AR 0114.)
3.                 
The Administrative Process
 a.                 
Skelly Hearing
On February 18, 2021, a
hearing pursuant to Skelly v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194
(“Skelly”) was held at Petitioner’s request. (AR 0009.) Petitioner was
represented by counsel at the hearing and he was able to present additional
information to Lopez at that time. (AR 0009-0010.)
On February 25, 2021,
Lopez issued a “Notice of Final Discipline,” which informed Petitioner that, after
considering additional information presented by Petitioner and his counsel
during the Skelly hearing, he had decided to reduce the proposed
discipline to a 15-day suspension without pay. (AR009-0013.) Disciplinary
action may be based on numerous grounds of conduct pursuant to the Personnel
Rules, including “[d]ishonesty” and “violation of rules, regulations of
orders.” (AR 0629, § 14.1.) Lopez explained that he was not persuaded that
Petitioner was “merely not aware of a policy violation,” that “the changes
[Petitioner] made did not alter the content of the memorandum” and that
Petitioner’s “contradictory statements to Investigator Don Wood were simply an
issue of memory.” (AR 0012.) Lopez concluded that “[y]our conduct in connection
with the events of October 7, 2019 causes me to question your judgment and
decision-making as a sergeant.” (AR 0012.) The Final Notice advised Petitioner
of his rights to file a written response and to appeal the suspension. (AR
0013).
          
b.                 
Arbitration 
On March 11, 2021,
Petitioner served a “Demand for Arbitration” on the City. (AR1481-1482.) The
arbitration was held on November 12 and 16, 2021 before arbitrator Joe Monat
(“Monat”). (AR1483, 1486, 1648 and 1651). The parties agreed upon the issue(s)
for Monat to decide:
Whether the
Baldwin Park Police Department had just cause to issue a 15-day suspension
without pay to [Petitioner]? and If not, what is the remedy? 
(AR 1488, AR 1932.) The
parties stipulated to two joint exhibits: Joint Exhibit 1, the “Notice of Final
Discipline,” and Joint Exhibit 2, the Police Department Manual. (AR 1489.) Both
parties examined Petitioner, Wood and Lopez, presented segments of witness
interview audio files, and submitted closing briefs. (AR 1487; AR 1556-1557; AR
1563; AR 1701-1724; AR 1914-1925.)
On February 3, 2022,
Monat issued his “Findings and Recommendation. (AR 1930-1938.) Monat determined
that “Huerta should have raised questions about why the changes were directed
to an incident report” and that “[a]s Officer Le’s sergeant, Huerta had an
obligation per Chief Lopez to become familiar with the incident described in
the memo before rubber stamping changes directed by Chief Patino.” (AR 1937.)
Monat recommended that the City affirm Petitioner’s 15-day suspension. (AR 1930-1938.)
c.                  
Personnel Commission
On March 1, 2022, the
City’s Personnel Commission met in closed session to consider Monat’s findings
and “voted unanimously to adopt the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and
opinion of the Arbitrator.” (AR 1944).
Petitioner thereafter
filed his Petition on May 31, 2022.
4.                 
Writ Proceedings
On May 31, 2022,
Petitioner filed his “Verified Petition for Administrative Writ” (“Petition”).
On July 28, 2023, Respondent filed an answer.
On March 8, 2024,
Petitioner filed his opening brief in support of the Petition. On March 11,
2024, Respondent filed its opposing documents. On March 26, 2024, Petitioner
filed his reply documents. The court has also received the amended administrative
record, which was lodged on March 27, 2024, as well as joint excerpts from the
amended administrative record.
Standard of Review
“Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure governs judicial
review by administrative mandate of any final decision of order rendered by an
administrative agency.” (Wences v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 305, 313). Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5, subdivision (b),
“[t]he inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the
respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of, jurisdiction; whether there
was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.
Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the
manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings,
or the findings are not supported by the evidence.”
“It repeatedly has been held that discipline imposed on
public employees affects their fundamental vested right in employment, and
therefore, when a public employee challenges an employer's disciplinary action
in a mandamus proceeding, the trial court is required to exercise its
independent judgment on the evidence.” (Wences, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at
314 [internal quotations and citation omitted].) While the “disciplinary action
at issue often is the termination of employment[,]. . . courts have also
held without distinction that the independent judgment standard applies to
actions involving other forms of discipline.” (Id. [emphasis added].) 
Under the independent judgment standard, “the trial court not
only examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises
its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de
novo.” (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) The trial court has
“the power to draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and to make
its own determinations as to the credibility of the witnesses.” (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Bd. of Comrs. (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 860, 868.)
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties. (Evid. Code § 664). “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817.) The “exercise of independent judgment applies only
to the evaluation of the evidence to determine if it supports the findings, not
to the findings themselves.” (American Funeral Concepts v. Board of Funeral
Directors & Embalmers (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 303, 311, fn. 7.)[2]
Request for
Judicial Notice
The court rules on
Petitioner’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as follows: Denied as moot,
based on the court’s ruling on City’s objections [see below].
The court rules on
City’s Request for Judicial Notice as follows:
(1)              
Grant as to Exhibit A (i.e., Executive Order N-40-20,
Executive Department, State of California (March 30, 2020), available at https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.30.20-N-40-20.pdf).
Evidentiary
Objections
The court sustains
City’s objections to Exhibits 1 (i.e., a complaint filed April 28, 2022 in case
styled Cetina, et al. v. City of Baldwin Park, Case No. 22STCV14121) and
2 (i.e., Petitioner’s government claim dated March 12, 2021) to Petitioner’s
RJN. (Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC v. Regents of University of
California (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 779, 790, fn. 4 [“only relevant evidence
is subject to judicial notice”].)
Further, as to Exhibit
1, judicial notice cannot be taken of the truth asserted in court records. (Lockley
v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 885-886). As to Exhibit 2, “[t]he court may take judicial
notice of the filing and contents of a government claim, but not the truth of
the claim.” (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 368,
fn. 1.)
Procedural Defects
At the outset, City requests
that Petitioner’s opening brief be disregarded or that the court alternatively disregard
the last six pages of Petitioner’s brief, on the basis that it does not comply
with pages limitations set forth in California Rules of Court rule 3.1113,
subdivision (d) (i.e., “[e]xcept in a summary judgment or summary adjudication
motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages. In a summary
judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum
may exceed 20 pages. . .”) and Los Angeles Superior Court (“LASC”) Local
Rule 3.231, subdivision (i) (i.e., “[t]he parties are subject to the limits of
15 pages for the opening brief, 15 pages for the opposition, and ten pages for
the reply. . . unless a party seeks, and the court grants, an order for an
oversized brief. . .”) Petitioner, in turn, argues without citing any legal
authority that the page limitations for a motion for summary judgment govern in
a writ proceeding.
City, however, only
generically claims that “Petitioner’s oversized brief prejudice[s] [its]
ability to address Petitioner’s arguments.” (Responding Brief [“RB”], 11:3-4. As
a result, the court declines City’s request.
City next requests that
the court disregard Petitioner’s opening brief on the basis that it was
untimely filed. Pursuant to the court’s November 30, 2023 order, Petitioner’s
opening brief was to be filed and served 60 days prior to April 10, 2024, which
is Saturday, February 10, 2024. Pursuant to Code of Civil § 12a, when a
deadline to file falls on a weekend or court holiday, its due date defaults to
the next court date. February 12, 2024 was a court holiday (Lincoln Day); as
such, Petitioner’s opening brief was due February 13, 2024, the day it was
served.
Legal assistant
Esmeralda Townsend (“Townsend”) attests that she submitted Petitioner’s opening
brief to One Legal on February 13, 2024, that the court issued a “Notice of
Court Rejection of Electronic Filing” on February 21, 2024, that she was not
made aware of the Notice of Rejection until the evening of February 27, 2024,
that her office resubmitted the opening brief to the court through One Legal
the morning of February 28, 2024, that the court issued another “Notice of
Court Rejection of Electronic Filing” on March 7, 2024, that her office again
resubmitted the opening brief to the court through One Legal the afternoon of
March 8, 2024 and that her office received a “Notice of Confirmation of
Electronic Filing,” showing that the documents were accepted and filed as of
March 8, 2024. (Townsend Decl., ¶¶ 1-8, Exhs. 2-7).
City fails to articulate
any appreciable prejudice resulting from the untimely filing of Petitioner’s
opening brief. City does not deny that it was served Petitioner’s opening brief
the day the opening brief was due; clearly, then, City was provided the entire
time allotted under the law to review and respond to Petitioner’s opening
brief. The court declines City’s request in this regard.
City complains that
Petitioner’s opening brief fails to comply with LASC Local Rule 3.231,
subdivision (i)(2), which requires that each material fact in a party’s
statement of facts be supported by a citation to the record. While true, the
court does not believe that Petitioner’s partial non-compliance with the
above-referenced Local Rule warrants a complete disregard of Petitioner’s
opening brief.
Analysis
Petitioner complains that City imposed discipline on
Petitioner outside of the statute of limitations in violation of the POBR, that
there were procedural defects with the investigation, Skelly hearing and
arbitration and that the Department’s determination that Petitioner engaged in
dishonesty was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the evidence. 
Statute of Limitations
Petitioner asserts that City’s imposition of discipline upon
him was time-barred by Government Code § 3304, subdivision (d)(1), which
provides in relevant part as follows:
            . . . no
punitive action,
nor denial of promotion on grounds other than merit,
shall be undertaken for any act,
omission, or other allegation of misconduct if 
the investigation of the allegation
is not completed within one year of the public 
agency's discovery by a person
authorized to initiate an investigation of the 
allegation of an act, omission, or
other misconduct.
Petitioner posits that the statute of limitations on
Petitioner’s interactions with Le began to run on October 7, 2019 because
Patino “observed Petitioner requesting more information in a Memorandum from
Officer Le and instruct[ed] him to put more details in his Memorandum on that
date,” that no investigation was initiated until December 23, 2019, that the
investigator submitted his report on April 23, 2020 and that the time to impose
discipline expired as of December 5, 2020[3]. (OB,
13:25-14:10.) Petitioner, however, provides no citations to the record that
Patino “observed” Petitioner and that Petitioner “engaged in acts in front of
[Patino].” (See OB, pp. 13-14.)[4] Le was
home on his day off when he prepared the memorandum and Petitioner’s
communications with Le took place over the phone and email. (AR 0116, 0126,
0129, 0137, 0412).
Instead, the record reflects that on December 23, 2019,
Hofford authored a memorandum to McLean, wherein Hofford advised that Findley
had informed him of Le’s allegations regarding the memorandum on December 20,
2019. (AR 0224.) While Petitioner cites to Hofford’s memorandum as support for
his position that “[t]he record reflects that soon after October 7, 2019, Le
informed Sgt. Findley of his concerns about the memo process” (OB, 4:14-15),
that is not what Hofford’s memorandum says; rather it states only that Findley
reviewed the memorandum in October 2019 and “was . . . familiar” with the use
of force incident, as he had conducted the initial supervisor’s inquiry into
that incident. (Id.) Hofford’s memorandum nowhere states that Findley
knew of Le’s allegations about the memorandum’s discrepancies and
modifications. (Id.) Monat determined that “[Appellant] produced no
evidence to support his claim the Notice of Intent was untimely. The time line
established by Officer Le was that Sgt. Findley was not made aware of the
events of October 7, 2019, until December 2019 after Patino was no longer
Interim Chief.” (AR 1934.)
The record elsewhere confirms that Le first reported the
discrepancies with his memorandum to Findley “when Chief Patino was bumped down
to sergeant.” (AR 0447). Patino’s last day as Acting Chief was in approximately
December 2019. (AR 0488-0489; see also OB, 4:21-23). Le’s conversation with
Findley, then, appears to have occurred sometime in December 2019, which is
consistent with Hofford’s December 23, 2019 memorandum to McLean. Even assuming
Le’s conversation occurred on December 1, 2019, the City’s time to serve the
“Notice of Intent to Discipline” would have been extended by Executive Order
No. N-40-20 to February 1, 2021.
The court determines that the discipline imposed on
Petitioner was not time-barred.
Procedural Defects with the Investigation, Skelly,
Arbitration and Personnel Commission
1.                 
Acting Commander Velebil
Petitioner asserts that Velebil should have been recused
from any investigation of Petitioner because Petitioner had testified in case
styled Herrera v. City of Baldwin Park, Case No. 20STCV11521 that
Velebil had sexually harassed and retaliated against another employee, Martin
Herrera. (OB, 15:9-10.) The court agrees that Velebil should not have been involved
in Petitioner’s investigation.
However, it appears that Velebil’s only role in the
investigation was to review the City’s investigation report. (AR 0111-0121.) As
Petitioner’s supervisor, Velebil was required to review the investigative
report. (AR  1328-29 [Policy Manual §
1009.6.1], 1333 [§ 1009.10.1], AR 0115,). Under section 1009.10, an
investigative report “should be forwarded to the Chief of Police through the
chain of command. Each level of command should review the report and include
his/her comments in writing before forwarding the report.” (AR 1333.) Clearly,
the “chain of command” should have been broken as it appears that Petitioner
and Velebil participated in litigation in which their respective positions were
adverse.
Nevertheless, despite the clear conflict, the court finds no
prejudice to Petitioner as a result of Velebil’s involvement. (Pinheiro v.
Civil Service Com. for County of Fresno (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1458, 1464
[“Generally, we reverse only if the alleged error prejudicially affected the
appellant’s substantial rights”].) Here, although Velebil recommended that
Petitioner be terminated, Lopez declined to follow Velebil’s recommendation and
instead decided to impose a 30-day suspension without pay and demote Petitioner
from Sergeant to Officer. (AR 0112.) Moreover, there is no evidence the court
could adduce that demonstrated that Lopez’ determination was based on Velebil’s
ultimate determination to terminate Petitioner or his review of the report and
findings in AA19-03. In fact, Velebil’s review demonstrated he disagreed with two
of Wood’s conclusions and agreed with the additional allegations set forth by
Leon in AA19-03. Irrespective of Velebil’s conclusion or participation, Lopez’s
determination included findings of policy violations included in the initial
allegations and the additional ones added by Leon and there is no evidence he
relied on anything Velebil did. (AR 0112-0114.)
The court determines that Velebil’s involvement was not
prejudicial to Petitioner.
2.                 
Skelly Hearing 
Petitioner erroneously represents that “[a] Skelly hearing
is supposed [to] with the ability for a fresh set of eyes to review all of the
materials and determine if the investigation is appropriate and if the proposed
discipline is commensurate with the violation.” (OB, 15:25-16:1). Skelly,
supra, 15 Cal.3d at 215, in fact, states to the contrary: “[i]t is clear that
due process does not require the state to provide the employee with a full
trial-type evidentiary hearing prior to the initial taking of punitive action.”
Skelly determined that the minimum procedural due
process protections required before disciplinary action became effective
included “notice
of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and
materials upon which the action is based, and the right to respond, either
orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline.” (Id.)
Here, Lopez provided Petitioner with a copy of the
investigative report upon which Lopez based his intended discipline. (AR
0012-AR 0114.) Petitioner’s contention that the Skelly process was
somehow deficient because there was no audio of his interview or transcripts of
interviews is unsupported by any legal authority. (See Gilbert v. City of
Sunnyvale (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1280 [“We reject appellant’s
contention that the word ‘materials’ as used in Skelly means each and every
document identified in the Chief’s Case was required to be produced prior to
his pretermination hearing in order to satisfy due process. Even the regulation
in Arnett, upon which Skelly relied, allowed for ‘extracts’
from witness statements, documents, and investigative reports”].)
The court determines that Petitioner’s Skelly process
was properly conducted.
3.                 
Arbitration Process
Petitioner asserts that there were prejudicial errors made
during the arbitration process, including the improper use of (unidentified) hearsay
statements and incomplete interview transcripts. However, “[a]n administrative
appeal instituted by a public safety officer. . . shall be conducted in
conformance with rules and procedures adopted by the local public agency.”
(Govt. Code § 3304.5.) POBR “requires only that an opportunity for
administrative appeal be provided. It does not specify how the appeal process
is to be implemented. The details of administrative appeal under section 3304,
subdivision (b) are left to be formulated by the local agency.” (Binkley v.
City of Long Beach (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1795, 1806 [italics theirs].)
The City’s Personnel Rules, which control the City’s
arbitration proceedings, expressly provide that “[t]he hearing need not be
conducted in accordance with technical rules relating to evidence and
witnesses,” that “[t]he arbiter shall not be bound by technical rules of
evidence” and that “[h]earsay evidence may be used for the purpose of
supplementing or explaining any direct evidence . . .” (AR 0632 [§ 14.5.7]).
Further, the record belies Petitioner’s contention that his
witness interviews were not made available for Morat. At the arbitration
hearing, Petitioner’s attorney played several audio recordings of Petitioner’s
investigation interviews during her witness examinations. (See AR 1556-1557
[“MS. KRIKORIAN: Your Honor, may I pay this portion of the audio? THE
ARBITRATOR: Sure. . . MS. TALA: Is this the Huerta recording or the Le
recording? MR. KRIKORIAN: This is the George Huerta first IA. This was the one
on March 17”].) The court reporter asked Petitioner’s attorney if she wanted to
transcribe the words in the audio, but Petitioner’s attorney stated, “[t]his
audio is actually already admitted, so if I can reference the time of the audio
that’s being played, . . . I do not believe it is necessary to report it.” (AR
1556). Most of the citations to the record listed by Petitioner in support of
his statement that “[t]he Arbitrator relied on the factual findings that
Petitioner was dishonest in his interview based solely on statements out of
context, quotes, and hearsay” (OB, 17:7-9 [i.e., AR 1557, AR 1562, AR 1564 and AR
1593]) actually involved portions of the arbitration hearing where his own
attorney was questioning witnesses and playing recordings of witness
interviews.
The court determines that Petitioner’s arbitration hearing
was properly conducted.
4.                 
Personnel Commission
Petitioner asserts that the City’s Personnel Commission
improperly denied Petitioner’s counsel the opportunity to raise the affirmative
defense of whistleblower retaliation during the March 1, 2022 closed session.
(Moussatche Decl., ¶ 1). The meeting, however, was conducted pursuant to the
Personnel Rules, which require the Personnel Commission to “adopt, amend,
modify, or reject the findings of fact, conclusion of law, and/or opinion of
the arbiter.” (AR 0634 [§ 14.5.a.20]). Prior to the Personnel Commission’s
decision the arbiter’s decision is advisory only. (AR 0634 [§ 14.5.a.17]). Although
“[e]ither party may request written and/or oral argument before the Commission
prior to the Commission’s decision” (and Petitioner’s counsel, in fact,
submitted a written letter to the Personnel Commission on February 28, 2022
prior to the March 1, 2022 session [AR 1939-AR 1940][5]) there
is no requirement that the Personnel Commission receive new evidence after the
conclusion of arbitration. (AR 0634 [§ 14.5.a.20].)
The court determines that the Personnel Commission’s
purported refusal to consider Petitioner’s affirmative defense of whistleblower
retaliation was not improper.
 
5.                 
Conflict of Interest 
Petitioner asserts that the City violated his due process
rights because Petitioner’s investigation was “conducted at the behest and
direction of” law firm Libert Cassidy Whitmore (“LCW”), which also “represented
the City in the arbitration proceedings” and “represented and advised the
City’s Personal Commission in closed session when evaluating the arbitrator’s
opinion.” (OB, 18:7-14). Attorney Emanuela Tala of LCW, however, represented
the police department in the arbitration (AR 1486; AR 1941) and at the
Personnel Commission closed session (AR 1944 [“The Police Department was
represented in closed session by attorney Emanuela Tala”]); she did not
represent the Personnel Commission. Petitioner fails to present any evidence
that Tala or any other attorney from LCW counseled the Personnel Commission or
served as the adjudicator.
The court determines that there was no conflict of interest.
Department’s Unsupported Determinations
Petitioner asserts that the Department’s determination that
Petitioner engaged in dishonesty was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported
by the evidence. (OB, 18:23-24). Petitioner’s argument in this regard, however,
is supported only by a singular citation to the record. (Id., at
20; AR 0011.) Petitioner, then, has simply not met its burden “of convincing the court
that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817).
The court denies the petition.
