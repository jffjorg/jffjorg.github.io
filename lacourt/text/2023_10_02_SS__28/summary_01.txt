The defendants have filed motions to consolidate and coordinate the case with another case pending in a different court. The Judge denies the motion to coordinate the cases without prejudice, meaning the defendants can refile the motion in a different department. The Judge notes that the cases have a common question of fact or law, but they are pending in different courts and have not been deemed related cases. The Judge also notes that the defendants have not complied with local rules and therefore the motion is denied.
