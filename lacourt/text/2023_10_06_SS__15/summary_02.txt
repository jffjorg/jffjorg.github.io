```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Cummins Inc. on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. The court finds that the complaint does not specify any product from Defendant that Terry Jellesed used or worked around, and therefore does not demonstrate minimum contacts with the forum state of California. The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that Defendant consented to California's jurisdiction in this case because it consented to jurisdiction in other cases, finding that there is no legal basis for this argument. The court grants the motion and dismisses the complaint against Defendant Cummins Inc. without prejudice.
