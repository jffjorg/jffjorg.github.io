And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by Cosmetic Specialties, Inc. The company is incorporated in New Jersey and has its principal place of business in New Jersey, and it has not conducted any activities in California related to the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence of Cosmetic Specialties, Inc.'s contacts with California, and they have not specified what additional discovery they need to establish jurisdiction. The judge has determined that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over Cosmetic Specialties, Inc. Therefore, the complaint against the company is dismissed without prejudice.
