Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the application to file certain documents under seal. The documents in question are related to a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The plaintiff, Diego Yoque, filed a redacted motion to compel further responses and then an application to file under seal the unredacted version of his motion. The defendant did not file an opposition to the motion. The judge found that the documents contain sensitive allegations of sexual harassment and abuse, as well as medical information and investigatory records. However, the judge did not find that the plaintiff had made a sufficient showing to justify sealing the documents. The judge noted that the parties' protective order designates certain documents as confidential, but this alone is not sufficient to justify sealing. The judge also noted that the First Amendment right of public access to court documents must be weighed against the potential harm that could result from the disclosure of the sensitive information. Ultimately, the judge granted the application to seal the documents, but only after finding that the plaintiff had made a sufficient showing to justify sealing.
