Tentative
Ruling:      The Application to File Under
Seal is granted.

 
In this
employment action, Plaintiffs
Jairo Sanchez and Diego Yoque (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint on August
23, 2022, alleging FEHA
claims for discrimination, hostile work environment, as well as retaliation,
and whistleblower claims against their employers, Defendants Barlow Respiratory Hospital and
Alberto Gomez.
 
On December
6, 2023, Plaintiff Diego Yoque filed a redacted motion to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One).
 
            On
December 11, 2023, Diego
Yoque filed an
application to file under seal the unredacted version of his Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Special Interrogatories, set one, against Defendant Alberto Gomez. No
opposition was filed. 
 
            The application to file
under seal is granted. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
“A party requesting that a record be
filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing the
record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a
declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” (California
Rules of Court, Rule 2.551, subd. (b)(1).)
 
The court must make express findings
to support sealing under California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550. Specifically,
California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550, subdivision (d), provides:
 
“The court may order that a record
be filed under seal only if it expressly finds that: 
(1) There exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports
sealing the record;
(3) A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed;
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”  
 
            The party seeking to
seal a document bears the burden of proof. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Specifically, “[a] party requesting that a
record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order
sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the
sealing.” (CRC, Rule 2.551, subd. (b)(1).)
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff Diego Yoque moves for a court
order allowing Plaintiff to file portions of       Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses under seal. Plaintiff argues that the motion contains sensitive
allegations pertaining to sexual harassment and abuse. Plaintiff also argues
that the information contains medical information and investigatory records. 
 
            Rules of
Court, Rule 2.550, subd. (a)(3), states: “These rules do not apply to discovery
motions and records filed or lodged in connection with discovery motions or
proceedings.”  
 
Based on this authority, the rules
of court pertaining to sealing do not apply to this motion and Plaintiff may
file his documents under seal. 
 
However, had the motion subject to
the sealing request been an adjudicatory motion and not a discovery motion, the
Court would have denied the motion to seal based on inadequate evidence to
support the required showings under California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550,
subdivision (d).[1]

 
By way of background, the California
Supreme Court has held that there is a First Amendment right of public access
to “ordinary civil trials and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc.
v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) As our high court has
explained, this constitutional right is a “qualified” one in the sense that the
proceedings “are ‘presumptively open’ ” and in order for them to be ordered
closed, the court must give advance notice of the potential closure and must
conduct a hearing and must make express findings supporting the closure order
and/or the sealing of court records. (Id. at p. 1217.)
 
Since NBC Subsidiary,
California Courts of Appeal have regularly employed a constitutional analysis
in resolving disputes over public access to court documents. (E.g., In re
Marriage of Nicholas (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1575 [holding sealing
orders implicate the public’s right of access under the First Amendment.]; Savaglio
v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 596 [explaining the public
has a First Amendment right to access civil litigation documents filed in court
and used at trial or submitted as basis for adjudication].)
 
Thus, under NBC Subsidiary, before
the presumption of openness established by the First Amendment may be overcome,
the trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that (1) there is an
overriding interest supporting sealing of the records; (2) there is a
substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent sealing;
(3) the sealing order is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest;
and (4) there is no less restrictive means of meeting that interest. (NBC,
supra, at pp. 1217–1218.) The Judicial Council codified the NBC
constitutional standards in rules 2.550 and 2.551—which are also known as “
‘the sealed records rules.’ ” (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 486.)


Here, Plaintiff almost exclusively
relies on the parties’ designation that certain documents produced during
discovery are confidential pursuant to the parties’ protective order. (Forouzanis Decl., ¶¶
2-4.) 
 
This grounds alone is inadequate to justify
sealing. (McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 25, 35–36 [An agreement “alone is insufficient to constitute an
overriding interest to justify sealing.”]; CRC, Rule 2.551, subd. (a) [“court
must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement
or stipulation of the parties”].) Specifically, courts have found that
enforcement of binding contractual obligations not to disclose “can
constitute an overriding interest within the meaning of Rule 243.1(d) [currently
California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550].” (Universal City Studios v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (Unity Pictures Corp.) (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
1273, 1284 [italics added].) However, in ordering records sealed, the court
must also find a substantial probability that the moving party would be
prejudiced absent sealing. (Id. at 1280-1284.)
 
Plaintiff’s evidence also mentions
that the sealed information involves “sensitive allegations pertaining to sexual harassment and
abuse” and Defendant Gomez’s “medical information” and Defendant Barlow
“investigatory records.” (Forouzanis Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
These vague references, however, fail
to meet Plaintiffs’ burden to make “ ‘a specific showing’ ” that “ ‘serious
injury’ ” will occur absent a sealing order. (McNair v. National Collegiate
Athletic Assn., supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 35; Huffy Corp. v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 97, 106 abrogated on other grounds in
Curtis v. Superior Court (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 453, 471; CRC, rule
2.550(d)(3).) “ ‘ “Broad allegations of harm, bereft of specific examples or
articulated reasoning” ’ ” are insufficient. (McNair v. National Collegiate
Athletic Assn., supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 35.)
 
Further, this specific showing must
be significant. For example, our state constitution recognizes a right to
privacy in one’s financial information (Cal. Const., art. I, § 1; Valley
Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) Nonetheless, “state
constitutional privacy rights do not automatically ‘trump’ the First Amendment
right of access under the United States Constitution.” (In re Marriage of
Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1059.) Instead, the ruling turns on the
context and the nature of the information sought to be sealed. 
 
Although privacy rights have been
deemed to outweigh First Amendment public access rights when such highly
sensitive information as identifying account or Social Security numbers are
involved[2]
– the size and existence of an asset, settlement, or salary is information that
has been found unworthy of this significant protection. (In re Marriage of
Tamir (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 1068,1088–1089, fn. 8; In re Marriage of
Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1063-1066, 1070; Copley Press v.
Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 367, 376 [“we find no authority [to
support the proposition] that the amount of money a person receives in judgment
or court-approved settlement as the result of tortious conduct is
confidential”].)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s application to seal. Plaintiff is ordered to file the unredacted
version of the motion and any supporting documentation electronically; “the
burden of accurately designating the documents as sealed at the time of
electronic submission is the submitting party’s responsibility.” (First General
Order, dated May 3, 2019, § 4(i).)
