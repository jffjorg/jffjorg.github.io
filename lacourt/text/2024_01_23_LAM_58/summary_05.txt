Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to allow early discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.210. The plaintiff, Ali Ziai, has been subjected to a pervasive harassment and defamation campaign consisting of dozens of false online reviews that have caused emotional and monetary damage. The plaintiff has been unable to effectuate service because he is unable to ascertain the true identities of any of the Doe defendants. The court's decision allows the plaintiff to serve deposition subpoenas to obtain the identities of the responsible defendants. The court notes that it is not deciding whether the subpoenas should be quashed or whether compliance should be compelled, but is merely determining that the requested subpoenas may be issued. The plaintiff will still need to make a prima facie showing of his claims in order to overcome a motion to quash the subpoenas once served.
