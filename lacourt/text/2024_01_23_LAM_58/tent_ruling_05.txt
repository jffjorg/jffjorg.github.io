under Code of Civil Procedures § 2025.210

Ali Ziai

Responding
Party:      None

Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion to Allow Discovery
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.210 is granted. 

 
This is a defamation
action. Plaintiff Ali Ziai (Plaintiff) alleges that, for years, he has been subjected to a pervasive
harassment and defamation campaign consisting of dozens of false online reviews
that were intended to inflict emotional and monetary damage on him.
 
            On
October 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to conduct early discovery under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.210, subdivision (b). No opposition was
filed.[1]

 
            The motion for leave to
conduct discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.210 is granted.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff seeks leave from the Court to serve
deposition subpoenas for business records pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.210, subdivision (b), on Yelp, Inc., Google, Inc, Microsoft, Inc.,
MH Sub I, LLC, Meta Platforms, Inc., International Association of Better
Business Bureaus, and DOE Defendants’ ISPs.
 
            Section
2025.210, subdivision (b), provides: “The plaintiff may serve a deposition
notice without leave of court on any date that is 20 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, any defendant. On motion with or without
notice, the court, for good cause shown, may grant to a plaintiff leave to serve
a deposition notice on an earlier date.”
 
            Here, the Complaint alleges causes
of action against Doe Defendants only. (Ziai Decl., ¶ 2.) No defendant has been served with a
summons or the complaint, and no defendant has made an appearance in this
action. (Ziai Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff asserts that he has been unable to
effectuate service because he is unable to ascertain the true identities of any
of the Doe Defendants. (Ziai Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
            In support of his motion, Plaintiff
cites only to O'Grady v.
Superior Court (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1423 for the proposition that “where
only DOE defendants are named in a complaint, the plaintiff must still seek
leave from the court to serve deposition notices, even if it is only to
ascertain the identities of the DOE defendants.” (Mot., p. 5:11-13.) 
 
While
this proposition is a correct interpretation of Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.210, subdivision (b), the O'Grady court
did not make any determination on whether the trial court’s decision to allow early
discovery under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.210, subdivision (b) was correct. (O'Grady v. Superior Court (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1423, 1454.) Thus, this case is really of no help to Plaintiff. 
 
            Nonetheless, Plaintiff’s argument and
evidence are sufficient to demonstrate good cause to permit Plaintiff to serve
third party subpoenas to obtain Defendants’ identities. Plaintiff cannot
proceed in his litigation without first identifying the responsible defendants;
Plaintiff submits evidence that he has no other means by which to obtain these identities.
(Ziai Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)
 
            It
is important to note that the Court is merely determining that requested subpoenas
may be issued, not deciding whether the subpoenas should be quashed, or on the
other hand, whether compliance should be compelled. Plaintiff need not make a
prima facie showing of his claims in his request for a subpoena. (Tendler v.
www.jewishsurvivors.blogspot.com (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 802, 808.)  But Plaintiff will have to make a prima face
showing as to his claims in order to overcome a motion to quash the subpoenas
once served. (Krinsky v. Doe 6 (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1154; ZL
Technologies, Inc. v. Does 1-7 (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 603, 611.) California courts have held that, to
defeat a defendant’s motion to quash a subpoena seeking his or her identity, a
plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of the elements of libel. (Krinsky,
supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1172; see Yelp Inc. v. Superior Court
(2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 1, 14 [“a plaintiff seeking discovery of the anonymous
person's identity must first make a prima facie showing the comment at issue is
defamatory”]; Doe 2 v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1300, 1305
[“First Amendment protection for anonymous speech requires a libel plaintiff
seeking to discover an anonymous libel defendant's identity to make a prima
facie showing of all elements of defamation”].) That determination is for
another day.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to obtain discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.210, subdivision (b).
