Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants, Sierra Tucson and Acadia Healthcare, to compel the deposition testimony of Diane Stretch, a plaintiff in the case. The defendants argue that Diane Stretch is a critical witness because she allegedly spoke with the decedent after his discharge and prior to his suicide less than a day later. They also contend that they are entitled to take Diane Stretch's deposition for elaboration and clarification regarding her damages claim. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that Diane Stretch is incompetent to testify at a deposition or at trial due to her mental health care and cognitive decline.

The judge notes that there is no evidence of a judicial determination of Diane Stretch's incompetence, but there are medical reports indicating her cognitive decline. The judge also notes that the parties seem to be in agreement that Diane Stretch not be allowed to present testimony at trial. The judge will entertain oral argument at the hearing on the stipulation if the parties have not agreed to those conditions by then.
