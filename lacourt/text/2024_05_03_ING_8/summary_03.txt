And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without prejudice to a later evidentiary motion. The Court held that the Motion relied on extrinsic evidence and failed to consider the allegations in the Complaint as true. The Court also noted that the Motion did not meet the standards for a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and instead attempted to weigh the evidence and make factual determinations, which is not permitted at this stage. The Court granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the Complaint and noted that the Complaint alleged facts that, if believed, would carry the Plaintiff's burden of proof under the first and third prongs of the McDonnell Douglas test for discrimination cases. The Court also noted that the Motion failed to address the sufficiency of the allegations in the Complaint and instead relied on extrinsic evidence to challenge the Plaintiff's allegations.
