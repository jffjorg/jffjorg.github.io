And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel Leo Ramsey's responses to the demand for production of documents, set one. The defendant is ordered to serve a verified written response on or before May 24, 2024, together with legible copies of responsive documents. Additionally, the plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in sanctions against the defendant for failing to timely respond to the discovery requests. The Court has lowered the amount of sanctions from the plaintiff's initial request of $5,065. The Court notes that six hours spent preparing an initial discovery motion is excessive and that no opposition brief was filed."
