```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Kia. The motion was not timely filed and is substantively similar to a previous motion (MIL No. 13). The court also notes that a document filed by the plaintiffs, entitled "Statement By Plaintiffs Re Documents Relating To The Transaction That Should Have Been Provided In Spanish", is not relevant to the current issue before the court. The court agrees with Kia's objection to this document and sustains the objection.

The court also finds that an offer letter which contemplates the execution of future contracts is appropriate. Additionally, the court notes that there is no basis to assume that the release proposed by Kia would be unlawfully overbroad. The court cites two previous cases, City of Galt v. Cohen and Covert v. FCA USA, LLC, in support of its ruling.
