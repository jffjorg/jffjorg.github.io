[1] The court notes that the motion
was neither timely filed nor substantively different than MIL No. 13.


[2] Plaintiffs also filed a document
entitled “Statement By Plaintiffs Re Documents Relating To The Transaction That
Should Have Been Provided In Spanish” (the Statement).  Kia objects to this document on the grounds the
Statement does not concern the bifurcation issue presently before the court.  The objection has merit.  The Statement concerns a separate issue:
whether Plaintiffs should have been provided a Spanish translation of the
documents related to the purchase of the allegedly defective vehicle.  The objection is SUSTAINED.  


[3] In further support of Kia’s position, an offer letter
which contemplates the execution of future contracts is appropriate.  After all, one contract may may anticipate the execution of future contracts.  (See, e.g., City of Galt v. Cohen (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 367, 381.) 
Further, there is no basis provided to assume that the release Kia would
propose would be unlawfully overbroad.  (See
Covert
v. FCA USA, LLC (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 821, 839 [rejecting notion
an anticipated release would reach impermissibly broader than the claims at
issue under the Act]).
