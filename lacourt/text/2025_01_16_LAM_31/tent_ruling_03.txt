I.          INTRODUCTION

 
This matter arises from alleged wrongful actions pertaining
to the listing of residential real estate.  On May 23, 2022, Plaintiff Investor Partners
Inc. dba Bruce Jay Associates (Investor Partners) filed a Complaint against
Defendant Sara Hechtman (Hechtman).
 
On June 10, 2022, Investor Partners filed the operative
First Amended Complaint against Hechtman alleging a single cause of action for
Breach of Contract.  Hechtman filed an
Answer to the Complaint on July 6, 2022.
 
On September 21, 2023, after the court granted Hechtman’s
Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint, Hechtman filed a Cross-Complaint
against Investor Partners.  On April 9,
2024, pursuant to stipulation with Investor Partners, Hechtman filed the Second
Amended Cross-Complaint (SAXC), alleging causes of  action for (1) Intentional Breach of Fiduciary
Duty; (2) Negligent Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Conversion; (4) Violation of
Penal Code § 496; (5) Negligence; (6) Intentional Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; (7) Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage; and (8) Breach of Contract. 
 
On May 13, 2024, Investor Partners filed a demurrer to the
third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action in the SAXC, as well
as a motion to strike portions of the SAXC. 
 
The demurrer and motion to strike were heard on September
11, 2024.  On September 19, 2024, after
taking the matter under submission, the court issued its final ruling: (1) sustaining
the demurrer to the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action and
granting leave to amend as to the sixth and seventh causes of action only, (3) overruling
the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, (4) striking the request for punitive
damages and granting leave to amend, and (5) finding the motion to strike
attorneys’ fees and treble damages as moot.
 
On October 14, 2024, Hechtman timely filed the Third Amended
Cross-Complaint (TAXC) alleging causes of action for (1) Intentional Breach of
Fiduciary Trust; (2) Negligence; (3) Intentional Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; (4) Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage; and (5) Breach of Contract.
 
            On November
15, 2024, Investor Partners filed a demurrer to the third and fourth causes of
action in the TAXC, as well as a motion to strike portions of the TAXC.
 
            On January
2, 2025, Hechtman filed the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint without leave of
court.
 
            On January
6, 2025, Hechtman filed an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike,
arguing they were mooted by the filing of the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint.[1]  
 
            On January
9, 2025, Investor Partners filed a consolidated reply.
 
II.        DISCUSSION 
 
            Hechtman argues she is entitled to file the Fourth
Amended Cross-Complaint because she is entitled to do so once without leave of
court.  Hechtman is mistaken.  “A party may amend its pleading once without
leave of the court at any time before the answer or demurrer is filed, or after
a demurrer is filed but before the demurrer is heard if the amended complaint
... is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer. A party may amend the complaint ... after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer, upon stipulation by the parties.”  (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564, 573 (Hedwall), citing Code Civ.
Proc., § 472.)  However, the section 472
right to amend is confined to the original complaint.  (See Hedwall, at pp. 573-579 (concluding,
as a matter of first impression, that the section 472 right to amend applies
only to the original complaint).)  Accordingly,
Hechtman cannot rely on section 472 to file her Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint.   
            
            Moreover,
Hechtman’s unauthorized filing of the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint amounts to
an admission that Investor Partners’ demurrer and motion to strike are
meritorious.  Indeed, Hechtman does not
offer any argument on the sufficiency of the allegations in the TAXC.
 
III.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, Investor Partners’ demurrer to the third and
fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED. The motion to strike is GRANTED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.  
 
Hechtman is directed to re-serve and re-file the Fourth
Amended Cross-Complaint within 5 court days of this order.
 
Investor Partners to give notice.
