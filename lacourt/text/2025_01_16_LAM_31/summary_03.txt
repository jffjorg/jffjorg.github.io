And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Investor Partners Inc. v. Sara Hechtman. The case involves allegations of wrongful actions related to the listing of residential real estate. Hechtman filed a cross-complaint alleging various causes of action, including intentional breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of contract. Investor Partners filed a demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action and a motion to strike.

The judge has sustained the demurrer and granted the motion to strike, finding that Hechtman's unauthorized filing of a fourth amended cross-complaint amounts to an admission that the demurrer and motion to strike are meritorious. The judge has also granted leave to amend. Hechtman is directed to re-serve and re-file the fourth amended cross-complaint within five court days of the order.
