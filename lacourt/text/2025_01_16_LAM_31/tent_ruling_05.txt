I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
Song-Beverly action.  Before the court
are Plaintiff Christina Gozy’s three (3) motions to compel Defendant Mercedes
Benz USA, LLC’s further discovery responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents.   
 
            Relevant
Background
 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel
Defendant to provide initial responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents.  Defendant filed opposition
which, in part, requested leave to file motions for relief from waiver of its
objections. 
 
            On June 25,
2024, while Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses were pending,
Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendant’s further discovery responses to
the same set of discovery—Plaintiff’s First Set of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.
 
On August 20, 2024, after taking the matter under
submission, the court granted the motions to compel initial responses to
Special Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents.  Defendant was
ordered to serve verified, objection-free responses to the Special
Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, within 30 days of the
court’s order.  Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses to Form Interrogatories was denied because Defendant provided
responses.  Defendant’s request for
relief from waiver of its objections was denied. 
 
As to Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses, the
court continued the motions to October 16, 2024 to allow the parties to participate
in an informal discovery conference (IDC).
 
The motions to compel further responses were heard on
October 16, 2024.  In advance of the
hearing, the court issued a tentative ruling denying the motions because the
parties had not participated in an IDC or apprised the court of the status of
the discovery dispute.  After oral
argument, the court continued the hearing for the motions to allow the parties
to participate in an IDC.  
 
The parties attended an IDC on December 5, 2024.  The issues were not resolved.  The court proceeds to rule on Plaintiff’s
motions. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD¿¿ 
¿ 
Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and
2031.310, parties may move for a further response to interrogatories requests
for production of documents¿where an answer to the request is evasive or
incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general.¿ The motion
“shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given within 45 days of
service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310,
subd. (c).)¿ The motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd.
(b)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Finally, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            According to Plaintiff’s separate statements, Plaintiff
seeks further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1,
13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1-50.6, Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-34, and
Request for Production of Documents (RPD) Nos. 1-90.  The court rules as follows.
 
A.   
Form Interrogatories
 
Plaintiff argues a further response is warranted because
Defendant provided objection-only responses to the Form Interrogatories despite
having waived its right to assert objections. 
The argument lacks merit.  In the
court’s August 20, 2024, order, the court found that “Defendant served belated
responses to the Form Interrogatories which are substantially compliant.
Defendant is entitled to relief from the waiver of objections as to the Form
Interrogatories. The motion to compel Defendant’s responses to the Form
Interrogatories is DENIED.”  (Minute
Order, 8/20/24.)  The court also notes
that Defendant provided substantive responses to the Form Interrogatories.  Accordingly, the court rules on the
sufficiency of Defendant’s substantive responses to the Form Interrogatories as
follows:
 
No. 1.1:           Denied.
 Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 4.1:           Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 4.2:           Denied.
 Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 12.1:         Granted.
 Evasive and incomplete.
No. 12.2:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 12.3:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 12.4:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 12.5:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 12.6:         Granted.  Evasive and incomplete.
No. 12.7:         Granted.  Evasive and incomplete.
No. 13.1:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 13.2:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 14.1:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 14.2:         Denied. 
Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 15.1:         Granted.
Evasive and incomplete.
No. 17.1:         Granted.
Evasive and incomplete.
No. 50.1:         Granted.
Evasive and incomplete.
No. 50.2:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 50.3:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 50.4:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 50.5:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 50.6:         Denied.  Substantive response is code compliant.
 
 
B.    
Special Interrogatories
 
No. 1:              Granted.  Evasive and incomplete.
No. 2:              Denied.
 Substantive response is code compliant.
No. 3-21:         Granted.  Evasive and incomplete.
Nos. 22-33:     Granted.  Objections were waived.  No substantive response provided.
No. 34:            Granted.  Evasive and incomplete.
 
C.    
Request for Production of Documents 
 
Defendant served a mixture of objection and substantive
responses.  Like the Special
Interrogatories, Defendant waived its right to object to the production
requests.  With this in mind, the court
rules as follows:
 
Nos. 1-7:         Granted.
 Defendant stated it would comply but has
yet to produce any documents.  The motion
is construed as a motion to compel compliance.
Nos. 8-9:         Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)
No. 10:            Granted.  Evasive.
No. 11:            Granted.  Defendant stated it would comply but has yet
to produce any documents.  The motion is
construed as a motion to compel compliance.
Nos. 12-43:     Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
No. 44:            Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
No. 45-47:       Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
Nos. 48-51:     Granted.  Defendant stated it would comply but has yet
to produce any documents.  The motion is
construed as a motion to compel compliance.
Nos. 52-57:     Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
No. 58:            Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
Nos. 59-60:     Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
Nos. 61-66:     Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
No. 67:            Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
Nos. 68-80:     Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
No. 81:            Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
Nos. 82-83:     Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
No. 84:            Granted.  Inability to comply statement is not code
complaint. (CCP § 2031.230.)  
Nos. 85-87:     Granted.  Defendant stated it would comply but has yet
to produce any documents.  The motion is
construed as a motion to compel compliance.
Nos. 88-90:     Granted.  Objections have been waived.  No substantive response provided.
 
D.   
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiff request sanctions against Defendant.  If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the
person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested,
that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be
set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.  Here, Plaintiff does not state her request
for sanctions in the notices of motion. 
Accordingly, the request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motions are Granted in Part, and Denied in Part.  Defendant is ordered to provide further
responses or produce documents consistent with its statements of compliance within
30 days of this order.
            
The request for sanctions is Denied.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
