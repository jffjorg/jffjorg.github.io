Case    # 20CHCV00340      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 22, 2024    MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE FIRST AMENDED  ANSWER  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 20CHCV00340    Motion  filed: 4/8/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Allied Servicing  Corporation; Sheila White; and Melissa Bolling (the “Moving Defendants” or  “Allied Defendants”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Henry W. Hardison (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting the Moving Defendants leave to file their First Amended Answer  to the Second Amended Complaint.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   On June 5, 2020, Plaintiff initiated this action.  Subsequently, on October 9, 2020, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.   On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed the operative  Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Second Chance Home Loans,  LLC; Allied Servicing Corporation; Homecoming Property, LLC; Stewardship  Properties, LLC; Sandor Lau; William Syrios; Sheila White; and Melissa Bolling  (collectively, “Defendants”); and Does 1 through 200, alleging the following  causes of action: (1) Money Had and Received; (2) Intentional  Misrepresentation; (3) Negligent Misrepresentation; (4) Declaratory Relief; (5)  Violation of California Fair Debt Collection Act (Civil Code § 1788.30); (6)  Violation of Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 USCA § 1692k); (7)  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Negligent Infliction of  Emotional Distress; (9) Unjust Enrichment; (10) Cancellation of Instrument;  (11) Unfair Competition – Business & Profession Code § 17200; and (12) Tort  of Another. Subsequently, on March 11, 2021, Defendants filed their joint  Answer to the SAC.   On November 24, 2021, the Court denied Plaintiff’s  motion for summary judgment filed on September 1, 2021. (2021/11/24 Minute  Order.)   On July 29, 2022, the Court denied Defendants’ motion  for summary judgment filed on April 22, 2022. (2022/07/29 Minute Order.)               On August 22, 2023, the Court  granted the parties’ joint stipulation to continue trial and all related dates  and deadlines, setting the current trial date as August 19, 2024.               On February 9, 2024, the Moving  Defendants filed substitutions of attorney.                Following this, on April 8, 2024,  the Moving Defendants filed the instant Motion for Leave to File First Amended  Answer (the “Motion”).               On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed his  Non-opposition to the Motion.               No replying papers have been  received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   Code of Civil Procedure section  473, subdivision (a)(1), provides in pertinent part, “The court may likewise,  in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as  may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars;  and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by  this code.”    Trial courts have discretion to permit amendments, which  should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments to promote the judicial  policy to resolve all disputed matters in one lawsuit. (Kittredge  Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045,  1047.)   Pursuant to California Rules of Court rule  3.1324(a), a motion to amend must: (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment  or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered; and (2) state what  allegations are proposed to be deleted from or added to the previous pleading  and where such allegations are located.  California Rules of Court rule  3.1324(b) requires a separate declaration that accompanies the motion, stating:  (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;  (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and  (4) the reason why the request for amendment was not made earlier.    A.     Motion for  Leave to File First Amended Answer   The Moving Defendants assert that the purpose of the proposed  First Amended Answer (“FAA”) is to update the caption page with new counsel of  record information, add eight affirmative defenses, and add one line to the  prayer for relief. (Reynolds Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.) Additionally, the counsel attests  that these proposed affirmative defenses were formulated shortly after he was  substituted in as the Moving Defendants’ attorney of record and reviewed the case  documents. (Id. ¶ 7.) The Motion is accompanied by a copy of the proposed  FAA as well as a redlined copy of the Moving Defendants’ original Answer to the  SAC, indicating the proposed changes. (Id. ¶ 4.)    Consequently, the Court finds that the Moving Defendants  have complied with the requirements mandated by the California Rules of Court  rule 3.1324.    Furthermore, the Motion states that there is no prejudice  to Plaintiff as the FAA relates to the same general set of facts pleaded in the  SAC, and Plaintiff still has adequate time to conduct written discovery on the  proposed affirmative defenses before the discovery cut-off date on July 18,  2024. (Reynolds Decl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff does not contest or contradict the  Motion.   Accordingly, the Court finds that the FAA will not cause  the type of prejudice that warrants the denial of the Motion.   Based on the foregoing, the unopposed Motion for Leave to  File First Amended Answer is GRANTED. The Court further ordered the Moving  Defendants to serve and file their First Amended Answer within five days of  this ruling.   CONCLUSION   The  Moving Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File First Amended Answer is GRANTED.   The  Moving Defendants are ordered to serve and file their First Amended Answer to  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint within five days of this ruling.   Moving  party is ordered to provide notice.
