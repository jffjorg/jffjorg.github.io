  Case Number:  BC487908    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  74 June Duley
v. Depuy, Inc., et al.
Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for
Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
July 6, 2012, Plaintiff June Duley (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Depuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (Defendant). 
            On
October 23, 2023, Defendant propounded special interrogatories (set one) on
Plaintiff.
            However,
Plaintiff never provided responses.
            Defendant
attempted to meet and confer to no avail.
            On
February 6, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses
to the special interrogatories.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Plaintiff has not responded to the special
interrogatories. Moreover, sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff’s failure
to timely respond lacked substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).) Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable,
and he has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Chan Decl., ¶ 7.) Given
Plaintiff’s non-opposition to the motion, though, a substantive reply from
Defendant is not necessary. Moreover, this motion largely duplicates
Defendant’s prior discovery motion. The court will adjust the award
accordingly. ($1,110 = $555 (1 hour (motion) + 1 hour (preparation for and
attendance at hearing).) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the special
interrogatories. Plaintiff shall provide Code-compliant responses, without
objections, within 30 days of this order. The court grants Defendant’s request
for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel attorney fees in the sum
of $1,110 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
shall give notice.
