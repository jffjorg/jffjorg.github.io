The court finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the special interrogatories and that the defendant's failure to respond lacked substantial justification, warranting sanctions. The plaintiff is ordered to provide code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of the order, and to pay the defendant's counsel attorney fees within the same timeframe.
