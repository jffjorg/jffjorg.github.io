The judge has set a hearing for June 5, 2024, to hear from the parties regarding the plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was originally heard on May 14, 2024, and continued to May 29, 2024, when the defendant failed to appear. The judge expresses concern that granting the motion may disrupt the orderly process of justice, particularly given the upcoming trial date of June 10, 2024. The court will hear from the parties to determine the next steps in the case.
