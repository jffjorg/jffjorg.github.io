CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV35971
SHATAIRAH WILSON, et al. vs STORPA INVESTMENTS 2  
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: THE COURT WILL HEAR FROM
THE PARTIES
 
Plaintiff’s counsel
previously filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. On May 14, 2024, the Court
heard the motion and noted that all judicial forms had been filed, and a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship constitutes good cause for
withdrawal. However, the court also noted that the next hearing, the Final
Status Conference, was set for May 29, 2024, which was only 15 days away, and
the trial was scheduled for June 10, 2024. Given that these dates were both
less than a month away, the court expressed concern that granting Jones’s
motion to withdraw may disrupt the orderly process of justice. Consequently,
the court continued the motion until May
29, 2024.
On May 29, 2024, no
appearance was made by Defendant. On the court’s own motion, the Hearing on the
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel was continued to June 5, 2024. Given that the
trial date is still set for June 10, 2024, which is only five days away, the
court will hear from the parties.
