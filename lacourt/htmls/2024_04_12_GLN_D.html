E, F&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:</div><div>Plaintiff New Look Skin Center, Inc (New Look spa) and its manager, plaintiff Albert Markarian, allege that New Look spa provides spa-quality skin treatments, including laser hair removal, tattoo removal, acne and acne scar treatment, wrinkle reduction, cellulite treatment, chemical peels, and other treatments.&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that in August of 2020, defendants David Yerushalmi and Yerushalmi Law Firm, APC contacted New Look spa by phone to inform it defendants were representing a patient of New Look spa, and demanded that New Look spa provide its commercial liability policy information.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs repeatedly and unequivocally advised defendants that New Look spa was represented by counsel.&nbsp; Plaintiffs later used a false name, “Alan,” to contact New Look spa by telephone to obtain access to management to obtain information including New Look spa’s confidential liability insurance information, and persisted in these efforts, ultimately contacting New Look spa’s counsel to obtain the insurance information.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that thereafter plaintiffs continued their surreptitious efforts to obtain the insurance information by falsely impersonating New Look spa in a call with the insurance company directly, during which defendant Yerushalmi false identified himself as Albert Markarian from New Look Skin Center, indicated that the company’s phone and internet systems were down, and asked the insurance company to immediately fax a copy of the most recent insurance declaration page and other information for a meeting with New Look spa’s accountant the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs allege that the information and documents defendants requested while falsely pretending to be plaintiffs, were not available to the public and contained confidential and business documents of plaintiffs, and that defendants were successful in obtaining New Look spa’s confidential information, as a result of which plaintiffs have been damaged.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendants seek to compel the deposition of plaintiff Albert Markarian, which defendants have noticed twice, with no written objection served.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7-9, Exs. B, C].&nbsp; The deposition was most recently scheduled for December 21, 2023, on a date offered by counsel for plaintiff.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 7-9, Ex. C].&nbsp; Defendants’ counsel drove from San Diego to Los Angeles on December 20, 2023, and the following morning appeared at the deposition location at the time noticed, along with a videographer and court reporter, but plaintiff did not appear.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 10-13].&nbsp; Defendants’ counsel contacted plaintiffs’counsel, who claimed that they knew nothing of the scheduled deposition that day, but then later acknowledged responsibility for having failed to attend the deposition.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, Ex. D].&nbsp; Since December, counsel for defendants has continued to ask for available dates for plaintiff’s deposition, and ultimately plaintiffs’ counsel has refused to produce plaintiff for deposition prior to April of 2024.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16, Ex. F].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The moving papers sufficiently establish here that plaintiff, a party to the action, did not serve an objection, and failed to appear for his examination which had been noticed on a date offered by plaintiff’s counsel as available.&nbsp; Defendants are accordingly entitled to an order compelling plaintiff’s attendance and testimony.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff Markarian argues in the opposition that the motion is now moot, as since the filing of the motion, plaintiff appeared for his deposition on February 29, 2024, and also produced records in his possession, custody and control that were responsive to the requests for production set forth in the deposition notice.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion appears to now be moot, and no order appears to be necessary.&nbsp; If defendants are not satisfied with the testimony or documents provided at the February deposition, a new motion must be filed following an appropriate meet and confer, and accompanied by an appropriate separate statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp;</span></div><div>Sanctions</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This leaves the issue of monetary sanctions, which are sought by both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants request monetary sanctions for the expense of having to bring this motion, and for the expense incurred in connection with the December deposition which plaintiff did not attend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2025.450 (g)(1):</div><div>“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2023.010 (d) provides that misuse of the discovery process includes, “Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”&nbsp; &nbsp;CCP § 2023.030(a) authorizes the imposition of monetary sanctions against a party and its attorney for misuse of the discovery process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a):&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v.

B].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that then, the following week, on February 2, 2024, defendants’ counsel wrote to plaintiff’s counsel, “Please confirm you’re taking your motions to compel off-calendar given they’ve been rendered moot.&nbsp; If not, we’ll oppose today.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Kerendian Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. B].&nbsp; Evidently the motions were not taken off calendar, and counsel for defendants filed this motion to compel Markarian’s deposition a few hours later that date.&nbsp; [Kerendian Decl. ¶10].&nbsp; Counsel for plaintiff argues that he was completely at a loss as to why defendants’ counsel elected to file a motion to compel despite stating on January 24 that the parties should pursue an IDC, and that this motion was improper and unnecessary, but was filed in retaliation for the four pending motions to compel being pursued by plaintiffs.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Kerendian Decl. ¶ 11].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court is concerned that the motion was filed while plaintiff’s counsel was under the not unreasonable impression that the parties would continue their efforts to resolve the scheduling issue informally.&nbsp; However, it appears that at the time the motion was filed, counsel for plaintiff also had not yet moved from the position that the deposition should not occur until April, and evidently did not reconsider that position until the motion was filed, and to which the February date was agreed.&nbsp; [See Ex. A, stating the proposed April date “is completely unacceptable.&nbsp; Give me dates in the first two weeks of February or I’ll notice it within that window and enforce it accordingly via court order as needed.”]&nbsp; &nbsp;It also appears that counsel for defendants was not unreasonable in pursuing the motion in order to preserve the right to recover the expenses for the non-appearance at the December deposition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the circumstances, including the representation by counsel for defendants that a motion would be pursued only after a February date was noticed, the court will award the reasonable expenses incurred due to the non-appearance in favor of defendants, but will not award the expense of bringing and pursuing this motion while the parties were continuing to pursue informal resolution of the schedule, as it would appear unjust under the circumstances to shift that expense to plaintiff.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the opposition argues that sanctions should be imposed on defendants and defendants counsel, as the motion was brought without substantial justification and despite representations that an ex parte application would be made to resolve the issue via IDC, and without warning, in retaliation for plaintiff’s motions to compel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 2025.450 (g)(1), which as set forth above, provides, in pertinent part,:</div><div>“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated…</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This provision does not support the imposition of sanctions against the party who noticed the deposition and filed a motion but provides for sanctions only to the successful moving party.&nbsp; &nbsp;No other provision is cited in the opposition, and no sanctions will be awarded against defendant moving party in this circumstance.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The sanctions sought by defendant are $15,939.&nbsp; Defendants seek 15 hours to pursue this motion at $595 ($8,925), and the $60 filing fee which sum will not be awarded.&nbsp; These sanctions will not be awarded.</div><div><br></div><div>The sanctions sought for the non-appearance include a videographer fee of $525, a court reporter fee of $1,074, and 5 hours to travel to and attend the deposition at $595 per hour ($2,975).&nbsp; These total $4,574.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition does not challenge specifically any aspect of these fees and costs as unreasonable.&nbsp; The court is concerned, however, that the travel time is for travel from San Diego to Los Angeles, when ordinarily the costs arising from defendant’s choice to retain distant counsel is not properly shifted to plaintiff.&nbsp; However, the court awards attorney travel time in this instance since plaintiff’s attorneys were aware of the travel distance and did not offer to have the deposition conducted remotely or to travel to plaintiff’s counsel office in San Diego to conduct the deposition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Albert Markarian and Production of Documents Demanded at Deposition is MOOT in light of the representation in the opposition that plaintiff was deposed on February 29, 2024, and has produced documents responsive to the deposition notice prior to the hearing on this motion.

[Id.].&nbsp; Counsel indicates that a copy of the letter is attached, but no attachment is included.&nbsp; Counsel states he was at a complete loss as to how this could have happened, and that in investigating the matter, he did not rule out any possibility as to how this could have happened.&nbsp; [Gutierrez Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Counsel’s declaration goes on to state that on or about January 25, 2024, counsel was informed by two of his staff members that there appeared to be on counsel’s central computer system a list of blocked emails preventing the reception of any emails&nbsp; from the blocked emails, and counsel was also advised that the sender of the emails would not receive a notice that their email was blocked, so would in all likelihood assume the email was received.&nbsp; [Gutierrez Decl., para. 3].&nbsp; Counsel indicates that Mr. Alkana’s office, opposing counsel’s office, “was one of the blocked emails from this list.”&nbsp; [Id.].&nbsp; The declaration states:</div><div>“This is the reason that I did not receive any documents of any discovery or Motion to Compel Discovery from Mr. Alkana’s office as they were all sent electronically. Obviously, I never authorized anyone to prepare a blocked email list or had no knowledge of any list of blocked emails nor did I at any time instruct anybody to do the same or restrict any communication by my office. Attached hereto is a copy of said list as Exhibit 2. I believe that this is what happened.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is my responsibility in as much as representing Mrs. Navarrete. However, such action was taken by surprise and excusable neglect on my part. I also paid the sanctions in this matter in as much as the problem emanated from my office. However, I do not want the court to think that this was some gross negligence or intentional conduct on either my part or my Client’s part. My Client was completely innocent of this and I was unknowing that someone in my office would have created this blocked communications list. I am requesting that the court consider these circumstances in affording plaintiff Erika W. Navarrete request for Relief in this matter.”</div><div>[Gutierrez Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Again, although there is reference to Exhibit 2, no such exhibit is attached to the moving papers, and, according to the opposition papers, the exhibits also were not served.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Guitierrez declaration is accompanied by two declarations from office staff members also describing the discovery of emails being blocked.&nbsp; [Vargas Decl., paras. 2, 3; Alvarez Decl., paras. 2, 3].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The moving papers also include a declaration of plaintiff Navarrete stating that she “was never put on notice that this discovery was served” on her via her previous counsel of record, Gutierrez, and that if she had been properly notified, she “would have made the good faith effort and ultimately responded in a timely manner allowed” or “requested further time to respond per California law.”&nbsp; [Navarrete Decl., paras. 5, 7].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also indicates that the request will not cause prejudice to defendant Rodriguez because discovery is continuing, and if the request is granted, defendant will have proper responses per code that correspond with plaintiff’s contentions in this case.&nbsp; [Navarrete Decl., para.&nbsp; 8].&nbsp; The declarations confirm that all monetary sanctions ordered have been paid, so there will be no prejudice to defendant with respect to monetary sanctions.&nbsp; [Navarrete Decl., para. 9; Gutierrez Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition argues that plaintiff has failed to establish that email messages from counsel for defendant and cross-complainant were not received by former counsel, as the documents which were sent to plaintiff’s counsel did not come from counsel Alkana directly, but were sent primarily from three different staff members of Eugene Alkana, none of whom have email addresses that reference of are associated with Eugene Alkana, APLC.&nbsp; In support of this argument, the opposition submits declarations from legal secretaries Maple Jiang, Denise Alhadeff, and Beatriz Santiago who state that they use email addresses to serve documents and notices in connection with this case that have no indication in them that the addresses are affiliated with the Alkana law firm [Jiang Decl., paras.4, 5; Alhadeff Decl., paras. 4, 5; Santiago Decl., paras. 3-5].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, most of the attached emails were copied on Alkana at an email including Alkana and were also copied on another attorney at the firm with the name Alkana in the email address, at addresses eugenealkana@mindspring .com and robertalkana@gmail.com.&nbsp; [See Jiang Decl., Ex. A, Akhadeff Decl., Ex. A; Santiago Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp; This could explain why those emails were not received as subject to the block.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Only three of the attached emails were not also copied on the Alkana email addresses, an August 26, 2023 letter attaching a notice of non-opposition to a demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint, an October 4, 2023 message attaching Form Interrogatories, Set Three, and an August 22, 2023 message attaching an unspecified attachment, entitled GutierrezRodriguez082223.pdf.&nbsp; [Jiang Decl., Ex. A; Santiago Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp; None of these would have given notice of the service of Requests for Admissions, or the motion requesting they be deemed admitted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition also argues that it appears that other emails which were sent from those email addresses were in fact received by former counsel.&nbsp; For example, defendant argues that defendant’s cross-complaint was electronically served by email on August 31, 2023, and must have been received as former counsel filed an answer to the cross-complaint on October 3, 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp; The attached email does in fact show that the subject email was served from a staff member, Jiang, from an email address of mapleleeng01@gmail.com.&nbsp; [Jiang Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp; This email is one which was also copied on the Alkanas.&nbsp; &nbsp;The email expressly requested, “Please confirm receipt,” but there is no indication that receipt was ever confirmed.&nbsp; &nbsp;This email is one of the earlier ones which are included in the opposition and could possibly have been sent before the blocking had occurred.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also points out that the moving papers refer to, and rely heavily on a list of blocked senders attached as an exhibit, but that no exhibits are attached to the declaration, so that it cannot be ascertained who is included on this list of alleged blocked senders.&nbsp; This issue will be discussed at the hearing, as the exhibits are also not attached to the papers filed with the court.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the court is prepared to accept the representations and testimony in the declarations themselves, particularly the testimony offered by an attorney as an officer of the court, as sufficient for analysis by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in opposition also argues that certain documents were also sent to former counsel via U.S. mail, including a letter of November 20, 2023 enclosing a notice of inspection which referenced the pending motions to compel for failure to respond to discovery.&nbsp; The letter at issue from Eugene Alkana does lead off with a paragraph concerning the discovery motions:</div><div>“As you know, there are several discovery motions that are upcoming because your client has failed to respond to any of the discovery propounded by the Defendant.&nbsp; Each of the discovery motions also has a request for monetary sanctions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Alkana Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant’s counsel in the letter also recognizes that there has been a lack of response to notices for some time, stating, “I’m somewhat bewildered by the failure of Plaintiff to respond to any of the discovery that has been propounded.”&nbsp; [Alkana Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that this correspondence was also served by U.S. mail.&nbsp; However, the proof of service on this letter is not particularly clear, as while the box is checked that an envelope was deposited in the mail, the proof of service does not clearly indicate that service was made other than by the box checked, “by e-mail.”&nbsp; [See Alkana Decl., Ex. A, Proof of Service].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition shows that the letter was served by email by Jiang, from her email address, and copied on the Alkanas.&nbsp; The Jiang Declaration does not include any statement that this correspondence and attachments were also served by regular mail.&nbsp; [See Jiang Decl., Ex. A].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, the opposition includes a letter from former counsel dated January 12, 2024, indicating that no notice of site inspection was ever received, but that plaintiff’s counsel learned about it from his client who had heard about it directly from defendant:</div><div>“I have been made aware that you wish to confirm a site inspection of the property… to take place on January 16, 2024.&nbsp; We did not receive a written notice from your office pursuant to CCP section 2031.010 et. Seq.&nbsp; Rather, we were notified of your request for a site inspection by our client. Neither you nor your client are to communicate directly with Ms. Navarette under any circumstances.&nbsp; We will agree to a future date and time for a property inspection upon receipt of proper notice.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Alkana Decl., Ex. C].</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it is a bit troubling that the moving papers did not include the list referenced as Exhibit 2, and did not explain who prepared that document, and how it was retrieved or generated.&nbsp; &nbsp;None of the staff declarations indicate that the witness prepared Exhibit 2, and neither does the declaration of counsel.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, it appears that previous counsel’s account through the declarations makes sense and would explain counsel’s unawareness of the proceedings against his client, particularly if the email block served to block correspondence delivered which had been copied on email addresses affiliated with opposing counsel of the Alkana name.&nbsp; It would appear that plaintiff’s previous counsel has taken responsibility for his mistake in this matter, and the testimony is credible.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no testimony offered in the opposition that the opposing attorneys ever had a telephone conversation concerning the Requests for Admissions or motion, or that counsel for defendant is aware of other conduct which would establish that counsel for plaintiff had notice specifically of the requests for admissions or the proceedings to have them deemed omitted and is now incorrectly claiming he did not.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant in the opposition also argues that even if the court is satisfied with former counsel’s excuses, this would constitute a breach of the attorney’s duty to be informed and to inform one’s client about critical developments in the case and would constitute inexcusable neglect.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Attorney conduct has been held not “excusable” under the discretionary provision of CCP section 473(b), which can be applied here, as discussed above, where the conduct consisted of counsel’s failure to discharge “routine professional duties”, or failure to “properly prepare for the hearing.”&nbsp; Generale Bank Nederland v. Eyes of the Beholder Ltd (1998, 2nd Dist.) 61 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1402.&nbsp; The Second District in Generale Bank reviewed the “reasonably prudent person standard” governing a determination of “excusable neglect” and concluded with respect to attorney conduct:</div><div>“Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not therefore excusable.&nbsp; &nbsp;To hold otherwise would be to eliminate the express statutory requirement of excusability and effectively eviscerate the concept of attorney malpractice.”&nbsp;</div><div>Generale Bank, at 1400.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Second District in Luri v.

[Navarrete Decl., para.&nbsp; 8].&nbsp; It appears from the file that beyond the written discovery to which Navarrete has now responded other than the RFAs which are the subject of this motion, there appear to have been no other discovery disputes so far, and this posture does not appear to be a situation where, for example, depositions which have already been completed will need to be reconvened.&nbsp; Plaintiff’s declarations confirm that all monetary sanctions ordered have been paid by previous counsel, so there will be no prejudice to defendant with respect to monetary sanctions.&nbsp; [Navarrete Decl., para. 9; Gutierrez Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in opposition argues that defendant will be prejudiced because defendant previously propounded Form Interrogatory 17.1, which concerns responses to RFAs, and, if this motion is granted and plaintiff is permitted to answer the RFAs, the Form Interrogatory will have to be served again.&nbsp; This circumstance appears to be a minimal inconvenience, not the type of prejudice to justify denying relief.&nbsp; Defendant also argues that once the RFAs are no longer admitted, defendant will be required to conduct expensive further discovery to determine why requests for admissions were denied, including conducting multiple depositions, and serving records subpoenas to determine income and expense related to the Navarrete Family Care business and to contractors that performed work at the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>It is not clear how the necessity to conduct such discovery would prejudice defendant in maintaining defendant’s action or defense “on the merits,” under the statute.&nbsp; It does not appear that in the short period between the RFAs being deemed admitted in late December and this motion being filed in mid-March necessary evidence or witnesses have disappeared, become unavailable or grown stale, or memories of the events at issue have faded.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the court also has determined that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in the opposition requests that if the relief is granted, the court impose conditions which are just, and requests that plaintiff be ordered as a condition to relief, to pay defendant and defendant’s counsel $10,000 toward future discovery costs and expenses resulting from the conduct of plaintiff and plaintiff’s former counsel.</div><div><br></div><div>The argument is based on CCP § 2033.300(c), which provides, in connection with the withdrawal of amendment of an admission:&nbsp;</div><div>“(c) The court may impose conditions on the granting of the motion that are just, including, but not limited to, the following:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(1) An order that the party who obtained the admission be permitted to pursue additional discovery related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) An order that the costs of any additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the party withdrawing or amending the admission.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, there has been no trial date set, so defendant is free to pursue additional discovery related to the matter involved in the RFAs which will be permitted to be responded to, so no further order concerning the pursuit of further discovery is required, or an order reopening or continuing the discovery cut off dates.&nbsp; There is no argument that certain costs for additional discovery will be unnecessarily incurred or would be duplicative of expenses already incurred, such as where a deposition must be reconvened which would have otherwise been covered by the court reporter expenses already incurred.&nbsp; The declaration in support of the request in the opposition, in support of the amount requested, states:</span></div><div>“In all, Defendant must take at least two (2) depositions, serve at least four (4) to six (6) records subpoenas, and obtain such information of discovery that has not been answered, including Form Interrogatories, Set No. Three (3).

(Hippo), which informed plaintiff it was closing her case at her request, forcing plaintiff to reopen the case.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that in June of 2023, Hippo denied plaintiff’s claim on the basis that the water damage was the result of ongoing seepage from an unknown source, quoting language from the insurance policy excluding such losses, when the language relied upon does not appear in the policy, which includes contrary language.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that Hippo ignored certain endorsements in the policy, closed plaintiff’s case to create a delay to qualify for an exclusion, failed and refused to conduct an adequate investigation of the claim, and based its denial of the claim on damage resulting from an unknown source.&nbsp; &nbsp;The FAC alleges that plaintiff’s homeowner’s insurance policy with defendant Hippo was underwritten by defendant Spinnaker Insurance Company (Spinnaker.)&nbsp; Both Hippo and Spinnaker are alleged to be subsidiaries of defendant Hippo Holdings, Inc. (HHI).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on January 5, 2024, the court heard a demurrer to the original complaint filed by defendant Hippo to the sixth and seventh causes of action.&nbsp; The demurrer was sustained with ten days leave to amend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Hippo and defendant HHI have now each filed demurrers challenging the sufficiency of the First Amended Complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Sixth Cause of Action—Breach of Contract—Demurrer by Hippo and HHI&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Hippo and HII each argue that the sixth cause of action for breach of contract is not sufficiently stated as against them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To plead a cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must plead the following elements: Contract formed, and terms alleged verbatim or according to legal effect; plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; defendant’s breach; and damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Walsh v. Standart (1917) 174 Cal. 807.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The previous demurrer by Hippo to this cause of action was sustained as follows:</div><div>“Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND to the sixth cause of action for breach of contract and seventh cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing on the ground the pleading fails to sufficiently allege that moving defendant is a party to the alleged contract, or is otherwise responsible for the alleged breaches of the subject contract.”</div><div>[Minute Order 1/5/2024].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Specifically, with respect to this cause of action, defendant Hippo had previously argued by reference to the policy documents attached to the complaint that the insurance policy at issue was between plaintiff and Spinnaker Insurance Company, with Hippo designated as acting as the program administrator, not a party to the contract.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argued that the contract here, the policy, is between the insured and insurer, plaintiff and Spinnaker, and that Hippo, as the program or claims administrator, cannot be liable for breach of a policy to which it is not a party.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Henry v. Associated Indemnity Corp. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1405, 1416-1417.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition to the previous demurrer pointed to mentions of Hippo in the policy provisions and argued that the policy documents include such seeming inconsistencies because Hippo and Spinnaker are one and the same company.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff went on to argue that there was a unity of interest and ownership between the two companies, and that Hippo is an undisclosed principal, in reliance on various documents such as Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other purported corporate documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In its previous minute order, the court found that such arguments went beyond what had been alleged in the complaint, which did not include alter ego allegations, or allegations concerning an undisclosed principal.&nbsp; The court also noted that arguments relied primarily on materials which could not be permissibly considered on demurrer, to which objections had been asserted and sustained.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court concluded:</div><div>“While this posture is a situation where the policy documents attached to the pleading itself could be construed to not strictly contradict the allegations of the complaint that Hippo is the insurer under the policy, the policy does affirmatively identify Hippo as the “Program Administrator,” and the policy is executed by representatives of “Spinnaker Insurance Company,” not by Hippo. [Ex. 1, pp. 003, 067].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition appears to rely on theories concerning the relationship of the two entities which are not alleged in the pleading itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer accordingly is sustained with leave to amend to permit plaintiff the opportunity to allege facts supporting alter ego and/or undisclosed principal theories to support its breach of contract claim.”</div><div>[Minute Order, 1/5/2024, p. 5].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that despite plaintiff being permitted leave to amend to allege facts supporting alter ego or undisclosed principal theories, the FAC continues to allege that Hippo entered into the policy with plaintiff and fails to allege facts supporting alter ego or undisclosed principal theories to overcome the court’s previous conclusion that the policy is a contract between plaintiff and Spinnaker.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that instead, the FAC adds Spinnaker and HHI as parties, and alleges that Hippo and Spinnaker are subsidiaries of the same parent company, HHI.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 5-6, 50].&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants argue that plaintiff has made a series of conclusory allegations that the parties were all acting as agents, employees and co-venturers acting within the scope of such agency or authority, but that this is insufficient to allege facts showing an undisclosed principal circumstance arose. Defendants also argue that although plaintiff has added a series of conclusory allegations that defendants generally are all the alter egos of each other, these allegations fail to allege sufficient facts to support alter ego liability on the part of Hippo or HII.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the agency allegations, instead of alleging facts supporting an undisclosed principal theory, plaintiff has now included a paragraph in the FAC which alleges:</div><div>“Plaintiffs are informed, believe and thereupon allege that at all times herein relevant, each of the named defendants inclusive of Does 1 through 20 was an agent, servant, principal, employee, representative, co-venturer, joint-venturer, and/or other authorized entity with the power and authority of each of its/his/her co-defendants acting within the course and scope of his, her or its agency, employment, representation, hiring, retention, supervision and/or co-venture, and that all of their acts and omissions were carried out with the consent, knowledge, actual, ostensible or apparent authority, agency, ratification, adoption and/or approval of each of the other defendants herein. Plaintiffs are informed, believe and thereupon allege that the acts and omissions of each defendant herein were ratified and approved by each of the other defendants.”</div><div>[FAC, para. 8].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue with respect to these general agency allegations that the policy on its face is a contract between plaintiff and Spinnaker, and that under California law a non-party to a contract cannot be liable for breach of that contract, and specifically, an insurer’s third-party claims administrator, that is not a party to an insurance policy, is not liable to the insured for breach of the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under Civil Code section 2338, a “principal is responsible to third parties for the negligence of his agent in the transaction of the business of the agency, including wrongful acts committed by such agent in and as a part of the transaction of such business.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants rely on Henry v. Associated Indemnity Corp. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1405, 1416-1417, cited previously by this court, in which the court of appeal affirmed a trial court order dismissing plaintiff’s causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty without leave to amend as against an insurance adjuster where “[t]here was no direct contractual relationship between [insured] and Underwriters from which either a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing or a breach of contract action could properly spring.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also rely on Filippo Industries, Inc. v. Sun Ins. Co. of New York (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1429 in which the Second District held:</div><div>“Obviously, the non-insurer defendants were not parties to the agreements for insurance; therefore, they are not, as such, subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Moreover, as agents and employees of the defendant insurers, they cannot be held accountable on a theory of conspiracy…. It is clear, therefore, that an agent cannot be held liable for breach of a duty which flows from a contract to which he is not party.</div><div><br></div><div>The causes of action in the instant case are for breach of contract and bad faith. The bad faith claim necessarily rests upon a contract. The only contract in the lawsuit is the insurance policy. Sun was a disclosed principal and subject to liability for its agent's actions and it is not disputed that McGee was the agent for Sun. Thus McGee cannot be held liable for Sun's breach of the contract and concomitant duty of good faith.”</div><div>Filippo, at 1442-1443.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the court has already concluded that it appears from the policy documents attached to the FAC that the insurance policy was between plaintiff and Spinnaker.&nbsp; Spinnaker was a disclosed principal and subject to liability for its agent’s actions so that Spinnaker under these agency allegations would be subject to liability for its agent claim administrator’s actions.&nbsp; &nbsp;The FAC now names Spinnaker as a party defendant.&nbsp; Plaintiff has made no attempt to allege facts supporting an undisclosed principal theory pursuant to which moving defendants Hippo or HHI would be subject to contractual liability for any alleged breach of the contract between plaintiff and Spinnaker, or for conduct engaged in while acting as Spinnaker’s agent.&nbsp; It appears that plaintiff has abandoned this undisclosed principal theory of liability.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that it is well settled that an insurer, as a principal, may be vicariously liable for the torts of its agents if the insurer directed or authorized the agent to perform tortious acts, or if it ratifies acts it did not originally authorize, and that in this case it is not even necessary to make a grand leap from insurer to third party agent because defendants Hippo, HHI and Spinnaker are all one company.&nbsp; Even applying the standard urged by plaintiff, the FAC fails to allege facts which would show how this agency operated as to the subject defendants, such as under an undisclosed principal theory.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This result leaves the issue of whether the FAC sufficiently alleges facts giving rise to liability on the part of these non-parties to the insurance contract on a theory of alter ego liability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC now alleges:</div><div>“10.&nbsp; At all times relevant herein, Defendants and each of them have been the primary obligor(s) on the above referenced performance or have been the alter ego of each primary obligor on such applicable duty to perform. A unity of interest and ownership has existed, at all times relevant herein, between the Defendants, and each of them, individually and collectively, as each such natural person has acted on behalf of themselves, as individuals, as well as within their respective capacities as authorized agents, trustees, partners, managing members, members, owners, founders, officers, and or directors of each such other natural person and or legal entity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>11. Such unity of interest and ownership exists between the Defendants, and each of them, that any individuality and separateness between the Defendants have ceased and such legal entities are each the alter ego of each individually named defendant herein.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>12. Adherence to the fiction of the separate existence of each named Defendant as an entity distinct from each other named Defendant would permit an abuse of corporate and/or agency privilege and would sanction corruption and promote injustice in that these Defendants, and each of them, whose principles used both their individual capacities as well as their status as business entities to perpetrate an ongoing fraud on Plaintiff.”</div><div>[FAC, paras. 10-12].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears that the only specific facts alleged in the FAC which would be relevant to the analysis are allegations that Hippo is “a subsidiary of” HHI (FAC, para. 4), and that, “Both HIPPO and SPINNAKER are subsidiaries of HIPPO HOLDINGS, INC. (“HHI”).”&nbsp; [FAC, para. 50].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that these alter ego allegations are insufficient to overcome the presumption that corporate entities are recognized as separate entities in the absence of a showing that it would be appropriate to pierce the corporate veil and subject an entity to liability for the conduct of another it has treated as its alter ego.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Disregarding a corporate entity has two requirements: 1) There must be such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist; and 2) it must be demonstrated that “the facts are such that an adherence to the separate existence of the corporation would, under the particular circumstances, sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” Minifie v.

Leuschner, 51 Cal.2d 574, 577-581 [335 P.2d 107]; Thomson v.&nbsp; L. C. Roney &amp; Co., 112 Cal.App.2d 420, 429 [246 P.2d 1017]); when they hold themselves out as being personally liable for the debts of the corporation (Stark v.

(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 825, the court of appeal set out several factors to be considered in making an alter ego determination concerning a unity of interest and ownership, including, among many, the commingling of funds and assets, treating the corporate assets as the assets of the individual, the holding out by an individual that he is personally responsible for the corporate debts, the failure to maintain minutes or adequate corporate records, the disregard of legal formalities, and the failure to adequately capitalize a corporation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Associated Vendors, at 838-840.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal noted that in the cases in which alter ego liability has been found, “in all instances several of the factors mentioned were present.”&nbsp; Associated Vendors, at 840.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>None of these factors or any other recognized factors have been alleged in these general allegations.&nbsp; With respect to the specific allegations that Spinnaker and Hippo are subsidiaries of HHI, it has long been recognized that a mere parent-subsidiary relationship is not sufficient to impose liability on the parent for the conduct of the subsidiary.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Walker v. Signal Companies, Inc. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 982, 1001 (“We conclude that more is required than solely a parent-subsidiary corporate relationship to create liability of a parent for the actions of its subsidiary.”).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued by defendants, it is held that conclusory allegations are insufficient to support an alter ego claim at the pleading stage:</div><div>“A complaint must set forth the facts with sufficient precision to put the defendant on notice about what the plaintiff is complaining and what remedies are being sought. To recover on an alter ego theory, a plaintiff need not use the words ‘alter ego,’ but must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor.</div><div>Leek v.

Plaintiff alleges that he was particularly interested in playing organized football with the SFHS teams that participate in defendant California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) organized games against other CIF teams in the Southern California section of CIF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from early 2020 through May 2021, SFHS had no in-person instruction, and no active football program.&nbsp; In June of 2021, plaintiff began attending SFHS’s football camp, and won a place on the Junior Varsity team.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that in August of 2021, plaintiff suffered an injury to his shoulder during football practice and was in October 2021 evaluated by a doctor and also diagnosed with a tear in the tendon of a finger and prescribed no PE or sports for 2 weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>In October of 2021, plaintiff alleges that during the first half of a SFHS football game, plaintiff was on the sidelines due to his medical restrictions, wearing his football uniform but not wearing pads or a helmet, when defendant Aidan Austin (Aidan), a fellow student, while wearing his football helmet, aggressively accosted plaintiff verbally for not being tough enough to play through injuries.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges he did not respond aggressively, but despite plaintiff’s peaceful response to Aidan’s bullying, Aidan, with his helmet still on, butted plaintiff in the face repeatedly, injuring plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges he did not fight back or do anything other than attempt to shield himself from Aidan’s criminal battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that no defendant took any significant disciplinary action against Aidan for the helmet assault, although it occurred in open view of hundreds of people, including one or more of the other defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At halftime, Aidan, obviously undeterred by any defendants, hunted plaintiff down in the weight room and, unprovoked, put plaintiff in a choke hold and beat him repeatedly over the head.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the following day, upon receiving reports of Aidan’s unprovoked violence against plaintiff, defendant John Jordan, Dean of Students of SFHS, punished both of them equally, by suspending them both from Friday’s football game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, Aidan again aggressively hunted plaintiff down in the locker room, threatened him, and proceeded to knee plaintiff in the groin, pulled plaintiff’s jacket over plaintiff’s head and repeatedly struck plaintiff in the head with a closed fist.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he did not fight back and sought only to shield himself.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that again defendants responded by treating plaintiff and Aidan equally, as if both were equally culpable for Aidan’s unprovoked criminal attack, which defendants had not stopped or prevented.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that in mid-October, another SFHS student reported to plaintiff that the student had seen Aidan carrying a knife on campus, and warned plaintiff to stay away from Aidan because he was armed.&nbsp; In the latter half of October, when plaintiff was intimidated and fearful of a knife armed Aidan again attacking him, plaintiff had a video displayed SnapChat conversation with another SFHS student, in which the other student viewed, near plaintiff, an airsoft gun, and plaintiff made a joke about the airsoft gun being a real firearm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, plaintiff and Recasens met with Jordan to discuss what Jordan claimed was his and SFHS’s investigation of the foregoing altercations and their aftermath.&nbsp; Jordan informed them that Jordan had a grainy photo of a gun that plaintiff had supposedly displayed on social media, but never presented this image to plaintiff or Recasens.&nbsp; The following day, plaintiff and Recasens met with SFHS’s Disciplinary Board, comprised of defendant Jordan, defendant Thomas Moran, Principal of SFHS, and six other individuals, in which plaintiff read a statement about the altercations and their aftermath, and admitted in his statement that within a week of Aidan’s most recent beating, plaintiff remembered having commented as a joke on social media that an airsoft gun the plaintiff owned was a real firearm.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he contritely admitted this joke as inappropriate and asked forgiveness.&nbsp; Plaintiff was then expelled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that had defendants acted more promptly in disciplining and either suspending or expelling Aidan prior to the last assault on plaintiff, plaintiff would not have been frightened and intimidated into joking that the airsoft gun was real, which joke led to plaintiff’s expulsion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that plaintiff has been damaged as a result of his expulsion, including mental suffering, the loss of the companionship and society of teachers and friends at SFHS, and due to the disciplinary record created with the expulsion, finding it difficult to be accepted as a student at a comparable religious high school and, later, college.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that at the new high school in which plaintiff enrolled, he was not allowed to play football for one year due to CIF rules.&nbsp; In contrast, Aidan, who was not expelled but suspended, and transferred to a different school, was allowed to participate in football after only six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff appealed the expulsion ruling to CIF explaining the circumstances, but CIF would not change its decision.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that prior to Aidan’s attacks, plaintiff had been an honor roll student, but his academic career was damaged when he failed courses because of the stress he endured from the bullying, beating and expulsion, and that plaintiff because of the beatings and expulsion, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also names as defendants the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles (Archdiocese) and Antonio Marti, the President of SFHS.</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that all defendants other than Aidan breached their duty of properly supervising Aidan to ensure that he did not bully or physically abuse plaintiff and breached their duty by failing to suspend or expel Aidan when Aidan repeatedly battered plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges causes of action against Aidan only for IIED and battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Demurrer</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Untimely&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant CIF has filed a demurrer to the complaint challenging the sufficiency of the two causes of action as stated against CIF.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition appears to suggest that the demurrer is untimely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP §430.40, the time permitted to demur to a complaint is “within 30 days after service of the complaint…”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the complaint was served on defendant CIF by substituted service, with follow up mailing on October 25, 2023.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 415.20, where service is by substituted service, the service “is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.”&nbsp;

A].&nbsp; The letter also requests a response no later than November 14, 2023, to permit defendant time to prepare a demurrer.&nbsp; [Ex. A, p. 2].&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration indicates that having heard nothing from plaintiff in response to the meet and confer, defendant filed the form requesting additional time to file a demurrer, which, as noted above, was filed on November 20, 2023.&nbsp; [Donald Decl., para. 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant indicates that one hour after that declaration was served, plaintiff’s counsel objected to the meet and confer process, and that in response, defendant’s counsel invited a substantive meet and confer but plaintiff’s counsel declined.&nbsp; [Donald Decl., para. 5].&nbsp; The declaration attaches emails reflecting that counsel for plaintiff emailed requesting that counsel for defendant withdraw the form served that date because defendant was ineligible for an automatic extension because counsel did not meet and confer in person or by telephone.&nbsp; [Donald Decl., Ex. B].&nbsp; Counsel for defendant responded, “I disagree with your interpretation but nevertheless am happy to discuss the points raised in my letter that up until now you have ignored.&nbsp; I can be reached at the number below.”&nbsp; [Ex.

To invoke procedural due process protection, an individual must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to a benefit—not simply a unilateral expectation or an abstract need. The possibility of obtaining a scholarship does not elevate participation in interscholastic athletics into an interest that due process protects, because such opportunities are themselves simply expectancies. The acquisition of a scholarship is purely speculative, contingent upon far more than simply maintaining playing privileges. For example, a scholarship is contingent upon not only the availability of the scholarship, but also the student's excelling during season, meeting certain academic and entrance exam requirements, overcoming any inference from a disciplinary record, remaining healthy, and overcoming like competitors for the same finite scholarships that are distributed by coaches in their unbridled discretion. Consequently, the opportunity to earn, or the possibility of obtaining, an athletic scholarship is too speculative to elevate participation in interscholastic sports to the level of a constitutionally protected interest.</div><div>Ryan, at 1064-1065, citations omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the claims against defendant CIF are well pleaded because the Ryan case held that participation in school sports is not a constitutional right that required “due process” before it could be taken away but did not hold that an improper expulsion could not be grounds for a claim of negligence or other torts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that plaintiff’s theory against defendant CIF is not that it had a legal obligation to supervise plaintiff, but rather that plaintiff has two theories of liability against CIF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first is a theory that CIF allowed defendant Aidan, perhaps because he is African American, to return to playing football after a short suspension, but refused to allow plaintiff, who is white, to play at all during his critical junior year, and then refused plaintiff’s appeal, damaging plaintiff’s academic career and prospects for college, and emotionally traumatizing him.&nbsp; [Paras. 40-44, 46].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second is a theory that CIF owed a duty to students at its member schools to ensure that its constitution and bylaws included requirements that its school and staff members exercise reasonable care to protect the students from bullying by adequately supervising students, and suspending or expelling other students who have engaged in battery of other students, and a duty to have its own enforcement and monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure that member schools comply with the anti-bullying guidelines that CIF lacks.&nbsp; [para. 46].&nbsp; &nbsp;The argument appears to be that the bylaws include detailed rules about interschool transfers and forbid profanity but say nothing about bullying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>These theories are not clearly alleged in the complaint and are of questionable validity in the negligence context, and no legal authorities are cited by plaintiff which impose such duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, with respect to the first theory, which appears to be a racial discrimination or disparate treatment theory, this does not appear to be based in negligence. This argument is a theory based in some flaw in the CIF’s review of plaintiff’s alleged appeal, which would likely implicate administrative remedies, and a duty arising from a source other than a general negligence duty of due care.&nbsp; Also, it would appear to depend on some sort of due process analysis when Ryan holds that participation in extracurricular activities such as football does not give rise to due process rights. The complaint does not allege how the CIF is authorized to engage in a process to investigate the proprietary of scholastic penalties independently imposed by a member school, how that process would occur, and what the CIF would be authorized to do based on the outcome of such an investigation.&nbsp; Also, the damages alleged are not sufficiently tied to any alleged conduct by the CIF but rather is attached to the conduct of the other defendants and plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As to the second theory, there is no explanation of how this duty to pass and enforce policies against bullying is a duty imposed by law, with no legal authorities cited, and the opposition essentially concedes that the duty has not been voluntarily assumed by defendant CIF, as the allegations are that the CIF has not established a policy on bullying, so practically speaking has not assumed a duty to enforce any such policy.&nbsp; It also is problematic with respect to the imposition of such a duty with respect to any mechanism by which CIF could ensure compliance by its member schools with an anti-bullying policy, or that, in this case, CIF had notice of facts giving rise to plaintiff’s allegations of bullying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued in the reply, defendant CIF is not arguing that it can never be sued in negligence or tort, but that there is no theory in negligence or tort which has been established as viable by plaintiff under the factual circumstances of this particular case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This conclusion is the case, and the demurrer accordingly is sustained.&nbsp; The demurrer is sustained as to both causes of action, as the NIED cause of action depends on the underlying negligence alleged in the negligence cause of action, alleging only very broadly that the previous allegations are realleged, that “Plaintiff suffered serious emotional distress, and that “The negligence of these Defendants was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s serious emotional distress.”&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 51-53].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant urges that the demurrer be sustained without leave to amend.&nbsp; However, this is the original complaint in the matter, and it is held that in the case of an original complaint, plaintiff need not even request leave to amend: “unless [an original complaint] shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment, denial of leave to amend constituted an abuse of discretion irrespective of whether leave to amend is requested or not.”&nbsp; King v.

If the notice is served on the client by electronic service under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rule 2.251, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service address is the client’s current electronic service address.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The rule further provides that;</div><div>“As used in this rule, ‘current’ means that the address was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and was not returned to the client or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.&nbsp;

The CMC was continued to the same date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On October 18, 2011, defendant filed a substitution of attorney, substituting in as new legal representation Arshak Bartoumian.&nbsp; A Notice of the Case Management Conference and OSC was served on counsel Bartoumian on November 17, 2011.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On December 6, 2011, there was again no appearance by defendant, and the court order provides, “Defendant having failed to appear for consecutive hearings, answer is stricken, and cross-complaint is dismissed.”&nbsp; The matter was set for an OSC re Entry of Default on January 10, 2012.&nbsp; A request for entry of default by clerk’s judgment was filed December 12, 2011, and the matter was set for a non-appearance case review on January 31, 2012 to allow the court to process the judgment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On January 20, 2012, the court heard a motion brought by defendant through defendant’s attorney to set aside the default.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court’s tentative ruling was to deny the motion.&nbsp; The minute order reflects that there were appearances for both parties at the hearing, and the minute order states:</div><div>“Pursuant to Defendant’s request, the Court denies the motion without prejudice, allowing counsel for the Defendant to allege inexcusable neglect in subsequent pleadings.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Minute Order 1/20/2012, p. 1].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Evidently no subsequent motion was filed.&nbsp; On January 31, 2012, the court signed and filed a judgment by the clerk by default, entering judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the total sum of $26, 404.85.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On December 23, 2021, plaintiff filed an Application for and Renewal of Judgment, which renewal was entered by the court the same date pursuant to a Notice of Renewal of Judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>The claim of exemption is evidently directed to a levy of the judgment debtor’s bank account with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America is holding funds.&nbsp; It is not clear what sum is being held.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 703.580(c), at a hearing on a claim for exemption</div><div>“The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both shall be received in evidence.&nbsp; If no other evidence is offered, the court, if satisfied that sufficient facts are shown by the claim of exemption (including the financial statement if one is required) and the notice of opposition, may make its determination thereon.&nbsp; If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It appears that the method of judgment enforcement involved here is the levy of a bank account.&nbsp; Under CCP section 703.520, a claimant after levy may make a claim of exemption, which is required to be executed under oath and provide specified information, including a financial statement if required, a citation to the provision or statute upon which the claim is based, and a statement of facts necessary to support the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 703.580(b), at a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the exemption claimant has the burden of proof.”&nbsp; In meeting this burden, the one who claims the exemption must establish the right by evidence or facts; an affidavit which merely follows the language of the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Le Font v. Ranin (1959, 2nd Dist.)&nbsp; 167 Cal.App. 2d 433, 435.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here the Claim of Exemption is signed under penalty of perjury and states that the property claimed to be exempt is all bank account funds in depository accounts and all wages.&nbsp; [Claim, para. 8c].&nbsp; Judgment debtor indicates that the property is claimed to be exempt under CCP section 703.140(b)(5).&nbsp; [Claim, para. 5].&nbsp; The claim includes an attachment which states that California law allows judgment debtor to exempt and protect up to approximately $30,000 of funds under Civil Code 703.140(b)(5).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 703.140 applies to federal Bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Subdivision (a) of the statute indicates that the listed exemptions are “applicable,” “In a case under Title 11 of the United States Code.”&nbsp; &nbsp;This does not appear to be such a case.&nbsp; Subdivision (b), relied upon here, provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(b) The following exemptions may be elected as provided in subdivision (a):…</div><div>(1) The debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed twenty-nine thousand two hundred seventy-five dollars ($29,275) in value, in real property or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence, in a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence.</div><div>(2) The debtor's interest, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) in value, in one or more motor vehicles.</div><div>(3) The debtor's interest, not to exceed seven hundred twenty-five dollars ($725) in value in any particular item, in household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments, that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.</div><div>(4) The debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($1,750) in value, in jewelry held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.</div><div>(5) The debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed one thousand five hundred fifty dollars ($1,550) in value, plus any unused amount of the exemption provided under paragraph (1), in any property.”</div><div>(Emphasis added).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This statute does not appear to apply in the current action.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, the attachment makes reference to California Civil Code section 703.140, but there is no such section in the Civil Code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The opposition appears to argue that the statutory grounds which are cited in the claim by the judgment debtor pertain to items which judgment creditor has not levied against here, such as insurance policy benefits, retirement plan funds, or household furnishings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that the statute relied upon does not apply at all to the matter, and the claim may be denied on this ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also points out that with respect to the bank account at issue, judgment debtor has the burden of tracing exempt funds from an exempt source under CCP section 703.080, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) Subject to any limitation provided in the particular exemption, a fund that is exempt remains exempt to the extent that it can be traced into deposit accounts or in the form of cash or its equivalent.</div><div>(b) The exemption claimant has the burden of tracing an exempt fund.”</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that here judgment debtor in support of the claim has failed to trace the source of funds or provide any documentation proving the funds levied consist only of exempt funds.</div><div><br></div><div>Without any documentation to support the purported claim of exemption, the claim cannot be evaluated, and the hearing is continued for submission of an appropriate showing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court will hear argument whether the matter should be continued, and judgment debtor required to submit a supplemental claim with argument and citation to appropriate statutes, if judgment debtor is aware of any, as well as supporting documentation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:&nbsp;</div><div>The Claim which has been forwarded from the Sheriff’s office does not appear to cite to any applicable statutory basis supporting a claim of exemption and fails to meet judgment debtor’s burden of tracing exempt funds into the subject account.&nbsp; The hearing on claim of exemption is CONTINUED pursuant to CCP section 703.580(c) for the submission of supplemental briefing and necessary documentary support for any claim of exemption.&nbsp; The new hearing date is May 17, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp; Judgment debtor defendant Sarkesyan must file his supplemental briefing by April 26, 2024 with judgment creditor plaintiff Citibank’s responsive pleading due on May 16, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp;
