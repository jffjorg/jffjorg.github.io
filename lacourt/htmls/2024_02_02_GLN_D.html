The FAC alleges that ultimately defendants demanded that plaintiffs vacate the property and served plaintiffs with an unlawful termination of tenancy notice in April of 2022, at a time when the County of Los Angeles prohibited no-fault evictions.&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that they were forced to vacate their home of approximately five years in June of 2022, and that as a result of defendants’ conduct and unlawful actions suffered actual damages and emotional distress.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, breach of the warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance, trespass, wrongful eviction in violation of the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, wrongful eviction in violation of the Los Angeles County COVID-19 Moratorium, wrongful evidence in violation of the California Civil Code, constructive eviction, violation of California unfair competition law, and IIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff Sally Jace in the notice of motion seeks relief pursuant to CCP § 36 (e), which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may in its discretion grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting this preference.”</div><div><br></div><div>Weil &amp; Brown note that this subdivision can be invoked where a delay would greatly prejudice a party’s ability to present its claims, where, for example, a party has a debilitating mental or physical disease, even though the illness is not terminal, or where advancing senility may impair the party’s ability to participate in the litigation, or where a party’s impending departure and inability to return, for example, entering military service or moving permanently, present circumstances where it would be “impossible or economically burdensome to return for trial.”&nbsp; Weil &amp; Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial (Cal. Practice Guide, The Rutter Group, 2023 rev.) 12:257.1 and 12:257.2.&nbsp; This subdivision accordingly appears to be directed to the ability of a party to pursue its claim on its merits, and the irreparable harm from the loss of essential evidence.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The decision to grant or deny a preferential trial setting under CCP § 36 “rests at all times in the sound discretion of the trial court in light of the totality of the circumstances.”&nbsp; Salas v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 342, 344.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues here that the interests of justice would be satisfied by granting a preference because plaintiff Sally Jace, in approximately 2013, suffered four strokes, and has since then suffered persistent memory loss, which makes it difficult for her to remember dates, facts and other important details surrounding her life since the strokes, including the tenancy at the property.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that it would be in the interests of justice to allow plaintiff Sally Jace equal protection, in effect, the opportunity to provide trial testimony and undergo cross-examination equipped in the sharpest state before the effects of her stroke take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that the parties will not suffer any prejudice, as the parties have had more than a year to conduct discovery and prepare for trial.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that both defendants have been deposed, as have plaintiffs Bobby Jace and Sally Jace.&nbsp; The opposition indicates that all three plaintiffs have since been deposed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff submits a declaration of plaintiff Sally Jace, and of plaintiffs’ counsel.</div><div><br></div><div>The Sally Jace declaration states, in pertinent part:</div><div>2.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In approximately 2013, I had four (4) minor strokes on the left side of my brain. As a result of the strokes, I was hospitalized for about ten (10) days. I was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. My medical professional’s [sic] told me that the stroke impacted the left chemistry of my brain, which my doctor told me effects memory and speech. Although I survived the stroke, I had several remaining medical issues, including persistent memory loss.</div><div><br></div><div>3.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Following the stroke, it is extremely difficult for me to remember dates, facts, and other important details surrounding my life, including my tenancy at 516 Myrtle Street, Glendale, California.</div><div><br></div><div>4. With each passing date, memory of my life at the property fades at a more rapid pace than the average person. I fear that if the trial is not held within the next three (3) or four (4) months, I will not be able to offer the best trial testimony. The effects of strokes will take effect and I will not be in the sharpest state I can be to undergo direct and cross examination.”</div><div>[Jace Decl., paras. 2-4].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The declaration of plaintiffs’ counsel states:</span></div><div>“Plaintiff SALLY JACE and I have discussed her stroke event several times during the representation. She has described the series of strokes to me, her hospitalizations at CedarsSinai Medical Center and Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center, and the strokes’ impacts. She has repeatedly told me that she will not be able to remember critical dates and particulars about the case, should it be tried in late 2024 or 2025. As trial is currently set for December 24, 2024, it is my belief that Plaintiff JACE will not be able to effectively testify during direct or cross examination, unless the Court grants this Motion for Preference.”</div><div>[Astanehe Decl., para. 6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants in opposition argue that plaintiff has cited no authority supporting memory loss as a basis for preferential trial setting under CCP section 36, subdivision (e), and have not offered any supporting medical documentation in support of the motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that the preference statute does not expressly recognize that purported memory loss or mental capacity warrants a trial preference but includes only three specific scenarios—when a party is over 70 years of age, when a party is under the age of 14 in certain cases, and when it is doubtful that a party will survive for more than six months.&nbsp; CCP section 36 (a)-(d).&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants argue that the motion is not brought under the mandatory provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b), but the discretionary provision of subdivision (e), which still requires the moving party provide a “showing that satisfies the court that the interest of justice will be served by the preference,” which plaintiff has failed to do.&nbsp; Defendants argue that purported memory loss is not the type of condition contemplated by the statute, as otherwise every plaintiff could claim that due to the passage of time their memory has diminished and seek preference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is true that plaintiff has not cited any legal authority under which memory loss is expressly recognized as a basis for a preference order.&nbsp; As discussed above, however, the loss of essential evidence during the time awaiting trial appears to be within the contemplation of the discretionary relief permitted in subdivision (e).&nbsp; However, while commentators have noted that a debilitating mental or physical condition short of a terminal illness would be sufficient, it does not appear that a showing of a fading memory alone would be enough to warrant relief.&nbsp; This conclusion would appear particularly true here, where plaintiff and her counsel report no specifics beyond an inability to recall details, and report no specific medical diagnosis or prognosis, and it is not disputed that plaintiff has already been deposed in this matter, so her current testimony has been preserved if a loss should occur in the additional months before trial.&nbsp; Weil and Brown comment with respect to the court’s discretion permitted under section 36 subdivision (e):</span></div><div>“Generally, judges are reluctant to grant preferential trial setting. With the age and terminal illness situations already provided for, there are relatively few situations that justify preempting other cases waiting in line for a trial date.”</div><div>Weil and Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, supra, at 12:256.3, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants also argue that plaintiff has submitted no competent medical evidence to support her argument.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>CCP §36.5 provides that a motion for trial preference may be supported by an affidavit by the party’s attorney “based upon information and belief” as to the party’s “medical diagnosis and prognosis.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, this statute is expressly directed to “subdivision (a) of Section 36,” the mandatory provision where a party who is 70 years of age seeks to make the requisite showing that the party’s health is “such that preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that this is in contrast to the discretionary provisions included in CCP section 36, subdivisions (d) and (e):</span></div><div>“(d) In its discretion, the court may also grant a motion for preference that is accompanied by clear and convincing medical documentation that concludes that one of the parties suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial medical doubt of survival of that party beyond six months, and that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference.</div><div>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may in its discretion grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting this preference.”</div><div>With respect to subdivision (d), “clear and convincing medical documentation” is required; an attorney affidavit is insufficient.&nbsp; &nbsp;With respect to subdivision (e), there is no express requirement for such medical documentation.&nbsp; However, the court would be within its discretion to evaluate the evidence submitted and find that the vagueness of the current showing, along with the fact that is not corroborated by medical documentation, is not satisfactory to the court with respect to the interests of justice being served by granting the preference.&nbsp; &nbsp;The evidence is not enough to show that memory loss is sufficiently serious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Weil and Brown note that a declaration from an attorney in support of a motion under subdivision (a), is a statutory exception to the normal rule that declarations must contain admissible evidence, not hearsay or conclusions.&nbsp; See Weil &amp; Brown, California Practice Guide, Civil Procedure Before Trial, supra, at section 12:247.2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff here does have some basis for her own reports concerning her condition and symptoms, but medical documentation would be needed for corroboration.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that plaintiff has not offered medical records or evidence to support her declaration claims because her medical records produced in this matter do not reference memory loss at any point in the last ten years, but on the occasions when Sally Jace’s physician conducted a objective evaluation of plaintiff, she was noted to be “AOx3,” which is an abbreviation for “alert and oriented to person, place and time,” and that plaintiff’s “judgment/insight intact.”&nbsp; [Glantz Decl., para. 3, Ex. 1].&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants submit a copy of one redacted chart note from plaintiff’s medical records and indicate they have not submitted more out of respect for plaintiff’s privacy.&nbsp; This chart note is from March 28, 2023, refers to “Sally Kaslov” as a 59-year-old-female, and includes the subject notations as to “Neuro” and “Psych.”&nbsp; [Glantz Decl., Ex. 1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also argue that during her deposition, plaintiff appeared no different from any other witness recalling events in the past.&nbsp; Defendants’ attorney indicates:</div><div>“I took Plaintiff Sally Jace’s deposition on December 12, 2023. During her deposition, based on my perception, Plaintiff seemed to be alert, and displayed little to no issues with remembering critical facts of her case, names of individuals, and where certain events took place. Plaintiff displayed some difficulties with recalling specific timing of when a particular event took place but was still able to provide me with an estimate timeline and whether facts occurred on, before, or during significant events, such as the Covid-19 Pandemic. Based on my experience, Plaintiff Sally Jace’s memory is no different than any other plaintiff or witness.

Plaintiff was quoted a price of $2,400 to $3,200, with four men.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that instead of four men, five men arrived not prepared to crate a beveled glass top dining table and a glass/brass coffee table, without containers for artwork or lamps, and without adequate wardrobe containers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that defendant forced plaintiff to initial for overtime, left items behind, damaged and stole items from plaintiff and refused to return to complete the move.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that upon arrival, defendant did not give plaintiff documentation required by the State of California, Bureau of Household Goods and Services regarding movers of household goods.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she requested extra insurance but was informed there would be an extra charge.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that less than two hours into the move, plaintiff was approached by defendant that the movers could not complete the move and would have to come back another day unless plaintiff agreed to pay overtime.&nbsp; Plaintiff challenged this request.&nbsp; The lead mover called the office to see what dates were available to return, with the next date being in February, so that plaintiff was forced to sign to pay overtime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The operative complaint, the Second Amended Complaint, alleges that the movers left furniture behind, then met plaintiff at the new residence, presenting her with a bill of $5,762.50, and, when plaintiff inquired about when the movers would return to retrieve the remaining items, the lead worker laughed at plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff issued a check for $5,000, and requested a copy of the bill, which was refused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On January 18, 2022, the twin sleigh bed collapsed, causing plaintiff injury and physical pain.&nbsp; That same day plaintiff called defendant to inquire about the remaining items, and the fall from the bed not properly assembled, and was told a crew would be sent out the following morning, on January 19, 2022, to pick up the remaining items and reassemble the bed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the afternoon of January 18, 2022, plaintiff received a phone call from defendant’s office manager in which he stated, “We’re not coming,” and hung up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that this left her shaken, broken down, and crying, as she is elderly and disabled, and plaintiff is now left with the task to complete the move by renting a U-Haul and hiring workers to complete what defendants refused to complete.&nbsp; Plaintiff in response to the demeaning telephone call from defendant telephoned the bank and placed a stop payment on the check.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff was unaware that without plaintiff’s consent defendant went into plaintiff’s account to take the remaining $762.50.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The SAC also alleges that plaintiff was charged thirteen hours, of which five hours were overtime, and defendant did not deduct the two-hour lunch break, and that defendant also charged 4 and a half hours for an additional two men.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that defendant hired workers who were not bonded but were allowed to access plaintiff’s home, and that as a result of this practice, many items were stolen from plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Transguard Insurance Company of America filed demurrers in response to the original complaint and the FAC.&nbsp; On October 20, 2023, a demurrer to the FAC by that defendant was sustained with leave to amend.&nbsp; &nbsp;On November 27, 2023, plaintiff filed the SAC, which no longer names Transguard Insurance, but continues to allege claims against defendant Redondo Van &amp; Storage, Inc.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moving defendant Defendant Redondo Van &amp; Storage, Inc. filed a demurrer to the FAC, which was noticed to be heard on December 1, 2023, and was rendered moot by the filing of the SAC which was filed prior to the hearing on that demurrer.&nbsp; Defendant Redondo Van &amp; Storage, Inc. now challenges the sufficiency of the Second Amended Complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Redondo Van &amp; Storage, Inc. argues that the SAC is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to state a case of action as to each of the causes of action asserted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First Cause of Action—Untitled&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that it is not clear what claim plaintiff intends to assert under the first, untitled, cause of action, which appears to simply provide a factual background concerning plaintiff’s initial interactions with defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 430.10 states in pertinent part:</div><div>“The party against whom a complaint... has been filed may object, by demurrer...to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:…</div><div>(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</div><div>(f) The pleading is uncertain.&nbsp; As used in this subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous or unintelligible.</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 430.10, “Uncertain” is defined to include ambiguous or unintelligible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Permitting demurrer for uncertainty is based on the policy which favors parties having notice of the liability alleged, and the pleading must be sufficiently certain to apprise the defendant of the basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking relief.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perkins v. Superior Court (1981, 2nd Dist.) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6.</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action, the court examines the facts alleged in order to determine whether they are adequate to state a cause of action.&nbsp; Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 38-39.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court treats the demurrer “as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,” and gives the complaint “a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”&nbsp; Quelimane, at 38, citations omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that it is unintelligible with respect to what plaintiff intends to allege in the first, untitled, cause of action.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cause of action alleges that plaintiff was given a verbal quote regarding the cost of the move, that plaintiff was not given documentation required concerning the move, and that there was some request for extra insurance, for which an extra sum was said would be charged, which plaintiff evidently accepted.&nbsp; [SAC, First Cause of Action].</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is not clear if plaintiff is alleging that she was charged more than the quoted amount, in breach of some oral contract, that the allege documentation was required and the failure to provide it violated the statutory requirements in certain particulars, or that there is some actionable claim for charging the extra rate for extra insurance coverage.&nbsp; As to this cause of action there is no allegation, even generally, that defendant’s actions caused plaintiff to suffer compensable damages.&nbsp; This situation is the rare case where the cause of action is not only uncertain, but also fails to state facts sufficient to state a cognizable cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>This confusion is compounded by plaintiff’s failure to comply with CRC Rule 2.112, which failure has been pointed out in connection with a previous demurrer brought by a co-defendant, which plaintiff has nevertheless failed to remedy. CRC Rule 2.112 provides:</div><div>“Each separately stated cause of action, count or defense must specifically state:</div><div>(1) Its number (e.g. “first cause of action”);&nbsp;</div><div>(2) Its nature (e.g., “for fraud”);&nbsp;</div><div>(3) The party asserting it, if more than one party is represented in the pleading (e.g. “by plaintiff Jones’); and&nbsp;</div><div>(4) The party or parties to whom it is directed (e.g., “against defendant Smith”).</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the SAC does not allege the nature of the first cause of action, which does not appear to state any easily recognizable cause of action.&nbsp; This deficiency should be corrected on amendment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the opposition appears to argue that this cause of action is based on an oral contract to move plaintiff’s household goods.&nbsp; It is not explained how the nature of the claim is not uncertain, or how each element of such a cause of action is alleged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurer is sustained.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Second Cause of Action—Forced Overtime&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that “Forced Overtime” is not a recognized cause of action under California law and that defendant cannot ascertain the legal theories against it.&nbsp; Defendant argues that while apparently plaintiff was unhappy with the time and labor required for the subject move, and the response to her challenge to the need for overtime, this is not a legal basis for civil relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There does not appear to be a legally recognized cause of action for forced overtime.&nbsp; Plaintiff in opposition does not identify any legal authority supporting the assertion of such a theory as a cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that plaintiff did not hire defendant to pack plaintiff’s belongings, so that defendant did not spend any time packing, that the workers came unprepared to move plaintiff’s belongings, that defendants approached plaintiff saying they could not complete the move without paying overtime, and that the moving crew took a two-hour lunch break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This assertion appears to be an argument that the cause of action is for somehow overcharging plaintiff for contracted services, which could possibly be a breach of contract claim.&nbsp; This is not clearly stated in the cause of action.&nbsp; In addition, each element of such a cause of action is not alleged, such as causation and damages.&nbsp; [SAC, Second Cause of Action].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer is sustained.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Third Cause of Action—Breach of Contract&nbsp;</div><div>To plead a cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must plead the following elements: Contract formed, and terms alleged verbatim or according to legal effect; plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; defendant’s breach; and damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Walsh v. Standart (1917) 174 Cal. 807.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the pleading fails to sufficiently allege the terms of the alleged contract, set forth the pertinent terms verbatim, or attach a copy of the alleged contract.&nbsp; Defendant also argues that the SAC fails to sufficiently allege performance by plaintiff of the obligation to pay for defendant’s services, as the SAC alleges that plaintiff stopped payment on the check issued by plaintiff. Defendant also argues that plaintiff has failed to allege that plaintiff sustained damages resulting from any alleged breach.&nbsp;</div><div>The cause of action in the SAC is confusing with respect to whether it is based on the original contact for moving services, not mentioned in the cause of action, or upon some later alleged contract based on some promise to send a crew to move the items remaining in the original residence and reassemble a bed.&nbsp; Again, the cause of action is ambiguous in this respect.&nbsp; In any case, the cause of action does not allege that any of the discernable terms of agreement set forth in the cause of action were in fact breached, that plaintiff performed or was excused from performance, or that any breach caused damage to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that there was an oral agreement to move household goods, that plaintiff made partial payment, and that there was evidently a subsequent oral agreement concerning sending a crew to pick up remaining items, which was breached when defendant’s representative informed plaintiff the crew was not coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Much of this is not clearly alleged in the pleading, and, in any case, the specific contract, or successive oral contract, or both, are not sufficiently alleged in terms of the terms agreed to and breached, and the cause of action fails to sufficiently allege plaintiff’s performance or excuse for non-performance, causation or damages.&nbsp; The demurrer accordingly is sustained.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Fourth Cause of Action—Financial and Emotional Elder Abuse</div><div>Defendant argues that this cause of action is uncertain and not sufficiently alleged.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As an initial matter, the SAC fails to identify what section or sections of the Elder Abuse Act were allegedly violated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent the cause of action intends to allege financial elder abuse, Welf &amp; Inst. Code sec. 15610.30 defines financial abuse of an elder:&nbsp;</div><div>“(a) "Financial abuse" of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section 1575 of the Civil Code.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) A person or entity shall be deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains the property and the person or entity knew or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent adult.</div><div><br></div><div>(c) For purposes of this section, a person or entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property when an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property right, including by means of an agreement, donative transfer, or testamentary bequest, regardless of whether the property is held directly or by a representative of an elder or dependent adult.</div><div><br></div><div>(d) For purposes of this section, "representative" means a person or entity that is either of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(1) A conservator, trustee, or other representative of the estate of an elder or dependent adult.”</div><div><br></div><div>Welfare &amp; Institutions Code section 15657.5 provides for heightened remedies for Financial Elder Abuse:</div><div>“(a) Where it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is liable for <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>financial abuse, as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to compensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The term "costs" includes, but is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any, devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also relies on case law under which it is recognized that because elder abuse is a statutory cause of action, it must be alleged with factual particularity.&nbsp; See Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cause of action here alleges that plaintiff received a phone call stating that “We’re not coming,” which left plaintiff shaking, broken down and crying, leaving her with the task of completing the move defendant refused to complete, and that defendant went into plaintiff’s bank account without plaintiff’s consent to take the remaining $762.50, evidently the amount due on to defendant under the moving agreement.&nbsp; [SAC, Fourth Cause of Action].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span> It is not alleged which provisions of the statutory cause of action are invoked, the cause of action is not alleged with factual particularity, and it is not clearly alleged that plaintiff is an elder, in effect, age 65 or older, subject to protection under the act.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in opposition argues that plaintiff is a single 83-year-old disabled woman, which is not alleged in the SAC. Plaintiff also argues that, due to defendant refusing to complete the move, plaintiff’s niece, who has medical issues, had to travel from Orange County to help retrieve plaintiff’s artwork, and plaintiff was forced to carry clothing by going up and down stairs.&nbsp; These allegations do not appear to pertain to allegations of financial elder abuse, and these allegations are for the most part not alleged in the pleadings.&nbsp; The demurrer is sustained.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Fifth Cause of Action—Fraud&nbsp;</div><div>To state a cause of action for fraud, plaintiff must plead the following elements: A false representation, actual or implied, or concealment of a matter of fact material to the transaction which defendant had a duty to disclose, or a promise made without intent to perform; defendant’s knowledge of the falsity; defendant’s intent to induce another into relying on the representation; plaintiff’s justifiable reliance thereon; and resulting damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Pearson v.

(NRG) pursuant to which NRG was to serve as direct solar contractor and provide all labor and materials in connection with the construction of a solar carport at plaintiff’s property.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that as the general contractor for the project, NRG had the contractual responsibility for the day-to-day prosecution of the work, direction of the work of the subcontractors, and to make sure the work was completed in a professional manner and in compliance with the project design, specifications, schedule and all relevant codes and industry standards, and to complete the project on time.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that NRG failed in its duties as it took half the contract amount up front, failed to provide a design that could actually fit cars into the carport and improperly kept $68,000 for two years without performing (producing a defective carport).&nbsp; The complaint alleges that plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the damages or losses incurred as a result of these issues with the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges that defendant NRG violated various provisions of the Business &amp; Professions Code with respect to construction projects, and fraudulently induced plaintiff to enter into the contract.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is also alleged that defendant American Contractors Indemnity Company (ACIC) issued a surety bond to NRG for the protection of persons that contracted with NRG and for whom NRG’s services were ultimately rendered, and that plaintiff is authorized by Business &amp; Professions Code section 7071.5 to pursue a bond claim against defendant ACIC for those damages caused by NRG.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of written contract, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of Business &amp; Professions Code, negligence, negligence per se, fraud, and claim on contractor’s bond.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>Procedural</div><div>No Opposition&nbsp;</div><div>There is no timely opposition to this motion.&nbsp; Under CCP § 1290.6, a response to a petition to compel arbitration “shall be served and filed within 10 days of the service of the petition.”&nbsp; Here, the motion was served on October 30, 2023, by mail and electronic transmission.&nbsp; &nbsp;Allowing two days for service by email, opposition was due on or before November 11, 2023, over two months ago.&nbsp; Opposition has also not been filed within nine court days of the date set for hearing, as required for standard motions under CCP §1005(b), which would have been on January 22, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court could grant the motion on the ground no timely opposition has been served or filed, but the court elects not to do so.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Substantive&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants NRG and ACIC seek an order compelling plaintiff to arbitrate his claims in accordance with an arbitration agreement with NRG and to stay this action pending the outcome of the arbitration.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 1281.2, governing orders to arbitrate controversies, provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:</div><div>(a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or</div><div>(b) Grounds exist for rescission of the agreement.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the Federal Arbitration Act, arbitration agreements “shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, save upon such grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.”&nbsp; &nbsp;9 U.S.C. section 2.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>There is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration of disputes and any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable disputes should be resolved in favor of arbitration.&nbsp; Moncharsh v.

&nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that upon discovering the deception, plaintiff demanded immediate repayment of the loaned fund from Hamadi, and that although Hamadi acknowledged the debt, he has refused to fulfill his obligation to pay plaintiff the money owed.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that defendant Keshishyan introduced plaintiff to her niece, who plaintiff married in 2016, and that defendant Hamadi thereafter cultivated a friendship with plaintiff under the guise of family ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that in January of 2017, Hamadi and Keshishyan approached plaintiff seeking assistance in purchasing property in Carpinteria, assuring plaintiff the property had a potential to be profitable.&nbsp; Hamadi requested that he be added to plaintiff’s bank account, which would allow him to demonstrate sufficient funds in reserve, and plaintiff added Hamadi as a co-signer so that Hamadi could qualify for a loan.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Hamidi and Keshishyan sought an additional $65,000 from plaintiff to increase the down payment, with a promise to repay plaintiff within two months after refinancing the house.&nbsp; Plaintiff loaned Hamadi and Keshishyan the $65,000, and defendants qualified for the loan and the property was purchased in March of 2017.&nbsp; Despite defendants’ assurances and promises to repay the $65,000 within two months, defendants failed to repay the borrowed funds.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that beginning in June 2017 and continuing through September 2021, defendants made continued assurances and promises to plaintiff that they intended to repay the loan in its entirety, and that it was their intention to repay plaintiff in full.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges that in June of 2017, Hamadi informed plaintiff that he intended to purchase life insurance policies totaling over five million dollars, with the intent to sell the policies after the two-year contestable period.&nbsp; Hamadi requested that plaintiff pay the insurance premiums for these policies for the first year, with the agreement that Hamadi would pay the premiums for the second year, and thereafter the polices would be sold, and the profits split.&nbsp; Hamadi also promised to repay the $65,000 debt obligation to plaintiff from the sale of the insurance policies.&nbsp; In July and December of 2017, Hamadi purchased life insurance policies for his father and mother, and plaintiff began paying the premiums for the policies.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that to induce plaintiff to assume the obligation of the insurance premium payments, Hamadi arranged a meeting between plaintiff, himself, and the servicing insurance agent, defendant Minasyan, and that during this meeting Minasyan and Hamadi together assured plaintiff that it was a common practice to sell insurance policies after two years, that it was easy to find a willing buyer, and that plaintiff would financially benefit from the sale of the policies.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that at the time, defendants Hamadi and Minasyan knew that the policies would not be sold after a two-year period but conspired to induce plaintiff to pay the premiums to prevent the policies from lapsing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the conclusion of the first year, Hamadi refused to pay the premiums for the policies, leaving plaintiff no choice but to continue making the premium payments to avoid a lapse in coverage.&nbsp; Hamadi also threatened to not repay plaintiff’s loan and the payments plaintiff had made for the policies if plaintiff chose to discontinue paying the insurance premiums.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that while plaintiff continued to make the premium payments, Hamadi refused to sell the policies or repay plaintiff, and that in September of 2021, plaintiff contacted Minasyan and demanded that Hamadi assume the payment obligations.&nbsp; Hamadi requested an exit plan from Minasyan, and Minasyan agreed to assume Hamadi’s and plaintiff’s rights in the policies, and 30 days after the rights were assigned, repay plaintiff, including 10% interest.&nbsp; Hamadi refused to sign the agreement and refused to acknowledge his obligation for the insurance premium payments made by plaintiff, in the total sum of $209,697.24.&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that as a result of defendants’ conduct, plaintiff has suffered economic damages in an amount in excess of $274,697.24, plus interest, and that plaintiff has experienced severe emotional distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Demurrer</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Citation to Unpublished Case Law&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants in both the moving papers and reply cite to several unpublished cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 8.1115:</div><div>&nbsp;“(a) Except as provided in (b), an opinion of a California Court of Appeal or superior court appellate division that is not certified for publication or ordered published must not be cited or relied on by a court or a party in any other action.”</div><div><br></div><div>Subdivision (b) states:</div><div>“An unpublished opinion may be cited or relied on:</div><div>(1) When the opinion is relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata or collateral estoppel; or&nbsp;</div><div>(2) When the opinion is relevant to a criminal or disciplinary action because it states reasons for a decision affecting the same defendant or respondent in another such action.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants note that some cited cases are unpublished, and at some points note, “noted and not cited as binding precedent per the CRC Rule 8.1115 exception as persuasive.”&nbsp; &nbsp;This is evidently a reference to subdivision (e) of the Rule, which applies only when review of a published opinion has been granted, while review is pending, where, “unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court…, a published opinion of a Court of Appeal in the matter has no binding or precedential effect, and may be cited for potentially persuasive value only.”&nbsp; The cases cited are simply unpublished decisions, not published opinions which have been granted review.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants appear to be intentionally and repeatedly violating the court rule.&nbsp; The court disregards all citations to unpublished cases.&nbsp; The court is considering setting an OSC re sanctions for this violation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Substantive&nbsp;</div><div>First Cause of Action—Fraud and Third Cause of Action—Intentional Misrepresentation&nbsp;</div><div>Lack of Specificity&nbsp;</div><div>To state a cause of action for fraud, plaintiff must plead the following elements: A false representation, actual or implied, or concealment of a matter-of-fact material to the transaction which defendant had a duty to disclose, or defendant’s promise made without intention to perform; defendant’s knowledge of the falsity; defendant’s intent to deceive; plaintiff’s justifiable reliance thereon; and resulting damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Pearson v. Norton (1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 1.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, in a fraud cause of action, a plaintiff must allege specifically how, what, where, to whom and by what means a defendant made a misrepresentation.&nbsp; Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the causes of action are not alleged with sufficient specificity.&nbsp; The first cause of action alleges that Hamadi and Minasyan engaged in fraud in connection with the insurance policy premiums.&nbsp; The cause of action incorporates previous allegations and alleges that Hamadi promised that plaintiff would sell the insurance policies within a two-year period, that he would split the proceeds, and that he would repay plaintiff all premium payments plaintiff made with interest.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 41].&nbsp; It is also alleged that Hamadi promised to repay the $65,000 he had borrowed from plaintiff for the purchase of the 5157 Ogan Road property in Carpinteria once the policies were sold.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 41].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not alleged in the cause of action when these representations were made, although the general allegations indicate that in June of 2017, Hamadi first informed plaintiff he intended to purchase the life insurance policies.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Complaint, para. 19].&nbsp; It is not clearly alleged when the representations and promises themselves were made, and it is also not alleged where they were made, or by what means (orally or in writing) they were made.&nbsp; The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend to permit plaintiff to allege the cause of action with these specifics.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third cause of action for intentional misrepresentation is also based on the alleged false statements made by Hamadi and Minasyan in connection with the insurance policies.&nbsp; The cause of action also fails to clearly allege when the representations were made, where, or by what means. The cause of action is further insufficient because it alleges that “Hamadi and Minasyan made numerous false statements to Plaintiff,” then lists the statements, but it is not clear which of the defendants made which statement, and it does not appear that both of these parties would have made each of the statements or promises.&nbsp; The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend to allege these specifics.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants argue briefly that the two fraud causes of action are barred by the three-year statute of limitations.&nbsp; In general, the statute of limitations is mandatory, based on the language of CCP section 312, which provides;</div><div>“Civil actions, without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed by this title...unless, where, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.”</div><div><br></div><div>A demurrer on the ground that a cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations should be sustained only where the facts alleged on the face of the complaint “clearly and affirmatively” show that the cause of action is barred.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not enough that the complaint might be barred.&nbsp; &nbsp;Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As to the fraud causes of action, CCP § 338(d) provides that “an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake” must be commenced within three years.&nbsp; CCP § 338(d) provides that in an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, “The cause of action in that case is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that three years from May 13, 2017 expired on May 13, 2020, but this action was not filed until September 15, 2023.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This assertion is evidently an argument that the $65,000 loan was allegedly made in March of 2017, and was to be repaid in two months, so by May of 2017, but was not timely repaid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fraud causes of action are primarily based on the representations concerning the insurance policies, which did not occur until after June of 2017, and it is not clearly argued how the pleading specifically alleges a date upon which plaintiff should have become aware that those representations and promises made were false.&nbsp; Moreover, it is alleged that defendants made continuous reassurances that plaintiff would be repaid, and specifically, that in October of 2020, Hamadi and plaintiff executed a “Transfer of Ownership” document for both insurance policies, making plaintiff a joint co-account holder of the policies.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 18, 28].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued in the opposition, the allegations are consistent with plaintiff’s argument that he was repeatedly assured by defendants that they eventually would make good on their promises.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff argues that it was not until October of 2021 that plaintiff realized that Hamadi did not intend to keep his promises regarding the insurance policies, when Hamadi refused to sign the exit agreement which Minasyan had proposed and refused to acknowledge his obligation to plaintiff concerning the insurance premiums.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 32].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it is not clear from the allegations that the causes of action clearly and affirmatively are time barred, and the demurrer to these causes of action are overruled on this ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Second Cause of Action—Conspiracy to Defraud&nbsp;</div><div>To state a civil conspiracy a pleading must allege a civil wrong (for example, fraud or battery), the formation and operation of the conspiracy, a wrongful act done pursuant to the conspiracy, and resulting damage.&nbsp; Unruh v. Truck Ins. Exchange (1972) 7 Cal.3d 616, 631, (noted to have been superseded by statute on other grounds in Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that there is no valid cause of action in California for a conspiracy to defraud.&nbsp; Defendants rely on Sui v. Price (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 933, 941, certified for partial publication, and specifically cite to a section of the opinion which is not certified for publication.&nbsp; Sui, at 941, footnote ***(“Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.1110, this opinion is certified for publication with the exception of…the entire sections under the following subheadings titled…There is no Cause of Action for Conspiracy to Defraud…”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As discussed above, defendants improperly rely on this unpublished authority, and the court cannot consider it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants fail to make any clear argument that the cause of action is deficient on grounds other than that there is no such cause of action.&nbsp; The cause of action appears to be one pursuant to which moving defendant Hamadi is alleged to be responsible for the alleged fraud committed by co-defendant Minasyan.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 49].&nbsp; There is no challenge to the sufficiency of the fraud allegations as to Minasyan.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that “Hamadi and his insurance agent, Minasyan, conspired, planned and intentionally agreed among themselves to defraud Plaintiff.”&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 50].&nbsp; &nbsp;Courts have generally held as sufficient allegations that defendants “conspired together” or “did agree together” as sufficient allegations of the formation and operation of a conspiracy.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Farr v. Bramblett (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 36, 47; Greenwood v. Mooradian (1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 532, 535.&nbsp; These allegations are made here.&nbsp; The&nbsp; &nbsp;demurrer to this cause of action accordingly is overruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Fifth Cause of Action—Breach of Oral Contract&nbsp;</div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants argue that the cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 339 sub. 1 provides a two-year statute for liability not founded on an instrument in writing:</div><div>“Within two years:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; An action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing…”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As the Second District has recognized, “A cause of action for breach of contract accrues at the time of breach, which then starts the limitations period running.” Cochran v. Cochran (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1120, citing Whorton v. Dillingham (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 447, 456.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the two-month repayment period for each of the three payments made on the loan in February and March of 2017 expired in April and May of 2017, more than six years before the complaint was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading alleges that the loans were made on specific dates in 2017 and would be repaid within two months of those dates.&nbsp; [Complaint, para.&nbsp; 70].&nbsp; The complaint goes on to allege that in June of 2017, defendants “promised and assured Plaintiff that they intended to repay Plaintiff’s loan in its entirety upon the sale of Hamadi’s parents’ life insurance policies,” and that “Beginning September 21, 2021,” defendants “refused to repay Plaintiff’s loan.”&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 72, 73].&nbsp; The cause of action overall, particularly with the incorporated general allegations, does not show with a sufficient degree of certainty that the cause of action is clearly and affirmatively time barred.&nbsp; The cause of action also sufficiently alleges a separate oral promise, which was not breached until a time within the statutory period.&nbsp; The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Statute of Frauds&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants also briefly argue that the cause of action is barred under the statute of frauds.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under Civil Code § 1622:</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>“All contracts may be oral, except such as are especially required by statute to be in writing.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that the cause of action is “barred under the statute of frauds of Civil Code section 1617.”&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no such section in the California Civil Code.&nbsp; To the extent defendants intend to rely on Civil Code section 1624, which specifies certain contracts which are invalid unless they are in writing, defendants fail to specify under which subdivision of that section the subject oral promises would fall.&nbsp; The case cited, without discussion, Harper v. Goldschmidt (1909) 156 Cal. 245, involved a claim for specific performance of a contract for the sale of realty, which does not apply here.&nbsp; &nbsp;The demurrer to this cause of action accordingly is overruled.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Sufficiency of Allegations&nbsp;</div><div>To plead a cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must plead the following elements: Contract formed, and terms alleged verbatim or according to legal effect; plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; defendant’s breach; and damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Walsh v.

Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387, in which the court of appeal observed:</div><div>“The first cause of action is labeled as one for “unjust enrichment.” Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however, or even a remedy, but rather “ ‘ “a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies” ’ .... [Citation.] It is synonymous with restitution. [Citation.]” (Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347.) Unjust enrichment has also been characterized as describing “ ‘the result of a failure to make restitution....’ ” (Dunkin, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 198, fn. 15, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44, quoting Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774 (Lauriedale ).)</div><div>McBride, at 387.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal in McBride, however, in evaluating whether a demurrer to the cause of action should have been sustained without leave to amend went on to look beyond the unjust enrichment label and evaluate whether the cause of action was an appropriate attempt to plead a cause of action giving rise to restitution.&nbsp; McBride, at 387-388.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also cite Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231, in which the court of appeal, quoting McBride, stated, “Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action,” but also went on to state, “Like the trial court, we will construe the cause of action as a quasi-contract claim seeking restitution.”&nbsp; Rutherford Holdings, at 231.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition cites Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726, in which the Second District affirmed a trial court judgment based on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff, determining:</div><div>“Evidence also supported the conclusion that Lectrodryer satisfied the elements for a claim of unjust enrichment: receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. (First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662-1663 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].).”</div><div>Lectrodryer, at 726.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Second District accordingly recognized an unjust enrichment cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>There is some disagreement concerning the existence of such a stand-alone cause of action in California.&nbsp; In fact, in Wilder v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA (2009) 2009 U.S. Lexis&nbsp; 124242, a federal district court criticized the broad holding that such a cause of action is not recognized in California, summarizing the conflicting authorities on this issue as follows:</div><div>“Defendant urges the Court to dismiss this claim based on the argument that there is no unjust enrichment cause of action in California as a matter of law.&nbsp; California courts have provided conflicting direction as to whether a separate cause of action exists for unjust enrichment. Some courts have held as an absolute that no such cause of action exists in California. See Melchor v. New Line Prod., Inc. 106 Cal.App. 4th 779, 793, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347 (Cal. Ct.App. 2003) ("[t]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment"); Jogani v. Superior Court, 165 Cal. App. 4th 901, 911, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 503 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004). However, other various courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have held just the opposite. See, e.g., Western Pac. R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R. Co., 206 F.2d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 1953) ("it is of&nbsp; [14] course true that the California courts, in common with authorities generally, recognize a cause of action based on unjust enrichment"); Gerlinger v.Amazon.com, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 838, 856 (N.D. Cal. 2004) ("[u]nder California law, unjust enrichment is an action in quasi-contract") (citing Paracor Fin. v. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 96 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 1996)); Nordberg v. Trilegiant Corp., 445 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (courts holding that no cause of action for unjust enrichment exists have focused on semantic arguments; cause of action for unjust enrichment can be understood as a proper and valid cause of action for restitution); F.D.I.C. v. Dintino, 167 Cal. App. 4th 333, 346, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 38 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (upholding unjust enrichment cause of action). The Court finds that the weight of authority indicates that California law recognizes a cause of action for unjust enrichment/restitution.”</div><div>Wilder at 124242.</div><div><br></div><div>Given the split of authority, and the practice of the courts of appeal in the authorities relied upon by defendants in evaluating an unjust enrichment cause of action as a claim for restitution, this court is reluctant to at the pleading stage sustain a demurrer on the ground the cause of action is not a recognized cause of action, and defer any determination of this issue following the development of actual proof in this matter.&nbsp; The court accordingly is inclined to overrule the demurrer on this ground but will hear argument with respect to whether plaintiff would prefer to amend the cause of action to more clearly frame the cause of action as a claim seeking restitution.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Seventh Cause of Action—Conversion</div><div>To state a cause of action for conversion, plaintiff must allege the following elements: Ownership, or right to possession of property; wrongful disposition of property right; and damages.&nbsp; Imperial Valley Land Co. v. Globe Grain &amp; Milling Co. (1921) 187 Cal. 352, 354-355.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading standards with respect to conversion are ordinarily not particularly strict, and it has long been held that a general allegation that defendants “converted and disposed of the property to their own use,” is sufficient to withstand demurrer.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Daggett v. Gray (1895) 110 Cal. 169, 171.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cause of action alleges that defendants converted plaintiff’s $65,000 “for their own benefit,” and that Hamadi converted the life insurance premiums paid, “for his own personal use and benefit.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Complaint, paras. 81, 82]. This appears sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer also argues that money cannot be the subject of a conversion claim, which is no longer the law.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pleading requirements now provide that when money is the subject of a conversion, plaintiff must plead that a specific identifiable sum was taken.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Vu v. California Commerce Club (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 229, 235.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pleading here identifies the specific sum, $65,000.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 81].&nbsp; This allegation is sufficient to withstand demurer as to at least one portion of the sums allegedly converted. The demurrer is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>As to the claim for conversion, the statute of limitations is three years.&nbsp; CCP § 338(c).&nbsp; (“Within three years:… (c)(1) An action for taking, detaining or injuring goods or chattels, including actions for the specific recovery of personal property.”).</div><div><br></div><div>As discussed above, the complaint sufficiently alleges that the money was paid by plaintiff voluntarily, but the wrongful act alleged in refusing to repay funds and premiums did not occur until it became clear to plaintiff that defendants would not enter into the exit plan, in 2021.&nbsp; The pleading does not establish on its face that the cause of action is time-barred, and the demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Eighth Cause of Action—Receipt of Stolen Property—Penal Code section 496&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants argue that there is no cause of action for theft under Penal Code section 496.&nbsp; Defendants cite two unpublished cases, which, as discussed above, cannot be considered by the court .&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, as plaintiff argues in the opposition, Penal Code § 496(a) provides:</span></div><div>(a) Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. However, if the value of the property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense shall be a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, if such person has no prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 290.</div><div>A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted pursuant to this section.
