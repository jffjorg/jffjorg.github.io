Hammond&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Responding Party:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants Jozsef Ferencz Foldi and Ma Victoria Yess Foldi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:</div><div>Order enforcing the terms of the settlement between the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>SUMMARY OF FACTS:</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs Vinod Nayar and Wendy K. Hammond allege that they are the owners of property in Pasadena, and that defendants Jozsef Ferencz Foldi and Ma Victoria Yess Foldi own neighboring property which is on the property line of the plaintiffs’ property.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that the roots of defendants’ trees have been encroaching onto the subject property and causing damage, and that plaintiffs have notified defendants, but defendants have failed to take proper action to cure the defect.&nbsp; The FAC alleges that as a result of defendants’ trees plaintiffs have suffered loss of use of their backyard, damage to their garage, damage to the subject property and an increase in expenses of maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action for trespass, private nuisance and negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants have filed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs as cross-defendants alleging that the roots of cross-defendants’ trees have been encroaching on cross-plaintiffs’ property and that the encroaching tree was planted by the prior owners of cross-defendants’ property, and is encroaching onto both properties, but despite the possible joint ownership and responsibility for the tree, cross-defendants have sought to place the entire burden of the encroaching tree on cross-plaintiffs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint also alleges that cross-defendants have removed an existing fence and replaced it with a new fence further into cross-plaintiffs’ property, installed walls which interfere with cross-plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their land and access from the front and back yards, and which destroyed a hibiscus tree, and have caused damage to cross-plaintiffs’ property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On July 26, 2023, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Settlement of the Entire Case.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiffs Vinod Nayar and Wendy K. Hammond seek to enforce the settlement entered between the parties.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>CCP § 664.6 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court...for settlement of the case,... the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.&nbsp; If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, plaintiffs indicate that at a Judicial Mandatory Settlement Conference Program, the parties agreed in writing and entered into a settlement agreement.&nbsp; [Hemming Decl., para. 2].&nbsp; Plaintiffs submit a Settlement Agreement which was signed by the parties outside the presence of the court.&nbsp; [Ex. 1]. The matter has not yet been dismissed, and the court still has jurisdiction over the matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District in Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal. App.4th 793 held that a trial court may on a section 664.6 motion receive evidence, determine disputed facts and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but may not create the material terms of a settlement as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves agreed to.&nbsp; Weddington, at 810.&nbsp; The trial court’s determination with respect to interpretation of the settlement agreement will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Skulnick v. Roberts Express, Inc.&nbsp; (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 884, 889.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As an initial matter, defendants in opposition argue that they were not served with written notice of the current hearing date for the motion, but current counsel was served with the motion giving notice of the hearing on April 26, 2024.&nbsp; [Torres Decl., paras. 2, 3].&nbsp; It appears from the file that no written notice of the hearing date being continued has been filed, although a minute order from April 26, 2024, the original noticed hearing date, indicates that “Pursuant to stipulation of counsel,” the OSC re dismissal was continued to July 12, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration of counsel makes it clear that counsel for defendants has all along been aware of the continued hearing date.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Torres Decl., para. 3].&nbsp; Defendants in opposition also address the motion on its merits.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>It is held that insufficient or defective notice may be waived if opposing counsel argues the merits of the motion.&nbsp; Alliance Bank v. Murray (1984, 2nd Dist) 161 Cal.App.3d 1, 7; Carlton v. Quint (2000, 2nd Dist.) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>While it is concerning that written notice was not properly served and filed here, given that defendants have timely responded to the motion on its merits for the scheduled hearing date, the court will reluctantly deem the notice irregularity waived and will consider the motion on its merits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion seeks enforcement of the term of the settlement pursuant to which defendants agreed to remove a tree.&nbsp; Plaintiffs indicate that the settlement amount in the sum of $90,865.00 has been paid in full, so there is no monetary judgment to be entered.&nbsp; [Hemming Decl., para. 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Settlement Agreement indicates that the “matter is settled on the following terms and conditions:&nbsp; Defendants to completely remove the avocado tree within 90 days of settlement at their cost.”&nbsp; [Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, para. 1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs indicate in the declaration of counsel that “The Defendants have breached the settlement agreement, by not removing the stump or the roots of the avocado tree.”&nbsp; [Hemming Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that the agreement was for defendants to “completely remove” the tree, so that a breach of the agreement has been established.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in the opposition indicate that the motion on this issue is now moot, as on April 12, 2024, defendants completed further removal of the tree, an inspection was conducted, and it has been agreed that the removal of the remaining tree stump is sufficient.&nbsp; [Torres Decl., para. 9, Ex. C].&nbsp; The photographs attached do not clearly indicate to the court that the stump has been completely removed.&nbsp; [See Ex. C].&nbsp; The court will hear argument concerning whether there remains a continuing need to enter the term concerning tree removal as judgment in this case.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The terms and conditions also include a term that money be paid, and specific terms concerning a garage rebuild, evidently to be performed by plaintiffs.&nbsp; While the moving papers indicate that the money has been paid, there is no mention in the moving papers of the garage rebuild terms.&nbsp; Defendants in opposition indicate that they believe plaintiffs have made no repairs to the structure at issue. It is the court’s practice when entering judgment enforcing the settlement agreement to also include in the judgment the terms agreed to by the parties in connection with that aspect of the settlement.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, the Settlement Agreement provides:</div><div>“The garage rebuild shall be in compliance with all required ordinances, building codes and permits of the City of Pasadena building and safety and Pasadena Planning Department (collectively referred to as, “Code sections"). If there are any violations of the Code sections noted or cited, Plaintiffs must cure (bring into compliance with the Code sections) within a reasonable time no more than one year from the date of the settlement agreement, unless unfeasible within the given time frame. If the time frame for completion and/or correction is not feasible, the parties shall meet and confer to reach a mutually acceptable time frame. Defendants to dismiss counter complaint.&nbsp; Parties to mutually cooperate with the tree removal and garage construction by communicating through email in a reasonable manner and time frame. Response to the email shall be given no more than 72 hours after the email has been sent. The time frame for response does not apply to emergency situations. If a matter is urgent it should be noted in the subject line of the email. The email communication should be sent to Josef Ferencz Foldi II at Joeyfoldi@gmail.com, Vinod Nayar at Timnayar@gmail.com and Wendy Hammond at wendyk8@gmail.com.”</div><div>[Settlement Agreement, para. 1].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This term will also be included in the judgment unless at the hearing sufficient evidence is presented that the garage rebuild is fully complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>Plaintiffs also seek attorney’s fees for the cost of bringing this motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Settlement Agreement states that while each party shall bear their own costs and fees arising from or related to the action:</div><div>“The party obtaining enforcement of this settlement agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Settlement Agreement, para. 5].</div><div><br></div><div>The motion accordingly seeks $2,560 in attorneys’ fees.&nbsp; The declaration in support of the motion indicates that counsel’s fee is $300 per hour and counsel has spent 8.5 hours on the motion, including the time counsel anticipates spending to prepare for and appear at the hearing.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Hemming Decl., para. 5].&nbsp; This amount actually totals $2,550, not $2,560.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in the opposition argue that no attorney’s fees should be awarded because at the time the motion was filed the parties were in meet and confer discussions concerning plans for further removal.&nbsp; Defendants indicate that counsel for plaintiffs sent a demand on January 4, 2024 seeking compliance by further removal of the existing tree stump, advising of an intent to file a motion and setting a deadline of January 17, 2024, and that on January 16, 2024, counsel for defendants sent an email advising that defendants had acted to retain a company for further removal and requesting plaintiffs’ availability in the event access to their property was needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Torres Decl., paras. 7, 8].&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no response to this email or information sent on January 26, 2024, but this motion was filed on February 13, 2024.&nbsp; [Torres Decl., para. 8].&nbsp; No copies of this email or correspondence is attached to the opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the circumstances, it appears that the tree removal was not completed within the agreed upon timeframe, that the filing of this motion appeared necessary at the time, but that the relief sought in the moving papers is essentially unnecessary, so that plaintiffs will not be parties who have successfully obtained enforcement of the settlement terms they sought to enforce.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Has the tree stump removal been satisfactorily completed?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED pursuant to CCP § 664.6.&nbsp; The Court finds that parties to pending litigation stipulated to the settlement of the case in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court.&nbsp; Judgment accordingly is entered in conformity with the Settlement Agreement executed by the parties dated June 12, 2023, except there will be no money judgment entered as the monetary settlement sum has already been paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Specifically, the terms remaining to be performed are as follows:</div><div>(If necessary)&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants to completely remove the avocado tree within 90 days of settlement at their cost.</div><div><br></div><div>The garage rebuild shall be in compliance with all required ordinances, building codes and permits of the City of Pasadena building and safety and Pasadena Planning Department (collectively referred to as, “Code sections").

(See, e.g., Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747, 87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360; Leger v. Stockton Unified School Dist. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1448, 1458–1461, 249 Cal.Rptr. 688.) If a supervisory or administrative employee of the school district is proven to have breached that duty by negligently exposing plaintiff to a foreseeable danger of molestation by his guidance counselor, resulting in his injuries, and assuming no immunity provision applies, liability falls on the school district under section 815.2.”</div><div>C.A., at 865-866.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Court in C.A. held that a special relationship exists between a student and a school and its employees:</span></div><div>“In addition, a school district and its employees have a special relationship with the district's pupils, a relationship arising from the mandatory character of school attendance and the comprehensive control over students exercised by school personnel, “analogous in many ways to the relationship between parents and their children.” (Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist., supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 935, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 811, 968 P.2d 522; see M.W. v. Panama Buena Vista Union School Dist.

Because of this special relationship, imposing obligations beyond what each person generally owes others under Civil Code section 1714, the duty of care owed by school personnel includes the duty to use reasonable measures to protect students from foreseeable injury at the hands of third parties acting negligently or intentionally.&nbsp; &nbsp;This principle has been applied in cases of employees' alleged negligence resulting in injury to a student by another student (J.H. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.

(See conc. and dis. opn., post, p. 465.) Given the facts of this case and the benefit of hindsight, all would have to agree that the prospect of such misconduct is conceivable, but that is a far cry from foreseeability, even under the broad meaning that concept is given in the respondeat superior context.”</div><div>John R., at 450, n.&nbsp; 9.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This portion of the footnote was directed to the theory of respondent superior liability for the sexual assault itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The actual holding in the John R. case was that a theory of liability on the school district for alleged sexual abuse of a student by a teacher based on vicarious liability based on respondeat superior based on the facts in the case before it was questionable. However, the Court expressly held that plaintiffs were “free to pursue…their claims against the district premised on its own direct negligence in hiring and supervising the teacher.”&nbsp; &nbsp;John R., at 453.&nbsp; The first paragraph of the above quoted footnote in fact emphasized that the majority took issue with the analysis offered which appeared to improperly call for the Court to “prejudge plaintiffs’ direct claims against the district for its own negligence.”&nbsp; [Id.].&nbsp; There is no dispute that the theories pursued in the subject causes of action are claims based on the direct negligence of defendant.&nbsp; The footnote accordingly has no bearing on the direct negligence claims alleged here.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as pointed out in the opposition, in the more recent case of Doe v. Lawndale Elementary School Dist. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 113, the Second District, in considering direct negligence claims against a school district with respect to the alleged sexual assault of a 13 year old student by a school music instructor, reversed the trial court’s granting of summary adjudication on the student’s negligence causes of action, holding:</div><div>“We conclude, consistent with California negligence law, that school administrators have a duty to protect students from sexual abuse by school employees, even if the school does not have actual knowledge of a particular employee's history of committing, or propensity to commit, such abuse.”</div><div>Lawndale, at 119.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Second District in Lawndale rejected an argument by the school district based on the same footnote in John R. that it is not foreseeable that school employees will sexually abuse students, and directly addressed the current application of that footnote under current law:</span></div><div>“The District also contends it is not foreseeable school employees will sexually abuse students. According to the District, “sexual abuse is so unforeseeable that it is outside the course and scope of everyone's employment as a matter of law.” But a school district is not like every employer. As the court recognized in United States Youth Soccer, supra, 8 Cal.App.5th 1118, 214 Cal.Rptr.3d 552, sexual abuse by members “of an organization that provide[s] activities exclusively for children”—like an elementary school district—is reasonably foreseeable, even where the organization “had no knowledge that [the employee] had previously sexually or physically abused anyone or had a propensity to do so.” (Id. at pp. 1132, 1135, 214 Cal.Rptr.3d 552; see Archbishop, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at pp. 676-677, 285 Cal.Rptr.3d 613; Brown v. USA Taekwondo, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1097-1098, 253 Cal.Rptr.3d 708; Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 404, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 12 (Juarez), disapproved on another ground in Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 222, fn. 9, 276 Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159.)</div><div><br></div><div>The District relies primarily on John R. v. Oakland Unified School Dist. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 438 [256 Cal. Rptr. 766, 769 P.2d 948] (lead opn.). In that case the Supreme Court held a school district was not vicariously liable for a teacher's sexual molestation of a student under respondeat superior. (Id. at p. 441, 256 Cal.Rptr. 766, 769 P.2d 948.) The lead opinion, joined by one other justice, included a footnote stating it was “unduly pessimistic ... to suggest that sexual misconduct is foreseeable any time a minor and an adult are alone in a room together ....” (Id. at p. 450, fn. 9, 256 Cal.Rptr. 766, 769 P.2d 948.) But the issue here is not whether it is foreseeable a particular adult will sexually abuse a student if left alone with the student. As the court recognized in United States Youth Soccer, and as subsequent cases confirmed, the issue is whether it is reasonably foreseeable that organizations or entities that provide services primarily or exclusively for children have employees who may sexually abuse a child if the organization fails to take reasonable measures to prevent the abuse. In any event, to the extent John R. suggests sexual abuse of students by school employees is not reasonably foreseeable, it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's more recent holding in Hart that school personnel owe students a duty to take reasonable measures to protect them from foreseeable injury, including “injuries to a student resulting from a teacher's sexual assault.” (Hart, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 871, 138 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 270 P.3d 699.)</div><div>Lawndale, at 132</div><div><br></div><div>Lawndale relied on Doe v. United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1118, in which the court of appeal found that an organization such as the Youth Soccer Association had a duty to one of its players in connection with sexual abuse by a coach, even where “defendants had no knowledge that [the coach] had previously sexually or physically abused anyone or had a propensity to do so.”&nbsp; United States Youth Soccer, at 1132.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to Steven F., defendant relies on a list of several specific instances in Steven F, which were held insufficient to provide a school with knowledge of a teacher’s sexual relationship with a student, but, again this case is not applicable here because, as pointed out in the opposition, Steven F. involved an analysis of the scope of a school district’s duty owed to the relatives of a student who had been sexually abused at school.&nbsp; The student’s claims against the district had been settled. The Court held that the student’s parents could not recover under a theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress, applying an NIED liability analysis which required that there be outrageous conduct on the part of defendants, and finding that in that case, the other teachers’ failure to report their colleague’s spending too much time in the company of a particular student was not sufficiently outrageous.&nbsp; The instant case is not a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim brought by relatives, but a direct action by the students, and no outrageous conduct on the part of defendant is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>The school district in Lawndale cited the passage in Steven F. in support of an argument that the standard of care required actual notice of sexual abuse, as defendant argues here.&nbsp; The court of appeal in Lawndale rejected the argument, explaining:&nbsp;</div><div>“This language from the 2003 Court of Appeal opinion in Steven F. no longer reflects California law. Imposing liability on school administrators who fail to take reasonable measures to identify and respond to potential sexual abuse of students does not lead to the parade of horribles conjured by the court in Steven F. The language cited by the District is also inconsistent with the Supreme Court's 2012 decision in Hart, which weighed the consequences of imposing liability on school districts and held school administrators may be liable for their negligent supervision of employees that results in sexual abuse. (Hart, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 879, 138 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 270 P.3d 699.)”</div><div>Lawndale, at 136-137.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal in Lawndale also addressed the language defendant quotes from Santillan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Fresno (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 708, 720, that vicarious liability is precluded “based solely on knowledge of conduct by the employee which is ambiguous in regard to his commission of such an offense.”&nbsp; The Santillan case addressed what evidence was necessary to revive the statute of limitations on childhood sex abuse cases under former CCP section 340.1, which permitted victims to bring an action where an institution “knew or had reason to know” that the perpetrator had engaged in past unlawful sexual conduct, which it had been recognized&nbsp; by the lower court “imposes more stringent demands on constructive knowledge than the concept of foreseeability normally applicable to negligence claims.”&nbsp; Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 542.&nbsp; The Lawndale court of appeal explained that Santillan’s “holding was limited to a defendant’s notice for purposes of extending the limitations period under the statute.”&nbsp; Lawndale, at 130.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The standard to be applied is then not whether defendant had actual knowledge of any misconduct or propensity of its employee Dean, but whether the organization failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the abuse, in effect, failed to take reasonable measures to identify and respond to potential sexual abuse of students from foreseeable sources.&nbsp; Lawndale, at 132, 136; C.A. v.

[UMF No. 29, 30, 33,35 and evidence cited, Ex. 16, Williams Decl., para. 12; Ex. 17, Dailey Decl., para. 12, Ex. 18, Helge Decl., para. 7, Ex. 19, Feazell Decl., para. 11; Additional Facts Nos. 57-63, and evidence cited].&nbsp; Specifically, the former principal of the high school at the time, John Locke, testified at deposition that he does not recall ever receiving any training related to suspected sexual abuse of students from either the church or the Imperial Schools, and does not recall himself providing any sort of information or training to his staff, teachers, or employees.&nbsp; [Shukry Decl., Ex. 8, Locke Depo., pp. 39-41].&nbsp; Locke also does not recall receiving anything from the legal department or from the church on the topic.&nbsp; [Locke Depo, p. 41].&nbsp; School personnel, including then legal secretary Evelyn Dailey, and then teacher, now president, Leston Greg Williams, testified in deposition that they could not recall any written policies at the time.&nbsp; [Additional Facts No. 62, and evidence cited, Shukry Decl., Ex. 7, Dailey Depo. 48-49; Shukry Decl., Ex. 10, Williams Depo., pp. 66-67].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In addition, although defendant has submitted a declaration of Ralph Helge, general legal counsel for the Grace Church organization at the time, stating that at no time prior to or during Dean’s employment with Imperial schools did he receive any complaints, reports, or other information suggesting Dean had sexually abused or was sexually inappropriate with a minor, plaintiffs have submitted deposition testimony in which Doe 1 testifies that she attended a meeting with the lawyer for the church, the declarant Ralph Helge, and her parents, in which the lawyer Helge made it clear he was aware of the sexual abuse of Doe 1 by Dean, but told plaintiff’s father that it would be very damaging to the father’s reputation if the relationship became public.&nbsp; [Helge Decl., para. 8; Response to UMF No. 32, and evidence cited, Additional Facts Nos. 12, 64-65, and evidence cited; Shukry Decl., Ex. 1, Doe 1 Depo., pp. 61-64, 83, 84, 88-91].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Several witnesses for defendant submit declarations indicating that records were reviewed and there were no complaints whatsoever in the records reflecting that Superintendent Dean “posed a risk of danger to minor children,” suggesting known misconduct which had become known to Helge was not reported or recorded.&nbsp; [UMF Nos. 37, 38, and evidence cited, Ex. 16, Williams Decl., para. 11; Ex. 17, Dailey Decl., paras. 10, 11; Ex. 19, Feazell Decl., para. 12].&nbsp; This circumstance raises triable issues of material fact with respect to whether Helge had actual knowledge of the improper relationship between Dean and a student, and deliberately did nothing about it and did not document it according to his own reported policies and training practices or was actively engaged in covering up the information.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, plaintiffs have submitted evidence which a trier of fact could reasonably find supports a conclusion that school, church and camp administrators should have known, or a reasonable investigation of conduct should have resulted in, discovery of defendant’s misconduct.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Specifically, plaintiffs submit evidence that Dean would do drugs with and provide alcohol to groups of students on multiple occasions, on school property, in his home, which was a church owned property, and at camp, and that drug and alcohol use occurred in the presence of another Imperial teacher and sports coach, Greg Rothwell, who plaintiff and other students believed was also aware of the closeness between Dean and Doe 1.&nbsp; [Additional Facts Nos. 28, 29, and evidence cited, Doe 1 Depo. pp. 44-49].&nbsp; Plaintiffs also submit deposition testimony of a student at the time, Lisa Davis, who testifies that she was called into the school office and asked about the parties by Principal Locke and Vice Principal Cote, including whether there had been alcohol use, and when Davis could offer no information, Principal Locke “would tell us not to have this conversation with anyone, and one student would have to go get the next one.”&nbsp; [Response to UMF No. 36, and evidence cited, Additional Facts 33, 53-55, and evidence cited, Shukry Decl., Ex. 2, Davis Depo. I, pp. 34; Shukry Decl., Ex. 3, Davis Depo. II, pp. 92-102; Shukry Decl., Ex. 6, Davis Depo. III, 31-33].&nbsp; As plaintiffs argue, this evidence gives rise to a reasonable inference that Dean’s misconduct, occurring repeatedly, was suspected by the principal and vice principal, known to at least one other teacher, and should have been further investigated and viewed with suspicion as creating an atmosphere of danger for students, and for abuse.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also submit evidence that Dean’s wife, Carole Dean, a teacher at the Imperial elementary school, witnessed Dean kissing plaintiff Doe 1 in their home. [Additional Facts 8, 24, and evidence cited, Doe 1 Depo., pp. 150].</div><div><br></div><div>Evidence is also submitted that camp employees personally assisted in delivering plaintiff Doe 1 to spend time alone with Dean after lights out at camp.&nbsp; [Additional Facts Nos. 35-37, 50, and evidence cited, Doe Depo., p 258-261].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs submit evidence that fellow students were aware of the relationship, observing the physical closeness between the two, particularly in speech class, hearing rumors of the relationship, and overhearing daily telephone calls from plaintiff Doe 1 to Superintendent Dean, in which she laughed and giggled, and was “smiley and flirty when she was on the phone.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Response to UMF No. 36, and evidence cited, Additional Facts Nos. 27, 31, 32, 34, and evidence cited, Davis Depo., I pp. 31, 32, 39-41; Davis Depo.

Coldwell Banker Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1444.&nbsp; This circumstance is not a situation where the indemnity claims will be lost if not asserted in this matter, so, although the opposition seems to apply the bad faith standards generally applicable to compulsory cross-complaints, the cross-complaint here would in fact not be compulsory.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, the case has already been set for trial, so it is in the court’s discretion to grant leave “in the interest of justice.”&nbsp; City of Glendale argues that the interests of justice would be served by permitting the City of Glendale to file a cross-complaint against Avedissian as Avedissian is the party most, if not completely, at fault for plaintiff’s injuries, and allowing the cross-complaint would ensure that all issues and claims arising out of the incident are determined in one action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that there is no evidence of inexcusable delay or prejudice to any other party as the trial in this matter is not set until November of 2025, so there is ample time to conduct discovery, and no depositions have taken place in this case, so that all parties will have the opportunity to fully participate in any depositions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Stepan Shahinyan has filed a Notice of Non-Opposition to the motion, indicating plaintiff has no opposition to the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant and cross-complainant David Avedissian has filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that City of Glendale has not established or explained any good faith in filing the cross-complaint, especially since it filed its answer over a year ago and did not file a motion earlier.&nbsp; The opposition argues that there is no dispute that the identity of the driver has been known since the complaint was filed.&nbsp; The opposition indicates that the claim against David Avedissian is only for negligent entrustment because plaintiff already settled this action with the driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition then relies on the statutes and standards governing compulsory cross-complaints, which, as noted above, this cross-complaint is not, as City of Glendale could seek indemnity from other parties after any obligation to plaintiff is determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, with respect to permissive cross-complaints it is generally recognized that the declaration of counsel should show that it would be in the interest of justice to grant leave to file, including some reasonable excuse why the cross-complaint was not filed earlier, such as mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, or recent discovery of new facts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Weil &amp; Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group, Cal. Practice Guide, 2024 rev.) 6:562.&nbsp; In Crocker National Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 862-864, the court of appeal held there was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to file a permissive cross-complaint five months before trial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, counsel’s declaration does not attempt to explain the delay at all but indicates that good cause exists to add the party that struck plaintiff with her vehicle to the action to ensure all issues arising out of the incident are determined in one action to avoid duplicity of efforts and resources, and that no prejudice or improper motives are present in the request.&nbsp; [Kang Decl., paras. 3, 4].&nbsp; At best, the declaration states that “there is no prejudice or inexcusable delay at issue here,” without explaining how the delay is in fact not inexcusable.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Kang Decl., para. 4].&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The declaration is quite disappointing, as it is not explained why the cross-complaint was not filed earlier, when the identity of the driver has been known to all parties since the complaint was served in late 2022 and early 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, the court has a strong interest in having all of these matters tried together and generally disfavors having defendant be forced to bring another civil action against a potentially responsible party, which would likely be related to this action, or to wait until the close of this action.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although not clearly argued in the opposition, counsel’s declaration in opposition indicates that there is a motion for summary judgment in this matter which was filed in January and set to be heard in July of 2024.&nbsp; [Kandarian-Stein Decl., para. 4].&nbsp; The court will inquire at the hearing if the filing of the cross-complaint would impact&nbsp; &nbsp;that motion or interfere with it going forward as scheduled.&nbsp; It does not appear from the file that permitting a cross-complaint to be filed against the driver would impact the motion for summary judgment, as the motion essentially argues that the sole cause of action brought against moving defendant for negligent entrustment is a cause of action in which liability is imposed on a vehicle owner or permitter because of his own independent negligence (in entrusting the vehicle), and not for the negligence of the driver.&nbsp; The motion appears to focus on defendant’s claims that he lacked any notice of any prior driving problems which would demonstrate his independent negligence.&nbsp; However, the court would be within its discretion to deny the motion for the lack of explanation concerning the delay, particularly if the timing would interfere with the current schedule in the litigation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, however, the opposition fails to point to any prejudice from the delay in seeking amendment, such as that evidence has disappeared or defendant will have insufficient time to explore the liability of the driver, who in this case, is his mother.&nbsp; The interests of justice here favor the judicial efficiency of the alleged liability for plaintiff’s alleged injuries and damages being determined and apportioned in a single proceeding.&nbsp; The motion accordingly is granted.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendant/Cross-Defendant City of Glendale’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED in the interest of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moving Defendant is ordered to e-file its signed cross-complaint by the close of business this date.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 23GDCV00879&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  July 12, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>6<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>7/12/2024&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>23 GDCV00879<span style="white-space:pre">			</span>Trial Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>HR General Construction, Inc. v.

FCA argues the phrase qualifies dealer-owned cars and demonstrators and thus refers to vehicles that, like those two types of vehicles, have not been previously sold and are sold with new or full warranties. FCA argues plaintiffs' interpretation is at odds with the rest of the Act's definition of “new motor vehicles.” While we acknowledge that in isolation the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” could arguably refer to any car sold with a manufacturer's warranty still in force, we agree with FCA that context clearly requires a more narrow interpretation. Context is a fundamental aspect of statutory interpretation, and here it's key to discerning the phrase's meaning. (Kirzhner, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 972, 266 Cal.Rptr.3d 346, 470 P.3d 56 [“We do not consider statutory language in isolation; instead, we examine the entire statute to construe the words in context”].)</div><div><br></div><div>To begin with, the phrase appears in a definition of new motor vehicles. That fact alone strongly suggests the Legislature did not intend the phrase to refer to used (i.e., previously sold) vehicles. But, more importantly, the phrase is preceded by “a dealer-owned vehicle and demonstrator,” which comprise a specific and narrow class of vehicles. Though they have not been previously sold to a consumer, demonstrators and dealer-owned cars are used in the sense that they will have been driven for various purposes before sale. As such, they will necessarily have more miles on their odometers than the typical vehicle in a dealer's new car inventory. What makes these vehicles unique is that even though they aren't technically new, manufacturers (or their dealer-representatives) treat them as such upon sale by providing the same type of manufacturer's warranty that accompanies new cars.</div><div><br></div><div>In other words, demonstrators and dealer-owned vehicles comprise a narrow category of basically new vehicles—they have never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express warranties. Given this context, we think the most natural interpretation of the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” is that it, too, refers to vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.</div><div>Rodriguez, at 219-220, italics in original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in opposition points out that Rodriguez is currently under review, and also that Rodriguez in any case merely created a split in authority on the subject issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As noted in a more recent precedent, Stiles v.

A ‘demonstrator’ is a vehicle assigned by a dealer for the purpose of demonstrating qualities and characteristics common to vehicles of the same or similar model and type.” (Emphasis added.)</div><div>Jensen, at 121-122, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The statutory language has not significantly changed since Jensen was decided.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal first considered the plain language of the statute, and the rules of proper construction of statutory interpretation, and concluded:</span></div><div>“We conclude the words of section 1793.22 are reasonably free from ambiguity and cars sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's new motor vehicle warranty are included within its definition of “new motor vehicle.” The use of the word “or” in the statute indicates “demonstrator” and “other motor vehicle” are intended as alternative or separate categories of “new motor vehicle” if they are “sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty.” (White v. County of Sacramento (1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680, 183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191.)</div><div>Jensen, at 123.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal then conducted an exhaustive review of the legislative history of the provision in support of its conclusion that the “plain meaning and the legislative intent are one and the same.”&nbsp; Jensen, at 123-125.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal also rejected various arguments that the trial court’s interpretation of the Act’s definition of “new motor vehicle” created a conflict with general definitions in the Vehicle Code and in connection with consumer goods, applying the more specific definition as the one governing the more general definitions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jensen, at 126.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>The court of appeal also reasoned that the interpretation of the definition to include cars sold with a balance remaining on the new motor vehicle warranty was consistent with the Act’s purposes, and with reason, practicality, and common sense:</div><div>“Our conclusion section 1793.22 includes cars sold with a balance remaining on the new motor vehicle warranty is consistent with the Act's purpose as a remedial measure. (Kwan v. Mercedes–Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371.) It is also consistent with the Department of Consumer Affairs' regulations which interpret the Act to protect “any individual to whom the vehicle is transferred during the duration of a written warranty.” (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 16, § 3396.1, subd. (g).)</div><div><br></div><div>Addressing the final step in statutory construction which applies reason, practicality, and common sense to the language in question (Halbert's Lumber, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1239, 8 Cal.Rptr.2d 298), BMW argues the Legislature could not have intended to grant protection to every used car with a balance remaining on the new car warranty because of the economic impact on consumers. Specifically, BMW maintains “[t]he subsequent owner would have the benefit of all of Song–Beverly's generous presumptions, without having undertaken the same risks as the purchaser of a really new car. Further, while the subsequent (perhaps third or fourth in the line of owners) will receive the benefit of these presumptions, the manufacturer will find it tremendously more difficult to raise defenses under Song–Beverly—such as the defense that the owner used the vehicle unreasonably—because it will be harder to trace multiple owners and determine their use or abuse of the vehicle.” BMW contends the increased costs will result in higher car prices or the shortening of warranties to the statutory minimum. It argues “[t]hese alternatives would inevitably result in a manifest decline in trade and commerce in this state, creating great inconvenience for consumers. It is impossible that the legislature intended this highly intractable result.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We acknowledge manufacturers such as BMW incur costs in honoring express warranties to service and repair the cars they sell in this state. We also presume the decision to offer a warranty of a specified length involves weighing the benefit of increased sales against the cost of providing service and repair for the effective duration of the warranty. It may be the equation factors in the impact of resale during the warranty period. However, as noted by BMW, manufacturers are free to change the terms of express warranties they offer. The Act merely reflects the Legislature's intent to make car manufacturers live up to their express warranties, whatever the duration of coverage.</div><div>Jensen, at 126-127, footnote omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This holding by the Third District court of appeal in Jensen, that the Song-Beverly Act applies to cars sold with a balance remaining on the new motor vehicle warranty, including used cars, has been consistently recognized since 1995.&nbsp; There appears to be a conflict between Jensen and Rodriguez which the trial courts were to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The opposition here primarily argues that there has been a more recent case decided by the Second District on this issue, which expressly rejected the Rodriguez holding.&nbsp; Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 913, was published on May 2, 2024, and modified on May 23, 2024.&nbsp; This recent case was before this motion for judgment on the pleadings was filed, but perhaps before defendant had become aware of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Stiles, the Second District reversed the trial court’s sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend to a first amended complaint brought by a plaintiff who had purchased a used vehicle from a third party dealership with some balance remaining on the original manufacturer’s warranty, finding that the vehicle was not a “new motor vehicle” as defined in the Song-Beverly Act, section 1793.22, in reliance on Rodriguez.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal rejected the argument, also made here, that a used car only qualifies as a “new motor vehicle” if at the time of purchase a “new or full” warranty accompanies the sale, rather than a balance remaining on an unexpired warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District quoted the definition of “New motor vehicle” in the Song-Beverly Act to include “a dealer owned vehicle and ‘demonstrator’ or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty,” and reasoned:</div><div>“Thus, Stiles is entitled to the replacement or refund remedy of section 1793.2, subdivision (d)(2) if the car she purchased was a ‘motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty.’ Section 1793.22 subd. (e)(2).&nbsp; Stiles so alleges.&nbsp; That should be the end of the discussion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Kia, in its relentless attempt to avoid the clear meaning of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), assumes a legislative role and tries to amend the statute. Kia claims we must add “new or full” prior to warranty. (§ 1793.22, subd. (e)(2).) Had the Legislature intended to qualify warranty with “new or full” it would have said so. We may not add words to a clear and unequivocal statute. (Hudson v. Superior Court (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 1165, 1172, 213 Cal.Rptr.3d 277.)”</div><div>Stiles, at 917.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Stiles went on to apply the following interpretation, pointing out irregularities in the interpretation applied by Rodriguez:</div><div>“The court stated that dealer-owned and demonstrator vehicles are “basically” new because “they have never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express warranties.” (Ibid.) The court interpreted the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” to be limited to vehicles that have “never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.” (Ibid.) The court stated the section describes only two types of vehicles— dealer-owned and demonstrator— not three. (Ibid.)</div><div><br></div><div>We cannot argue with the Rodriguez court's conclusion that the phrase “or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” appears under the definition of a new motor vehicle. (§ 1793.22, subd. (e)(2).) That is why we conclude Stiles's car, in precisely meeting the definition as a “motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty,” is a new motor vehicle as defined by the statute. More importantly, the Rodriguez court adds words to the statute. The statute contains no such limitation as vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties. Section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2) was enacted in 1992. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1232,&nbsp; § 7.) In the more than 30 years since then, the Legislature has had ample opportunity to add such limiting language. It has not done so. It would be more than presumptuous for us to add what the Legislature has not. The court's assertion that section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2) has only two categories— dealer-owned and demonstrator— defies the rules of English grammar and logic.</div><div><br></div><div>In section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), the dealer-owned and demonstrator categories are followed by the disjunctive “or” which precedes “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty.” The disjunctive is ordinarily used to distinguish that which precedes it from that which follows it. “[O]ther motor vehicles” is clearly a third separate category.</div><div>Stiles, at 919, italics in original, footnote omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Stiles court concluded:</div><div>“We, like Jensen, but unlike Rodriguez, look to the plain words of the statute. If any legislative history is required, its most salient feature is that more than 30 years after section 1793.22 was enacted and almost 30 years after Jensen was decided, the Legislature has not amended the definition of “new motor vehicle” in section 1793.22. And neither will we.”</div><div>Stiles, at 920.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the complaint, as in Stiles, alleges that plaintiff obtained the vehicle in a transaction which was accompanied by defendant manufacturer’s express and implied warranties.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 10, 21, 22].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, according to the Standing Order and the order of the Supreme Court granting review, pursuant to the current posture of Rodriguez being reviewed by the California Supreme Court, this court has discretion to consider Rodriguez persuasive, and to consider it conflicting precedent, and, to the extent there is a conflict, choose between the conflicting decisions, in this case, the authorities and rationales of Jensen and Stiles, on the one hand, and the rationale and decision in Rodriguez on the other hand, pursuant to Auto Equity Sales.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This court has carefully reviewed the analysis of the Third District in Jensen, and the Second District in Stiles, and that of the Fourth District in Rodriguez, as well as the language of the statutory provision, and the competing treatment in each decision of the overall provisions in consumer protection law, and the legislative history.&nbsp; The court has also noted the court of appeal concession in Rodriguez that in the statute itself the operative plain language could refer to any car sold with a manufacturer’s warranty in force.&nbsp; The court has also considered the consumer protection focus of the Jensen court, its conclusion that its definition is consistent with the Song-Beverly Act’s purpose as a remedial measure, as well as the point emphasized in Stiles concerning the longstanding application of Jensen without action to change the statute by the legislature.&nbsp; This court at this juncture accordingly opts to apply the analysis set forth in Jensen and Stiles, finding that the reasoning is sound.&nbsp; The motion for judgment on the pleadings accordingly is denied on this ground.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To the extent defendant argues that plaintiff fails to allege that BMW was the lessor or seller of the subject vehicle, the pleading clearly alleges that BMW was the manufacturer who extended warranties.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 21, 22].&nbsp; The complaint alleges that defendant leased the vehicle from an authorized BMW dealership and identifies the dealership.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 9].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As argued in the opposition, the court of appeal in Jensen rejected arguments similar to those raised by defendant here with respect to the warranties recognized in Song-Beverly Act actions.&nbsp; Jensen, at 126 (“the more specific definition found in the current section 1793.22 governs the more general definition found in section 1791,” citation omitted); Jensen, at 128 (“the Act applies to new motor manufacturers who make express warranties.

Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff enrolled at defendant Saint Francis High School of La Canada Flintridge (SFHS) in August of 2020, and that it was important to plaintiff and his family that plaintiff attend a Roman Catholic high school for various strongly held personal reasons.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he was particularly interested in playing organized football with the SFHS teams that participate in defendant California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) organized games against other CIF teams in the Southern California section of CIF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from early 2020 through May 2021, SFHS had no in-person instruction, and no active football program.&nbsp; In June of 2021, plaintiff began attending SFHS’s football camp, and won a place on the Junior Varsity team.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that in August of 2021, plaintiff suffered an injury to his shoulder during football practice and was in October 2021 evaluated by a doctor and also diagnosed with a tear in the tendon of a finger and prescribed no PE or sports for two weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>In October of 2021, plaintiff alleges that during the first half of a SFHS football game, plaintiff was on the sidelines due to his medical restrictions, wearing his football uniform but not wearing pads or a helmet, when defendant Aidan Austin (Aidan), a fellow student, while wearing his football helmet, aggressively accosted plaintiff verbally for not being tough enough to play through injuries.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges despite Aidan’s continual harassment, plaintiff did not engage in any physical retaliation against Aidan, but Aidan, with his helmet still on, butted plaintiff (who was not wearing a helmet) in the face repeatedly, injuring plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges he did not fight back or do anything other than attempt to shield himself from Aidan’s criminal battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that no defendant took any significant disciplinary action against Aidan for the helmet assault, although it occurred in open view of hundreds of people, including one or more of the other defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At halftime, Aidan, obviously undeterred by any defendants, hunted plaintiff down in the weight room and, unprovoked, put plaintiff in a choke hold and beat him repeatedly over the head.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the following day, upon receiving reports of Aidan’s unprovoked violence against plaintiff, defendant John Jordan, Dean of Students of SFHS, punished both of them equally, by suspending them both from Friday’s football game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, Aidan again aggressively hunted plaintiff down in the locker room, threatened him, and proceeded to knee plaintiff in the groin, pulled plaintiff’s jacket over plaintiff’s head and repeatedly struck plaintiff in the head with a closed fist.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he did not fight back and sought only to shield himself, and the incident was videotaped and viewed by Jordan, which showed older players dancing and celebrating the assault.&nbsp; It also documents that plaintiff never struck back.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that again defendants responded by treating plaintiff and Aidan equally, as if both were equally culpable for Aidan’s unprovoked criminal attack, which defendants again did nothing to stop or prevent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that in mid-October, another SFHS student reported to plaintiff that the student had seen Aidan carrying a knife on campus, and warned plaintiff to stay away from Aidan because he was armed.&nbsp; In the latter half of October, when plaintiff was intimidated and fearful of a knife armed Aidan again attacking him, plaintiff had a video-displayed SnapChat conversation with another SFHS student, in which the other student viewed, near plaintiff, an airsoft gun, and plaintiff made a joke about the airsoft gun being a real firearm. Plaintiff later clarified that it was not real and that he was joking.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, plaintiff and his mother, Marta Recasens, met with Jordan to discuss what Jordan claimed was his and SFHS’s investigation of the foregoing altercations and their aftermath.&nbsp; Jordan informed them that Jordan had a grainy photo of a gun that plaintiff had supposedly displayed on social media, but never presented this image to plaintiff or Recasens.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that during the investigation, Jordan did view the videotape where Aidan attacked plaintiff in the locker room, and interviewed other football players who informed him that plaintiff was being threatened and harassed by Aidan and that plaintiff feared for his life, but did not take proper measures to prevent, protect plaintiff or to properly punish Aidan, the aggressor.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff was under the authority of defendants as a student athlete who qualified to be in the football program and should have been afforded the protection of those authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The day following the meeting with Jordan, plaintiff and Recasen met with SFHS’s Disciplinary Board, comprised of defendant Jordan, defendant Thomas Moran, Principal of SFHS, and six other individuals, in which plaintiff read a statement about the altercations and their aftermath, and admitted in his statement that within a week of Aidan’s most recent beating, plaintiff remembered having commented as a joke on social media that an airsoft gun the plaintiff owned was a real firearm.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he contritely admitted this joke as inappropriate and asked forgiveness.&nbsp; Plaintiff was then expelled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that had defendants acted more promptly in disciplining and either suspending or expelling Aidan prior to the last assault on plaintiff, plaintiff would not have been frightened and intimidated into joking that the airsoft gun was real, which joke led to plaintiff’s expulsion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The First Amended Complaint alleges that plaintiff has been damaged as a result of his expulsion, including mental suffering, the loss of the companionship and society of teachers and friends at SFHS, and due to the disciplinary record created with the expulsion, finding it difficult to be accepted as a student at a comparable religious high school and, later, colleges.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that at the new high school in which plaintiff enrolled, he was not allowed to play football for one year due to CIF rules, despite being told by Jordan that no such disciplinary reasons statement would appear on plaintiff’s record.&nbsp; In contrast, Aidan, who was not expelled but suspended, and transferred to a different school, was allowed to participate in football after only six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff appealed the expulsion ruling to CIF explaining the circumstances, but CIF would not change its decision. Plaintiff alleges that CIF failed to properly investigate the matter after it failed to protect plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that prior to Aidan’s attacks, plaintiff had been an honor roll student, but his academic career was damaged when he failed courses because of the stress he endured from the bullying, beating and expulsion, that plaintiff’s football career was harmed as he was not able to play football for over a year, and that plaintiff as a result of the beatings and expulsion, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC also names as defendant Antonio Marti, the President of SFHS.</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that all defendants other than Aidan breached their duty of properly supervising Aidan to ensure that he did not bully or physically abuse plaintiff, and breached their duty by failing to suspend or expel Aidan when Aidan repeatedly battered plaintiff, and that CIF breached its duty to provide protection for plaintiff by not instituting rules and guidelines on bullying and breached its duty in not ensuring that Aidan received the same consequences as plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action against Aidan only for IIED and battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>First Cause of Action—Negligence and Second Cause of Action—NIED&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer to these causes of action by moving defendant CIF was previously sustained as follows:</span></div><div>“Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED on the grounds the complaint fails to sufficiently allege a legal or factual basis for the imposition, or assumption, of a negligence duty on the party of moving defendant California Interscholastic Federation or conduct on the part of moving defendant which resulted in plaintiff’s alleged damages.”</div><div>[Minute Order 02/12/2024].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant CIF argues that plaintiff’s first and second causes of action in the FAC continue to rely on an assumption that under the factual circumstances alleged by plaintiff which caused his injuries that CIF had a duty to supervise him when the injurious events occurred.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Specifically, plaintiff alleges that once a player qualifies to participate and is in the program, “CIF has the duty to protect its players since they are providing the rules and guidelines on how players are to behave and qualify to play.”&nbsp; [FAC, para. 55].&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that CIF is negligent in failing to have some form of a rule or guideline addressing bullying and providing protections against it.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 60].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that the despite the court’s previous order and the basis for sustaining CIF’s demurrer to the original complaint, plaintiff continues to insist that CIF had the same duty of care as plaintiff’s school to supervise students and ensure that no bullying or improper behavior occurred between students, attempting to hold CIF responsible for the same duty to supervise as its member schools, without pleading proper facts to do so.&nbsp; CIF argues that the fact remains that CIF owes no duty of care to supervise two student athletes on school grounds in the context of curricular or extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To plead a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must allege the following elements: The existence of a duty of care, breach of that duty, and an injury proximately caused by the breach.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ladd v.

Hoek (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 208, 213 (“The question of the existence of a legal duty of care in a given factual situation presents a question of law which is to be determined by the courts alone.”). Garcia v. Paramount Citrus Association, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1452 (“The existence of a duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff is a question of law for the court, reviewed de novo on appeal.”)</div><div><br></div><div>Here, CIF argues that while the complaint here appears to acknowledge that as a student of defendant SFHS, plaintiff’s school had a duty to supervise plaintiff at the times referenced in the complaint, no such duty appears to be alleged against CIF.&nbsp; Defendant argues that plaintiff’s allegations against CIF appear to focus on the ultimate consequence of plaintiff’s expulsion as it relates to CIF’s rules regarding eligibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CIF again relies on Ryan v. California Interscholastic Federation-San Diego Section (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1048, in which the court of appeal reversed a mandamus judgment by the trial court directing CIF-San Diego Section to vacate its internal ruling arising from the athletic eligibility application of a high school in connection with a student athlete from Australia, who elected to repeat the 12th grade, upon which the high school requested eligibility for the student to participate in intercollegiate sports, specifically, football.&nbsp; &nbsp;The CIF found the student ineligible for violating the eight-semester rule and transfer rules of CIF, and the trial court ruled that the CIF bylaws were unconstitutional facially and as applied in violation of the California Constitution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As previously set forth in the court’s ruling on the demurrer to the previous pleading, the court of appeal in Ryan held that no property or liberty interest founded in state law had been established in the case, giving rise to constitutional due process rights:</span></div><div>“Neither the California Constitution nor California statutory law contains any provision that entitles students to an absolute right to participate in extracurricular activities and, precisely, in interscholastic athletics. Absent such support, the opportunity to participate in interscholastic athletic activities is a privilege, not a right or an entitlement of such dignity to warrant due process protection. Our conclusion is consistent with the overwhelming majority of other states whose appellate courts have held that students do not possess a constitutionally protected interest in their participation in extracurricular activities and, specifically, in interscholastic sports.”</div><div>Ryan, at 1061, citations omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also again cites to Education Code section 33353, under which it argues that CIF has limited duties, and is described, “(a) The California Interscholastic Federation is a voluntary organization that consists of school and school-related personnel with responsibility for administering interscholastic athletic activities in secondary schools,” which gives “the governing boards of school districts specific authority to select their athletic league representatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that, as Ryan recognizes, CIF’s role is eligibility-centered as opposed to policing or supervising the student athletes or its member schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The new allegations, in essence, that CIF should have enacted rules and regulations concerning bullying, while conceding it did not actually do so, and so did not assume a duty with respect to such rules and regulations, undermines the existence of any alleged duty.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 55, 60].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition does not cite to any legal duty which has been imposed on CIF with respect to promulgating or enforcing rules and regulations regarding bullying or investigating determinations made by the participating schools regarding conduct affecting eligibility determinations.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that there is one division, evidently not the division in which plaintiff is, in which CIF has students sign Sportsmanship Rules, but does not explain any legal basis for that supporting the imposition or assumption of a legal duty to ensure sportsmanship by students.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As the court previously observed, this theory that CIF owed a duty to promulgate and enforce rules concerning bullying, remains problematic practically speaking, when there is no legal basis for CIF having assumed a duty to enforce any such policy, which it never promulgated.&nbsp; This legal posture is also problematic with respect to the imposition of such a duty with respect to any mechanism by which CIF could ensure compliance by its member schools with an anti-bullying policy, or that in this case CIF had notice of facts giving rise to plaintiff’s allegations of bullying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that plaintiff relies on the disparate treatment by CIF of two players, as the Ryan case does not allow CIF to treat players unfairly or disparately different.&nbsp; Again, no legal authority is cited for this proposition, but plaintiff seems to rely on a wrongful discrimination theory, without explaining how plaintiff was discriminated against based on his membership in a protected class.&nbsp; This assertion is a particularly weak argument given Ryan’s assessment that there is no constitutionally protected right to participate in interscholastic athletics.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As the court previously observed, with respect to a racial discrimination or disparate treatment theory, this claim is not based in negligence. This argument is a theory based in some flaw in CIF’s review of plaintiff’s alleged appeal, which would likely implicate administrative remedies, and a duty arising from a source other than a general negligence duty of due care.&nbsp; Also, it depends on some sort of due process analysis when Ryan holds that participation in extracurricular activities such as football does not give rise to due process rights. The FAC continues to fail to allege how CIF is authorized to engage in a process to investigate the proprietary of scholastic penalties independently imposed by a member school, how that process would occur, and what CIF would be authorized to do based on the outcome of such an investigation. It would also appear that the damages alleged are not sufficiently tied to any alleged conduct by CIF, rather is tied to the conduct of the other defendants and plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading fails again on the issue of any duty owed or assumed by defendant CIF, despite plaintiff being permitted leave to amend to address this issue.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also again argues that plaintiff has failed to allege recoverable damages, as the FAC fails to identify any recoverable damages attributable to CIF’s ruling.&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, defendant again argues that the possibility of obtaining a scholarship in college is recognized in Ryan as alleged damages which are within the realm of being purely speculative:</div><div>“Finally, the trial court's observation that “for many students, the possibility of obtaining a college education literally hinges on their ability to receive an athletic scholarship, and qualification for such scholarships almost always requires participation in high school interscholastic athletics” does not create a property right to such participation. To invoke procedural due process protection, an individual must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to a benefit—not simply a unilateral expectation or an abstract need. The possibility of obtaining a scholarship does not elevate participation in interscholastic athletics into an interest that due process protects, because such opportunities are themselves simply expectancies. The acquisition of a scholarship is purely speculative, contingent upon far more than simply maintaining playing privileges. For example, a scholarship is contingent upon not only the availability of the scholarship, but also the student's excelling during season, meeting certain academic and entrance exam requirements, overcoming any inference from a disciplinary record, remaining healthy, and overcoming like competitors for the same finite scholarships that are distributed by coaches in their unbridled discretion. Consequently, the opportunity to earn, or the possibility of obtaining, an athletic scholarship is too speculative to elevate participation in interscholastic sports to the level of a constitutionally protected interest.</div><div>Ryan, at 1064-1065, citations omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that, again, plaintiff here has alleged nothing but a privilege, i.e., participation in high school football, as opposed to any legal right.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in opposition simply argues in terms of duty that the moving papers make light of the suffering of thousands of students by urging that CIF has no legal obligation to supervise students on the sidelines during an athletic competition in Southern California from its offices in Sacramento, when “the damages alleged are real and lasting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The FAC again fails to sufficiently allege recoverable damages caused by CIF.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the opposition requests further leave to amend, arguing that plaintiff proposes to separate the CIF from the school causes of action to clarify them and propose additional or different causes of action more in alignment with the facts, including allegations concerning CIF’s knowledge of problems prior to this case, going to foreseeability, and expanding on the disparate treatment allegations, and allegations based on facts learned in discovery and through investigation and research.&nbsp; The opposition notes, in a footnote, that attorney Mark Oknyansky was only recently hired by plaintiff’s counsel, has taken over the day-to-day handling of this case and has not had much time to oppose the demurrer but can see many ways the FAC might be improved. There is no specific explanation of what new material could be added.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court has already permitted one opportunity to amend, “if possible” with the detailed input of the court, and the detailed discussion of legal authorities seriously limiting the potential liability of CIF in these circumstances.&nbsp; Despite being permitted this opportunity, plaintiff has failed to sufficiently address those concerns, and defendant has requested that the demurrer now be sustained without leave to amend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Where a complaint is successfully challenged on demurrer, it is plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate how the complaint might be amended to cure it of the defect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now v. Dept. of Industrial Relations (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 298, 302.&nbsp; The opposition here does not explain what facts could be added which would support the existence of a duty based on foreseeability, which appears to be the standard applied to the school defendants, not CIF, or on disparate treatment where there is no constitutional right at issue under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Where a plaintiff will be unable to correct the flaws in a pleading, leave to amend should be denied.&nbsp; &nbsp;La Vista Cemetery Association v. American Savings &amp; Loan Association.&nbsp; &nbsp;(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 365.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court is of the view that plaintiff on further amendment will be unable to correct the flaws in its claims against moving defendant CIF.&nbsp; Hence, the demurrer by this defendant is now sustained without further leave to amend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED on the grounds the First Amended Complaint fails to sufficiently allege a legal or factual basis for the imposition or assumption of a negligence duty on the party of moving defendant California Interscholastic Federation or conduct on the part of moving defendant which resulted in plaintiff’s alleged damages.&nbsp;</div><div>As plaintiff has been unable to correct the deficiencies despite being permitted leave to amend to do so, with the benefit of detailed argument of the previous demurrer and the detailed input of the Court on the previous demurrer, and plaintiff has failed to sufficiently meet his burden in the opposition to demonstrate how the complaint might be amended to cure it of its defects, the demurrer is now sustained without further leave to amend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 23GDCV02198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  July 12, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>11<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>7/12/2024&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>23 GDCV02198&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Pacific Western Bank v.

The complaint alleges that defendant failed to possess and exercise that degree of knowledge and skill ordinarily possessed and exercised by other physicians, surgeons, hospitals, nurses, attendants and the like, failed to comply with the applicable legal standard, and neglected to adequately select a competent medical staff or periodically review the competency of the medical staff.&nbsp; The complaint also alleges that defendants failed to obtain the informed consent of Ghadimi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that as a result of the acts and omissions of defendants, Ghadimi suffered severe, serious and permanent injury to his person, and suffered loss of earnings and earnings capacity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges in the second “First” cause of action that the damages and injuries alleged that were caused by defendants resulted in the death of decedent Ghadimi, resulting in plaintiff being deprived of decedent’s presence, companionship, protection, affection and comfort, and also being deprived of decedent’s future support and maintenance, and expectancy in the estate of Ghadimi.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges plaintiff has incurred funeral and burial expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Untimely&nbsp;</div><div>The declaration submitted with the demurrer indicates that the complaint was served on moving defendants pursuant to an acknowledgment of receipt which counsel executed on or about January 4, 2024.&nbsp;

Thirty days after this service would have been February 3, 2024.&nbsp; On February 2, 2024, defendants’ counsel filed a declaration to invoke the automatic extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading under CCP sections 430.41(a)(2) and 435.5(a)(2), acknowledging that the responsive pleadings would now be due on March 4, 2024.&nbsp; Those sections provide that “Any further extensions shall be obtained by court order upon a showing of good cause.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer and motion to strike were filed on June 4, 2024, and served on June 3, 2024.&nbsp;

The motion could be denied, and the demurrer overruled on this ground alone, but the court elects not to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, the declaration filed in support of the demurrer shows that plaintiff permitted defendants several extensions of time to respond during meet and confer communications, with the final extension being to June 3, 2024.&nbsp;

Ruttenberg (2000) 53 Cal.App.4th 801.&nbsp; &nbsp;Under Ruttenberg, where an heir was not joined in the original proceeding, the omitted heir has a remedy against the other heirs, not a right to bring the wrongful death claim again.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, plaintiff has not responded to these arguments.&nbsp; Hence, the demurrer is sustained on this ground with leave to amend to permit plaintiff to allege facts supporting her standing, as well as to establish the joinder of necessary parties or the existence or non-existence of any other wrongful death claimants and any reasons for non-joinder.&nbsp; &nbsp;On amendment, if there is more than one plaintiff, the pleading must clearly allege and differentiate the capacities in which each plaintiff is pursuing each claim.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent the first “first” cause of action for professional negligence appears to be a survival claim, it is also not clearly alleged how plaintiff has standing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 377.20 (a), provides that “a cause of action for or against a person is not lost by reason of the person’s death, but survives subject to the applicable statute of limitations period.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP § 377.30:</span></div><div>“A cause of action that survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding passes to the decedent’s successor in interest, subject to Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 7000) of the Part 1 of Division 7 of the Probate Code, and an action may be commenced by the decedent’s personal representative or, if none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is not alleged here that plaintiff is decedent’s successor in interest, or decedent’s personal representative, and the opposition does not address this issue.&nbsp; The demurrer is sustained, and plaintiff is required on amendment to clearly allege the basis for any standing to pursue a claim on behalf of decedent on a survival theory, and if necessary, allege compliance with all procedures required for the pursuit of such a claim in that representative capacity.&nbsp; See, e.g. CCP § 377.32 (requiring affidavit or declaration of successor in interest).&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To the extent defendants seem to argue that certain damages cannot be recovered in a wrongful death cause of action, the pleading appropriately states each respective claim.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 377.30 provides for the pursuit of a cause of action that survives the death of a decedent.&nbsp; CCP § 377.34 limits damages in such an action to loss or damage sustained before death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 377.60 provides for the pursuit of a wrongful death cause of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;Under CCP § 377.61, damages in a wrongful death proceeding “may not include damages recoverable under Section 377.34.”&nbsp; This statute suggests that two claims may be necessary to recover both pre and post-death damages, and possibly by plaintiffs in differing capacities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the Code, a survival action and wrongful death action may be brought together:</div><div>“An action under Section 377.30 may be joined with an action under Section 377.60 arising out of the same wrongful act or neglect.”&nbsp;</div><div>CCP § 377.62(a).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The pleading does not separate out which damages are being sought in connection with each cause of action, which creates some uncertainty with respect to the appropriateness of the causes of action stated.&nbsp; Plaintiff must on amendment state separate prayers for relief as to each separate cause of action and ensure that the damages sought are recoverable under the above statutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Separate Causes of Action&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants argue that the two causes of action should be consolidated and alleged as only a single cause of action, as with respect to allegations of professional negligence a defendant has only one duty, measured by one standard of care.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants cite briefly to Flowers v.

one claim being made as a survivor action as a representative of decedent, and one being made as a wrongful death claim on behalf of plaintiff directly as an individual suffering different harm.&nbsp; As set forth above, the Code recognizes that the two distinctly postured claims can be brought in the same action.&nbsp; CCP § 377.62(a).</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hence, stating these theories separately could prove beneficial to all parties as the litigation proceeds, particularly if further facts alleged raise further standing or necessary party issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer on this ground accordingly is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff on amendment, however, is ordered to identify a first and second cause of action, rather than two “first” causes of action.&nbsp;

The pleading is also uncertain and confusing to the extent it refers repeatedly to “plaintiffs,” when only one plaintiff is named.&nbsp; Plaintiff on amendment must clearly allege the basis for any standing to pursue a claim on behalf of decedent on a survival theory, and if necessary, allege compliance with all procedures required for the pursuit of such a claim in that representative capacity.&nbsp; Plaintiff must also allege the basis for any standing to pursue a claim for wrongful death and allege the inclusion of all necessary parties to that claim.&nbsp; On amendment, if there is more than one plaintiff, the pleading must clearly allege and differentiate the capacities in which each plaintiff is pursuing each claim.&nbsp; The pleading is also uncertain as it does not separate out which damages are being sought in connection with each cause of action, which creates uncertainty with respect to the appropriateness of the causes of action stated.&nbsp; Plaintiff must also on amendment state separate prayers for relief as to each separate cause of action and ensure that the damages sought are recoverable.&nbsp; Plaintiff on amendment must also identify a “first” and “second” cause of action, rather than two “first” causes of action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Demurrer on all other grounds is OVERRULED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants Glendale Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Health Glendale and Adventist Health Foundation’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint is MOOT in light of the sustaining of the demurrer with leave to amend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ten days leave to amend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are ordered to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5 before any further demurrer or motion to strike may be filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp;
