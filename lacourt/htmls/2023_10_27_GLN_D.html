The complaint also alleges that defendant failed to follow fair claim settlement regulations, and other standards of conduct with regard to fair handling of claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges that plaintiff has a custom and practice of discriminating against its own insureds who are of Armenian and/or Middle Eastern descent, which violates the unfair competition law, and seeks injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from committing further unfair practices.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On June 30, 2023, the court heard an unopposed motion to compel third party witness Edgar Madatyan to appear and testify at deposition and to produce documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;The motion was granted.&nbsp; The court’s minute order states:</span></div><div>“Third party Edgar Madatyan is ordered to appear and give testimony at a deposition to be conducted on a mutually agreeable date and time, at the law offices of defendants’ counsel, to be completed before July 28, 2023.

Welch (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1084, in which the court of appeal reviews the case law on this subject and concludes that in a case like the one presented here, with a boundary border dispute between neighbors, the easement holder cannot prevent the title holder from using his property:</div><div>“From the foregoing cases, we discern the rule that&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>an exclusive prescriptive easement, ‘which as a practical matter completely prohibits the true owner from using his land’ will not be granted in a case (like this) involving a garden-variety residential boundary encroachment.”</span></div><div>Harrison, at 1093, quotation, footnote omitted.</div><div>The court of appeal in Harrison further observed that an encroaching substantial structure, “just as much as any encroaching fenced-in landscaping, ‘as a practical matter completely prohibits the true owner from using his land.’”&nbsp; &nbsp;Harrison, at 1093, quoting Silacci v. Abramson (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 558, 564.&nbsp; &nbsp;This ruling suggests that here the fence most certainly, and likely the landscaping on plaintiff’s side of the border which defendant also evidently seeks to protect, would be subject to this limitation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also relies on Silacci v. Abramson (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 558, 564, relied upon and quoted in Harrison, in which the court of appeal reversed a trial court judgment finding on a complaint for declaratory relief brought by property owners against their neighbors that the trial court had erred in finding that defendants had established an exclusive prescriptive easement for an enclosed yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal found it appropriate, given the undisputed facts concerning the exclusive nature of the easement, to resolve the case as a matter of law involving the legal concepts relating to rights in the land of another.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal concluded:</div><div>“The notion of an exclusive prescriptive easement, which as a practical matter completely prohibits the true owner from using his land, has no application to a simple backyard dispute like this one. An easement, after all, is merely the right to use the land of another for a specific purpose—most often, the right to cross the land of another. An easement acquired by prescription is one acquired by adverse use for a certain period. An easement, however, is not an ownership interest, and certainly does not amount to a fee simple estate. To permit Abramson to acquire possession of Silacci's land, and to call the acquisition an exclusive prescriptive easement, perverts the classical distinction in real property law between ownership and use. The trial court's order here amounted to giving Silacci's land completely, without reservation, to Abramson. This the court did, using the term “exclusive prescriptive easement,” an unusual doctrine which does not apply.”</div><div>Silacci, at 564.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, any equitable easement claimed by defendant in connection with the construction and placement of the current fence, in this simple backyard dispute, would completely prevent plaintiff from using what is conceded as plaintiff’s own land, awarding an exclusive easement, and cannot be recognized in this action to the extent it would be exclusive.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a matter of law, defendant has failed to raise triable issues of material fact on the declaration sought by this motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant has accordingly failed to raise triable issues of material fact with respect to a declaration concerning 1) the proper designation of the property line, and 2) that the wall as it is currently constructed, unquestionably on plaintiff’s land, can be properly ordered removed pursuant to such a declaration and injunctive relief.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court declares that the proper designation of the property line is that set forth in the Corner Record, Document Number 1917, prepared on 09/30/2013, and examined and signed by the Deputy County Surveyor on October 16, 2013, as set forth at page 2].&nbsp; &nbsp;The court also declares that the current fence, located on plaintiff’s property pursuant to the survey and the acknowledgement of the parties, is subject to removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The court in making this declaration does not foreclose defendant from pursuing arguments concerning an equitable easement in connection with any placement of a new border wall between the parties to be determined in connection with the remaining causes of action in both the complaint and cross-complaint.&nbsp; The court makes no orders concerning the replacement of the wall between the properties, or its appropriate placement pending resolution of the factual issues remaining on that issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-Complaint&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff briefly argues at the end of the motion that Lee’s cross-complaint, which seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, will be subsumed by the court’s ruling on plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and must be dismissed with prejudice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The notice of motion, which seeks that the cross-complaint be dismissed on this ground, does not list this as an issue to be resolved by summary adjudication or judgment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A court may not summarily adjudicate claims or defenses unless requested in the notice of motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Homestead Savings v.

(9th Cir. 2013) 705 F.3d 1122, which suggests that the appropriate analysis here would conclude that in a case such as this one, where there is no mention of or reliance on the Sale Contract to support the statutory claims based on the manufacturer’s responsibility under separate warranty obligations relating to defects in the vehicle, the requisite intertwining, and equity are not present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The Ninth Circuit in Kramer observed:</span></div><div>“Looking to California contract law, the correct analysis is whether Plaintiffs would have a claim independent of the existence of the Purchase Agreement (equitable estoppel applies “when the signatory must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory,” Goldman, 173 Cal.App.4th at 222, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 534(emphasis added), or “when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations,” Jones, 195 Cal.App.4th at 20, 125 Cal.Rptr.3d 522 (emphasis added)), not whether the court must look to the Purchase Agreement to ascertain the requested relief. The emphasis of the case law is unmistakably on the claim itself, not the relief. Despite Toyota's focus on Plaintiffs' relief, Toyota offers no cases to support Toyota's proposed application.</div><div><br></div><div>Here, Plaintiffs' claims are premised on California consumer law, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and breach of contract. In order for Toyota's equitable estoppel argument to succeed, Plaintiffs' claims themselves must intimately rely on the existence of the Purchase Agreements, not merely reference them. Toyota is correct that Plaintiffs' claims presume a transaction involving a purchase of a Class Vehicle. The claims do not, however, rely upon the existence of a Purchase Agreement. For illustration, a consumer who purchased a vehicle with cash instead of credit would still state a claim for which relief could be granted, absent a Purchase Agreement. In this regard, the facts resemble the facts of Goldman and Mundi, in which Plaintiffs' claims arose independently of the terms of the agreements containing arbitration provisions. Moreover, we note that Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint never actually references the Purchase Agreement, either in the prayer for relief or otherwise.</div><div>Kramer, at 1131-1132, italics in original.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Similarly, in this case, plaintiffs’ claims are not rooted in the Sale Contract, there is no reliance on any contract terms from the Sale Contract in the claims against defendant, and all of plaintiff’s claims would be the same had plaintiffs not financed the purchase of the vehicle but obtained the vehicle in some other manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Overall, considering the underlying basis of the equitable indemnity doctrine, as emphasized in Metalclad, above, upon which defendants rely, this does not appear to be a case where plaintiffs’ own conduct renders assertion of plaintiffs’ rights contrary to equity, that is where plaintiffs are seeking enforcement of other provisions of the same contract that benefit plaintiffs.&nbsp; See Metalclad, quoted above, at 1713.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs here are not seeking to invoke the duties and obligations of any defendant under the Sale Contract while simultaneously seeking to avoid the arbitration provision of that Sale Contract.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, although not cited in the moving papers, a recent published California court of appeal case, Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App. 5th 1324 (Ford Warranty) addressed this issue and distinguished Felisilda and is relied upon by plaintiffs in the opposition.&nbsp; The case is referred to in the opposition as the “Ochoa” case.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although not mentioned in the opposition, on July 19, 2023, the California Supreme Court granted a petition for review of the Ford Warranty case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Supreme Court opinion states:</div><div>“The issue to be briefed and argued is limited to the following: Do manufacturers' express or implied warranties that accompany a vehicle at the time of sale constitute obligations arising from the sale contract, permitting manufacturers to enforce an arbitration agreement in the contract pursuant to equitable estoppel?</div><div><br></div><div>Pending review, the opinion of the Court of Appeal, which is currently published at 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 306 Cal.Rptr.3d 611, may be cited, not only for its persuasive value, but also for the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a conflict in authority that would in turn allow trial courts to exercise discretion under Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v.

Rather, we read it as a further delineation of the subject matter of claims the purchasers and dealers agreed to arbitrate. They agreed to arbitrate disputes “between” themselves—“you and us”—arising out of or relating to “relationship[s],” including “relationship[s] with third parties who [did] not sign th[e] [sale] contract[s],” resulting from the “purchase, or condition of th[e] vehicle, [or] th[e] [sale] contract.”</div><div><br></div><div>Purchasers, like plaintiff Mathew Davidson-Codjoe, whose sale contract we described above, can elect to buy insurance, theft protection, extended warranties and the like from third parties, and they can finance their transactions with those third parties under the sale contracts. The “third party” language in the arbitration clause means that if a purchaser asserts a claim against the dealer (or its employees, agents, successors or assigns) that relates to one of these third-party transactions, the dealer can elect to arbitrate that claim. It says nothing of binding the purchaser to arbitrate with the universe of unnamed third parties.”</div><div>Ford Warranty, at 1334-1335.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The Ford Warranty court also found that plaintiffs’ claims were not founded in the sale contracts, as:</span></div><div>&nbsp;“no plaintiffs alleged violations of the sale contracts’ express terms.&nbsp; Rather, plaintiffs’ claims are based on FMC’s statutory obligations to reimburse consumers or replace their vehicles when unable to repair in accordance with its warranty.

We conclude Ford cannot enforce the arbitration provision in the sales contract because the Montemayors’ claims against Ford are founded on Ford's express warranty for the vehicle, not any obligation imposed on Ford by the sales contract, and thus, the Montemayors’ claims are not inextricably intertwined with any obligations under the sales contract.

KPMG, LLP, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at pp. 229-230, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 534.) They are not. As discussed, the Montemayors allege as part of each cause of action against Ford at issue on appeal that Ford's obligations arose out of its express written warranty, not the sales contract. As the Ford Warranty court explained with respect to similar allegations, “[P]laintiffs’ claims are based on [Ford's] statutory obligations to reimburse consumers or replace their vehicles when unable to repair in accordance with its warranty.... Not one of the plaintiffs sued on any express contractual language in the sale contracts.” (Ford Warranty, at p. 1335, 306 Cal.Rptr.3d 611.) Moreover, the “sale contracts include no warranty, nor any assurance regarding the quality of the vehicle sold, nor any promise of repairs or other remedies in the event problems arise. To the contrary, the sale contracts disclaim any warranty on the part of the dealers, while acknowledging no effect on ‘any warranties covering the vehicle that the vehicle manufacturer may provide.’ ” (Ibid.) “In short, the substantive terms of the sale contracts relate to sale and financing and nothing more.” (Ibid.)</div><div><br></div><div>Ford contends the Montemayors’ claims are inextricably intertwined with the sales contract because the claims concern the condition of the vehicle sold by AutoNation, and the arbitration agreement specifically applies to the purchase and “condition of this vehicle.” But this argument conflates the concept of “but for” causation with a determination whether the Montemayors’ claims are founded on obligations imposed on Ford under the sales contract. To be sure, the Montemayors would not have sued Ford for the defective condition of the vehicle but for the sale of the vehicle by AutoNation pursuant to the sales contract. And Ford provided an express warranty to the Montemayors as a result of the sale.

A, p. 1].&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that by limiting the parties who could enforce the arbitration clause to plaintiffs and/or Norm Reeves Honda Superstore, the arbitration provision demonstrates an intent not to benefit defendant, or anyone else falling outside the Sale Contract’s definitions of “you” and “we.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant appears to attempt to make a factual showing that defendant BMW NA was an intended beneficiary as an “assignee” of the dealership, indicating in the Grener declaration that BMW Bank, the assignee of the dealership, is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW FS.&nbsp; [Grener Decl., paras. 1, 2].&nbsp; Grener than indicates that defendant BMW NA and BMW FS are affiliates of each other, but fails to show how BMW Bank would be an affiliate of BMW NA.&nbsp; The assignee would step into the shoes of the dealership, which is not named in this lawsuit, and there is no clear showing that the assignee and defendant here are in such a relationship that their separate corporate existence should not be recognized.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it does not appear that permitting defendant manufacturer to enforce the clause would be consistent with the objectives of the contract, and not violate the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.&nbsp; The objective of the Sale Contract here was to finance plaintiffs’ vehicle purchase, and the objective of the arbitration clause specifically was to enable, “you” and “us,” plaintiffs and/or Pacific BMW, to choose to arbitrate disputes.&nbsp; Allowing defendant to take advantage of the arbitration provision would not effectuate either of these objectives.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In sum, the purchase of the vehicle from an entirely separate party, when the contractual language expressly limits those who can choose to arbitrate to the seller and the buyer, does not satisfy the elements required to invoke third-party beneficiary status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent defendant appears to rely on the Sale Contract provision which limits arbitrable disputes to those “between you and us or our employees, agents, successor or assigns,” as noted above, defendant has not submitted any clear argument or evidence establishing how defendant has any of these relationships to the dealership.&nbsp; Specifically, there appears to be no coherent argument or evidence to support a claim that because the various BMW entities were purportedly affiliated with one another, the corporate separateness of each imposed by law should be disregarded.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs again cite to Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC (USDC., 9th Cir. 2022) 23 F.4th 942, discussed above, in which the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s granting of a manufacturer’s motion to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision very similar to the form contract provision at issue here.&nbsp; With respect to the argument that the manufacturer in that case was an intended third-party beneficiary, the Ninth Circuit found that defendant manufacturer had failed to establish any of the required elements to demonstrate it was a third-party beneficiary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Ngo, the complaint named only the manufacturer BMW as a defendant, which was not a signatory to the purchase agreement plaintiff had entered into with the dealership because, as in this case, the dealership financed plaintiff’s purchase of the vehicle.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Ninth Circuit concluded that the manufacturer had failed to establish in that case that it was a third party which in fact benefitted from the contract, setting forth the “you” and “we” designations in that case from the same form used here, and noting that in that case, the arbitration provision through this language expressly provided that only three parties, plaintiff, the dealership, and, in that case, as here, the assignee, could compel arbitration, and that arbitrable disputes were limited to the dealership’s employees, agents, successors, or assigns, which did not include BMW.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ninth Circuit reasoned:</span></div><div>“That BMW could, at some point down the line, receive some benefit if the arbitration clause were read to extend to the manufacturer is of no moment: incidental or secondary benefit is not sufficient. See Lucas, 56 Cal. 2d at 590, 15 Cal.Rptr. 821, 364 P.2d 685. The clause is pellucid that only three parties may compel arbitration, none of which is BMW. Language limiting the right to compel arbitration to a specific buyer and a specific dealership (and its assignees) means that extraneous third parties may not compel arbitration. See Kramer v. Toyota Motor Corp., 705 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2013) (finding similar language to evince the buyer's intent to arbitrate with the expressly named parties and no one else); see also Safley v.

Any benefit that BMW might receive from the clause is peripheral and indirect because it is predicated on the decisions of others to arbitrate. BMW therefore fails to meet the first prong of the Goonewardene test.”</div><div>Ngo, at 947.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, it is also clear that only four parties can elect arbitration, the buyer, the co-buyer, the seller dealership, and its assignee, so that any benefit defendant would receive from the arbitration provision would be indirect as predicated on the decisions of others to arbitrate.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Ninth Circuit in Ngo also found that BMW had failed to establish that the contracting parties had the “motivating purpose” of providing a benefit to the manufacturer such as had been recognized in case law in cases involving agreements to draft wills or manage trusts or mutual funds, “arrangements inherently formed with third parties in mind.”&nbsp; The court reasoned that, in contrast:</span></div><div>“the vehicle purchase agreement in question was drafted with the primary purpose of securing benefits for the contracting parties themselves. In such an agreement, the purchaser seeks to buy a car, and the dealership and assignees seek to profit by selling and financing the car. Third parties are not purposeful beneficiaries of such an undertaking.</div><div><br></div><div>The text of the arbitration clause supports this conclusion. It provides that claims and disputes “which arise[ ] out of or relate[ ] to your credit application, purchase or condition of this Vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) ... shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration.” (emphasis added). Though the language allows for arbitration of certain claims concerning third parties, it still gives only Ngo, the dealership, and the assignee the power to compel arbitration. Nothing in the clause or, for that matter, in the purchase agreement reflects any intention to benefit BMW by allowing it to take advantage of the arbitration provision.”</div><div>&nbsp;Ngo, at 947-948, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the Sale Contract is similarly an arrangement pursuant to which plaintiffs as the buyer and co-buyer sought to purchase and finance a car, and the dealership sought to profit by selling and financing the car.&nbsp; The arbitration provision itself similarly gives only the buyers and the seller dealership or its assignees the power to compel arbitration, not the manufacturer, and defendant has pointed to no other language or circumstances to distinguish this case from the Ngo analysis, which, as discussed above, and again below, was accepted by the Second District in Ford Warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The Ninth Circuit in Ngo also interpreted the contractual language to establish that the third element had not been met, that is, that permitting the third party to enforce the contract must be consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties, concluding:</div><div>“Nothing in the contract here evinces any intention that the arbitration clause should apply to BMW. The arbitration clause's enforcement provisions are limited to the dealership, the assignee, and Ngo. The compelling inference from this arrangement is that the parties knew how to give enforcement powers to non-signatories when they wished to do so but gave none to BMW.”</div><div>Ngo, at 948, emphasis added.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition also points out that the Second District in Ford Warranty conducted a similar analysis, relying heavily on the reasoning in Ngo, finding that:</span></div><div>“We agree with Ngo that the sale contracts reflect no intention to benefit a vehicle manufacturer under Goonewardene. First, nothing in the sale contracts or their arbitration provision offers any direct “benefit” to FMC (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830, 243 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 434 P.3d 124). FMC's claim that it “would benefit from utilizing arbitration as an efficient means of dispute resolution” (italics added) if treated as a third party beneficiary begs the question: does the provision directly benefit FMC? The answer is patently “no.” Its direct benefits are expressly limited to those persons who might rely on it to avoid proceeding in court—the purchaser, the dealer, and the dealer's employees, agents, successors or assigns. FMC is none of these.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, there is no indication that a benefit to FMC was the signatories’ “motivating purpose” (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830, 243 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 434 P.3d 124) in contracting for the sale and purchase of a Ford vehicle. The manifest intent of the parties was to buy, sell and finance a car, and to allow either the purchaser or the dealer to compel arbitration of the specified categories of disputes between them, or between the purchaser and any of the dealer's “employees, agents, successors or assigns.” (See Martinez v. BaronHR, Inc. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 962, 967, 265 Cal.Rptr.3d 523 [intent of arbitration agreement ascertained solely from words of written agreement, if possible; language controls if clear and explicit].)</div><div><br></div><div>Any interest FMC may have in where its dealers and consumers choose to resolve their disputes is remote and certainly not articulated in FMC's briefing. If the signatories had intended to benefit FMC, such a purpose would have been easy to articulate. They could have simply named FMC—directly or by class as the vehicle's manufacturer—as a person entitled to compel arbitration. But they did not. What they said was that “EITHER YOU OR WE”—the purchaser or the dealer—“MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US DECIDED BY ARBITRATION,” and reiterated that arbitrable disputes “shall, at your or our”—the purchaser's or the dealer's—“election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration ....” (Italics added.)….</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, allowing FMC to enforce the arbitration provision as a third party beneficiary would be inconsistent with the “reasonable expectations of the contracting parties” (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830, 243 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 434 P.3d 124) where they twice specifically vested the right of enforcement in the purchaser and the dealer only.”</div><div>Ford Warranty, at 1338-1338, emphasis, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court notes that the issue framed by the California Supreme Court to be reviewed from Ford Warranty was limited to the equitable estoppel question, and it does not appear that the Court intends to review the conclusion of the Second District in Ford Warranty that a third party beneficiary analysis failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs again also rely on Montemayor, in which the Second District, in connection with the third-party beneficiary analysis, followed much of the reasoning in Ngo and Ford Warranty, and ultimately concluded:</div><div>“[“[T]he vehicle purchase agreement in question was drafted with the primary purpose of securing benefits for the contracting parties themselves. In such an agreement, the purchaser seeks to buy a car, and the dealership and assignees seek to profit by selling and financing the car. Third parties are not purposeful beneficiaries of such an undertaking.”].)</div><div><br></div><div>The Montemayors and AutoNation agreed in the sales contract on terms for the financing and purchase of the vehicle from AutoNation, and they agreed to arbitrate disputes between them arising out of the credit application, purchase, or condition of the purchased vehicle. In no way was the sales contract “made expressly for the benefit of a third person.” (Civ. Code, § 1559.)”</div><div>Montemayor, at 974, quoting Ngo, at 947.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This appears sound, and this court again finds the analysis in Ford Warranty and Montemayor, and the other cited authorities in the opposition distinguishing Felisidas and interpreting the Sale Contract language, well-reasoned and appropriate, and will follow the court of appeal precedent set forth in Ford Warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion will accordingly be denied with respect to the argument that defendant is a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As defendant has failed to establish it is entitled as a non-signatory to enforce the arbitration provision on either of the grounds defendant relies on, equitable estoppel or third-party beneficiary, the motion will be denied.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">			</span></div><div>RULING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Motion to Compel Arbitration is DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs’ Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Aaron Grener:</div><div>Objections Nos. 1 and 3:</div><div>While the Court finds the objection would ordinarily justify disregarding the Sale Contract, the Court will nevertheless consider the Sale Contract submitted, although without proper authentication, based on the relaxed authentication standard applied under case law, and the waiver implied by the reliance by plaintiffs in their opposition papers on the terms of the submitted Sale Contract.&nbsp;</div><div>Remaining Objections are OVERRULED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court notes it has not considered the material attached to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Lodging as Exhibits 2, 3 and 4, in effect, any rulings in other unrelated Superior Court cases.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 22GDCV01112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  October 27, 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div><br></div><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>6<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>10/27/2023<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Case No: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>22 GDCV01112<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; February 18, 2025&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Sanchez v.

The complaint alleges that when plaintiff arrived at the Hospital, her vital signs showed she was hypersensitive and tachycardic.&nbsp; While in the emergency room, when asked her name, plaintiff identified several names, which were not her correct name, and plaintiff was also unable to provide a valid social security number.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that although attempts were made to take plaintiff’s blood and urine, the attempts were not successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that she was eventually seen by defendant Alec Bradleigh Freling, M.D., who diagnosed plaintiff with, among other conditions, psychosis due to methamphetamine use, schizoaffective disorder, and PCP use, and concluded that plaintiff appeared in a psychotic state.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that she was given a dose of haloperidol, a medication used to treat psychotic patients, and an injection of lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medication.&nbsp; Plaintiff repeatedly requested that the psychiatrist evaluate her, and a request was entered by Dr. Freling for plaintiff to be seen by a psychiatrist.&nbsp; Dr. Freling later re-evaluated plaintiff and noted that she would not provide further information to him because he was a male and had requested to speak with a female behavioral health individual, so that Dr. Freling noted that a female, Tracy, previously had attempted an evaluation during which plaintiff was uncooperative, and that Tracy would attempt to evaluate plaintiff again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that plaintiff engaged in behavior such as telling the nursing staff she had been poisoned and requesting an ultrasound because she believed there were drugs inside her uterus, crying loudly, screaming, pulling the curtains on other patient’s beds and screaming and yelling.&nbsp; Plaintiff was asked to write down her social security number, but ultimately said she could not remember it.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that later that evening Dr. Freling noted that Tracy had evaluated plaintiff and that plaintiff had been cleared by the on-call psychiatrist, although there is no record plaintiff was seen or evaluated by a psychiatrist at any time during her presentation.&nbsp; It is alleged that Dr. Freling stated plaintiff was alert and oriented and had normal mood and affect, but there was no physical examination performed at that time to support such a conclusion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Freling then indicated that plaintiff would be discharged, and plaintiff requested of the nursing staff that she see someone else, but her request was denied, and she was told to call someone for a ride.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that after some further confusion, plaintiff ultimately called a friend to pick her up, and the nurses escorted plaintiff out of the hospital, essentially throwing her out of the facility, three hours after arriving, when plaintiff had never been seen or evaluated by a psychiatrist and had never had blood or urine work done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that after many instances of improper behavior in the car and once plaintiff arrived at the friend’s house, plaintiff eventually walked to an overpass above the 15 freeway in Barstow and jumped off the overpass in an attempt to kill herself, as a result of which she suffered serious injuries.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff brings this motion under CCP section 425.13 for permission to allege punitive damages against health care providers.&nbsp; CCP section 425.13 provides, in pertinent part:&nbsp;</div><div>“(a) In any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider, no claim for punitive damages shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.&nbsp; The court may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to Section 3294 of the Civil Code.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Accordingly, it is plaintiff’s burden to satisfy a two-prong test.&nbsp; It must “state” and “substantiate” a legitimate, triable claim by showing such evidence to the court at the pleading stage as would allow plaintiff to get to a jury.&nbsp; College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 709.&nbsp; &nbsp;The evidence must be competent admissible evidence. Id.&nbsp; Plaintiff’s evidence is to be considered first, with defendant’s evidence considered to fill in any gaps left by that evidence. Id.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Civil Code § 3294 authorizes recovery of punitive damages on the basis of findings “that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”&nbsp; “Oppression” is defined to mean “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”&nbsp; “Malice” is defined to include “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Civil Code § 3294 (c)(1) and (2).&nbsp; In College Hospital, “despicable” was defined as a powerful term that refers to circumstances that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.”&nbsp; College Hospital, 8 Cal.4th at 725.</div><div><br></div><div>The cases considering CCP §425.13 have mostly established the standard to be applied, without actually applying it to the applicable facts.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Looney v. Superior Court, (1993) 16 Cal. App.4th 521, for example, the court of appeal established a clear and convincing evidentiary standard and then sent the case back down to the trial court for an evaluation under that standard.&nbsp; Two cases relied upon by plaintiff did apply the standard to the facts before it. In College Hospital, 8 Cal.4th 704, the California Supreme Court reversed a ruling permitting a plaintiff to plead punitive damages against a hospital where the plaintiff alleged, she was traumatized when her affair with a hospital employee ended.&nbsp; Despite her presentation of evidence that the affair was known about, and encouraged by hospital staff, the Court found that, since the hospital employee was acting outside the scope of his employment, the punitive damages could not be recovered, and therefore not pled, against the hospital.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In Aquino v. Superior Court, (1993)21 Cal.App.4th 827, a family brought an action against three doctors in the treatment and care of their daughter after a car accident.&nbsp; The cause of action giving rise to punitives in that case was intentional infliction of emotional distress on the family, which allegedly occurred when the doctors did not keep the family informed of the daughter’s condition, removed life support, made misrepresentations about her time of death and permitted her body to be removed to the coroner’s without last rites. The court analyzed plaintiff’s evidence and concluded that denial of their motion to amend to allege punitive damages against the doctors was appropriate.&nbsp; The court of appeal made several findings in this matter.&nbsp; As to one doctor, it concluded that removal of the machine in question was a treatment method subject to the application of medical judgment, and with no showing with respect to that medical judgment, the punitive damages could not be pled.&nbsp; &nbsp;As to another doctor, the court of appeal held that plaintiffs had failed to make out a prima facie showing because the showing did not establish that the doctor concealed knowledge or “that the exact sequence of events showed fraud or disregard of plaintiffs’ rights.”&nbsp; Aquino, 21 Cal.App.4th at 860.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff here argues that punitive damages are properly sought here, based on malice and oppression, because plaintiff has evidence, which, if credited by the trier of fact, would establish a conscious disregard of the rights and safety of plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff submits a declaration from a board-certified psychiatrist, Brian Jacks, M.D., which shows that the witness has completed the appropriate education and training and experience to offer expert testimony concerning the care and treatment provided to plaintiff by the health care professionals in this matter.&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., paras. 2, 4-6].&nbsp; Dr. Jacks indicates he has reviewed plaintiff’s medical records from Glendale Adventist Medical Center and the Complaint in this matter.&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., para. 7].&nbsp; &nbsp;He sets forth in detail his understanding of the facts in this matter.&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., paras 9-21].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Dr. Jacks indicates that it is his opinion that “the care and treatment provided to Ms. Black by Defendants was not only negligent but fell grossly and egregiously below the applicable standard of care for both a behavioral health therapist as well as an emergency room doctor evaluating a psychiatrically altered patient.”&nbsp; [Jack’s Decl., para. 22].&nbsp; Dr. Jacks explains that Ms. Black was exhibiting delusional behaviors, that the hospital staff did not take or was unable to determine a proper history, failed to take blood samples or conduct a urinalysis, and failed to reach a final diagnosis other than “altered mental status,” which he opines, “is absolutely unconscionable in a patient such as Ms. Black given her markedly abnormal presentation.”&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., paras. 23, 24].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Dr. Jacks also explains how releasing a patient under the circumstances was “totally unreasonable,” as was the failure to institute an involuntary psychiatric hold, as “Ms. Black’s behavior in the hospital was clearly an indication that she would need active supervision and to be held in hospital to prevent further harm to herself or others.”&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., paras. 25-27].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Jacks concludes:</div><div>“In conclusion, the care rendered to Ms. Black by Defendants on the evening of October 13, 2022 and early morning of October 14, 2022, was categorically and unequivocally below the standard of care, and even more so, represented a callus and willful and reckless disregard for her health and safety.”</div><div>[Jacks Decl., para. 29].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>His opinions are made “to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.”&nbsp; [Jacks Decl., para. 30].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also submits evidence from plaintiff’s attorney indicating the attorney previously litigated a similar claim against the same hospital defendant in this action, which the attorney indicates strongly suggests that the hospital has learned nothing from the previous experience in prematurely discharging a patient with similar psychiatric complaints, leading to that patient jumping off a parking structure and rendering him quadriplegic.&nbsp; [Kramer Decl., para. 3].</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in opposition argue that the motion is not supported by admissible evidence.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the expert evidently relied on the complaint in this action for any facts beyond those contained in the hospital medical records, which is inappropriate.&nbsp; The Second District in Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center v. Superior Court (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 828, expressly held, “The plaintiff may not rely on allegations of its own pleadings, even if verified, to satisfy the required evidentiary showing.”&nbsp; &nbsp; Pomona Valley, at 836.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Second District in Pomona Valley also observed:</div><div>““[S]ubstantiation of a proposed punitive damages claim occurs only where the factual recitals are made under penalty of perjury and set forth competent admissible evidence within the personal knowledge of the declarant. (See §§ 437c, subds. (b) &amp; (d), 2015.5.) Consistent with the legislative intent to protect health care defendants from the drastic effects of unwarranted punitive damage claims, the entire package of materials submitted in support of the section 425.13[, subdivision] (a) motion should be carefully reviewed to ensure that a genuine contestable claim is indeed proposed.” (College Hospital, supra, at pp. 719–720, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 898, 882 P.2d 894, fn. omitted.)”</div><div>Pomona Valley, at 836-837.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This argument suggests that the declaration here improperly relies on medical records which are not in fact submitted with the motion for the court’s review, authenticated or established to include material which would qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; This showing is insufficient to meet plaintiff’s substantial burden here.&nbsp; The motion accordingly is denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, the defendant hospital argues that plaintiff has failed to submit evidence to establish ratification sufficient to allege punitive damages against the hospital.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Civil Code § 3294(b) requires that a plaintiff seeking punitive damages against an employer must show such wrongful conduct by managing personnel of the employer:</div><div>“(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff has made no attempt to establish advance knowledge and conscious disregard or ratification on the part of managing personnel, and the motion as to the hospital is denied on this additional ground.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to Dr. Freling, who is an emergency medicine physician, the Dr. Freling opposition argues that the claims brought against him are solely related to his role as an emergency medicine physician, so that the only admissible medical testimony that can be offered regarding the services he provided must be made by a witness with professional experience in that field.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant relies on Health and Safety Code section 1799.110, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(c) In any action for damages involving a claim of negligence against a physician and surgeon providing emergency medical coverage for a general acute care hospital emergency department, the court shall admit expert medical testimony only from physicians and surgeons who have had substantial professional experience within the last five years while assigned to provide emergency medical coverage in a general acute care hospital emergency department. For purposes of this section, "substantial professional experience" shall be determined by the custom and practice of the manner in which emergency medical coverage is provided in general acute care hospital emergency departments in the same or similar localities where the alleged negligence occurred.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There is no indication that Dr. Jacks has had any professional experience within the last five years while assigned to provide emergency medical coverage in a general acute care hospital emergency department.&nbsp; The CV reflects no such experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, the court cannot consider Dr. Jacks’ medical testimony as against Dr. Freling.

&nbsp;This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party.&nbsp;

The first cause of action for premises liability alleges, primarily through form complaint standard language, that defendant “negligently owned, maintained, managed and operated the described premises,” and that plaintiff was injured when a metal stand fell and slammed onto plaintiff’s head.&nbsp; [Complaint, Prem. L-1 and Prem L-2].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The second cause of action for general negligence includes allegations that defendants, presumably including the Doe defendants, who “owns/leases/occupies/controls property” owe various negligence duties including to use reasonable care, to discover unsafe conditions and warn of them, and to repair or replace conditions that could be reasonably expected to cause harm.&nbsp; These allegations suggest that the general negligence claim seeks to impose liability on moving defendant for the possible negligence of others.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Complaint, para. GN-1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition argues that defendant has acknowledged that the causes of action are not identical.&nbsp; Plaintiff also argues that the negligence cause of action would cover theories of liability against tortfeasors, such as outside contractors, vendors, residents, or visitors that negligently cause harm but do not own or control the property, and that moving defendant may be responsible for the wrongful acts of its agents.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that it is unclear at this point who placed the unhinged metal stand, whether it was an employee of the Americana, or a contractor, security guard, or someone else, and whether the metal stand was properly placed, altered, tampered with, or broken, and who had control over it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The causes of action are not duplicative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Even if the negligence cause of action were strictly duplicative, under the liberal rules of pleading parties are permitted to plead duplicative, alternative, or even inconsistent causes of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Jackson v.

(HR General Construction) alleges that in December of 2021 plaintiff entered into a written contract with defendants Scott Sakamoto and Jamie Sakamoto, and that defendants breached the agreement by failing to pay the final $5,550 due on the contract and brought defendant Oswaldo Diaz in as the countertop contractor, and did not allow plaintiff to hang the painted, ready to hang doors.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges that the Sakamoto defendants filed a false claim under oath against plaintiff’s bond company, claiming plaintiff was responsible for a granite countertop that did not fit, and was not, color coordinated, when the truth was that the Sakamoto’s contracted directly with defendant Diaz for the counter tops.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that the cabinet maker defendant Custom Furniture Design misaligned the cabinets by a 2” offset above the sink, and that defendant Diaz mis-measured the sink and counter area, resulting in a first, expensive granite counter which did not fit, and a second granite countertop had to be purchased.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendants the Sakamotos filed a false claim knowing that plaintiff HR General Construction had no liability for the counter problems.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges cause of action for negligence against defendants Diaz and Custom Furniture Design.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants Scott Sakamoto and Jamie Sakamoto have filed a Cross-complaint against plaintiff HR General Construction as cross-defendant, as well as against HR General Construction’s Principal, Rafael Herrera, and the bonding company Hudson Insurance Company.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendant HR General Construction breached the written and oral contracts for the construction project by causing problems with the construction which caused delay, failing to complete construction on several items, performing substandard work, and ultimately abandoning the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is also alleged that after HR General Construction stopped work on the project, cross-complainants filed complaints with the Contractor’s State License Board and the Better Business Bureau, and in January of 2023 were advised by the CSLB representatives that they could file a claim against HR General Constructions’ surety bond under Business &amp; Professions Code section 7107.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that cross-complainants became aware that HR General Construction’s contractor’s licensed had expired in November of 2022, and, fearful that the license bond was the only avenue to recover damages, cross-complainants submitted a claim on HR General Construction’s license bond to cross-defendant Hudson Insurance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for breach of written contract, breach of oral contract, money had and received, and money due on contractor’s license bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendants Scott Sakamoto and Jamie Sakamoto seek an order striking the second cause of action of plaintiff’s complaint, as well as portions of the first cause of action and the claim for punitive damages asserted in the complaint pursuant to CCP § 425.16, which provides:</div><div>“(a) The Legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.&nbsp;

First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the statute. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.””&nbsp;</div><div>Jarrow, at 733, quoting Equilon Enterprises v.

(2020)&nbsp; 56 Cal.App.5th 413, the court of appeal found that the trial court had properly granted an anti-SLAPP motion, finding specifically that the filing of a mechanic’s lien was a protected communication under CCP section 425.16 (e)(1), that is, a written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive or judicial proceeding, or under subdivision (e)(1), that is, a statement made, “in connection with an issue under consideration or review in such proceedings.”&nbsp; RGC Gaslamp, at 425.&nbsp; The court of appeal also observed that, “Statements made in preparation for litigation or in anticipation of bringing an action fall within these categories.”&nbsp; &nbsp;RGC Gaslamp, at 425; See also Wilton v. Mountain Wood Homeowners Assn.&nbsp; (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 565, 569-70 (finding publication of homeowners assessment liens, which may be foreclosed judicially or by private sale, is nevertheless subject to litigation privilege).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that similar to the lien cases, a demand for recovery on a contractor’s license bond made against a surety is also a creature of California legislation. Business &amp; Professions Code §7071.5 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“The contractor's bond required by this article shall be executed by an admitted surety in favor of the State of California, in a form acceptable to the registrar and filed with the registrar by the licensee or applicant. The contractor's bond shall be for the benefit of the following:</div><div>(a)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A homeowner contracting for home improvement upon the homeowner's personal family residence damaged as a result of a violation of this chapter by the licensee.”</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, in California, the CSLB requires that contractors have a contractor’s license bond on file with the CSLB in the amount of $25,000.&nbsp; Business &amp; Professions Code §7071.6.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The CSLB is an administrative agency of the State of California and a part of the California Department of Consumer Affairs. Business &amp; Professions Code, §7000.5(a) (“There is in the Department of Consumer Affairs, a Contractors State License Board…);&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Contractors' State License Board v. Superior Court (1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 557, the Second District noted that CSLB is</div><div>“an administrative agency of the state, charged by law with the duty of investigating the actions of any contractor within the state and of taking disciplinary action against any such contractor should its investigation disclose reason to believe that the contractor has committed any acts which, under the provisions of the statute, are made grounds for disciplinary action.”&nbsp;</div><div>Contractors’ State, at 560.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants rely on authority under which the Second District has held that a complaint made to the CSLB and any statements in connection with that complaint constitute part of an “official proceeding” for purposes of the litigation privilege set forth at Civil Code section 47 (b).&nbsp; Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 513, 517-18.&nbsp; While Rodas was determined on demurrer, and did not involve the anti-SLAPP statute, it appears to support a conclusion in this matter that communications to the CSLB would be similarly considered part of an official proceeding.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants submit evidence that they submitted a claim to the CSLB in anticipation of invoking an official proceeding with respect to plaintiff’s conduct and were advised by the CSLB of their right to pursue plaintiff’s license bond. [Sakamoto Decl., paras. 11, 14, Ex. D]. Defendants indicate that they pursued the demand against the bond to recover damages for the rules violations recognized by the CSLB, and with their claim provided Hudson Insurance with the CSLB complaint.&nbsp; [Sakamoto Decl. paras. 16-19, Exs. E, F].&nbsp; The investigation by the CSLB is evidently ongoing.&nbsp; [Sakamoto Decl., para. 20].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the demand on the license bond was a necessary action to recover on the bond under California law and statements made by defendants in the claim fall under the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute and constitute protected activity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no opposition served or filed here, so no legal argument why the communications to recover on the licensing bond would not constitute protected activity directed at recovering relief recognized appropriate in an official proceeding.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The pursuit of the bond could be construed as in the nature of pursuing the remedies provided by the state agency for violation of statutory duties, in the nature of communications undertaken to enforce a judgment.&nbsp; &nbsp;In O’Keefe v.

Robbins as a 50/50 partner in an advertising and branding agency, which came to be known as Bird Design, Inc. (Bird).&nbsp; &nbsp;By 1998, the company had become profitable enough that the parties decided to invest in commercial real estate, and created a new company for the new enterprise, Lucas King, LLC (Lucas King).&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she did not set up a separate Lucas King email accounts, but used her Bird email accounts for communications relating to either company.</span></div><div><br></div><div>In 2017, Bird was dissolved pursuant to a Dissolution Agreement, which provided that all Bird creative and infrastructural data (Shared Assets) were assigned to and jointly owned by plaintiff and defendant, to be managed and stored by defendant and made available to plaintiff upon request, with defendant to provide plaintiff with prior written notification of any planned change in status or location of the Shared Assets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In 2018, defendant began urging plaintiff to sell the property held by Lucas King, but plaintiff did not desire to sell, but spoke of a buy-out. The parties could not agree on a price, and on June 2, 2020, defendant and the another interested party filed a lawsuit against plaintiff and Lucas King in Los Angeles Superior Court, which is currently pending as Case No. 20 STCV20770.&nbsp; That lawsuit alleges that plaintiff De La Torre, as the sole manager of Lucas King, had abused her authority, looting the company for her own benefit, and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that on June 7, 2020, a couple of days after plaintiff was served with the Lucas King lawsuit, plaintiff suddenly lost access to her Bird email accounts.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that these were her primary email accounts, containing the vast majority of her communications with defendant relating to Lucas King, and contained all the emails plaintiff would need to counter plaintiff’s allegations in the Lucas King lawsuit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff assumed her loss of access was some kind of error, and immediately contacted Google, the host of the accounts, but was never able to regain access.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that without access to her emails, refuting the Lucas King lawsuit turned into a nightmare, as plaintiff was forced to spend extra time and attorney’s fees to litigate her defense while attempting to recreate evidence to show that defendant’s claims against her were unfounded.&nbsp; &nbsp;This resulted in plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment being denied when the court found triable issues regarding a certain transaction that was undetailed and unsubstantiated by other written records, records that likely existed in plaintiff’s emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In November of 2021, plaintiff received interrogatory responses in the Lucas King lawsuit which revealed for the first time that it was defendant Robbins who removed plaintiff’s access to her emails, and plaintiff realized that her long-time business partner had surreptitiously locked her out of her email accounts so she could not access the emails she would need to defend herself against his lawsuit.&nbsp; Plaintiff demanded that defendant return control of her email account, but defendant refused, and instead sent a purportedly complete copy of her email accounts, which plaintiff alleges is insufficient.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she will need access to her individual Bird email accounts as well as the overall administration account, to determine whether defendant deleted or altered emails critical to her defense.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that this conduct breached the Bird Dissolution Agreement, as well as the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and constitutes conversion of plaintiff’s email accounts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on August 18, 2023, defendant filed a Notice of Related Case, indicating that this case is related to LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, Fleming, et al. v. De La Torre, et al., an unlimited civil case pending in Department 40, which the Notice indicates involves the same parties and is based on the same or similar claims.&nbsp; On August 23, 2023, a Notice of Related Case was filed in the other case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This matter was originally heard on September 29, 2023.&nbsp; The matter was continued to this date, October 27, 2023, to permit the parties to seek and obtain a related case determination in the other matter, LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, pending in Department 40.&nbsp; The parties were ordered to seek a related case determination in the other matter, and file and serve a notice in this matter concerning the status of the related case determination in this matter in advance of the continued hearing date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The file shows that on October 10, 2023, plaintiff filed a Notice of Ruling Re: Related Case Determination, which indicates that on October 10, 2023, Department 40 heard an ex parte application for related case determination filed jointly by plaintiffs Harriet Fleming and Peter Robbins, and defendant Tabitha De la Torre.&nbsp; The court granted the ex parte application. The minute order indicates that “After full consideration of the evidence and the written and oral submissions of the parties, and with good cause appearing… the Court hereby…deems the cases NOT RELATED.”&nbsp; [Notice, Ex.

De La Torre, et al. LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, filed on June 2, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that in the discovery motion plaintiff sought terminating and monetary sanctions relating to her access to the e-mail accounts for the business formerly operated and jointly owned by plaintiff and defendant, and that after the other court entered its order to deny the discovery motion, plaintiff filed this action to seek the identical relief sought in the discovery motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant does not submit to the court the operative complaint in the other action for consideration by the court with respect to whether this action involves the same parties and any same cause of action.&nbsp; Defendant submits only a minute order on a motion for terminating sanctions and a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, and a declaration of counsel for Robbins in that action in support of the opposition to the motion for terminating sanctions.&nbsp; Without the operative pleading, the court does not have sufficient information to conclude that this action, or any part of it, is demurrable under CCP section 430.10 (c).</div><div><br></div><div>A review of the minute order shows that the dispute concerning the disclosure of the e-mails arose only well after the action in that case was filed, when discovery conducted after De La Torre experienced difficulty accessing her accounts finally revealed that access had been blocked by her litigation opponent, and De La Torre ultimately sought terminating sanctions based on abuse of the discovery process, arguing that the failure to provide De La Torre with access to her old Bird Gmail Account had provided plaintiffs in that action with an unfair litigation advantage and merited terminating sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court in the other action found that under the circumstances presented by the motion there were not sufficient grounds to grant terminating sanctions, limited to the evidence then before the court.&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, pp. 10-11].&nbsp; The court also stated, “To the extent that De La Torre is entitled to relief, e.g., access to the Gmail Account at issue, a terminating sanction motion is not the vehicle for such relief.”&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, Minute Order, p. 12].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This indication suggests that the proper vehicle for such relief could well be a separate lawsuit, which is what plaintiff has chosen to file here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers also appear to suggest that the court in the other action expressly denied De La Torre’s request for access to her Gmail Account, the same relief sought here.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court in fact denied a motion to compel further discovery responses providing De La Torre with login credentials to enter her Gmail Account, but denied the motion as untimely, filed one court day late.&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, Minute Order, p. 13].&nbsp; The matter was not determined on its merits, and the minute order expressly states, “This does not foreclose De La Torre’s ability to pursue other avenues of relief under the Code of Civil Procedure.”&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, Minute Order, p. 13].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This presentation is an insufficient showing to establish any of defendant’s vague arguments, including that this complaint, or any cause of action stated in it, is barred under CCP § 430.10 (c), that there is some aspect of res judicata which bars the current action, or that plaintiff is required to bring this action as a compulsory cross-complaint in the other action, when the minute order relied upon acknowledges that De La Torre was unaware for a significant period in the other litigation that her inability to access her accounts was due not to some technical difficulty but due&nbsp; to the deliberate conduct of plaintiff in that action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition does submit the original complaint and First Amended Complaint in the other action.&nbsp; [Plaintiff’s RFJN, Exs. A, B].&nbsp; A review of the pleadings suggests to the court that these pleadings were not submitted with the demurrer because they do not support the relief sought.&nbsp; The complaint alleges causes of action against defendant De La Torre related to her conduct characterized as abuse of her authority as managing member of the limited liability company for Conversion, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of the Operating Agreement, Accounting, and Dissolution of the Company. [Plaintiff’s RFJN, Ex. A].</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action for Conversion, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of the 1998 and 2016 Operating Agreements, Accounting, Dissolution of the Company and Declaratory Relief.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Plaintiff’s RFJN, Ex. B].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, this action alleges causes of action by De La Torre, against Robbins, related to his specific alleged conduct with respect to denying access to De La Torre’s Gmail Account and other documentation, for Breach of Contract, Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Conversion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also points out in opposition that not only are the causes of action, brought by and against different parties, not the same, but all parties are not the same, and the relief sought in each of the actions is distinct.&nbsp; As noted above, the other court’s determinations on a discovery motion were somewhat limited by the court itself, and not necessarily directed to the merits of anything in dispute in this matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This court is also mindful that the Notice filed in this action concerning the determination of Related Cases in the other matter represents, without objection or contradiction by defendant, that the other court, which has extensive experience with the other action, has observed that this action arises out of facts occurring after the filing of the first action, and alleges different wrongdoing.&nbsp; [See Notice, filed 10/10/2023].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; It is difficult to determine why defendant would believe that very limited orders in discovery matters in another matter would give rise to demurrer either under CCP § 430.10 (c), res judicata, or an argument that the current action is a compulsory cross-claim, particular when this action had not yet arisen, and the facts giving rise to the distinct damages claimed in this action had been actively concealed from De La Torre at and beyond the time the previous action was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No grounds have been established to sustain a demurrer to the complaint in this action, and the demurrer is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Demurrer of Defendant Peter K.

representation of plaintiff and other partners in a real estate investment joint venture transaction, defendants failed to appropriately advise the parties, and continued representation despite conflicts of interests arising between the partners, ultimately resulting in plaintiff funding the entire real estate purchase, with no written contract to protect plaintiff from the circumstance that two of the other partners’ names remained as purchasers in whom title would vest at closing, and could fail to pay their share of the funding after closing.&nbsp; The partners failed to pay, and the complaint also alleges that although the partners agreed to execute and executed a notarized&nbsp; Reconveyance Grant Deed to plaintiff to facilitate a potential sale of the property, defendant falsely claimed that the deed had been forged, and sent a false letter making such allegations to escrow, and other involved parties, clouding title and derailing plaintiff’s efforts to sell the property and mitigate her damages.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that in breach of their duties and ethical obligations to plaintiff, their client, and plaintiff’s spouse, also their client, defendants have filed a civil suit against plaintiff and her spouse on behalf of the other two partners, seeking to quiet title to the property in favor of the other partners according to their purported 50% interest.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that in the course of that lawsuit, defendants are improperly using confidential information derived from plaintiff in the course of defendants’ representation of plaintiff.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on December 5, 2018, the parties filed, and the Court signed a Stipulation and Order Staying Action, staying this matter for all purposes pending resolution of the other action between the partners, which was pending in Van Nuys.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On October 25, 2019, the Court heard a motion brought by defendants Alex Megeredchian, Megeredchian Law and Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian to lift the stay in this matter, arguing that the Van Nuys action had been unsatisfactorily delayed.&nbsp; The motion was denied, the court finding that defendants had not shown good cause to lift the stay.</div><div><br></div><div>These motions were originally scheduled to be heard on September 25, 2020.&nbsp; The minute order indicates that at the hearing, counsel represented to the court that they had lost their Mandatory Settlement Conference date and Trial Date in the Van Nuys action.&nbsp; The Court continued the matters to January 22, 2021 as a “Place Holder Date.”&nbsp; &nbsp;On January 22, 2021, the court again found that the motions were stayed, and continued the matters for “hearing/rescheduling” to October 22, 2021.&nbsp; &nbsp;On that date the parties submitted a Stipulation and Order to Continue the hearings and the matters were continued to November 12, 2021.&nbsp; At that hearing counsel for plaintiff reported that the Van Nuys action was scheduled for closing argument in February, and the matters were continued to February 18, 2021.&nbsp; On February 18, the court noted that no ruling or statement of decision had been filed in the Van Nuys case, and the matters were continued to April 22, 2022.&nbsp;

The court’s order also permitted plaintiff’s counsel to file a motion to lift the stay pursuant to statutory notice.&nbsp; The court also ordered, “The stay is to remain until the next court date.”&nbsp;

The Van Nuys court awarded monetary damages in favor of cross-complainants in that case, the Grigorians, against cross-defendants Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary, jointly and severally, in the sum of economic damages in the amount of $751,489.29 plus $129,026.22 prejudgment interest (tort claims) plus $195,200.10 (breach of contract claims), for a total of $1,075,715.61.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainants were deemed the prevailing parties, with costs to cross-complainants pursuant to memorandum of costs and attorney fees to cross-complainants, if allowed by statute or contract, by noticed motion.</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that the Van Nuys action was proceeding through briefing on a post-trial motion for attorneys’ fees, which was set to be argued on January 18, 2023.&nbsp; On January 17, 2023, plaintiffs in that action filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings, indicating that the matter was stayed pursuant to an automatic stay caused by the filing in another court of a bankruptcy petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court by Robert Ter-Oganesyan and Meghedy Bandary.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On January 18, 2023, the motion for attorney fees was called for hearing in the Van Nuys action, and the minute order indicates that the case had been stayed by filing of bankruptcy proceedings by plaintiffs. The hearing on the motion for attorney fees was continued to July 17, 2023, and the action was also set for a Status Conference Re: Status of Bankruptcy the same date.&nbsp; The July 17, 2023, the matters were taken off calendar by the Van Nuys court.</div><div><br></div><div>The Van Nuys action file also shows that on May 22, 2023, defendants and cross-complainants the Grigorians filed an “Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Monetary Judgment,” which indicates that the Grigorians acknowledge “full satisfaction of the monetary obligations in the December 5, 2022 Judgment” in that action as follows:</div><div>“the Judgment Creditors have accepted payment other than that specified in the Judgment in full satisfaction of the monetary obligations in the Judgment owed to them by Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants Robert TerOganesyan and Meghedy Bandary (“Judgment Debtors”). For the sake of clarity, this Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgment only applies to monetary aspects of the Judgment and does not serve to extinguish aspects of the Judgment relating to the Judgment Creditors’ sole ownership of the “Skytop Property” including but not limited to Paragraph A on page 2 of the Judgment; those portions of the Judgment shall remain active and in full force and effect.”</div><div>[Acknowledgment, LASC Case No. LC106885, filed 05/22/2023, p. 2].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Acknowledgment also indicates:</div><div>“Judgment Creditors have not recorded any abstracts of judgment in any county or filed any judgment liens in the Office of the California Secretary of State.

This Glendale action does not appear to be subject to any automatic bankruptcy stay.&nbsp; This action may accordingly now be ripe for having the stay in this case lifted, and the matters set for hearing this date set for hearing and further briefing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court will hear argument concerning the status of the Van Nuys action and the bankruptcy proceedings to determine if anything remains pending in the Van Nuys action.&nbsp; The court notes that it is not clear if the motion for attorney’s fees remains pending in that action, but stayed, or if the motion has been withdrawn in light of the parties’ agreements referenced in the Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Monetary Judgment in the Van Nuys action.&nbsp; The court also notes that no request for dismissal has been filed in the Van Nuys action, and it is not clear what the status is with respect to the non-monetary aspects of the Van Nuys Judgment.&nbsp; It is also not clear whether the represented resolution of the monetary portion of the Van Nuys Judgment was overseen by the bankruptcy court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the motions on file in this Glendale action, again, none of the parties have filed a motion to lift the stay in this action as previously ordered.&nbsp; The court intended by ordering the filing of a motion to lift the stay by the parties to permit the parties, who are in a better position to provide information than this court, to explain the status of the Van Nuys action and the bankruptcy proceeding and how the current circumstances impact the pending discovery motions and the stay in this action.&nbsp; This potential lifting of the stay in this action would in turn permit the court to issue appropriate orders concerning rescheduling the motions which have long been subject to the stay for the purpose of streamlining the issues to be addressed in this action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court will, during the argument concerning the current status of the Van Nuys action and the bankruptcy proceedings, hear argument concerning whether the parties intend to seek to lift the stay in this matter, what is the current status of this Glendale action in connection with the parties and various causes of action in this Glendale action in light of the judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs in this matter as defendants and cross-complainants in the Van Nuys action, and in light of the bankruptcy stay now in place in that action, and whether the pending discovery motions have been rendered unnecessary or may be properly scheduled for future hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically with respect to the discovery motions, the court cannot hear the motions on their merits this date, as it appears from the file in this matter that the pending motions are not yet fully briefed.&nbsp; With respect to the motion to compel answers to specially prepared interrogatories, there has been no opposition filed.&nbsp; In connection with the motion for compliance with subpoena and other relief, the court notes an opposition and a supplemental declaration have been filed, but no reply papers have yet been filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At this point, the discovery motions remain subject to the court’s previously ordered stay, and this date was designated as a place-holder date with respect to setting the matters for hearing.&nbsp; The court continues the discovery motions to a future date as a placeholder one last time for scheduling hearings on whatever remains to be determined in this action, to permit the parties to seek to lift the stay and provide this court with the appropriate information to determine if the motions should go forward, and under what conditions.&nbsp; The current total stay remains in place.&nbsp; If the moving party has not filed a motion to lift the stay on or before the re-scheduled hearing date on these discovery motions, the court at the placeholder hearing date will deny all the discovery motions without prejudice.</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>The Court notes that no party has filed a timely motion to lift the stay in this action, as previously ordered in the Court’s April 14, 2023 Minute Order, and as further ordered in the Court’s July 28, 2023 Minute Order.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motion to Compel Answers to Specially Prepared Interrogatories is STAYED and hearing is CONTINUED ONE FINAL TIME to placeholder date of December 22, 2023 to permit the parties to file a motion to lift stay or further briefing concerning the status of this action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff’s Motion for an OSC Re: Order to Compel Compliance with Subpoena for Attendance and Testimony Against Robert Ter-Oganesyan is STAYED and hearing is CONTINUED to placeholder date of December 22, 2023 to permit the parties to file a motion to lift stay or further briefing concerning the status of this action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will hear argument concerning the following:</div><div>Whether this action should continue to be stayed.</div><div>What is the status of the Van Nuys action; does anything remain pending in that action which would affect this action?&nbsp; Motion for attorney’s fees?&nbsp; Enforcement of Judgment proceedings?&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Is it necessary for the parties to brief for this Court the impact of the Van Nuys Judgment on this action, and particularly the impact on any need for the outstanding discovery which is the subject of the pending discovery motions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Are there causes of action or issue in this matter which were resolved by the Van Nuys Judgment, or are subject to good faith arguments based on res judicata or collateral estoppel?&nbsp;</div><div>Should the discovery motions be withdrawn or continued for new complete updated and superseding briefing in light of the new circumstances arising from entry of the Judgment in the Van Nuys action?</div><div><br></div><div>These motions will not be heard by the Court unless the Court enters an order lifting the total stay of this case.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the moving party has not filed a motion to lift the stay on or before December 22, 2023, the Court will dismiss the discovery motions without prejudice.&nbsp; If the moving party files a motion to lift the stay, and the Court grants the motions, the Court will reschedule the hearing date for the discovery motion for a hearing date of 30 to 60 days after the Court enters an order lifting the stay.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp;
