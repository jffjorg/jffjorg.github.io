(Allen Gwynn) a new 2023 Chevrolet Corvette vehicle, which was sold to plaintiff with an express warranty from the vehicle manufacturer, defendant General Motors LLC (General Motors).&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was also sold with a statutorily implied warranty of merchantability as described in the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle has a manufacturing defect which causes the brakes to squeal excessively, that plaintiff presented the vehicle to defendant dealer on three occasions, and dealer was either unable to perform any repair or the repair performed did not resolve the defect.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that manufacturer and dealer have failed in their affirmative obligation to repurchase or replace the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges a cause of action for Violation of Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 29, 2023, the court heard motions filed by plaintiff to compel responses from defendant General Motors to special interrogatories and to a request for production of documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motions were denied without prejudice pursuant to this court’s Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) signed and entered by the court on January 24, 2023.&nbsp; The court’s order provides:</div><div>“The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the Order, and to serve any further discovery, and engage in any further discovery proceedings or motions in compliance with the Order and this Minute Order.”</div><div>[Minute Order, 09/29/2023, p. 5].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>As previously pointed out to the parties, this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation, now posted and available on the Los Angeles Superior Court website in connection with this Department, Glendale Courthouse, Department D.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Order was originally signed by the court on January 24, 2023, and revised and again signed on January 11, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court’s previous order had set forth the provisions in the Order concerning discovery in Song-Beverly cases pertinent to interrogatories and requests for production of documents, denied the motions without prejudice, and ordered the parties to engage in good faith meet and confer regarding compliance with the Order:</div><div>“The parties are ordered to engage in good faith meet and confer concerning the outstanding discovery in light of the Order, and, if necessary, reschedule the motions and file new papers and supporting documentation, including up-to-date separate statements, if required, reflecting the then current status of the discovery disputes.&nbsp; Separate statements should also set forth verbatim the relevant language of the Order where applicable.”</div><div>[Minute Order, 09/29/2023, p. 4].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The ruling states:</span></div><div>“The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the Order, and to serve any further discovery, and engage in any further discovery proceedings or motions in compliance with the Order and this Minute Order.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>[Minute Order, 09/29/2023, p. 5].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This motion is now brought by plaintiff to compel compliance with the Order, arguing that plaintiff has repeatedly asked General Motors to comply with the court’s Order with respect to production of documents, but General Motors has simply ignored these requests. [Cooper Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion does not submit copies of any discovery propounded, establish that such discovery is within the scope of the discovery, which is addressed in the Order, or submit a separate statement as previously required.&nbsp; Since there is no separate statement, plaintiff fails to set forth verbatim the relevant language of the Order where applicable, as required in the previous minute order.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The motion evidently assumes that the court will just take plaintiff’s counsel’s word, without supporting documentary evidence, that plaintiff propounded discovery as permitted by the Order, but plaintiff has failed to respond.&nbsp; The discovery is not submitted, and there is no separate statement.&nbsp; [See Cooper Decl.]</div><div><br></div><div>The Cooper Declaration indicates that there were letters sent to request production of documents, which were not responded to, but it is not clear that the documents in any formal requests or even in the letters were limited to those referenced in the Order.&nbsp; [See Cooper Decl., para. 2, Exs. A, B].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first letter was sent on November 30, 2023, and the last letter was sent on December 7, 2023, requesting further production by December 14, 2023.&nbsp; [Ex. B].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This motion was filed on December 18, 2023.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant General Motors argues in opposition that it had served its responses to plaintiff’s two sets of Requests for Production by November 30, 2023, which would have been before this motion was filed, so that this motion would have been one for further responses to discovery, requiring a separate statement, even independently of the standing Order and the court’s previous minute order.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CRC Rule 3.1345 requires that, “any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the Rule:</div><div>“The motions that require a separate statement include a motion:…</div><div>“(3) To compel further responses to a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things;…”</div><div><br></div><div>General Motors also argues that it responded to the December 7, 2023 letter in February 15, 2024, and has already produced responsive documents, and “thereafter” this motion to compel compliance was filed. [Major Decl., paras. 5-7].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The argument seems to be that the motion is moot and should be denied.&nbsp; However, without submission of the actual responses by General Motors with proof of service, or a separate statement indicating verbatim the substance of the responses, the court is unable to determine that the responses were served before this motion was filed, or even since this motion was filed but before the hearing, or that the purported responses were verified or sufficiently responsive to the Order to render this motion moot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This showing by both sides is insufficient to permit an appropriate analysis by this court, and the matter is denied without prejudice.&nbsp; The parties will be ordered to further meet and confer in good faith concerning the current status of the requests for production, the Order, and any production made in November of 2023 and February of 2024.</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are also directed to the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, entitled Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation) (Notice), posted since the hearing on the previous motion, and applicable to this case.&nbsp; That Notice provides:</div><div><br></div><div>“When the court is faced with a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, the court will usually order that the plaintiff and defendant provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side:&nbsp;</div><div>1.

CCP section 438 (d).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition essentially concedes that from the face of the pleading in the file, the complaint was not filed by September 6, 2023, which plaintiff concedes was the statutory deadline, but argues that the September 8, 2023 filing date should be disregarded in favor of the September 6, 2023 date when the complaint was first attempted to be filed.&nbsp; None of the facts concerning those earlier attempts are alleged in the pleading.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court accordingly considers the evidentiary showing offered by plaintiff in the opposition not as a showing to defeat the motion for judgment on the pleadings, but only on the issue of whether leave to amend will be permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that under longstanding California law, complaints rejected due to a technicality are deemed filed on the date of the rejection.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>CCP section 335 introduces the state statutes of limitations, stating, “The periods prescribed for the commencement of actions… are as follows:”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The issue presented here accordingly is when this action was “commenced” for the purposes of the applicable two-year statute of limitations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 350, which provides, “An action is commenced, within the meaning of this Title, when the complaint is filed.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on Cuadra v. Millan (1998) 17 Cal.4th 855, in which the California Supreme Court, in determining that the Labor Commissioner had authority to calculate backpay from the date wage claims were filed rather than the date the claims were heard, rejected an argument that the filing of the complaint tolled the statute of limitations.&nbsp; Plaintiff relies on the following highlighted language in the Court’s opinion:</div><div>“To begin with, the commissioner does not correctly state the issue. Although some judicial opinions—including the decision under review—speak of the filing of a complaint as “tolling the statute of limitations,” the usage is imprecise and potentially misleading. More accurately, the plaintiff's act of filing the complaint fixes the date on which the “action is commenced” (Code Civ. Proc., § 350), thus allowing the defendant and the court to determine whether the action is “commenced within the period[ ] prescribed” by the applicable statute of limitations (id., § 312), and hence is timely. Clarity of thought will be promoted by reserving the use of the phrase, “the statute of limitations is tolled,” for instances in which the running of the statute is temporarily suspended by a specified condition—e.g., the plaintiff's minority (id., § 352) or incarceration (id., § 352.1), the defendant's absence from the state (id., § 351), an injunction or stay of the action (id., § 356), or a state of war (id., § 354)—and will resume when that condition is lifted.</div><div>Cuadra, at 864, italics in original, emphasis added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also argues that under Government Code section 69846.5 the clerk has no power to reject a filing.&nbsp; Government Code section 69846.5 provides, “The clerk of the superior court shall endorse each paper filed with the court the day, month, and year it is filed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also cites to CRC Rule 3.220(c), which provides:</span></div><div>“(c) Failure to provide cover sheet</div><div>If a party that is required to provide a cover sheet under this rule or a similar local rule fails to do so or provides a defective or incomplete cover sheet at the time the party's first paper is submitted for filing, the clerk of the court must file the paper.

Agricultural Labor Relations Board (1985) 37 Cal. 3d 912, 918, in which the California Supreme Court found the Court of Appeal had erred in granting motions of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB) and Admiral Packing Company (Admiral) to dismiss a petition for review by the United Farm Workers (UFW) as untimely.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In that case, the petition for review was submitted to the clerk’s office of the Court of Appeal on the 30th and final day for seeking review under Labor Code section 1160.8.&nbsp; A deputy clerk stamped the petition “received April 2, 1984” but mailed it back to petitioner with an unsigned handwritten note stating that the petition did not comply with the Rules of Court, as it had no Table of Authorities Index.&nbsp; &nbsp;United Farm Workers, at 914.&nbsp; Counsel for petitioner received the petition on April 3, 2018, called the clerk’s office and pointed out that a different rule applied to a petition for review and no table of authorities was required, with the chief deputy telling counsel the petition was unverified and instructed it be returned with verification.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Counsel did so immediately, and the verified petition was filed on April 5, 2018.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court reviewed the various applicable Rules of Court, and case law, and held that the petition had been improperly dismissed:</div><div>“ALRB and Admiral argue that the deputy clerk properly refused to file UFW's defective brief under rule 46. It is indeed arguable that the omission of a required verification is a technical defect which is properly within the clerk's scrutiny. Nevertheless, it cannot be the rule that the timeliness of a petition depends on whether the clerk catches such technical defects. Accordingly, we conclude that ‘filing’ for purposes of compliance with the time limits of Labor Code section 1160.8 means what it does in all other contexts: actual delivery of the petition to the clerk at his place of business during office hours. (See People v. Slobodion (1947) 30 Cal.2d 362, 367 [181 P.2d 868]; Hallett v. Slaughter (1943) 22 Cal.2d 552 [140 P.2d 3].) Thus, it is the filer's actions that are scrutinized in determining whether a petition was timely filed. Rejection of the petition by the clerk under rule 46 for a technical defect cannot undo a ‘filing’ that has already occurred. This is not to say, however, the reviewing court could not later order dismissal if a party has not undertaken timely correction of defects noted. We hold only that a defective petition may not be dismissed for untimeliness under Labor Code section 1160.8 when it is delivered to the appropriate clerk's office during office hours within the time limits set therein.</div><div>United Farm Workers, at 918</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District in Mentzer v. Hardoin (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1365, 1372 cited United Farm Workers in determining that presentation of an arbitrator’s award to a deputy clerk constitutes the act of filing for purposes of calculating the time within which a party may seek a trial de novo, despite a practice of delaying the filing of the award for 30 days after it was received by the arbitration clerk or administrator.&nbsp; Mentzer, at 1372.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The arguments in the opposition do provide a basis for plaintiff to argue in this matter that the action was commenced, and the complaint was technically filed when it was delivered to the court for efiling on September 6, 2023, and was not filed by the clerk on a ground which a Court Rule expressly states is not a valid ground for rejection, providing that the clerk, “must file the paper.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>Although not cited by the parties, the court also notes that since the filing of this motion on February 29, 2024, and shortly after the opposition was filed, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, on April 10, 2024, interpreting California procedural law, held that for purposes of removability of an action to federal court, “an electronically submitted complaint is not ‘filed’ in California state court until is it processed and endorsed or otherwise acknowledged as officially filed by the clerk of the court.”&nbsp; Casola v.

Rodgers alleges that in November of 2020, plaintiff and defendant Joanie K. Chan-Jones purchased a single-family residence in Altadena as joint tenants.&nbsp; As of the time of the property purchase, plaintiff and defendant were in a relationship and until October of 2023 resided together at the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in June of 2019, plaintiff purchased a Labradoodle dog named Remy, for which he paid $2,250 together with a $550 deposit.</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that plaintiff has certain limitations regarding social interactions due to what plaintiff’s doctors have diagnosed as a mental health disability, and in July of 2020, plaintiff began seeing a therapist for his condition.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2020, plaintiff’s then therapist determined that Remy had been a big help to plaintiff in managing plaintiff’s life on a daily basis and recommended that Remy be designated as an emotional support animal for plaintiff to help alleviate plaintiff’s social difficulties and enhance his ability to live independently and travel.&nbsp; As a result, Remy was formally certified as an Emotional Support Animal by the United Service Dog Association.&nbsp; Plaintiff’s doctors have recommended the constant presence of plaintiff’s emotional support animal to assist plaintiff in coping with his diagnosis, and that diagnosis has resulted in an Emotional Support Dog being prescribed by a licensed therapist as necessary for plaintiff’s well-being in light of his mental health disability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in August of 2023, plaintiff and defendant decided to separate, and defendant moved out of the property in October of 2023.&nbsp; Plaintiff and defendant are still working to determine how to handle the property and some issues still need to be resolved, including any potential buyout and roof repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that even after leaving the property defendant has been showing up unannounced and has been improperly removing mail and deliveries from the property, including things belonging to plaintiff, and has most egregiously removed plaintiff’s Emotional Support Animal, Remy, without plaintiff’s permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that defendant has threatened plaintiff to maintain custody of Remy until the property issues are settled.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendant’s actions were deliberate, cruel, and emotionally abusive to plaintiff, with defendant using intimidation and threats to manipulate plaintiff to make certain decisions regarding disposition of the property in order to financially benefit defendant.&nbsp; The FAC also alleges that removing Remy without permission violates various California and federal laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Penal Code sections which provide that stealing a companion animal is a crime.</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that he has tried to persuade defendant to return Remy, including enlisting the assistance of the Altadena Sheriff’s Department, but defendant has refused, which has caused plaintiff emotional distress, and negatively affected his health.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on January 19, 2024, the court heard an ex parte application brought by plaintiff for a writ of possession, which was granted, and defendant was ordered to immediately return possession of the Emotional Support Animal known as “Remy” to plaintiff, finding that defendant had not shown she had any lawful claim to Remy.&nbsp; The court ordered that no undertaking by plaintiff would be required, but that given the uniqueness of the property in dispute and defendant’s failure to show any lawful right to such property, the amount of defendant’s undertaking was set at $50,000.&nbsp; The Order Granting Ex Parte Application for Writ of Possession was signed and filed the same date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On January 23, 2024, defendant filed a Notice of Posting the Undertaking, with proof of deposit with the court on the same date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On March 19, 2023, defendant filed a cross-complaint naming plaintiff as a cross-defendant, alleging that Remy was fully gifted to cross-complainant by cross-defendant in 2019, in order to induce cross-complainant to remain in their romantic relationship.&nbsp; Cross-complainant alleges that since receiving Remy as a gift from cross-defendant, cross-complainant has loved, nurtured, and cared for Remy, particularly providing solely for Remy’s special needs and health issues, including Remy being diagnosed with leptospirosis, having to go through dialysis, and then having to be fed through a feeding tube and receive IV fluids.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cross-complainant alleges that she takes Remy to all medical appointments and grooming appointments and provides for cleaning and bathing to avoid infection and address Remy’s allergies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint seeks a declaration that cross-complainant is the 100% legal and equitable title holder of Remy, and that her interest is superior to any rights asserted by cross-defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint also seeks partition by sale of the real property owned jointly by cross-complainant and cross-defendant, and an accounting, based on allegations that during the years of the ownership of the real property, cross-defendant collected and received from third parties rents and profits derived from the property, and that cross-complainant has paid expenses for the repair, maintenance, taxes, and insurance on the property in amounts different than amounts paid by cross-defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendant Joanie K. Chan-Jones seeks an order striking the first cause of action for extortion and the third cause of action for IIED in the FAC pursuant to CCP § 425.16, which provides:</div><div>“(a) The Legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.&nbsp; The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.&nbsp; &nbsp;To this end, this section shall be construed broadly.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) (1) A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) In making its determination, the court shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.”</div><div><br></div><div>Subdivision (e) defines “act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue” to include statements made before an official proceeding, in connection with an issue under consideration by an official proceeding, in a “place open to the public or in a public forum” in connection with an issue of public interest, “or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The latter two categories require a specific showing the action concerns a matter of public interest; the first two categories do not require this showing.&nbsp; Briggs v.

La Marche (2003) 31 Cal.4th 728 set forth the manner in which the trial court is to apply CCP § 425.16:</div><div>“Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion “requires the court to engage in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the statute. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.””&nbsp;</div><div>Jarrow, at 733, quoting Equilon Enterprises v.

V].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued in the opposition, this text does not appear to be the “cornerstone” of the causes of action for extortion or IIED.&nbsp; &nbsp;The gravamen of those causes of action appear to be the allegations that defendant took the dog Remy, plaintiff’s emotional support animal, and would not return Remy to plaintiff.&nbsp; The text does not mention Remy, and to the extent it states that plaintiff will not see “us” anytime soon, this could easily be interpreted as a reference to defendant and her two sons, the “boys” referenced in the text.&nbsp; There is no direct threat involving Remy included in this text.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first cause of action alleges:&nbsp;</div><div>“As set forth above, Defendant improperly and illegally removed Christopher's emotional support animal, Remy, from the Property without Christopher's permission. Further, Joanie has refused to return custody of Remy to Christopher until the Property issues are settled.”</div><div>[FAC, para. 34]&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third cause of action alleges:</div><div>“Joanie knew that Christopher needed his Emotional Support Animal in his daily life and that he would suffer emotional distress when she removed Remy from his possession and deliberately employed intimidation and escalated manipulation against Christopher.”</div><div>[FAC, para. 53].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Particularly in connection with the IIED cause of action, it appears that this conduct of taking the Emotional Support Animal without permission would alone support the cause of action, and no alleged protected pre-litigation speech activity would be necessary to support such a cause of action.&nbsp; Any alleged threats do not appear to be included in the subject text message, and would only provide further evidence that defendant engaged in outrageous conduct, which conduct would already be sufficiently outrageous without additional threatening conduct or alleged escalating manipulation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first cause of action is more complicated because the elements of extortion require a threat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, the California Supreme Court recognized a civil cause of action for extortion, based on the criminal statutes:</div><div>“Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent … induced by a wrongful use of force or fear … .” (Pen. Code, § 518.) Fear, for purposes of extortion “may be induced by a threat, either: [¶] … [¶] 2. To accuse the individual threatened … of any crime; or, [¶] 3. To expose, or impute to him … any deformity, disgrace or crime[.]” (Pen. Code, § 519.) “Every person who, with intent to extort any money or other property from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other writing, whether subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were actually obtained by means of such threat.” (Pen. Code, § 523.)</div><div><br></div><div>Extortion has been characterized as a paradoxical crime in that it criminalizes the making of threats that, in and of themselves, may not be illegal. “[I]n many blackmail cases the threat is to do something in itself perfectly legal, but that threat nevertheless becomes illegal when coupled with a demand for money.” (Philippine Export &amp; Foreign Loan Guarantee Corp. v. Chuidian (1990) 218 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 1079 [267 Cal. Rptr. 457].)”</div><div>Flatley, at 326.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under Penal Code § 519:</div><div>“Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat of any of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;1. To do an unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threatened or of a third person.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;2. To accuse the individual threatened, or a relative of his or her, or a member of his or her family, of a crime.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;3. To expose, or to impute to him, her, or them a deformity, disgrace, or crime.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;4. To expose a secret affecting him, her, or them.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;5. To report his, her, or their immigration status or suspected immigration status.”</div><div><br></div><div>As set forth above, Flately indicates that such conduct is actionable, as under the criminal statute there is liability “as if such money or property were actually obtained…” Flately, at 326.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The argument by both sides is apparently that defendant here is being accused of having threatened to do unlawful injury to the person of plaintiff, in the form of withholding contact with Remy and therefore inflicting severe emotional distress, if plaintiff did not agree to the buyout terms of the real property favorable to defendant which the parties were in the process of negotiating.&nbsp; While plaintiff evidently did not give in to defendant’s demand with respect to the real property, the fact of the threat itself would support the cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in the motion argues that such conduct falls within the first prong of the special motion to strike statute because any such threat would have been a pre-litigation communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In connection with the first prong and the first cause of action for extortion, plaintiff argues that defendant’s speech is not protected, as there is an insufficient showing that any extortionate threats concerning withholding custody of Remy unless plaintiff would agree to defendant’s terms concerning the buyout of the real property was made in anticipation of litigation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This posture leaves the issue, as set forth above, of whether any alleged communications involved prospective litigation, which was at the time “contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.”&nbsp; Action Apartment Association, Inc. v.

V].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears that this communication was made after an attorney had been consulted, but it is not entirely clear that litigation was then contemplated, as the parties were then endeavoring to reach an agreement for a buyout which would not involve a court or a formal partition proceeding, and the text expressly states, that “My intent for retaining counsel isn’t adversarial.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The FAC does not clearly allege when Remy was first taken by defendant but does allege that threatened custody maintenance by defendant is reflected in texts dated October 16, 2023, which text is set forth above.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 20].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in the moving declaration states that in the back-and-forth negotiations concerning the buyout, plaintiff sent a counterproposal on September 18, 2023, which referenced legal fees because the parties had discussed the possibility of each retaining an attorney.&nbsp; [Jones Decl., paras.&nbsp; 44-47, Ex. O].&nbsp; It is indicated that this email was the first mention of plaintiff retaining custody of Remy for one weekend a month, when it remains defendant’s position that Remy had never been plaintiff’s dog.&nbsp; [Jones Decl., paras. 47, 48, Ex. O].&nbsp; Defendant indicates it was at this point that she started contacting lawyers, and evidently began taking action such as returning checks for less than the full amount agreed to, evidently on the advice of counsel.&nbsp; [Jones Decl., paras.&nbsp; 50-52].&nbsp; It appears that after this retention was when plaintiff began in his emails indicating that “Remy is part of the equation and nothing will be signed until custody is agreed upon.”&nbsp; [Jones Decl., para. 55, Ex. S].&nbsp; Jones indicates that in this same October 2, 2023 e-mail, plaintiff stated, “If we are not in agreement, and you do not want to accept my buyout offer, we can both go get attorneys at this point to help formulate our next steps/each persons’ obligations.”&nbsp; [Ex. S].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant states, “I understood Mr. Rodgers words that if we did not reach an agreement on his terms, that he would hire an attorney and file a lawsuit against me regarding ownership of the Subject Property and our shares in the Subject Property.&nbsp; I was scared by his statement about getting an attorney because to me that meant he was going to file a lawsuit against me.”&nbsp; [Jones Decl., para. 58].&nbsp; Defendant also states, “At this stage, I was already being advised by my current attorneys…”&nbsp; [Jones Decl., para. 59].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that by the time of the alleged threats on October 16, 2023 as currently alleged in the FAC, defendant has established that she had been for two weeks fearful that she would be forced to defend against contemplated litigation and in good faith had retained counsel to deal with that eventuality and protect her rights to pursue litigation.&nbsp; It is also clear from the file that defendant, as cross-complainant, in response to this lawsuit, actually did file a cross-complaint to protect her interests concerning the real property, further supporting that litigation had been anticipated.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>This showing sufficiently establishes that any alleged threats upon which the first cause of action of the FAC relies, if they existed at all, were undertaken as pre-litigation communications, which would constitute protected activity within the meaning of CCP § 425.16 (e)(2), which defines act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech to include “(2)&nbsp; any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As discussed above, the court is not persuaded that the gravamen of the third cause of action for IIED depends on the alleged text message communication upon which the motion relies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In any case, even if defendant’s speech in making threats concerning the custody of the dog were the gravamen of the causes of action, meeting the first prong and shifting the burden to plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing on those causes of action, plaintiff argues that he is able to do so without reference to any alleged pre-litigation communications, which argument is discussed below.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that extortion is not a protected activity under the first prong of the Special Motion to Strike statute but is considered non-protected criminal activity.</div><div><br></div><div>In Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and the Second District denying a special motion to strike where the alleged conduct constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law, finding that since extortionate speech was not constitutionally protected, the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply.&nbsp; Flatley, at 328.&nbsp; (“Extortion is not a constitutionally protected form of speech.”).&nbsp; The Court found that in that case, where defendant did not deny that he made the extortionate statements, and “based on the specific and extreme circumstances of this case,” the activity was extortion as a matter of law, and the trial court did not err in denying the special motion to strike. Flatley, at 332-333.</div><div><br></div><div>The Court in Flatley held that the special motion to strike statute did not apply, “where either the defendant concedes the illegality of its conduct, or the illegality is conclusively shown by the evidence…”&nbsp; Flatley, at 316.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff bears the burden of producing evidence to establish the illegality exception.&nbsp; Soukup v.

Gaims, Weil, West &amp; Epstein (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, in which the Second District found that plaintiff’s ex-boyfriend’s attorney’s alleged wiretapping was not protected activity, but criminal misconduct, concluding that,&nbsp; “Under no factual scenario offered by [the law firm] is such wiretapping activity protected by the constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.”&nbsp; Gerbosi, at 446-447.&nbsp; Such a showing has not been established as the case here, where a review of the text message at issue does not even include an extortionate statement, in effect, a threat prohibited under statute, combined with a demand for money, or, indeed, any mention of Remy.&nbsp; &nbsp;See also LeFebvre v. LeFebvre (2011, 2nd Dist) 199 Cal.App.4th 696, 705 (affirming denial of anti-SLAPP motion finding that the activity in that case, filing a false police report, although privileged, did not fall within the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute because it was illegal activity, not made in connection with a protected constitutional right, the Second District concluding “Because Alice does not contest that she submitted an illegal, false criminal report, [w]e end our review here.”); See also Kenne v. Stennis (2014, 2nd Dist.) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 967 (distinguishing the case before it from LeFebvre:&nbsp; “Plaintiff's reliance on LeFebvre…is misplaced.

Code, § 518.) …. “Every person who, with intent to extort any money or other property from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other writing, whether subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were actually obtained by means of such threat.” (Pen. Code, § 523.)”</div><div>Flatley, at 326.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The relevant portion of Penal Code § 519 is:</div><div>“Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat of any of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;1. To do an unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threatened or of a third person….”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues briefly, with no citation to evidence, that defendant’s actions constitute extortion in that defendant has wrongfully taken and is holding Remy hostage in an effort to force plaintiff to make certain concessions regarding the disposition of the real property in order to financially benefit defendant, and that as a result plaintiff has been damaged and continues to suffer damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As discussed above, this cause of action requires an oral or written threat, and the text message which is the focus of the motion does not mention Remy directly and does not include a threat that unless plaintiff complies with defendant’s demands, defendant will cause unlawful injury to plaintiff’s person or property.&nbsp; The e-mail at best states, “You will not be seeing us anytime soon until we come to an agreement with the property.&nbsp; We can have a discussion at that time.”&nbsp; [Jones Decl., Ex. V].</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent there may be a vague argument that there was some extortion in the act of holding Remy hostage, or wrongfully obtaining possession of Remy, this assertion could not be the basis of an extortion claim, because it is expressly alleged that defendant took Remy “without [plaintiff’s] permission” or consent, when extortion requires that property be obtained from another, “with his consent,” “induced by wrongful use of force or fear.”&nbsp; [FAC, para. 20, see also para. 22].&nbsp; In fact, this lack of permission or consent appears to be an essential element of the claims asserted for conversion and statutory violations, which are not challenged by instant motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as argued above, even if such a representation met the elements of extortion, it is clear that the October 16, 2023 e-mail and any other communications after October 2, 2023 are protected by the litigation privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Civil Code § 47 provides that “a privileged publication or broadcast is one made:...(b) In any ...(2) judicial proceeding.”&nbsp; &nbsp;This privilege extends to all communications made by the litigants or their attorneys in furtherance of the objects of the litigation which have some logical relation to the action.&nbsp; Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal. 3d 205, 214.&nbsp; The California Supreme Court has held that “section 47(b) operates to bar civil liability for any tort claim based upon a privileged communication, with the exception of malicious prosecution…”&nbsp; &nbsp;Hagberg v. California Federal Bank FSB (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 375.</div><div><br></div><div>In Greco v. Greco (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 810, the court of appeal set forth the following elements to establish the litigation privilege:</div><div>“The litigation privilege, found in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2), “applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365.)”</div><div>Greco, at 826.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These elements have been established in connection with the subject text message, as discussed in detail above.&nbsp; The text was authored by defendant litigant, was a pre-litigation statement connected to the dispute in this action, to achieve the objects of that anticipated litigation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues here that the first cause of action is based on the conduct by defendant, the wrongful taking and refusing to return Remy, not any alleged protected speech by defendant.&nbsp; This argument disregards that a claim for civil extortion involves the making of some threat, and the opposition does not point to any threat being made other than arguing that the text message relied upon by defendant is not the basis of the claim but is simply evidence that proves the bad faith purpose of plaintiff’s wrongful conduct to extort concessions regarding the parties’ property dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is difficult to understand from the opposition how plaintiff has established by admissible evidence each element of an extortion claim, particularly if the court must disregard the text at issue as a pre-litigation communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff’s declaration in support of the opposition states that, “Since the first day I brought Remy home, Remy and I have been living together for the past 4 and ½ years until Remy was taken without my permission by Joanie on October 2, 2023.”&nbsp; [Rodgers Decl., para. 30].&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration states that “All conversations about the house were only possible after I was forced to agree to terms with Remy and his living situation,” which evidently occurred before October 2, 2024, as the declaration states again that “after leaving the house, Joanie removed my Emotional Support Animal, Remy, without my consent.”&nbsp; [Rodgers Decl., paras. 40-44].&nbsp; It is not clear what accompanying threat was made to support an extortion claim.&nbsp; The declaration states that plaintiff did not instruct defendant to obtain counsel, despite her claims that she formally retained and consulted counsel at the beginning of the process, and states:</div><div>“Joanie has repeatedly refused to talk about Remy, knowing it would affect my stance on the house.&nbsp; Finally, Joanie used Remy to threaten me through text in order to sell the house faster and obtain her desired payout amount.&nbsp; Obviously, Joanie and I had been discussing Remy since he was mentioned in her text dated October 16, 2023.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Rodgers Decl., para. 58]</div><div><br></div><div>The text quoted above is then attached to the declaration as Exhibit 25.&nbsp; Again, if this text is the only evidence relied upon to establish the essential element of fear “induced by a threat” that defendant would “do an unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threatened,” the text does not include such a threat.&nbsp; Moreover, the testimony concerning what defendant “knew” and her thought processes in making an alleged statement has been objected to, and it would appear that plaintiff would have no personal knowledge of what defendant “knew” or was thinking at the time.&nbsp; Finally, the text would also be subject to the litigation privilege as a pre-litigation communication, discussed above.&nbsp; This legal contract trumps all other arguments presented by plaintiff.</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, plaintiff has failed to meet his burden on the second prong to establish a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claim, that is, to establish by admissible evidence a prima facie case which, if believed by the trier of fact, would result in judgment for the plaintiff on a civil extortion cause of action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion as to the first cause of action for extortion is granted, and the cause of action is ordered stricken from the FAC.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Third Cause of Action—Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress&nbsp;</div><div>As discussed above, this cause of action does not have as its gravamen the purported threats included in the subject text message, so does not arise from protected activity, and the special motion to strike will be denied on the ground the third cause of action for IIED has not been established as having arisen from protected activity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even if the court were to find that the burden had shifted to plaintiff to establish a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claim, in effect, to establish by admissible evidence a prima facie case, plaintiff has successfully done so.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To establish a cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, plaintiff must plead and prove the following essential elements: Extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress;

Quality Old Time Service, Inc.&nbsp; (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, the court of appeal found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in determining that defendants were prevailing parties on an anti-SLAPP motion in that case where they were unsuccessful in striking three of the four challenged causes of action, but that the trial court erred in failing to reduce the fees to reflect that defendants were only partially successful on the motion.&nbsp; The court of appeal discussed those issues as follows:</div><div>“Given the express legislative preference for awarding fees to successful anti-SLAPP defendants, a party need not succeed in striking every challenged claim to be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of section 425.16. A contrary conclusion would require a partially prevailing defendant to bear the entire cost of the anti-SLAPP litigation at the outset of the case. This would create a strong disincentive for a defendant to bring the motion, undermining the legislative intent to encourage defendants to utilize the anti-SLAPP procedure to eliminate SLAPP claims and to discourage plaintiffs from bringing meritless SLAPP claims. (See Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1131, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735.) On the other hand, there is no reason to encourage a defendant to bring an anti-SLAPP motion where the factual and legal grounds for the claims against the defendant remain the same after the resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion. (Endres v. Moran, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at pp. 955–956, 37 Cal.Rptr.3d 786.) Where the results of the motion are “ ‘minimal’ ” or “insignificant” a court does not abuse its discretion in finding the defendant was not a prevailing party. (Id. at p. 956, 37 Cal.Rptr.3d 786 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.); see Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, supra, 88 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1391–1392, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 29.)</div><div><br></div><div>We thus hold that a party who partially prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a prevailing party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion. The determination whether a party prevailed on an anti- SLAPP motion lies within the broad discretion of a trial court. (See Jackson v. Homeowners Assn. Monte Vista Estates–East (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 773, 789, 113 Cal.Rptr.2d 363.) We review this determination on an abuse of discretion standard.</div><div><br></div><div>Applying these principles, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining defendants were prevailing parties in the underlying litigation. Defendants successfully eliminated the trade libel cause of action. Although trade libel bears similarity to the defamation claim that remained in the litigation, the two causes of action are not identical. Whereas defamation concerns injury to the reputation of a person or business, trade libel involves false disparagement of the quality of goods or services. (Guess, Inc. v. Superior Court (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 473, 479, 222 Cal.Rptr. 79; Erlich v. Etner, supra, 224 Cal.App.2d at pp. 73–74, 36 Cal.Rptr. 256.) The elimination of the trade libel cause of action thus had the potential to narrow the litigation with respect to the damage issues and the focus of the claimed false statements. Additionally, the Mann court's acknowledgment that an absolute privilege applies to defendants' reports of WSSI's activities to government entities precluded WSSI from thereafter pursuing any recovery based on defendants' communications with government agencies. (Mann, supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 108, 15 Cal.Rptr.3d 215.) By bringing the anti-SLAPP motion, defendants thus successfully narrowed the scope of the lawsuit, limiting discovery, reducing potential recoverable damages, and altering the settlement posture of the case.”</div><div>Mann, at 339-340.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>In this case, the court, in reviewing the special motion to strike and the intended ruling on that motion this date, further finds that the results here, the elimination of the civil extortion cause of action, were not so insignificant that defendant did not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion.&nbsp; The elimination of the civil extortion cause of action, an intentional tort, will streamline the case, and eliminate the need for certain discovery related to that claim.&nbsp; The elimination of such a cause of action also presumably alters the settlement posture of the case.&nbsp; Defendant is accordingly prevailing party on that part of the motion to strike, entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in bringing that portion of the motion.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>This conclusion leaves the issue of the amount of fees to be awarded.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant seeks a total of 25 hours in fees in connection with preparing the moving papers, and 5 hours estimated to prepare the reply, and one hour to appear at the hearing (a total of 31 hours) at the hourly rate of $550 per hour, plus a filing fee of $60, for a total fee award of $16,560.00.&nbsp; [Shamtob Decl., paras. 3-7]. (Although the Amended Notice of Motion indicates that $16,584.24 is sought in fees and costs, the fees and costs awarded will be limited to those evidenced in the declaration).&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant submits the declaration of counsel, Edrin Shamtob, Esq., who explains his qualifications, and the justification for the billing rate of $550 per hour in this matter.&nbsp; [Shamtob Decl., para. 3].&nbsp; The billing rate is sufficiently justified.&nbsp; There is only one attorney for which time is being claimed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span> The court of appeal in Mann, in connection with the amount of fees to be awarded in connection with partially prevailing on a special motion to strike noted:</span></div><div>“An award of attorney fees to a partially prevailing defendant under section 425.16, subdivision (c) thus involves competing public policies: (1) the public policy to discourage meritless SLAPP claims by compelling a SLAPP plaintiff to bear a defendant's litigation costs incurred to eliminate the claim from the lawsuit; and (2) the public policy to provide a plaintiff who has facially valid claims to exercise his or her constitutional petition rights by filing a complaint and litigating those claims in court. (§§ 425.16, 425.17; see Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1131, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735.) In balancing these policies, we conclude a defendant should not be entitled to obtain as a matter of right his or her entire attorney fees incurred on successful and unsuccessful claims merely because the attorney work on those claims was overlapping. Instead, the court should first determine the lodestar amount for the hours expended on the successful claims, and, if the work on the successful and unsuccessful causes of action was overlapping, the court should then consider the defendant's relative success on the motion in achieving his or her objective, and reduce the amount if appropriate.</div><div><br></div><div>“This analysis includes factors such as the extent to which the defendant's litigation posture was advanced by the motion, whether the same factual allegations remain to be litigated, whether discovery and motion practice have been narrowed, and the extent to which future litigation expenses and strategy were impacted by the motion. The fees awarded to a defendant who was only partially successful on an anti-SLAPP motion should be commensurate with the extent to which the motion changed the nature and character of the lawsuit in a practical way. The court should also consider any other applicable relevant factors, such as the experience and abilities of the attorney and the novelty and difficulty of the issues, to adjust the lodestar amount as appropriate.

A determination of frivolousness requires a finding the anti-SLAPP “motion is ‘totally and completely without merit’ (§ 128.5, subd.

&nbsp;The file shows that at a hearing on March 29, 2024, “pursuant to oral stipulation,” the hearing on the motion was advanced to that date and continued to April 26, 2024, presumably so that the motion could be heard together with the other two motions to be relieved which were noticed to be heard on April 26, 2024.&nbsp; [Minute Order, 03/29/2024, p. 12].&nbsp; Counsel Eisenberg was ordered to give notice.&nbsp; There is no notice of ruling providing notice that the hearing date on the motion as to defendant Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian had been advanced to this hearing date.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court will hear argument concerning whether notice of the new hearing date was in fact given to the client defendant Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian, or whether that motion should be continued for notice to the client.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Second, at the hearing on March 29, 2024, a Case Management Conference in this matter was also continued to this date, April 26, 2024.&nbsp; This hearing date had not been scheduled at the time the motions were filed, and so the date understandably does not appear on the proposed orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court anticipates that future dates will be set at the Case Management Conference on April 26, 2024, and will require that moving counsel modify the proposed orders to include at paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 any future hearing dates and/or trial date set at that hearing before the court will sign the Orders to be served on the clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;This change will provide the appropriate notice to the unrepresented parties concerning the future hearings and proceedings in this matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No Opposition]</div><div>Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for defendant Law Offices of Alex Megerdchian:</div><div>The Court will hear argument concerning whether the client has been given appropriate notice that this motion was rescheduled from the date originally noticed, May 10, 2024, to the date of the hearing April 26, 2024.&nbsp; The file does not include a notice of ruling giving notice of the rulings at the March 29, 2024 hearing, including the rescheduling of the date for this motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Or, if the Court is satisfied that the client has been given notice:</div><div><br></div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for defendant Law Offices of Alex Megerdchian is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will sign the proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil after the Order has been modified to reflect at paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 any future hearings in this matter set at the Case Management Conference to be conducted this date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As so modified, the Court will sign the Order and counsel will be relieved effective upon the efiling of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for defendant Megerdchian Law is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will sign the proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil after the Order has been modified to reflect at paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 any future hearings in this matter set at the Case Management Conference to be conducted this date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As so modified, the Court will sign the Order and counsel will be relieved effective upon the efiling of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.</div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for defendant Alex Megerdchian is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will sign the proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil after the Order has been modified to reflect at paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 any future hearings in this matter set at the Case Management Conference to be conducted this date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As so modified, the Court will sign the Order and counsel will be relieved effective upon the efiling of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
