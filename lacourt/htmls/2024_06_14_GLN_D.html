C&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:</div><div>Plaintiff Hamed Golshan alleges that defendant Mike Kamali was a fifty percent shareholder of a business entity known as Saint Glen, Inc., which operates a restaurant known as Panini Grill in Los Angeles County (the Company), and in September of 2019 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement wherein defendant agreed to sell his entire fifty percent interest to plaintiff for the sum of $750,000.00.&nbsp; The sale was to be consummated on December 30, 2019, and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement defendant was to remain fully liable for all claims, actions, lawsuits and demands that the Company was liable for prior to December 30, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint alleges that defendant has failed to perform defendant’s obligations under the Agreement, as defendant has failed to pay vendors for products purchased prior to December 30, 2019, failed to pay sums due to the franchisor, failed to pay rent to the landlord, and failed to file taxes for the Company for the year 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint also alleges that in connection with the transaction, defendant made false representations upon which plaintiff relied in agreeing to purchase defendant’s share in the Company, including that all taxes would be paid for by defendant, that there were no known outstanding balances due to vendors, and that the lease and franchisor/franchisee agreements with which they had been fully complied.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Mike Kamali has filed a cross-complaint against plaintiff Hamed Golshan as cross-defendant, alleging that cross-complainant and cross-defendant entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement for the shares of stock in the Panini Kabob Grill, under which Golshan agreed to pay $750,000 for the shares.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that on December 31, 2019 Golshan paid Kamali a deposit of $450,000, and Kamali gave ownership of the Panini Kabob Grill to Golshan on January 1, 2020, but that Golshan has never paid the balance of the purchase price in the sum of $300,000, although the balance was to be paid to Kamali on or before January 31, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint also alleges that cross-complainant Kamali entered into an implied-in-fact contract for the sale of Kamali’s 50% share of Saint Glen with cross-defendant Hootan Ataian, as Ataian had approached Kamali proposing that they enter into a partnership to run a food-truck catering business that would compete with Panini Kabob Grill, took Kamili to his Pacific Stone warehouse to show Kamali the food truck, obtained the consent of the franchisor based on informing him that Ataian was interested in purchasing the shares in Saint Glen, and made the $450,000 payment with two checks from two bank accounts belonging to Ataian.&nbsp; The operative cross-complaint, the FACC, also alleges that Ataian made various misrepresentations to Kamali regarding the transaction.</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Third party deponents Ali R. Mirhosseini and Mirhosseini Law Group, APC (MLG) seek to quash deposition subpoenas which defendant Mike Kamali served on them.</div><div><br></div><div>The two subpoenas each seek the same records, with one additional request made only to the individual, Mirhosseini.&nbsp; The requests seek records including all billing records relating to Saint Glen, relating to the drafting of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Security Agreement, and the Promissory Note, and all communications relating to the sale of Saint Glen, and between the deponents and Ataian and Amir Talebi relating to each of the subject documents.&nbsp; [Starr Decl., Exs. A, B, Subpoenas, Attach. 3].&nbsp; &nbsp;The subpoena as to Mirhosseini also seeks communications between the deponents and any third party relating to Saint Glen.&nbsp; [Starr Decl., Ex. A, Subpoena, Attach. 3, Request No. 13].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The deponents seek to quash the subpoenas on the ground they violate attorney-client privilege, as defendant is seeking testimony and production of documents from the deponents Mirhosseini and MLG, an attorney and law firm, which would disclose communications between Ataian, non-party Amir Talebi and their counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion indicates that when the client cross-defendant Ataian was advised that defendant sought the records of counsel, Ataian claimed privilege and would not permit Mirhosseini or MLG to produce the requested documents or give testimony regarding them.&nbsp; [Starr Decl., para. 6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion attaches a declaration of cross-defendant Ataian, in which Ataian indicates that Mirhosseini and Mirhosseini Law Group, APC have been his personal attorney for years, and provided various legal services to him, and states:</div><div>“At some point I was involved in a potential stock purchase for Saint Glen, Inc.&nbsp; and Mr. Mirhosseini drafted various documents on my behalf and at the request of myself and Amir Talebi.&nbsp; Due to a conflict of interest, neither Mr. Mirhosseini nor Mirhosseini Law Group, APC, are representing me in this matter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Ataian Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ataian, as the client, goes on to state:</div><div>“On or around April 25, 2024, Mr. Mirhosseini contacted me to advise me that Defendant had issued a subpoena requesting his personal testimony and MLG’s business records related to the documents drafted in relation to the Saint Glen, Inc. purchase.&nbsp; I did not agree to waive the attorney-client privilege because the documents sought by Defendant include communications between myself and Ali R. Mirhosseini/MLG that are privileged.”</div><div>[Ataian Decl., para. 3].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to the client Talebi, who is not a party to this lawsuit, the motion also indicates that to date, MLG “has not been provided with any written authorization from Mr. Talebi granting us permission to waive privilege and produce the requested documents or provide testimony regarding the same.”&nbsp; [Starr Decl., para. 7].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2020.220(c) provides that</div><div>“(c) Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service&nbsp;</div><div>(1) Personal attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies.</div><div>(2)&nbsp; &nbsp;Any specified production, inspection, testing and sampling....”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Deponents seek relief under CCP § 1987.1, which provides in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.”</div><div>With respect to limiting discovery, the burden is generally on the moving party to establish good cause for the relief requested.&nbsp; Emerson Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101, 1110.&nbsp; &nbsp;The granting or denial of relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Meritplan Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1981, 2nd Dist.) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Separate Statement&nbsp;</div><div>As an initial matter, the motion is not accompanied by a separate statement.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CRC Rule 3.1345 (a) requires that “Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.&nbsp; The motions that require a separate statement include a motion:...(5) To compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things at a deposition.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion does not explain why a separate statement is not submitted here, when the subpoenas seek twelve and thirteen distinct categories of documents and involves the content of the discovery requests.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Presumably, the deponents are relying on CRC Rule 3.1345, subdivision (b), which provides that “A separate statement is not required when no response has been provided to the request for discovery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The arguments are broadly made here that all documents requested from the personal attorney deponents are attorney-client privileged, but a separate statement would be enormously helpful to the court here.&nbsp; The court will consider whether it will require that a separate statement be submitted to assist the court in ruling on the motion.&nbsp; Specifically, for example, there is a request for communications between the deponent Mirhosseini and “any third party RELATING TO SAINT GLEN,” which would evidently not be communications between the deponent as the attorney and his clients.&nbsp; [See Subpoena, Ex. A, Requests Nos. 13].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Notice to Consumer&nbsp;</div><div>The motion argues that the subpoena to Mirhosseini should be quashed because there were no notices to consumer documents served on this deponent, Mirhosseini individually.&nbsp; Counsel’s declaration states:</div><div>“Defendant failed to comply with any part of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3 (c) with respect to the Deposition Subpoena served on Mr. Mirhosseini, nor did Defendant serve Mr. Mirhosseini with a copy of the Notice to Consumer.”</div><div>[Starr Decl., para. 9].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears from the framing of the argument and the documents submitted that notices of consumer were served with the MLG subpoena.&nbsp; [See Ex.

State Bar (1990) 51 Cal. 3d 1117,&nbsp; involving a review of attorney disciplinary proceedings by the State Bar of California.&nbsp; In determining if there was an attorney-client relationship between the attorney and client, the California Supreme Court rejected an argument by the attorney that there was no such relationship because the client never paid the attorney:</div><div>“Petitioner contends that because Merritt never paid him, there was no attorney-client relationship. Although there apparently was a misunderstanding as to whether or not petitioner was retained on a contingency fee basis, the record supports the finding that an attorney-client relationship existed between them. Merritt testified that she asked petitioner to file the lawsuit on her behalf, and gave him all the relevant documents. She understood that petitioner was working on the matter. Petitioner's office did, in fact, do substantial work on the case. “No formal contract or arrangement or attorney fee is necessary to create the relationship of attorney and client. It is the fact of the relationship which is important.” (Farnham v. State Bar (1976) 17 Cal.3d 605, 612 [131 Cal.Rptr. 661, 552 P.2d 445].) Under the circumstances, an attorney-client relationship existed between petitioner and Merritt. He could not simply abandon her and let the statute of limitations expire.”</div><div>Lister, at 1126.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also relies on Responsible Citizens v. Superior Court (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 1717, in which the court of appeal addressed the issue of whether the trial court had properly disqualified a law firm from representing an association and an individual in the subject lawsuit.&nbsp; The court of appeal directed the trial court to vacate its order disqualifying counsel and to conduct further proceedings, holding that an attorney representing a partnership does not necessarily have an attorney-client relationship with an individual partner for purposes of applying the conflict of interest rules.&nbsp; The highlighted language is what is relied upon by defendant in this matter:</div><div>“An implied contract is one, the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct.” (Civ. Code, § 1621.) “The distinction between express and implied in fact contracts relates only to the manifestation of assent; both types are based upon the expressed or apparent intention of the parties.” (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, § 11, p. 46, italics in original.)</div><div>Without any attempt at being exhaustive, we can identify some factors which might support, or undercut, implication of an attorney-client relationship with an individual partner in any particular case. The type and size of the partnership obviously have a bearing, as already noted. So do the nature and scope of the attorney's engagement by the partnership. The kind and extent of contacts, if any, between the attorney and the individual partner might be important factors. The same is true as to the attorney's access to information (e.g., partnership financial information) relating to the individual partner's interests.</div><div>As noted earlier, the rule prohibiting simultaneous representation of adverse interests is said to be an outgrowth of the confidential nature of an attorney-client relationship. Because a client reposes confidence in his or her attorney, the attorney owes the client a duty of undivided loyalty. (E. F. Hutton &amp; Company v. Brown, supra, 305 F.Supp. at pp. 393-394; Developments in the Law-Conflicts of Interest in the Legal Profession (1981) 94 Harv.L.Rev. 1244, 1292-1315.) For that reason, we believe that in determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists in cases like this, primary attention should be given to whether the totality of the circumstances, including the parties' conduct, implies an agreement by the partnership attorney not to accept other representations adverse to the individual partner's personal interests. (See Friedman, The Creation of the Attorney-Client Relationship: An Emerging View, op. cit. supra, 22 Cal. W.L.Rev. at p. 231, suggesting that one of the most important facts involved in finding an attorney-client relationship is “the expectation of the client based on how the situation appears to a reasonable person in the client's position.”)”</div><div>Responsible Citizens, at 1732-1733, italics in original, emphasis added.</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Neither of these cases address the issue of attorney-client privilege or a common interest determination.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>Defendant argues that here, an implied attorney-client relationship arose because Mirhossein led Kamali to believe that Mirhossein represented both Kamali and Ataian when he drafted the agreement, as Kamali had previously retained Mirhossein’s services in other matters, and Mirhossein treated Kamali the way he had when representing Kamili in other matters; requesting direct feedback and changes to the agreement as a lawyer would do from his client.&nbsp; Defendant also argues that Mirhossein never told Kamali that Mirhossein was not representing Kamali or that Kamali needed to take the agreement to another lawyer for advice or review.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Kamali submits his own declaration, in which he states that in 2019 he sold his share of Saint Glen, and at the time believed he was selling his share to cross-defendant Hootian Ataian, and they went to see the lawyer Mirhosseini to prepare a stock purchase agreement.&nbsp; [Kamali Decl., para. 4].&nbsp; &nbsp;Kamali states:</div><div>“At the time Hootan and I went to see Ali, I believed that Ali was representing me and Hootan. There are multiple reasons why I believed this to be the case.&nbsp;</div><div>First, Ali led me to believe that he was representing both Hootan and I when he drafted the Agreement. When Ali initially drafted the Agreement, Ali asked Hootan and I to provide him with any feedback and let him know if we had any changes. Ali never told me that he was not my lawyer. Ali also never told me to take the Agreement to my own lawyer to get his/her advice or review.&nbsp;</div><div>Second, when Hootan and I agreed to go to Ali to draft the Agreement, I agreed to have Ali draft the Agreement because Ali’s previously represented me in other cases. Ali also prepared a contract for me for one of my Del Taco franchises. At the time Hootan and I went to Ali to draft the Agreement, I was comfortable with Ali drafting the Agreement because I trusted Ali since he represented me in the past.”</div><div>[Kamali Decl., para. 5].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Kamali indicates that at the time he “reasonably believed Ali would be neutral when preparing the Agreement,” that Ali never told him that he only represented Ataian in preparing the agreement, and that:</div><div>“To the contrary, Ali treated me the same way he treated me when he represented me in the other cases and when he drafted the contract for me. Ali would ask me for my feedback and changes to the document I requested. Ali would also answer my questions on the documents he prepared for me. Ali did the same when he prepared the Agreement.”</div><div>[Kamali Decl., para. 7].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also relies on deposition testimony of Ataian, in which Ataian testified that there was an agreed upon price with Kamali, and Ataian then suggested, evidently to Kamali and Golshan, “‘You guys should go see a lawyer.’&nbsp; And at that time both told me that,‘What your recommendation is?’” and he remembers telling them his lawyer is Ali Mirhosseini, who reviewed the contract in 2016 for the Panini, and as soon as Ataian brought it up, Kamali said, “‘Actually, I know him.&nbsp; He was my lawyer, too.&nbsp; I’ve done a few cases with him.&nbsp; Also, I’ve done one Del Taco with him; and he draft the contract.’&nbsp; And he was very comfortable with that.’”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Dominguez Decl., Ex. I, 47-48].</div><div><br></div><div>This testimony is a bit confusing, as it appears Ataian was sending Golshan and Kamali to consult Ataian’s attorney, not suggesting that the attorney would be representing Ataian and Kamali (and/or Golshan) jointly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The issue then is whether under the circumstances the situation would appear to a reasonable person in Kamali’s position to have created an expectation that the attorney was representing Kamali, as well as Ataian, giving rise to an implied attorney-client relationship.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Hence, under the circumstances, given that Kamali was an experienced business person, and evidently consulting the attorney represented to have been Ataian’s attorney for purposes of preparing documentation for an alleged transfer between Saint Glen, Talebi and Kamali as sellers, and Goshan as buyer, with Ataian as secured party, and party to a promissory note, that a reasonable person, particularly in the absence of a formal retainer, would not assume that the documentation prepared by the attorney would be reasonably to be expected to be protective of all parties.&nbsp; There is no evidence submitted of any manifestation of assent to legal representation by Kamali, and the conflict and need to consult separate counsel should have been obvious.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, the issues raised by this motion are difficult to fully analyze given the fact that neither party addresses specifically the actual Requests in the moving papers or opposition.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is not clear what documents or information is claiming to be subject to the privilege, subject to waiver, or subject to a common interest theory.&nbsp; Without a designation of specific documents and specific information relating to the scope of the disclosures already made in this litigation by the Ataian and Talebi, it is difficult to even determine if the documents and issues raised involve communications between the client and attorney made in confidence, as opposed to in the presence of non-clients, and shared with such third parties, in effect, that any particular documents included privileged information in the first instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This posture makes it extremely difficult for the court to determine if the documents contain privileged material in the first place, and to then determine if the parties were in fact aligned and had a common interest in the transaction, when it appears that their interests may have in fact been adverse to each other.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the arguments are entirely superficial, and this court is left without sufficient information to determine if any responsive documents here are protected as privileged.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court will hear argument with respect to whether the motion will be continued for a further showing, privilege log and legal argument concerning the Requests with respect to communications directly with Ataian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the lack of consent by cross-defendant Ataian, with whom the attorneys concede there is an attorney-client relationship and the requests for information specifically concerning communications between the attorneys and this witness, Requests Nos. 6-9, The court will hear argument with respect to whether the motion will be continued for a further showing, privilege log and legal argument concerning the Requests concerning communications directly with Ataian.

Costco, at 733.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, the burden has shifted to defendant to establish the subject communications were not confidential or that the privilege does not apply for other reasons.&nbsp; Defendant has failed to do so with respect to the direct communications between attorney and client, and as noted above, the court is inclined to grant the motion as to Requests Nos. 6-9, or to require a further showing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>With respect to Requests Nos. 1-4, these requests seek “all billing records” relating to Saint Glen, and the drafting of each of the three documents at issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clearly established that such billings would consist presumably of communications between the attorney and client, and the court will hear argument with respect to whether the initial burden has been met by deponents with respect to these requests, and whether if the burden has shifted, defendant can establish the communications would not be considered confidential or otherwise discoverable, as these specifics are not addressed in the opposition.&nbsp; The court notes that billings may on occasion reveal attorney-client privileged details or work product with respect to specific services performed, but neither side has made an argument concerning such arguments specifically with respect to billings.&nbsp; The court is inclined to deny the motion as to billings, again without prejudice to the deponents redacting information from billings which they believe in good faith are subject to attorney-client privilege, and to assert objections to specific questions based on such a privilege with a factual explanation on the deposition record.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request No. 5 seeks “all COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO the sale of SAINT GLEN.”&nbsp; Request No. 13 (only propounded to Mirhossieni, not MLG) seeks, “all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATING TO SAINT GLEN.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear that the showing here establishes that these requests would be subject to attorney-client privilege, except with respect to communications directly between counsel and the client Ataian.&nbsp; There is no work product argument made in the moving papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court will hear argument concerning whether these requests are subject to quashing, as they would include communications between counsel and third parties who are not the clients and may also include information which has previously been revealed by the clients in this litigation.&nbsp; The court is inclined to find that as limited to communications with other than the clients, and to information and communications not previously disclosed by the clients in this litigation, the communications and documents would be discoverable.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court is also inclined to order that if any responsive material is withheld by the deponents, the deponents must serve a privilege log.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>RULING:</div><div>Ali R.

App.4th 793 held that a trial court may on a section 664.6 motion receive evidence, determine disputed facts and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but may not create the material terms of a settlement as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves agreed to.&nbsp; Weddington, at 810.&nbsp; The trial court’s determination with respect to interpretation of the settlement agreement will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Skulnick v. Roberts Express, Inc.&nbsp; (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 884, 889.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that defendant has upheld her obligations under the Settlement Agreement and removed the encroachments in a timely manner, by hiring general contractor John Fase and his construction company JMF Construction, with the deck removal project costing $4,839.80.&nbsp; [Suzanne Bloom Decl. paras. 5-12, Ex. A].&nbsp; Evidently plaintiff Abolian initially interfered and disrupted the first day of work by refusing to allow the workers to trespass on his property to conduct the work, which defendant argues would have made removal of part of the deck more or less impossible, so that defendant’s daughter, Eva Bloom, agreed to monitor the deck removal situation each day.&nbsp; [Eva Bloom Decl. paras. 4-7].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant states in her declaration that the contractor cut off and removed approximately 127 square feet from the wood deck to comply with the settlement, and that she also had the contractor cut back the railroad ties that were slightly encroaching, and that all work was completed on January 17, 2024, in advance of the agreed upon deadline on February 1, 2024.&nbsp; [Suzanne Bloom Decl., para. 6, 12-15].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also submits evidence that although counsel has been notified that all necessary work for the removal of the encroachment had been completed, the settlement sum of $2,800 has not been paid, the matter has not been dismissed, and the lis pendens has not been withdrawn or removed.&nbsp; [Suzanne Bloom Decl., paras.&nbsp; 14, 16].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the court should accordingly enter judgment on the parties’ settlement in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, with defendant to be awarded $2,800 from plaintiff, the court ordering the lis pendens filed by plaintiff expunged, and thereafter the court ordering that the case is dismissed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs in opposition do not dispute that the encroachment has been timely removed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs argue that defendant improperly seeks payment before the actions are dismissed, and that pursuant to the settlement, the sequence of performance was for 1) defendant to remove the encroachment, 2) the parties to mutually dismiss their claims, and then 3) plaintiffs pay defendant the amount of $2,800 and the parties remove their lis pendens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that the dismissal of the action is a precondition to payment, but that defendant has refused to execute a Stipulation to dismiss or to dismiss the cross-complaint, and defendant cannot now seek specific performance or enforcement of the settlement agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs also indicate that the issue is moot because plaintiffs have tendered the $2,800 to defendant’s counsel to hold in trust pending defendant’s performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears from the transcript quoted above that the agreement was for the action to be dismissed, and then the sum would be paid and the lis pendens expunged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs rely on further excerpts of the transcript from the hearing where the settlement was placed on the record.&nbsp; Specifically, the court was concerned that the payment be made after the dismissals, which would occur after the encroachment was fixed, and that the dismissals would reserve jurisdiction under CCP section 664.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the hearing, the following was stated:</div><div>“THE COURT: WELL, THE IDEA OF HAVING IT PAID WHEN THE DISMISSALS HAPPEN IS NORMALLY THE WAY THINGS HAPPEN IN THAT THE PLAINTIFF WANTS TO KNOW I'M PAYING AND THE CASE IS OVER. IF IT'S BEING PAID EARLIER THAN THAT, THERE IS ISSUES ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE ENCROACHMENT WILL BE FIXED? HAS IT BEEN FIXED? DO WE NOW NEED TO MAKE A BUNCH OF THE MEASUREMENTS NOW TO MAKE SURE IT HAS BEEN FIXED PROPERLY AND IT DOESN'T ENCROACH ANY LONGER?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>MR.

Dismissing the complaint and cross-complaint while reserving jurisdiction to the court to enforce the settlement is what the parties had agreed to do in their settlement agreement.&nbsp; It remains necessary to make any dismissal subject to the court’s continuing jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, as such jurisdiction may be necessary to ensure that the lis pendens are removed after the dismissal.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears that what has occurred here is that the parties have determined that in order to dismiss the entire action, including both the complaint and cross-complaint, the parties needed to stipulate to the dismissal.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>After the March 4, 2024 hearing at which the court pointed out that the proposed stipulation and order which had been submitted did not properly reserve jurisdiction under CCP section 664.6, counsel for plaintiffs sent a second stipulation to counsel for defendant, which had been signed by plaintiffs, and which new proposed stipulation and order to defendant, which states that the parties stipulate that:</div><div>1.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this Action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, after it is dismissed in order to enforce the terms of the Parties’ October 4, 2023, oral settlement on the record; and</div><div>2.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The entire Action of all parties and all causes of action shall be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 with the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Parties’ October 4, 2023, oral settlement on the record.”</div><div>[DiJulio Decl., paras. 9, Ex. 7].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs’ counsel indicates that defendant “refuses to sign the ‘second’ stipulation despite my persistent inquiry and request.”&nbsp; [DiJulio Decl., para. 10].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the circumstances, the court cannot enter the orders requested by defendant without ordering the parties to first dismiss the action while reserving jurisdiction to the court to enforce the settlement pursuant to CCP section 664.6.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court would then, pursuant to the settlement agreement, order that once the dismissal is entered, the $2,800 be paid to defendant, and that the parties also remove or withdraw any lis pendens.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This result is not the order sought by the moving papers, but as noted above, on a motion under CCP section 664.6, the court may not create alternative material terms of a settlement but may make orders in accordance with the terms the parties agreed to.&nbsp; Weddington, at 810.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The motion accordingly is granted in part and is denied in part with given the discrepancy between what defendant is seeking and the terms of the agreed upon settlement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both sides also seek that they be deemed the prevailing party in this matter and be awarded attorney’s fees and costs for enforcing the settlement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant points out that the Settlement Agreement provided that the prevailing party on a motion to enforce the settlement would be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs for being required to enforce the settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As set forth above, the transcript of the hearing memorializing the settlement agreement indicates that the Settlement Agreement is intended to be subject to an “ATTORNEYS’ FEES CLAUSE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that for purposes of determining entitlement to recover costs, CCP section 1032 defines “prevailing party” to include, “a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argues that attorney’s fees are recoverable costs under section 1033.5 (a)(10), which provides that a prevailing party is entitled to recover as costs, “Attorney’s fees, when authorized by …(A) Contract.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs argue that by virtue of their opposition papers, they will have achieved their objectives in enforcing the settlement, and so should be awarded their attorney’s fees.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, defendant will not entirely prevail on this motion, and the court will not be dismissing the action in favor of defendant but ordering the parties to dismiss the action subject to a reservation of jurisdiction under CCP section 664.6.&nbsp; It also appears that defendant has failed to fully perform under the settlement agreement, so that a motion to enforce the agreement by defendant was not necessary; defendant could have avoided such a motion by performing as agreed.&nbsp; Attorney’s fees are not awarded to defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs have not brought an affirmative motion to enforce the settlement agreement and also are not awarded attorney’s fees.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in the motion also seeks sanctions against plaintiffs for allegedly engaging in a strategy of obstructive tactics in trying to stop the workers from removing the encroaching portion of the deck, in using plaintiff Shahbazian’s position as a commissioner on Glendale’s Planning Commission to secure an investigation of defendant’s property, and in withholding payment beyond the date promised by counsel as stated in open court.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argues that sanctions should be awarded against plaintiffs in the sum of $5,600, two times the amount of the $2,800 payment due.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As pointed out in the opposition, there is no statutory or other legal authority cited for the imposition of sanctions here.&nbsp; There is also no justification for a sum in the amount of double the settlement sum due.&nbsp; There was certainly no agreement in the Settlement Agreement to the imposition of a sanctions award which could be summarily determined under CCP section 664.6.&nbsp; To the extent sanctions are intended to be sought under CCP section 128.7, defendant has clearly not filed a separate motion and permitted the required safe harbor as required under that section.&nbsp; The request is denied.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Motion to Enforce the Settlement Pursuant to CCP section 664.6 and For Legal Fees and Costs of $4,887.50 Against Plaintiffs Sarmen Abolian and Talin Shahbazian is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</div><div><br></div><div>Pursuant to CCP section 664.6, the Court finds that parties to pending litigation stipulated to the settlement of the case orally before the Court.&nbsp;

Once dismissal is entered, plaintiffs and cross-defendants Sarmen Abolian and Talin Shahbazian are ordered to pay to defendant and cross-complainant Suzanne S.

Defendant began to harass plaintiff with relentless calls and messages, demanding the increased rent and threatening to evict plaintiff, ultimately serving a 60 day notice to terminate tenancy.&nbsp; &nbsp; Plaintiff sought help from Legal Aid and was informed the rent increase and notice to terminate tenancy were unlawful.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that defendant continued to harass plaintiff through the holidays and only ceased when he realized that his rent increase and notice were in fact unlawful.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived along with a number of laws and ordinances barring evictions, and defendant stopped his attempts to coerce plaintiff to move.&nbsp;</span></div><div>In December of 2021, plaintiff was rushed to the hospital for two more emergency surgeries, and in June of 2022 was again admitted to the hospital for emergency surgeries, and at all times kept defendant informed about her ongoing health complications and recovery needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that once the eviction moratorium was lifted, in March of 2023, defendant informed plaintiff he intended to modify and refurbish then sell the subject property, and that her lease would no longer be valid as of August 1, 2023.&nbsp; Defendant indicated that property taxes were too high, and that his poor investment decisions had left him in financial need.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendant insisted that the lease would be terminated, despite knowing about the requirements of a “no fault just cause” termination of tenancy, as that code section is referred to in plaintiff’s lease agreement, and that none of the justifications provided by defendant were adequate.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint alleges that defendant then renewed his campaign of harassment, subjecting plaintiff to a barrage of phone calls, text messages, letters, and voicemails, at all hours of the day and night, demanding to know when plaintiff would be leaving the property, and insisting she do so.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that beginning in August of 2023, defendant would show up at the adjacent unit at 5:45 am to conduct renovations, banging on the mailbox and wall which share a bedroom wall with plaintiff, repeatedly moving furniture in an unnecessarily loud way, and running a drill or impact driver to disrupt plaintiff’s sleep and rest, despite plaintiff’s request that defendant stop or adjust his hours so that plaintiff was not awakened before 6 a.m. every morning.&nbsp;

Defendant then sold the property and informed the buyers that plaintiff had agreed and intended to leave, despite plaintiff never having agreed to waive her lease rights.&nbsp; When the new buyers purchased the property, they immediately served plaintiff with a notice of the termination of her tenancy.</span></div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that defendant intentionally harassed and disrupted plaintiff for almost a full calendar year in the hopes that she would be forced to move despite her recovering from serious health conditions and being under no legal obligation to do so.&nbsp;

[Citation.] In recent years, the covenant of quiet enjoyment has been expanded, and in this state, for example, it insulates the tenant against any act or omission on the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which interferes with a tenant's right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.

Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant, supra, ¶ 7:42, p. 7-14.1 (rev. # 1, 2013)), such as theft, extortion, interference with a tenant's quiet enjoyment, or trespass “for the purpose of influencing a tenant to vacate a dwelling.” (Civ.

Defendant insisted that Ms. Goldmann’s lease would be terminated, despite knowing about the requirements of California Civil Code 1946.2 which sets forth the requirements of a “no fault just cause” termination of tenancy, as that code section is referenced in Ms. Goldmann’s lease agreement. None of the justifications provided by Defendant were adequate justifications for the termination of her tenancy….</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>40.&nbsp; On Sunday August 6, 2023, Defendant told Ms. Goldmann “you neither have a lease, nor do you have permission to remain in possession of the unit at 490,” despite the fact that Ms. Goldmann did in fact possess a lawful lease, and Defendant did not have sufficient grounds to terminate her tenancy under the law….</div><div><br></div><div>48.&nbsp; Through September, Defendant himself, as well as through his realtor, pressured Ms. Goldmann to sign an addendum to her lease that included additional “no fault just cause” grounds for eviction despite her having a right under California law to only sign a lease with substantially similar terms.”</div><div>[Complaint, paras. 33, 40, 48].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is a reasonable conclusion from these allegations is that the lease was in writing, and this is not a situation where it “cannot be ascertained from the pleading” that plaintiff is making such an allegation.&nbsp; Plaintiff in the opposition quotes paragraph 48 of the complaint and argues that, even if plaintiff were required to allege the form of the contract giving rise to the leasehold, it is clear from this allegation that her lease agreement was in writing, as pressure to force plaintiff to “sign an addendum to her lease,” only makes sense in the context of a written lease agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer on this ground also is overruled.&nbsp; The demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled in its entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Alter Ego Allegations&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also demurs to the paragraphs of the pleading which set forth “Joint Alter Ego Allegations,” arguing that they are improper as there are no other named defendants in this matter, and the allegations appear directed to an unspecified and unidentified business entity.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant has not brought a motion to strike, and this argument is not properly made on demurrer, as it not addressed to defeat any of the alleged causes of action.&nbsp; A demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action (or to a particular type of damage or remedy), and a cause will survive demurrer if there are sufficient allegations that might entitle the pleader to relief.&nbsp; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelop. Agency (2003, 2nd Dist.) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046; PH II, Inc. v.

Plaintiff is ignorant of the true name and capacity of the trust that owns the subject property but will amend this complaint once this information is ascertained.”</div><div>[Complaint, para. 6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that under these circumstances, the inclusion of the alter ego allegations does not render the complaint uncertain or ambiguous, as they are included in an abundance of caution given plaintiff’s ignorance of the true nature and capacity of the entities that owned the subject property.&nbsp; This approach suggests that plaintiff appropriately intends to determine through discovery what proper business entity is involved, and to then determine whether to include that business entity in this lawsuit in substitution of a Doe defendant, if proper.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer is overruled in its entirety.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED as untimely and on its merits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ten days to answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
