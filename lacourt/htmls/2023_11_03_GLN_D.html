Bank of America (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 389, 395 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 270].) “To mitigate summary judgment's harshness, the statute's drafters included a provision making continuances-which are normally a matter within the broad discretion of trial courts-virtually mandated ....” (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).) Where the opposing party submits an adequate affidavit showing that essential facts may exist but cannot be presented timely, the court must either deny summary judgment or grant a continuance. (Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 627, 633 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 780].)</div><div>Dee, at 34-35.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the declaration was timely filed, and indicates that there is good reason to believe that facts relating to plaintiff’s exposure to DuPont’s product exist even if plaintiff could not confirm such during his deposition.&nbsp; The attorney indicates it is not uncommon for plaintiffs in toxic tort cases to have difficulty recalling the particular products they used during deposition and this failure is not necessarily fatal to their cases, but that there are other ways of proving plaintiff was exposed, including expert testimony.&nbsp; [Finnerty Decl., para. 2].&nbsp; The declaration also states that more time is required to fully investigate these facts pursuant to the court’s Case Management Order, which ordered expert discovery to commence next year.&nbsp; [Finnerty Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The declaration is not ideal, as it does not directly indicate what facts are essential to justify opposition to the motion, or why these facts cannot now be presented, in effect, why additional time is needed to obtain these facts, or a showing of diligence.&nbsp; &nbsp;It can be reasonably inferred that the essential facts would include evidence that plaintiff during the course of his employment at Lockheed handled specific chemicals which were manufactured or supplied by the moving defendant DuPont, which facts and connection would not necessarily have been within the personal knowledge of plaintiff at his deposition.&nbsp; However, a showing for a continuance would ordinarily explain what specific further discovery is necessary to obtain those facts, such as that requests for production of documents are pending, or a deposition of a witness with knowledge needs to be taken, which is not done here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court is familiar with this case and has been apprised of the difficulties presented by the fact that documents in connection with the period of plaintiff’s employment at Lockheed are very old.&nbsp; It is not clear from the declaration, however, what steps have been taken by plaintiff to demonstrate diligence with respect to discovering the facts to connect moving defendant to plaintiff’s injuries.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to the Case Management Order in this case, the file shows that on March 30, 2022, the court signed and filed a stipulation, Joint Case Management Order and Request for Trial Continuance, which set the trial for July 10, 2023, and indicated that non-expert discovery was to be completed 90 days before trial, with the simultaneous disclosures of causation experts to occur on or before January 10, 2023, with schedules set for deposing those experts, and for production of certain documents in advance of the depositions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On October 27, 2022, a new Stipulation and Order Regarding Continuance of Trial and Related Deadlines was signed and filed, continuing the trial date to November 13, 2023, continuing the deadline to disclose causation experts to May 10, 2023, and continuing all related deadlines to the new trial date.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span> On May 11, 2023, the court signed and filed a third Order re: Parties’ Stipulation to Continue Trial and Related Deadlines, continuing the trial date to August 12, 2024, continuing the deadline to disclose causation experts to February 8, 2024, and continuing all other trial related deadlines relative to the trial date ordered.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This order is the one plaintiff relies on in arguing that expert discovery is not scheduled to commence until next year.&nbsp; &nbsp;The CMO and various continuances does indicate that expert discovery will commence in February of 2024 and follow a particular schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that even if relief is not strictly available under CCP section 437c(h), plaintiff should be granted a continuance in the court’s discretion, based on a finding of good cause.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on Hamilton v. Orange County Sheriff’s Dept. (2017) 8 Cal.App. 5th 759, in which the court of appeal denied a request for continuance on the ground a stipulation submitted to the court sixteen days before the summary judgment hearing to continue the hearing so that plaintiff could complete discovery did not include a showing of diligence.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal found that under the circumstances of the case, the trial court had abused its discretion.&nbsp; The court of appeal observed:</div><div>“In seeking a continuance of a summary judgment motion, a plaintiff has essentially two options. The first option is to comply with section 437c, subdivision (h), which states, “If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just. The application to continue the motion to obtain necessary discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on or before the date the opposition response to the motion is due.” “The drafters' inclusion of the italicized words ‘may’ and ‘shall’ leaves little room for doubt that such continuances are to be liberally granted. Indeed, as one court noted, ‘an opposing party can compel a continuance of a summary judgment motion’ by making a declaration meeting the requirements of section 437c, subdivision (h).” (Bahl v. Bank of America (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 389, 395–96, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 270).</div><div><br></div><div>Where a plaintiff cannot make the showing required under section 437c, subdivision (h), a plaintiff may seek a continuance under the ordinary discretionary standard applied to requests for a continuance. (Mahoney v. Southland Mental Health Associates Medical Group (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 167, 170, 272 Cal.Rptr. 602.) This requires a showing of good cause. (Id. at pp. 170–171, 272 Cal.Rptr. 602.) “[I]n deciding whether to continue a summary judgment to permit additional discovery courts consider various factors, including (1) how long the case has been pending; (2) how long the requesting party had to oppose the motion; (3) whether the continuance motion could have been made earlier; (4) the proximity of the trial date or the 30-day discovery cutoff before trial; (5) any prior continuances for the same reason; and (6) the question whether the evidence sought is truly essential to the motion.” (Chavez v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 632, 644, 189 Cal.Rptr.3d 449 (Chavez).)</div><div>Hamilton, at 764-765.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even the cases cited in the reply recognize that even where an affidavit in support of a continuance is deficient, the trial court retains discretion to grant a continuance.&nbsp; See Johnson v. Alameda County Medical Center (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 521, 533 (“The trial court was, nevertheless, free to grant a continuance under its broad discretionary power.” (citing Lerma v. County of Orange (2004) 120 Cal. App. 4th 709, 716 (“When a continuance of a summary judgment motion is not mandatory, because of a failure to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h), the court must determine whether the party requesting the continuance has nonetheless established good cause therefor. That determination is within the court's discretion.”)).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Considering the good cause factors here, the case has been pending since September 11, 2020, but as discussed above, has been subject to delays recognized as reasonable by both parties due to the timeframe of the alleged exposure.&nbsp; The trial date is now scheduled for August 12, 2024, with discovery to be cut off ninety days in advance, in mid-May of 2024, so there remains plenty of time for the parties to prepare for trial if a 60-day continuance is permitted.&nbsp; There have been no prior continuances for the same reason.&nbsp; With respect to whether the evidence sought is truly essential to the motion, it would appear that since the motion is based on plaintiff’s failure to respond at deposition with evidence concerning the substances to which he was exposed, and his purported inability to obtain evidence to support the essential element of his claims that moving defendant’s product was one to which he was exposed, the evidence at issue would be considered essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in reply argues in a footnote that expert discovery and evidence would not be sufficient to defeat the motion without plaintiff obtaining underlying evidence of the chemicals involved upon which an expert could base opinions concerning DuPont’s liability.&nbsp; The court recognizes that plaintiff’s reliance on the prematurity of conducting expert evidence is incomplete, and that plaintiff is free to submit appropriate expert evidence in response to the motion regardless of any CMO deadlines.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, given the above factors, and particularly given the apparent reliance on the specially tailored Case Management Order in this matter, and the harshness of granting a dispositive motion for summary judgment or adjudication, the court finds that good cause exists to continue the hearing in this matter for a maximum period of sixty days, and the court will exercise its discretion to permit plaintiff to conduct further discovery into facts which would justify opposition to the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If plaintiff requires any expert discovery in advance of the dates now provided in the Case Management Order, plaintiff may apply ex parte to the court for permission to conduct such discovery but must specifically demonstrate that any such discovery is essential to obtain facts necessary to oppose the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication is CONTINUED.&nbsp;</div><div>Pursuant to the request of plaintiff in the opposition papers, the Court has considered the circumstances with respect to this action and this motion, particularly the lack of immediate proximity of the trial date and the discovery cut off deadlines, the lack of any prior continuances for the same reason, the reasonable conclusion the evidence connecting moving defendant to plaintiff’s allege workplace exposure is truly essential to opposing the motion, plaintiff’s reliance on the case specific Case Management Order entered in this action, and the dispositive nature of the summary judgment or summary adjudication remedy.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court finds that sufficient good cause has been established to continue the hearing on this motion for no longer than 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Hearing is continued to January 19, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp;</div><div>Supplemental Opposition papers are to be served and filed no later than fourteen calendar days prior to the continued hearing date, by 12 pm (noon).</div><div>Supplemental Reply papers are to be served and filed no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date by 12 pm (noon).&nbsp;

Match Apparel, Inc. has become indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $152,244.49.&nbsp; The complaint alleges causes of action for open book account, account stated, and reasonable value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Mix &amp; Match Apparel, Inc. has filed a cross-complaint against Mido Trade Co., Ltd., alleging that in July and August of 2020, cross-complainant and cross-defendant entered into a written agreement by way of a series of purchase orders and invoices whereby cross-defendant agreed to sell, and cross-complainant agreed to purchase certain women’s leggings.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendant breached the contract by failing to deliver conforming goods, failing to have the goods manufactured at the main factory of cross-defendant, placing false UPC codes on the goods, failing to inspect the goods in a proper manner, and delivering goods that were “bleeding” and had sewing defects so that the goods failed to pass inspection with an acceptable defect rate.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that as a direct result of cross-defendant’s breach, cross-complainant has been damaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is also alleged that during the negotiations for the sale of the goods, cross-defendant falsely represented the goods would be manufactured at the main factory of cross-defendant, that correct UPC codes would be placed on the goods, and that the goods would be inspected in a proper manner and pass inspection at an acceptable defect rate and that the goods would otherwise conform to the specifications required by cross-complainant.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent billing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action...if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP Section 2033.290:</div><div>“(a) On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply:</div><div>(1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete.</div><div>(2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are eight RFAs at issue, which each seek admissions concerning what information plaintiff Korea Trade had concerning the claim it is suing on.&nbsp; The responses for each of the eight are the same.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, the RFAs seek the following admissions:</div><div>Request for Admission 1&nbsp;</div><div>“You did not receive any report on inspections performed on the GOODS (" GOODS" shall mean "the goods agreed to be sold and purchased between MIX &amp; MATCH APPAREL, INC.&nbsp; and MIDO TRADE CO., LTD. under a series of purchase orders and invoices memorialized in Purchase Order numbers M2001 and M2002 and Invoice numbers MIDO/M&amp;M/20201217 and MIDO/M&amp;M20201225.”</div><div><br></div><div>Request for Admission 2</div><div>“You did not verify whether the GOODS were conforming to the specifications required by MIX &amp; MATCH APPAREL, INC.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Request for Admission 3</span></div><div>“You did not verify whether MIDO ("MIDO" shall mean "MIDO TRADE CO., LTD.") had the GOODS manufactured at the main factory of MIDO.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Request for Admission 4</span></div><div>“You did not verify whether MIDO placed false UPC codes on the GOODS.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request for Admission 5</div><div>“You did not verify whether MIDO inspected the GOODS in a proper manner.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request for Admission 6</div><div>“You did not verify whether the GOODS were ‘bleeding’.”</div><div><br></div><div>Request for Admission 7</div><div>“You did not verify whether the GOODS had sewing defects.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request for Admission 8</div><div>“You did not verify whether the GOODS passed the inspection with an acceptable defect rate.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The responses are the same for each, and state:</div><div>“Responding party lacks information or personal knowledge to admit or deny to this request. Reasonable inquiry has been made and the information known or readily obtainable by the Responding party is insufficient to enable the answering party to admit or deny.&nbsp; Responding Party is not the manufacturer of the goods. Responding Party is assignee to MIDO TRADE CO., LTD.&nbsp; Despite numerous attempts, Defendant evaded Responding Party's investigation.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Mix &amp; Match argues that the requests ask Korea Trading to admit or deny what it did or did not do, as opposed to what Mido did or did not do, and so this information is within Korea Trading’s knowledge and does not require a third person’s knowledge.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that reasonable inquiry would permit the RFAs to be responded to, as if Korea Trading had only asked these of an employee or officer in charge of the Mido account, Korea Trading could have fully responded to these RFAs, based on its own acts or omissions.&nbsp; Defendant argues that the response that responding party is not the manufacturer, but an assignee, is irrelevant, as is the response that defendant evaded an investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the responses do not comply with CCP section 2033.220:</div><div>“(a) Each answer in a response to requests for admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.</div><div>(b) Each answer shall:</div><div>(1) Admit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.</div><div>(2) Deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.</div><div>(3) Specify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.”</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, section 2033.220, subdivision (c) provides:</div><div>“If a responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the information readily known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>While the responses parrot the statutory language, it is not clearly stated why the information readily obtainable by the responding party is not sufficient to enable plaintiff what measures plaintiff took to determine what plaintiff was aware of or what steps it took with respect to the rights it was assigned, which would be within the knowledge or records of plaintiff or its employees.&nbsp; If plaintiff took and sought to enforce the assigned obligations without taking any of the actions referred to in the RFAs, plaintiff should admit those facts.&nbsp; Plaintiff would retain the opportunity to argue that it stands in the shoes of the assignor, or otherwise that such admissions are of little weight with respect to defendant’s defenses or cross-complaint against Mido.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In Chodos v. Superior Court (1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 318, the Second District, in interpreting the former version of the discovery statutes, set a standard for claiming lack of information which was quite high, given the purpose of Requests for Admissions.&nbsp; The Second District stated:</div><div>“The case is controlled by the decision of the Supreme Court in Cembrook v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 423 [15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303], where the court said (at p. 429): "Most of the other discovery procedures are aimed primarily at assisting counsel to prepare for trial.&nbsp; Requests for admissions, on the other hand, are primarily aimed at setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried. Thus, such requests, in a most definite manner, are aimed at expediting the trial. For this reason, the fact that the request is for the admission of a controversial matter, or one involving complex facts, or calls for an opinion, is of no moment. If the litigant is able to make the admission, the time for making it is during discovery procedures, and not at the trial."</div><div><br></div><div>Section 2033 requires a party, if he does not admit or deny, to set forth "in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny" the matters involved. In the light of this statutory language, the validity of the Lowes' refusal to admit or deny the six requests herein involved and the propriety of the trial court's order sustaining such refusal must be judged solely by the reasons assigned by the Lowes in their "response" filed in the trial court -- namely, as to Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, that the Lowes had no "independent information" and, as to No. 41, that it called for an opinion. Neither of these grounds is tenable. (Cembrook v. Superior Court, supra, 56 Cal.2d 423.)</div><div><br></div><div>In the instant case, the declaration of plaintiffs' counsel,&nbsp; filed in connection with the hearing on the motion to compel an admission or a denial, set forth facts from which it may be inferred that the Lowes have available to them sources of information as to the matters involved. Neither these allegations nor the inference to be drawn therefrom are denied by the Lowes. Under these circumstances, it is neither unfair nor improper to require the Lowes to make such reasonable investigation as they may deem needed in order for them to determine now that, when the trial is held, they will, or they will not, dispute the matters involved.&nbsp; Neither these allegations nor the inference to be drawn therefrom are denied by the Lowes. Under these circumstances, it is neither unfair nor improper to require the Lowes to make such reasonable investigation as they may deem needed in order for them to determine now that, when the trial is held, they will, or they will not, dispute the matters involved. If the Lowes do not intend to contest any of these facts,&nbsp; the statute requires them to say so now, by an admission (for the purpose of this suit only [§ 2033, subd. (b)]). If they want to put plaintiffs to their proof, they may deny, risking, however, the possibility of being surcharged with costs if the plaintiffs ultimately prove the fact involved (§ 2034, subd. (c)).</div><div>Chodos, at 323-324.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the motion establishes that the responses do not in fact call for information within the knowledge of a third person, but information within the knowledge of responding party, “you.”&nbsp; The motion indicates that the subject set of RFAs did in fact include RFAs which called for information within the knowledge of Mido, plaintiff’s assignor, such as “MIDO failed to have the GOODS manufactured at the main factory of MIDO,” and accepted the identical responses set forth above concerning the lack of information or personal knowledge.&nbsp; The subject RFAs, however, are not directed to Mido’s conduct, but directed to plaintiff Korea Trade, and its acts or omissions.&nbsp; This information is known to plaintiff, and certainly by reasonable inquiry to its own personnel.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues broadly that the responding party is the assignee, and that it lacks information or knowledge to be able to admit or deny the subject RFAs because defendant evaded the initial investigation period.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition fails to present any legal analysis under which defendant is not entitled to discovery concerning what the assignee did or did not do or what information it did or did not obtain in connection with the obligations assigned.&nbsp; There is no legal authority cited with respect to the scope of an assignment, or the duties of an assignee, and, in any case, the broad scope of discovery appears to justify defendant and cross-complainant in pursuing this discovery to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence concerning the allegations of the cross-complaint against the assignor. The argument that defendant failed to cooperate in an initial investigation appears to concede that an initial investigation was conducted by plaintiff, the conduct and outcome of which would be within the knowledge of plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff, by directly responding to the subject RFAs based on its knowledge and reasonable investigation within its own company would not be foregoing the argument concerning any reasons it did not have the requisite knowledge.&nbsp; In fact, plaintiffs indicate in the opposition that an acceptable response should and could be that the particular RFA concerning plaintiff’s action or inaction is admitted, but plaintiff did not investigate because it had no such duty.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Further responses which fully comply with the Code and respond to the RFAs as posed in connection with plaintiff Korea Trade’s knowledge are ordered to be served.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions&nbsp;</div><div>This leaves the issue of monetary sanctions, which are sought by both sides.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>CCP § 2033.290 (d) provides that the court “shall impose a monetary sanction...against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Under CCP § 2023.010, misuse of the discovery process includes “(f) making an evasive response to discovery.”&nbsp; Where there has been a misuse of the discovery process, under Section 2023.030(a), the court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v.

&nbsp;At the hearing, the tentative ruling was adopted as the final order of the court, and the matter was continued for the filing of further declarations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The matter was then continued several times.&nbsp;

Baca.&nbsp; This left the total fees claimed in this case as $100,881.05.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>With respect to the requirement that the supplemental showing explain “how the fees are apportioned between work on the claims based on Civil Code § 1942.5, and work spent on other claims,” despite the failure of plaintiffs to offer any explanation at all concerning this matter, the court conducted a detailed analysis and was prepared to find that the reasonable fees incurred for prevailing on plaintiff’s second cause of action for Demand for Rent for Uninhabitable Dwelling under Civil Code section 1942.4, which also required evidence of breach of the implied warranty of habitability, but did not involve proof to establish six other causes of action and related damages, at 25% of the fees claimed. The court reduced the total sum claimed by obvious duplication in the billing records and was prepared to award a total sum of $24,726.51 in fees.&nbsp; [Minute Order, 09/15/2023].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the hearing, defendants requested a continuance, indicating defendants had not received notice of the motion, and the matter was continued to this date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs then filed a Second Supplemental Declaration in support of the motion, which argues, for the first time, that attorneys’ fees are awardable to plaintiffs pursuant to the written lease agreement between the parties.&nbsp; [Second Supp. Grace Decl., p. 5].&nbsp; Plaintiffs submit a copy of the written Rental Contract between plaintiffs and what appears to be the previous owner/landlord, which plaintiffs indicate was introduced into evidence as Exhibit 17 at trial.&nbsp; [Second Supp. Grace Decl., para. 3, Ex. A].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs rely on paragraph 15 of that Rental Contract, which provides:</div><div>“15.&nbsp; COURT COSTS:&nbsp; Resident agrees to pay all court costs and Attorney’s fees incurred by the Owner in enforcing legal action or any of the Owner’s other rights under this agreement or any state law. In the event any portion of this Agreement shall be found to be unsupportable under the law, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and subject to enforcement in the courts without exception.”</div><div>[Second Supp. Grace Decl., para. 3, Ex. A, p. 2, para. 15].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that defendants, as the successor owner and manager of the subject property within the meaning of Civil Code section 1962 (c), succeed to the rights and duties under the Rental Contract after a change in ownership or management, step into the shoes of the prior landlord, and assume the terms and conditions of the lease the tenants had with the prior owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also argue that although the provision applies only for an award of attorneys’ fees to the “Owner,” under the reciprocity provisions of Civil Code section 1717, the prevailing party in a contract dispute is entitled to recover attorney’s fees if the contract provides for attorney’s fees to be awarded to one of the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that based upon the broad language of the Rental Contract, plaintiffs are entitled to an award of all attorney’s fees for each and every cause of action, as all conduct which gave rise to the emotional distress and other damages arose from a violation of the Rental Contract, and the failure of defendants to comply with landlord tenant law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is the first time that plaintiffs have argued that they are entitled to fees under contract, have asserted the various arguments pursuant to which such fees are awardable under contract, and have requested that all fees, not just fees under statute, are properly awardable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in opposition argue that plaintiffs are requesting attorneys’ fees in the lead case as well as the related case for all causes of action, although only a single cause of action has a statutory recovery for fees.&nbsp; Defendants also argue that no delineation of the fees is made at all, and then argues that the billings for each of plaintiff’s attorneys contain double billings and overinflated requests without any details, and that plaintiff’s attorneys have refused to produce or serve the details of their requests.&nbsp; Defendants have not responded to the argument that fees are available as to all causes of action based on the provisions of the Rental Contract.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that, specifically, without consent from defendants, plaintiffs have been using a third-party service company to serve motions and supporting declarations, which form of service defendants have rejected, resulting in defendants not receiving post-judgment documents, with plaintiffs refusing to serve the papers directly through email with appropriate attachments, instead indicating defendants could acquire the subject documents online themselves.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition is confusing, as defendants appear to argue that they have not received any documents beyond the declarations of counsel, which fail to provide evidence as to the hours spent, but then also argue that there is double billing and referring to plaintiffs submitting “a commingled billing statement for the matters.”&nbsp; [Opposition, p. 4:18-19].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears, then, that defendants are in possession of the billing statements which have been submitted by plaintiffs but have chosen not to address them.&nbsp; Instead, defendants object to the manner of service by electronic service through what defendants indicate is an unreliable third party service and argue that they have not been directly served with the relevant documents.&nbsp; Defendants argue that this violates defendants’ due process, and request that the court deny the motion, or, in the alternative, reduce the requested fees awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Alternatively, defendants request that plaintiffs serve their motion papers either as paper copies or PDF documents transmitted to the defense.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court had reasonably expected that the supplemental papers and opposition would address issues from the court’s previous tentative ruling, including the appropriate allocation of the fees between the two related cases, and between the statutory claims and other claims.&nbsp; It was not expected that an entirely new basis for an award of attorneys’ fees be raised by the plaintiffs, or that defendants, which concede they have access to a copy of the billings submitted with the papers filed prior to the previous hearing, would not review the billings entries and make specific arguments concerning the reasonableness of the time spent, and its relationship to the pertinent issues in connection with the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, the court finds that because plaintiffs have now raised issues which were not raised in the moving papers, and it is not clear that all of the moving papers are properly before all parties with the opportunity to address the papers at the current hearing date of November 3, 2023, good cause exists to continue the hearing on the motion for attorney’s fees to ensure that proper notice and opportunity to be heard on all issues is provided.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The hearing is continued to December 8, 2023 (60 days) to allow defendants to respond to all arguments made by plaintiffs in the moving papers, the supplemental papers and the second supplemental papers.&nbsp; Specifically, defendants are permitted to respond to the issue that plaintiffs seek all fees under the attorney’s fees provision of the Rental Contract, not just statutory fees under Civil Code section 1942.5.&nbsp; The supplemental opposition may be up to 20 pages long, to permit defendants to respond to the attorneys’ fees sought pursuant to contract, including, if warranted, the issues of successor liability, the reciprocity doctrine, and the reach of the particular attorneys’ fees provision at issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants will address all grounds raised by the moving papers, even if addressed previously, including the allocation of the fees between the two related cases, and any specific items in the billings which defendants find appropriate to challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court requires a detailed opposition addressed to the claimed hourly rate, the matters charged, and defendants’ proposal of an appropriate alternative number for any attorneys’ fees award, and the basis for that number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This will be the final continuation of the hearing on the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs are ordered to serve all moving documents, including the original moving papers filed on November 22, 2022, the supplemental declarations and supporting papers and exhibits filed on August 23, 2023, and the second supplemental declaration and supporting papers and exhibits filed on September 25, 2023, and all other previously filed and served relevant documents no later than November 7, 2023.

Baca.&nbsp; This left the total fees claimed in this case as $101,093.07.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>With respect to the requirement that the supplemental showing explain “how the fees are apportioned between work on the claims based on Civil Code § 1942.5, and work spent on other claims,” despite the failure of plaintiffs to offer any explanation at all concerning this matter, the court conducted a detailed analysis and was prepared to find that the reasonable fees incurred for prevailing on plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for Demand for Rent for Uninhabitable Dwelling under Civil Code section 1942.4 because there was no Certificate of Occupancy for plaintiffs’ unit, were limited to the lack of Certificate of Occupancy, with no establishment of breach of the warranty of habitability in connection with the alleged violation, so that the attorney time spent to establish the lack of the Certificate of Occupancy to support the cause of action was very limited.&nbsp; The court found that most of the time in the matter was spent pursuing and presenting at trial evidence concerning attempts to evict plaintiffs, and other claims related to the ten other causes of action and was prepared to find it reasonable to allocate 10% of the time spent by plaintiffs’ attorneys to prevailing on the statutory cause of action.&nbsp; The court reduced the total sum claimed by obvious duplication in the billing records and was prepared to award a total sum of $9,911.80 in fees.&nbsp; [Minute Order, 09/15/2023, pp. 9, 10].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the hearing, defendants requested a continuance, indicating defendants had not received notice of the motion, and the matter was continued to this date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs then filed a Second Supplemental Declaration in support of the motion, which argues, for the first time, that attorneys’ fees are awardable to plaintiffs pursuant to the written lease agreement between the parties.&nbsp; [Second Supp. Grace Decl., p. 5].&nbsp; Plaintiffs submit a copy of the written Rental Contract between plaintiff Raul Mendoza and what appears to be the previous owner/landlord, which plaintiffs indicate was introduced into evidence as Exhibit 17 at trial.&nbsp; [Second Supp. Grace Decl., para. 3, Ex. A].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs rely on paragraph 15 of that Rental Contract, which provides:</div><div>“15.&nbsp; COURT COSTS:&nbsp; Resident agrees to pay all court costs and Attorney’s fees incurred by the Owner in enforcing legal action or any of the Owner’s other rights under this agreement or any state law. In the event any portion of this Agreement shall be found to be unsupportable under the law, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and subject to enforcement in the courts without exception.”</div><div>[Second Supp. Grace Decl., para. 3, Ex. A, p. 2, para. 15].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that defendants, as the successor owner and manager of the subject property within the meaning of Civil Code section 1962 (c), succeed to the rights and duties under the Rental Contract after a change in ownership or management, step into the shoes of the prior landlord, and assume the terms and conditions of the lease the tenants had with the prior owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also argue that although the provision applies only for an award of attorneys’ fees to the “Owner,” under the reciprocity provisions of Civil Code section 1717, the prevailing party in a contract dispute is entitled to recover attorney’s fees if the contract provides for attorney’s fees to be awarded to one of the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that based upon the broad language of the Rental Contract, plaintiffs are entitled to an award of all attorney’s fees for each and every cause of action, as all conduct which gave rise to the emotional distress and other damages arose from a violation of the Rental Contract, and the failure of defendants to comply with landlord tenant law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is the first time that plaintiffs have argued that they are entitled to fees under contract, have asserted the various arguments pursuant to which such fees are awardable under contract, and have requested that all fees, not just fees under statute, are properly awardable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants have not filed timely opposition to the motion in this case.&nbsp; &nbsp;Counsel for plaintiffs has confirmed that the only written opposition which was served was an opposition in the related case, Leyva, et al. v. Baca, et al.&nbsp; &nbsp;That opposition was filed under the related case number but appears intended to address both cases.&nbsp; The court will reluctantly consider those opposition arguments in connection with this matter, but counsel for defendants is cautioned that in the future, all filings in this matter must be filed and served in this matter, not just in the related case.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in the opposition in Levya argue that plaintiffs are requesting attorneys’ fees in the lead case as well as the related case for all causes of action, although only a single cause of action has a statutory recovery for fees.&nbsp; Defendants also argue that no delineation of the fees is made at all, and then argues that the billings for each of plaintiff’s attorneys contain double billings and overinflated requests without any details, and that plaintiff’s attorneys have refused to produce or serve the details of their requests.&nbsp; Defendants have not responded to the argument that fees are available as to all causes of action based on the provisions of the Rental Contract.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that, specifically, without consent from defendants, plaintiffs have been using a third-party service company to serve motions and supporting declarations, which form of service defendants have rejected, resulting in defendants not receiving post-judgment documents, with plaintiffs refusing to serve the papers directly through email with appropriate attachments, instead indicating defendants could acquire the subject documents online themselves.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition is confusing, as defendants appear to argue that they have not received any documents beyond the declarations of counsel, which fail to provide evidence as to the hours spent, but then also argue that there is double billing and referring to plaintiffs submitting “a commingled billing statement for the matters.”&nbsp; [Opposition, p. 4:18-19].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears, then, that defendants are in possession of the billing statements which have been submitted by plaintiffs but have chosen not to address them.&nbsp; Instead, defendants object to the manner of service by electronic service through what defendants indicate is an unreliable third-party service and argue that they have not been directly served with the relevant documents.&nbsp; Defendants argue that this violates defendants’ due process, and request that the court deny the motion, or, in the alternative, reduce the requested fees awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Alternatively, defendants request that plaintiffs serve their motion papers either as paper copies or PDF documents transmitted to the defense.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court had reasonably expected that the supplemental papers and opposition would address issues from the court’s previous tentative ruling, including the appropriate allocation of the fees between the two related cases, and between the statutory claims and other claims.&nbsp; It was not expected that an entirely new basis for an award of attorneys’ fees be raised by plaintiffs, or that defendants, which concede they have access to a copy of the billings submitted with the papers filed prior to the previous hearing, would not review the billings entries and make specific arguments concerning the reasonableness of the time spent, and its relationship to the pertinent issues in connection with the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, the court finds that because plaintiffs have now raised issues which were not raised in the moving papers, and it is not clear that all of the moving papers are properly before all parties with the opportunity to address the papers at the current hearing date of November 3, 2023, good cause exists to continue the hearing on the motion for attorney’s fees to ensure that proper notice and opportunity to be heard on all issues is provided.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The hearing is continued to December 8, 2023 (60 days) to allow defendants to respond to all arguments made by plaintiffs in the moving papers, the supplemental papers and the second supplemental papers.&nbsp; Specifically, defendants are permitted to respond to the issue that plaintiffs seek all fees under the attorney’s fees provision of the Rental Contract, not just statutory fees under Civil Code section 1942.5.&nbsp; The supplemental opposition may be up to 20 pages long, to permit defendants to respond to the attorneys’ fees sought pursuant to contract, including, if warranted, the issues of successor liability, the reciprocity doctrine, and the reach of the particular attorneys’ fees provision at issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants will address all grounds raised by the moving papers, even if addressed previously, including the allocation of the fees between the two related cases, and any specific items in the billings which defendants find appropriate to challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court requires a detailed opposition addressed to the claimed hourly rate, the matters charged, and defendants’ proposal of an appropriate alternative number for any attorneys’ fees award, and the basis for that number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This will be the final continuation of the hearing on the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs are ordered to serve all moving documents, including the original moving papers filed on November 22, 2022, the supplemental declarations and supporting papers and exhibits filed on August 23, 2023, and the second supplemental declaration and supporting papers and exhibits filed on September 25, 2023, and all other previously filed and served relevant documents no later than November 7, 2023. Service is to be by direct email from plaintiffs’ counsel to defendants’ counsel’s email, with pdf documents attached directly to and accessible from the direct email message.&nbsp; Plaintiffs also are to serve all documents by follow up mailing the same date, with hard copies mailed to defendants’ counsel’s mailing address of record.&nbsp; Plaintiffs also are ordered to deliver courtesy copies of all documents to the court no later than two calendar weeks prior to the continued hearing on the motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants’ opposition must be filed and served by electronic service no later than fifteen court days prior to the continued hearing date, by 12:00 pm (noon), with courtesy copies of all opposition papers to be delivered to the court on the date opposition is filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs’ reply papers are due no later than nine court days prior to the continued hearing date, by 12:00 pm (noon), with courtesy copies to be delivered to the court on the date reply is filed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Expenses:</div><div>Motion is CONTINUED to December 8, 2023 (60 days) (FINAL CONTINUANCE), to allow defendants to respond to all arguments made by plaintiffs in the moving papers, the supplemental papers and the second supplemental papers.&nbsp; Specifically, defendants are permitted to respond to the issue that plaintiffs seek all fees under the attorney’s fees provision of the Rental Contract, not just statutory fees under Civil Code section 1942.5.&nbsp; The supplemental opposition memorandum may be up to 20 pages long, to permit defendants to respond to the attorney’s fees sought pursuant to contract, including, if warranted, the issues of successor liability, the reciprocity doctrine, and the reach of the particular attorneys’ fees provision at issue.&nbsp; Defendants are expected to address all grounds raised by the moving papers, even if addressed previously, including the allocation of the fees between the two related cases, and any specific items in the billings which defendants find appropriate to challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court requires a detailed opposition addressed to the claimed hourly rate, the matters charged, and defendants’ proposal of an appropriate alternative number for any attorney’s fees award, and the basis for that number.&nbsp; The submission of an opposition of 20 pages in length is optional, depending on defendants’ preference.&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiffs are ordered to serve all moving documents, including the original moving papers filed on November 22, 2022, the supplemental declarations and supporting papers and exhibits filed on August 23, 2023, and the second supplemental declaration and supporting papers and exhibits filed on September 25, 2023, and all other previously filed and served relevant documents no later than November 7, 2023.
