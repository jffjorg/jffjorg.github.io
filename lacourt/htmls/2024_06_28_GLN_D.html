A].&nbsp; Dr. Margossian is evidently a subsequent treater of plaintiff for his dental issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Counsel for defendant has determined that Dr. Margossian is employed with Burbank Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, and defendant issued a deposition subpoena for production of business records to the entity for the records of plaintiff.&nbsp; [Zaragoza Decl., Exs. B, C].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The subpoena is directed to the Custodian of Records for Burbank Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery, at the address identified in the special interrogatories for Dr. Margossian, 239 West Olive Avenue, Burbank.&nbsp; [Zaragoza Decl., Ex. C].&nbsp; The subpoena seeks:&nbsp;</div><div>“ANY AND ALL MEDICAL RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, MEDICAL REPORTS, INCLUDING DOCTORS' ENTRIES, NURSES' CHARTS, PROGRESS REPORTS, PHYSICAL THERAPY RECORDS, PATHOLOGY REPORTS, X-RAY REPORTS, ALL FILMS, ORIGINAL X-RAY FILMS, MRl'S, CT SCANS, X-RAY REPORTS, LAB REPORTS, CASE HISTORY, EMERGENCY ROOM RECORDS, ADMtmNG SHEETS, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, CONDITION, DISCHARGE, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL DENTAL RECORDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: COPY OF FRONT/BACK OF TREATMENT FILE FOLDERS; DENTIST NOTES; DENTAL ASSISTANT NOTES; HYGIENISTS RECORDS; STUDY MODELS; CASTS; MOLDS; SLIDES; PHOTOGRAPHS; SKETCHES; TRACINGS; DIAGRAMS; DENTAL APPLIANCES; WAX-UPS; DRAWINGS; NOTES; CORRESPONDENCE; ALL COMPUTER GENERATED NOTES; LETTERS, PHONE MESSAGES, ALL BILLINGS, STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS, WRITINGS, AND DOCUMENTS REFLECTING THE FOLLOWING: ANY AND ALL PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED IN REFERENCE TO SAID PATIENT, ANY AND ALL CREDITS, ADJUSTMENTS, WRITE.OFFS, RECONCILIATIONS, CONTRACT PRICE PAYMENTS OR REDUCTION, PAYMENTS BY ANY HEAL TH INSURANCE ENTITY, PERSONAL PAYMENTS BY OR TO SAID PATIENT FROM ANY SOURCE, HMO, PPO, MEDI-CAL, MEDICARE OR CONTRACT PAYMENTS BY ANY ENTITY CONCERNING SAID PATIENT, BILLING LEDGERS, REPORTS AND/OR STATEMENTS OF CHARGES RENDERED ANO ANY INSURANCE RECORDS.

D, F].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2020.220(c) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(c) Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service&nbsp;</div><div>(1) Personal attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies.</div><div>(2)&nbsp; &nbsp;Any specified production, inspection, testing and sampling....”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, the court had been previously unable to determine if the subpoena had been personally served on the custodian of records of the deponent, or that defendant had obtained personal jurisdiction over the deponent.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant has now submitted the proof of service, which shows that the subpoena was personally delivered to “NATALIE (NO LAST NAME PROVIDED,” the Custodian of Records for Burbank Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery, on April 4, 2023.&nbsp; [Hudson Decl., para. 1, Ex. G].&nbsp; &nbsp;The deponent has now also been served with the supplemental declaration and notice of continuance of the hearing date.&nbsp; It is not clear that the individual personally served was confirmed to be the custodian of records, or that the other documents were served on a confirmed custodian of records.&nbsp; &nbsp;This issue will be discussed at the hearing.&nbsp; If the court is satisfied that service has been properly made, and there continues to be no opposition to the motion, the court’s order of June 17, 2024 will stand, and the motion will be granted, as the subpoena seeks discoverable records, which were not produced in accordance with the subpoena, by April 17, 2023, and the paperwork appears in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to sanctions, which are sought against the deponent, monetary sanctions for the expense of bringing this motion are sought pursuant to CCP section 2020.240, which provides:</div><div>“A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena in any manner described in subdivision (c) of Section 2020.220 may be punished for contempt under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) without the necessity of a prior order of court directing compliance by the witness. The deponent is also subject to the forfeiture and the payment of damages set forth in Section 1992.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP section 1992:</span></div><div>“A person failing to appear pursuant to a subpoena or a court order also forfeits to the party aggrieved the sum of five hundred dollars ($500), and all damages that he or she may sustain by the failure of the person to appear pursuant to the subpoena or court order, which forfeiture and damages may be recovered in a civil action.”</div><div>(Emphasis added)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The statute accordingly requires that a separate civil action be filed to obtain forfeiture and damages under this section.&nbsp; While the California Supreme Court has noted that this is an impractical remedy (see New York Times v.

Once the remodeling was complete, the property would be sold by defendant Assali acting as the selling agent, or rented out, and plaintiff would receive the net profit from the sale of each property.&nbsp; It was also agreed that invoices for all expenses would be provided to plaintiff, and that plaintiff could demand the return of his investment at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff formed and registered CARP Property, LLC to purchase properties to be remodeled and sold.&nbsp; After two successful property flips, defendant Assali insisted that CARP Property, LLC no longer be used to purchase the investment properties, but that all future transactions should go through defendant personally or through his corporation, defendant UASA, LLC. Plaintiff agreed to this modification of the terms of the original agreement.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint alleges that plaintiff transferred further funds to Assali to be used to purchase two properties in Long Beach, and further funds were provided for Long Beach flip supplies and a porch add on, but Assali did not provide plaintiff with any of the profits from the sale of the properties being flipped, insisting that the profits be added to the original investment to have more capital to purchase more properties, or higher valued properties.&nbsp; Sometime thereafter, defendant stopped sharing details of the properties with plaintiff.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that in December of 2018, a property in Glendale was successfully flipped, and that, upon information and belief, from 2018 to 2020, Assali purchased multiple properties that were eventually sold for a profit. When Assali’s communications with plaintiff became inconsistent and defendant stopped involving plaintiff in the details of the properties being purchased and sold, plaintiff requested that Assali repay plaintiff whatever plaintiff was owed.&nbsp; After making three payments through UASA, LLC to either CARP Property LLC or to plaintiff, Assali claimed he was not able to return the remaining funds owed to plaintiff and that he would return the money on the next property flips. Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff has made multiple demands for Assali to return the amount owed to plaintiff, but Assali has refused to return plaintiff’s money, and ignored plaintiff’s demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Motion to Seal</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Unredacted Documents Filed on eCourt&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants have filed a motion to seal an exhibit to the Gallagher Declaration submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment, as well as the separate statement portions which reference the information in that document.&nbsp; Defendants argue that the records should be ordered to be sealed, or submitted as redacted, so not placed in the public record.&nbsp; &nbsp;It does not appear that moving parties have followed the correct procedures for obtaining an order to file material under seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>CRC Rule 2.551 sets forth the required procedures for a motion requesting that a record be filed under seal, and provides, in pertinent part, beginning with section (b)(4):</span></div><div><br></div><div>“(4) Lodging of record pending determination of motion or application</div><div>The party requesting that a record be filed under seal must lodge it with the court under (d) when the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it or the record has previously been lodged under (3)(A)(i).

On receipt of this notification, the clerk must unseal and file the record.

Defendants have also filed on eCourt an “unredacted” version of defendants’ separate statement which includes the material at UMF Nos.&nbsp; 24-30.&nbsp; Those materials are now in the public record, and it is not clear how that can be undone.&nbsp; At best, the court could order the entire Gallagher Declaration and separate statement stricken, but it appears the system is unable to strike just one exhibit to an efiled document or interlineate a separate statement to make redactions.&nbsp; &nbsp; Defendants would then be required to file another motion to obtain an order to have the properly lodged redacted declaration and material filed in the public record.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This issue will be discussed at the hearing, as it appears that any purportedly private information has now been publicly disclosed, and the most efficient way of handling this error is to allow the filing to stand as made and proceed to consider the material as publicly available records in connection with the pending motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Substantive</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants seek to file under seal an Income and Expense Declaration (IED) filed by plaintiff Rafi Tarakjian as petitioner in a family law matter, and certain references to that IED in the separate statement.

A].&nbsp; Defendant relies on the declaration of its employee Aida Reganyan, who works in the admissions department of Leisure Glen, and who states:</div><div>“ROSALBA FLORECIO voluntarily signed the attached Arbitration Agreement on behalf of, and at the request of, CARMEN MARTINEZ, which was not a requirement for her admission.&nbsp; Per my custom and practice, I would have approached CARMEN MARTINEZ about the admission paperwork and the arbitration agreement and would have obtained consent from CARMEN MARTINEZ to have ROSALBA FLORENCIO sign those documents on her behalf.”</div><div>[Reganyan Decl., para. 6].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs in opposition argue that defendant cannot meet its burden of demonstrating that a valid arbitration agreement exists, because defendant cannot meet its burden to prove that a proper agency relationship existed between plaintiff Florencio and decedent Martinez.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that the declaration of Reganyan is extremely weak evidence, essentially admitting that Reganyan has no direct recollection of what occurred with this particular admission, and failing to offer any affirmative facts supporting the conclusion that consent from decedent was in fact obtained, only that Reganyan “would have obtained” such consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argue that to the extent defendant appears to argue that consent was obtained from decedent and an agency relationship confirmed, this is not what occurred.&nbsp; Plaintiffs submit a declaration of the daughter, plaintiff Florencio, in which she states:</div><div>“4.&nbsp; My mother never authorized me to sign any document for her at Leisure Glen, neither orally nor through any actions of hers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>5. I remember Aida Reganyan. I remember meeting with her. She never spoke with my mother, my mother did not speak or understand English.

I have never dealt with a nursing home before, I thought this was all normal, in hindsight I feel betrayed by Aida Reganyan who I thought was being nice to me….

Molinari (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1230:</div><div>&nbsp;“In determining whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists, the initial burden is on the party petitioning to compel arbitration. “Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to granting the petition, the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v.

Once the petitioner has met that burden, the burden shifts to the party opposing arbitration, to “produc[e]&nbsp; evidence of, and prov[e] by a preponderance of the evidence, any fact necessary to the defense.” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin.

Libby Care Center, Inc. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 298, the Second District affirmed a trial court order denying a petition to compel arbitration, in a case where decedent’s adult daughters had signed arbitration agreements after their comatose mother had been admitted to a skilled nursing facility, where there was no evidence that the daughters had authority from their mother to do so:</div><div>“Defendants bore the burden of establishing a valid agreement to arbitrate. Defendants admit Johnnie Pagarigan did not sign either arbitration agreement. They further admit Ms. Pagarigan was mentally incompetent at the time she was admitted to Magnolia Gardens and at the time her daughters signed the arbitration agreements approximately a week later. There was no evidence Ms. Pagarigan had signed a durable power of attorney. It necessarily follows Ms. Pagarigan lacked the capacity to authorize either daughter to enter into the arbitration agreements on her behalf. Consequently, no valid arbitration contract exists.”</div><div>Pagarigan, at 302, footnote omitted.</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District went on to reject arguments that the daughters obtained such authority by being next of kin, or because they were statutorily authorized to make medical decisions on their mother’s behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also rely on Goliger v. AMS Properties, Inc. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 374, 375-376, in which the Second District, following Pagarigan, affirmed the trial court’s denial of a petition to compel arbitration, where a daughter had signed the arbitration agreement as the “responsible party” for her mother, rejecting arguments that agency had been established in the case because the mother had permitted the daughter to make medical decisions for her:</div><div>“AMS tries to distinguish Pagarigan. It notes that the mother in that case was comatose and therefore could not consent to her children making any decisions for her. Thus, it was reasonable, AMS argues, for the court to limit the children to those choices permitted them by statute regarding medical care, but to refuse to make them her agents for other purposes. Here, in contrast, mother was mentally alert and consented to Binshtock making health care decisions for her. Thus, there was no similar reason in AMS's view to narrowly construe the grant of such powers. AMS's argument does not, however, justify expanding Binshtock's powers beyond what the evidence shows mother permitted. The record shows mother allowed Binshtock to make medical decisions for her. As the Pagarigan court stated in words that are equally appropriate here, “[the nursing home d]efendants do not explain how the next of kin's authority to make medical treatment decisions for the patient … translates into authority to sign an arbitration agreement on the patient's behalf at the request of the nursing home.” (Pagarigan, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at p. 302.)&nbsp;</div><div>Goliger, at 377.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Here, the evidence that the mother designated plaintiff Florencio as her agent is extremely weak, and inconsistent with decedent speaking Spanish. There is no dispute that there was no written power of attorney of any breadth at all.&nbsp; [Florencio Decl., paras. 9, 20]. It also appears that at the time of the alleged agency decedent was competent and able to make her own decisions.&nbsp; [Florencia Decl., para. 14].&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that under those circumstances, any argument that defendant obtained some sort of consent from decedent to have her daughter act as her agent, outside the presence of any family member or any witness whatsoever, is highly suspicious.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Although not cited by the parties, the California Supreme Court has recently, on March 28, 2024,&nbsp; emphasized the need to examine any agency on the part of an adult child in cases such as this because even a written agency agreement, in the form of a power of attorney for health care, for an agent to make “health care decisions” for another, would not confer agency to enter into an optional, separate arbitration agreement.&nbsp; See Harrod v. Country Oaks Partners, LLC (2024) 15 Cal. 5th 939, 946, 964.&nbsp; Here, where there is no showing of any agency agreement with respect to the authority of Florencio to bind decedent, other than a poorly supported oral assent, it would appear that any alleged actual or ostensible agency should be similarly scrutinized.&nbsp; It does not appear that agency to accept an arbitration agreement and waive the right to the constitutionally protected right to trial by jury has been sufficiently established here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs also argue that the circumstances appear to present a situation where defendant has failed to comply with Health &amp; Safety Code section 1599.65 (a), which applies to admission contracts for long-term health care facilities, and provides:</span></div><div>“(a) Prior to or at the time of admission, the facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the content of the contract to, and obtain on the contract the signature of, the person who is to be admitted to the facility.

In the event the patient is unable to sign the contract, the reason shall be documented in the resident's medical record by the admitting physician. This provision does not preclude the facility from obtaining the signature of an agent, responsible party, or a legal representative, if applicable.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs argue here that decedent did not co-sign the documents, and the moving papers fail to submit any evidence suggesting that it was documented in decedent’s medical records by the admitting physician that decedent was unable to sign the contract.&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that the Reganyan Declaration, in which the admissions employee describes a “custom and practice” with respect to “residents who were alert and oriented at least x2 upon admission,” to “offer the admission agreement and arbitration agreement to their legal representative/family member…” suggests that the facility was routinely violating this statute in connection with its residents.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The fact remains here that there is insufficient evidence of conduct by decedent which gives rise to an agency, so that defendant has failed to meet its burden on this motion.&nbsp; In Rogers v.

Hoyman, an individual, was personally served with the summons and complaint on May 3, 2024, at the address defendant identifies as defendant Hoyman’s address in the caption of the moving papers.&nbsp; The proof of service is signed under penalty of perjury by the process server.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving defendant does not in his declaration under penalty of perjury submitted with the motion state any facts which would suggest this service did not occur as represented in the proof of service.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff has pointed out this fact in the opposition.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant instead argues that service here was not properly made because defendant does not recognize as valid the papers and process made “for the reason that the papers do not contain a valid seal,” and “for the reason that the seal of the court was not affixed to the purported summons page…”&nbsp; [Hoyman Decl., paras. 3, 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The argument seems to be that because the summons includes these purported defects, the service of that summons was insufficient to require defendant to respond to the summons or to obtain personal jurisdiction over defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The questions remains whether the summons is defective and insufficient as a matter of law.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant relies on CCP section 153, which states:</div><div>“Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the seal of a court need not be affixed to any proceeding therein, or to any document, except to the following:</div><div>(a) A writ.</div><div>(b) A summons.</div><div>(c) A warrant of arrest.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the legislatively-mandated seal for a superior court can be found in Government Code section 68076, which states:</div><div>“The seals of the superior courts shall:</div><div>(a) Be circular.</div><div>(b) Be not less than one and one-fourth inches in diameter.</div><div>(c) Have in the center any word, words, or design adopted by the judges of the superior court.</div><div>(d) Have inscribed around the central words or design “Superior Court of California, County of [___],” inserting the name of the county.</div><div>The seal of any such court, which has been adopted before April 1, 1880, shall be the seal of such court until another is adopted.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the image at the bottom-left of the summons here measures one inch in diameter, rather than the required one and one-fourth inches.&nbsp; There is no indication that the subject seal was not adopted before April 1, 1880.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the factual basis for this argument is without merit, as the copy of the seal attached to the motion measures 1.3 inches, in excess of the 1 and ¼ inches required.&nbsp; This situation in fact appears to be the case because the diameter of the document submitted at 100% image measuring 1 inch and 6/16 or 3/8 inches.&nbsp; [See motion, Hoyman Decl., para. 1, Ex. A].&nbsp; This is 2/16, or 1/8 of an inch greater the 1 and ¼ inches required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, the defendant in the moving papers cites to CCP section 412.20, but fails to include all sections of that statute, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) Except as otherwise required by statute, a summons shall be directed to the defendant, signed by the clerk and issued under the seal of the court in which the action is pending, and it shall contain:</div><div>(1)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span> The title of the court in which the action is pending.</div><div>(2)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The names of the parties to the action.</div><div>(3)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A direction that the defendant file with the court a written pleading in response to the complaint within 30 days after summons is served on him or her….”</div><div>(c)&nbsp; A summons in a form approved by the Judicial Council is deemed to comply with this section.”&nbsp;</div><div>(emphasis added).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There is no question that the summons at issue was prepared and signed by the clerk of the court, on the “Form Adopted for Mandatory Use, Judicial Council of California.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Ex.

Komisar and Shut alleged that the walls, pool decks, foundation, fences, and gas, water, drain and electrical lines had been in existence at their current locations for more than five years prior to the filing of the present lawsuit, and that cross-complainants were entitled to a prescriptive easement to use the Mellenthin property for those alleged encroachments.&nbsp; In the alternative, cross-complainants alleged that during a remodeling project and public hearings for the remodeling project, Michael Mellenthin, an experienced residential property developer and retired licensed general contractor, reviewed the construction plans, and represented that he knew the plan included encroachments on his property but did not care about them, but that his only concern was that the project have adequate drainage so that no water would flow from the Komisar property to the Mellenthin property.&nbsp; &nbsp;After the hearing, and the approval of the plans, cross-complainants proceeded with the remodeling project, and so alleged that if they were not entitled to a prescriptive easement, they were entitled to have an equitable or other easement to use that portion of the Mellenthin property containing alleged encroachments, particularly if the award of such equitable easement was conditioned on cross-complainants paying cross-defendants the reasonable value of said easements.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleged that removing the retaining wall would remove the lateral support for cross-complainants’ driveway and create a soil subsidence issue on the Mellenthin property, that the removal of the pool deck would endanger the structural integrity of the structure, and that moving gas, water, drain and electrical lines would be prohibitively expensive, and of negligible harm to cross-defendants, when the lines were not interfering with the Mellenthins’ use of the ornamental landscape then being maintained.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cross-complaint sought a determination of title to prescriptive, equitable or other easements for the encroaching structures, and a judicial determination as to the rights and duties of the parties concerning those structures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that the matter went to a court trial in November of 2017 through January of 2018.&nbsp; Post-trial briefs and motions were filed, and on April 25, 2018, the court issued and served it Statement of Decision, which was to issue a mandatory injunction for defendants’ trespass as to a large pillar encroachment [Encroachment No. 2], and for defendants’ trespass as to the electrical and plumbing encroachment [Encroachment No. 4], and to issue a license to defendants for the driveway wall encroachment [Encroachment No. 1] and the pool deck wall encroachment [Encroachment No. 3].&nbsp; The Statement of Decision provides for a damages award to plaintiffs in the amount of $14,755 for construction of a new fence and $5,498.30 for new replacement trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On May 23, 2018, the court signed and filed the Judgment submitted jointly by the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This motion is brought by Judgment Creditors Eve Somer, as Trustee of the Eve Somer Living Trust dated July 1, 2020, and Gregory C. Yaitanes, as Trustee of the Gregory C. Yaitanes Family Trust (Judgment Creditors), who argue that they are the owners of the Oakdell Road property previously owned by plaintiffs and cross-defendants the Mellenthin parties, who were judgment creditors under the Judgment in this case.&nbsp; Judgment Creditors indicate that they now own the subject property pursuant to a Grant Deed recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on June 2, 2023.&nbsp; [Davis Decl., para. 3, Request for Judicial Notice, para. 1, Ex. 1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Judgment Creditors evidently seek to amend the Judgement pursuant to its terms, although the relevant terms are not quoted for the court.&nbsp; It appears that the relevant terms would be as follows:</span></div><div>“7. The revocable licenses allow Defendants to maintain the encroaching trespasses for driveway wall and the pool deck wall without liability for damages and without enforcement by way of mandatory injunction and said revocable licenses shall automatically terminate upon the occurrence of the following events:&nbsp;</div><div>A. Plaintiffs sell their property commonly known as 3818 and 3330 Oakdell Road, Studio City, CA, 91604 and legally described in Exhibit “A” attached hereto…”</div><div><br></div><div>8. The revocable licenses cannot be revoked unilaterally by Plaintiffs in the absence of the occurrence of any of the above-referenced conditions. Upon occurrence of any one of the four conditions in subparagraphs 6 A, B, C, or D above, Plaintiffs, or any subsequent owner of Plaintiffs’ property, will have one year to amend the judgment to obtain a mandatory injunction for Encroachment No 1 (driveway wall) and/or Encroachment No. 3 (pool deck wall), which mandatory injunction will issue automatically upon timely application to amend the judgment.</div><div><br></div><div>9. In the event Plaintiffs or any subsequent owner of Plaintiffs’ property fail to make application within one year to amend the judgment to obtain the mandatory injunction, Defendants or any subsequent owner of Defendants’ property, must apply to the court within one year for an equitable easement for encroachment Nos. 1 and 3 which the court will grant automatically upon timely application.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>10. If Defendants fail to apply to the court within one year, for an equitable easement for Nos. 1 and 3, Plaintiffs or any subsequent owner of Plaintiffs’ property, may apply at anytime thereafter to amend the judgment to obtain a mandatory injunction for removal of encroachment No 1 (the driveway wall) and Encroachment No. 3 (pool deck wall), which mandatory injunctions will issue automatically.”</div><div>[Judgment, paras. 7-9].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Judgment Creditors purchased Plaintiffs’ property through a Grant Deed executed on April 21, 2023, and recorded on June 2, 2023, and have brought this motion within one year of those dates, filing it on April 15, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears that Judgment Creditors, as subsequent owners of Plaintiffs’ property, are accordingly entitled to “amend the judgment to obtain a mandatory injunction for Encroachment No. 1 (driveway wall) and/or Encroachment No. 3 (pool deck wall), which mandatory injunction will issue automatically upon timely application to amend the judgment.”&nbsp; [Judgment, para. 8].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This Amendment appears appropriate here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The Judgment Creditors also request that the Judgment be amended to set a date certain by which Encroachments Nos. 1 and 3 are to be removed, and also request that since the other two encroachments addressed by the Judgment—the trespassing large pillar encroachment [Encroachment No. 2] and the trespassing electrical and plumbing encroachment [Encroachment No. 4]—still have not been removed, the Amended Judgment require that Encroachment Nos. 1-4 all be removed by the same date.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is no provision cited in the Judgment for an Amended Judgment concerning the removal of Encroachments Nos. 2 and 4, so this Amendment will not be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion also indicates that Judgment Creditors are working with Judgment Debtors on a lot line adjustment which adjusts the boundary between them to address Encroachments 1-4, and that the parties have executed a Stipulation Re Lot Line Adjustment.&nbsp; [Davis Decl., para. 4, Ex. B].&nbsp; Judgment Debtors argue that Judgment Debtors have not yet submitted the lot line adjustment application to the City of Los Angeles, and request that the court hold the entry of the Amended Judgment in abeyance until the City of Los Angeles approves or denies the lot line adjustment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment Creditors evidently filed this motion to amend in order to meet the one-year deadline for them to move to amend the Judgment included in paragraph 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Judgment Debtors in opposition indicate that the parties, outside of court, resolved the issues in this matter by way of agreeing to a lot line adjustment to adjust the boundary between the two properties to increase defendants’ property to include the area in which the encroachments are maintained, and that the lot line adjustment is ongoing and in good faith.&nbsp; The opposition indicates that defendants have placed into escrow the agreed upon price of $25,000 to purchase the portion of Judgment Creditors’ property for the lot line adjustment.&nbsp; The opposition indicates that the lot line adjustment has been submitted and is in process, and that it is expected that the process will take another 120 days to complete.&nbsp; &nbsp;Judgment Debtors argue that this motion is accordingly premature and should not have been filed and should be continued for 120 days to permit the lot line adjustment process to proceed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition is not supported by any declaration establishing any of the facts argued.&nbsp; The opposition makes reference to the Stipulation submitted with the moving papers as Exhibit B but does not by declaration show that the lot line adjustment has been submitted, that escrow has opened, or facts explaining why it is expected to take 120 days for the lot line adjustment matter to be concluded.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the court will hear from the parties at the hearing, and will continue the motion, essentially, at the request of both sides, to permit a reasonable time for the lot line adjustment to be pursued by the parties with the City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition also makes an argument that seems to be that the motion to amend is not timely made pursuant to the Judgment, as Judgment Creditors had one year from the date the property was sold, and that plaintiffs transferred the property from their trust to Mary Mellenthin Bunzel as Trustee of the Mellenthin’s Survivor’s Trust on March 17, 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition submits a Request for Judicial Notice of an Affidavit—Death of Trustee, recorded November 29, 2022, which indicates that Michael Alfred Mellentin, decedent, was named as one of the trustees of the Mellenthin Family Trust, that Donna Mellenthin, a named trustee resigned as trustee of that trust, and that Mary Mellentin Bunzel is the duly appointed trustee who has consented to act.&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. A].&nbsp; The documentation supporting the actions by the various trustees is included.&nbsp; The opposition also submits a Trust Transfer Deed in which Mary Mellenthin Bunzel, as Trustee, granted Mary Mellenthin Bunzel, as trustee of the Mellenthin Survivor’s Trust, the subject property for no consideration.&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. B].&nbsp; The Deed is dated March 17, 2023, and was recorded March 24, 2023.&nbsp; [Id].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This Mellenthin Survivor’s Trust is the entity which then transferred the property for a valuable consideration to Judgment Creditors via the Grant Deed submitted by Judgment Creditors, which is dated April 21, 2023, and was recorded on June 2, 2023.&nbsp; [RFJN Ex. 1].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The argument appears to be that this transfer between the trusts is a complete divesting of the property from the plaintiffs in this action to a third party, so that the transfer was a triggering event for defendants to file a motion for a permanent equitable easement, but defendants were not notified of the transfer.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no clear argument that due to this timeline, Judgment Creditor’s current motion is not timely, but if the dates in March 2023 are applied, this motion was not filed within one year, as it was filed on April 15, 2024.&nbsp; In any case, there is a strong argument that the subject transfer, by the same trustee to another family trust was not in any case an “occurrence” under the Judgment’s language, which refers to the event that “Plaintiffs sell their property…”&nbsp; [Judgment, para. 7].&nbsp; &nbsp;The subject Grant Deed did not clearly reflect a “sale” of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The argument appears instead to be that Judgment Creditors should be estopped to make their motion because plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ successor trust had an obligation under the Judgment to notify defendants of the transfer, but failed to do so, and that the only reason the transfer to another trust was made was to circumvent the Judgment in this case and prevent defendants from seeking redress for a permanent equitable easement in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp; The opposition argues that the Judgment required plaintiffs to notify defendants if and when the property was transferred, stating, “The Court was very specific.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The opposition fails to cite to any provision of the Judgment or any order of the court to this effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;A review of the Judgment itself shows that there was no specific mention made of an obligation to give notice of a transfer, or a sale.&nbsp; A review of the Statement of Decision similarly does not appear to show that such an obligation was imposed.&nbsp; [See Statement of Decision, pp. 8-15].&nbsp; The court is inclined under the circumstances to not deny the motion based on this lack of notice argument but will hear from the parties at the hearing concerning whether additional briefing should be required in advance of any continued hearing date to further explore the issues.&nbsp; The court is also cognizant of the fact that defendants have not pursued to resolution a motion under the Judgment within one year of any of the dates at play, so that evidently paragraph 10 of the Judgment would apply, in effect that:&nbsp;</span></div><div>“If Defendants fail to apply to the court within one year, for an equitable easement for Nos. 1 and 3, Plaintiffs or any subsequent owner of Plaintiffs’ property, may apply at any time thereafter to amend the judgment to obtain a mandatory injunction for removal of encroachment No 1 (the driveway wall) and Encroachment No. 3 (pool deck wall), which mandatory injunctions will issue automatically.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Judgment, para. 10, emphasis added].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>While this motion could arguably be premature, it can now be brought at any time, and another motion could easily be pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition also seeks, alternatively to the continuance, that the court deny the motion altogether and issue a permanent equitable easement in this case.&nbsp; No basis for entering such an order has been established by the opposition, and no separate motion has been made.&nbsp; The alternative relief is not granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Judgment Creditors’ Application to Amend Judgment is CONTINUED to December 6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. [120 days requested in opposition].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The Court will hear argument concerning what a reasonable continuance would be to permit the parties to pursue a lot line adjustment with the City of Los Angeles, and the current status of that proceeding, and of escrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will also hear arguments with respect to whether any further briefing is necessary or will be permitted prior to the continued hearing date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp;
