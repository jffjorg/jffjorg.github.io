Abramson Trust, the owner of real property Unit 676 at Excelsior, and a member of Excelsior HOA.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that Van Richter resides at the subject unit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that every condominium unit at the property is governed by the Excelsior HOA Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs), pursuant to which Excelsior HOA is responsible for repairs of common areas at the property.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2020, plaintiff completed a major construction defect lawsuit, which included claims for defects and damages related to the master bedroom showers leaking into the adjacent common area walls and sub-floors between residences, deterioration of cast iron pipes due to hydrogen sulfide gas corrosion, and missing fire stopping in the fire rated walls between the residences.&nbsp; The repairs will require the removal and replacement of the master bathroom shower, replacement of the cast iron pipes, and the installation of fireproofing between the residences, which repairs will take place inside all of the residences, and cannot be done solely from the exterior of the residences.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that it has sent notice to the residents concerning a schedule of inspections to take place inside the residences, to be completed November 1-12, 2021, Monday through Friday, lasting about thirty minutes.&nbsp; Van Richter has contacted the reconstruction company to not contact him for access to his unit, has informed Excelsior HOA’s consultants that he had no issues in his residence and the issues were all repaired, which plaintiff alleges is not possible because the problems are located in the common areas and defendant has not obtained approval for construction in his residence as required by the CC&amp;Rs. Defendant’s home, Unit 676, has not been inspected as defendant refused to grant access for inspections, in violation of the CC&amp;Rs section concerning Right of Entry of the Association, and Excelsior HOA seeks an order from the court to defendant to vacate his unit for the duration of inspection and repairs of his unit and that the Excelsior HOA be permitted access to his unit to perform the repairs that are being made at all other units at the Excelsior.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint also alleges causes of action for fraud and abuse of process based on allegations that defendant has filed two small claims complaints, in March of 2021 and November of 2021, in which defendant has falsely represented to the court that the claims had been served on plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;These causes of action were the subject of a special motion to strike which the court heard on October 7, 2022.&nbsp; The motion was granted, and the causes of action were ordered stricken with prejudice from the verified complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Van Richter, individually and as trustee, has filed a cross-complaint, naming plaintiff Excelsior HOA as cross-defendant, alleging that Excelsior HOA has breached the CC&amp;Rs by directing or being compliant in allowing management servicer First Service Residential on May 11, 2020 to terminate all its management duties and services exclusively to Van Richter.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges a cause of action for breach of contract, as well as a cause of action for declaratory relief, in which cross-complainant seeks a declaration that Excelsior HOA is in violation of the CC&amp;Rs by continuing to require Van Richter to pay $716.86 per month for residential services such as onsite property management, concierge, janitorial, engineering and security, while Van Richter is being denied any of these services.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>OPPOSITION:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>No opposition.&nbsp; The courtroom assistant has confirmed with moving party that no opposition to this motion has been served.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>Defendant and cross-complainant Paul Van Richter moves the court for an order permitting him to file a supplemental cross-complaint to allege facts which have occurred recently, since the filing of the original cross-complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 464 permits the filing of supplemental pleadings:</div><div>“(a)&nbsp; The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the former complaint or answer.”</div><div><br></div><div>The determination to permit the making of a supplemental pleading is within the discretion of the court.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Second District has observed: “It is the general policy that courts should exercise liberality in permitting the filing of supplemental pleadings when the alleged ‘occurring-after’ facts are pertinent to the case.”&nbsp; Flood v. Simpson&nbsp; (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 644, 647, citations omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp;A motion to file a supplemental pleading “is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court, and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing of manifest abuse of discretion.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &nbsp;A supplemental pleading cannot ordinarily be used to allege facts constituting an entirely new cause of action.&nbsp; Flood, at 647.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, Van Richter seeks to amend the pleading based on occurrences since the filing of the original cross-complaint.&nbsp; Specifically, cross-complainant argues that since the filing of the cross-complaint in November of 2022, cross-defendant Excelsior HOA has continued to intentionally exclude cross-complainant from all the benefits it provided to all the other 99 homeowners, which facts further support cross-complainant’s claims in the cross-complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cross-complainant indicates that in May of 2023, an attorney for the Excelsior HOA board sent out a “member’ status letter” with an attached copy of a complaint in a lawsuit entitled Reconstruction Experts, Inc. v. The Excelsior at the Americana at Brand Homeowners’ Association and its Members, LASC Case No. 23 GDCV00580 which includes a cause of action for foreclosure on a mechanics’ lien, with the County Recording listing on the recorded lien all of the homeowners, including Van Richter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant indicates that he has sent a written letter to the Excelsior HOA Board and its attorney requesting a defense in the lawsuit, as provided to all the other 99 homeowners, and requested he be provided with a copy of the waiver of conflict which was sent to the other 99 homeowners to sign in order to allow the Excelsior HOA attorney to defend them in the lawsuit, but cross-defendant has failed to respond, and the attorney, in August of 2023, has proceeded to file a demurrer in the Reconstruction Experts lawsuit on behalf of all 99 other owners except cross-defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Cross-complainant argues that once again, cross-complainant is paying 1/100 from his monthly dues for rights, services, and privileges afforded to all the other 99 homeowners, and Excelsior HOA is wrongfully discriminating against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant accordingly seeks to supplement the cross-complaint to add these facts so that cross-complainant may seek to have Excelsior HOA defend and indemnify him in the other lawsuit and pay for legal counsel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant also argues that permitting the supplemental allegations will not prejudice defendants and would further the interests of justice by fulfilling the fundamental policy of deciding cases on their merits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion indicates that the supplemental allegations are based on events which occurred recently, and there has not been a delay in asserting them which would result in prejudice such as the loss of critical evidence, and that the parties have submitted a stipulation to continue the trial to a later date which would allow for any additional needed discovery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The proposed supplemental cross-complaint attached to the motion is not drafted as a stand-alone supplemental cross-complaint, with a restatement of the allegations from the original cross-complaint, so that one cross-complaint would be the operative cross-complaint in this proceeding.&nbsp; Instead, cross-complainant has submitted a supplemental cross-complaint which states, that the “pending” cross-complaint previously filed “as supplemented hereby, remains operative,” and that cross-complainant, “additionally alleges as follows.”&nbsp; [Ex. 1, p. 1].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This approach is improper as one all encompassing cross-complaint including all cross-claims and allegations must be submitted in this matter, which cross-complaint will supersede all previous pleadings.&nbsp; This manner of submitting the supplemental&nbsp; allegations also creates confusion, as it is not clear which of the two causes of action in the original cross-complaint are intended to be supplemented.&nbsp; The cross-complaint includes two causes of action, for breach of governing documents and for declaratory relief.&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears that the supplemental pleading may be intended to supplement both causes of action, but this must be clarified.&nbsp; As noted above, a supplemental pleading cannot be used to add an entirely new cause of action.&nbsp; The supplemental allegations here suggest that cross-complainant is pursuing new damages beyond those suffered for the payment of monthly dues for services not received through First Services Residential, and a broader declaration of rights and duties, which may be beyond the intended scope of permitting supplemental allegations to be added to a pleading.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Nevertheless, there is no opposition to this motion, so no prejudice is argued, and it would be preferable to resolve the disputes concerning the alleged treatment of cross-complainant and the use of his homeowners’ association fees in one proceeding.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion is granted, but cross-complainant will be required to file a stand-alone all-encompassing pleading, entitled the “Supplemental First Amended Cross-Complaint,” which will include the allegations included in the original cross-complaint, as well as those included in the “[Proposed] Supplemental Cross Complaint of Paul Van Richter” attached to the moving papers as Exhibit 1, with the new allegations inserted into the cause or causes of action intended to be supplemented, following the original allegations.&nbsp; The supplemental allegations are to be alleged verbatim from the proposed supplemental pleading, including the dates alleged, which serve to clarify what allegations are new.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No Opposition] <span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>Cross-Complainant Paul Van Richter’s UNOPPOSED Motion to File a Supplemental Cross-Complaint, as corrected by Notice of Errata, is GRANTED.&nbsp;

The supplemental allegations must be alleged verbatim from the proposed supplemental pleading, including the dates alleged, which serve to clarify what allegations are new. The only variation from the allegations in the proposed supplemental pleading permitted will be the omission of the “Supplemental Cross-Complaint designation and the introductory paragraph (Ex. 1, p. 1:19-23), and the addition of dates, if necessary, to clarify that allegations are supplemental.&nbsp; The Court does not believe that further dates will be necessary if the new allegations are made verbatim and left in the order in which they appear in Exhibit 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant is ordered to efile and serve the Supplemental First Amended Cross-Complaint within ten days.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 23GDCV01045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  May 3, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div><br></div><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>2<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>5/3/2024<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Case No: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>23 GDCV01045&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Trial Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>October 27, 2025&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Urrutia v.

De La Torre Urrutia alleges that in May of 2022, plaintiff purchased a 2021 Kia Sorento with an accompanying written warranty from defendant Kia America Inc., pursuant to which Kia America, Inc. agreed to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty, including the vehicle’s engine, electrical, emission, suspension and transmission system defects.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the express warranty period, and substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.&nbsp; Plaintiff delivered the vehicle to manufacturer’s authorized repair facility for repair of the nonconformities, and defendant has been unable to conform plaintiff’s vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of repair attempts.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that notwithstanding plaintiff’s entitlement, defendant has failed to either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or to promptly make restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, and Civil Code section 1793.2.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. seeks by this motion to compel plaintiff to attend and testify at deposition and produce documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the motion is moot, as the parties have agreed that plaintiff’s deposition will occur on April 30, 2024.&nbsp; [Stocca Decl. ¶ ¶ 7, 8, Exs. 2, 3].&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears that defendant has served a Notice of Taking Continued Deposition of Plaintiff on the agreed upon date.&nbsp; [Stocca Decl. Ex. 3].&nbsp; Presumably, since plaintiff is arguing the motion is moot, plaintiff will not be objecting to this Notice and intends to appear and testify on April 30, 2024, three days before the hearing on this motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear why the motion has remained on calendar, but evidently defendant’s counsel has not responded to a request that it be taken off calendar and may be reasonably concerned that if plaintiff does not appear as agreed and noticed, it has been difficult to obtain a deposition date from plaintiff and a court order for a date certain would be necessary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion accordingly appears to be moot in principle, although since the deposition has not yet been conducted, in an abundance of caution, the court will order the deposition to go forward, if it has not already been conducted, on a date certain to be determined at the hearing, within the next thirty days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court also notes that this matter remains subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation, now posted and available on the Los Angeles Superior Court website in connection with this Department, Glendale Courthouse, Department D.&nbsp;

&nbsp;The opposition argues that this motion is improperly attempting to avoid this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, as argued in the opposition, the attempt here to stay the appeal under this provision is improperly sought in this court, as the motion essentially seeks a stay of an order for the payment of money, without seeking such relief in the court of appeal and being subject to the applicable bonding provisions to postpone paying a money judgment entered by the trial court.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also relies on CCP section 918, which provides:</div><div>“(a) Subject to subdivision (b), the trial court may stay the enforcement of any judgment or order.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) If the enforcement of the judgment or order would be stayed on appeal only by the giving of an undertaking, a trial court shall not have power, without the consent of the adverse party, to stay the enforcement thereof pursuant to this section for a period which extends for more than 10 days beyond the last date on which a notice of appeal could be filed.</div><div><br></div><div>(c) This section applies whether or not an appeal will be taken from the judgment or order and whether or not a notice of appeal has been filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that the ten-day period beyond the last day on which a notice to appeal could be filed past weeks ago, and the judgment on appeal can be stayed only by the giving of an undertaking.&nbsp; Accordingly, pursuant to the clear language of the statute, the “trial court shall not have power” to stay enforcement without the consent of the adverse party.&nbsp; &nbsp;The opposition argues that the Code allows the trial court to grant a temporary stay of up to ten days beyond the appeal deadline so that the judgment debtor has a chance to decide whether to appeal, and, if so, to post a bond pursuant to CCP section 917.1.&nbsp; Defendants argue that this court accordingly has no jurisdiction to stay enforcement of the monetary sanctions award.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the notice of entry of the dismissals and orders was served by the clerk on January 18, 2024.&nbsp; The time to appeal is on or before “60 days after the superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled ‘Notice of Entry’ of judgment” showing the date it was served.&nbsp;

Le (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 730, in which the court of appeal reversed a trial court order of a stay on appeal without an undertaking, emphasizing the statutory language that “a trial court shall not have power without the consent of the adverse party,” to stay enforcement on appeal, and finding that the failure of the adverse party to file a timely written opposition to the request for a stay had been improperly characterized by the trial court as the giving of consent.&nbsp; Sharifpour, at 733-734, italics in original.&nbsp; The court of appeal found that the trial court abused its discretion in so characterizing the failure to file an opposition, and that the court “exceeded its powers in staying enforcement of the judgment,” when the opposing parties appeared at the hearing and objected.&nbsp; &nbsp;Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there has been no consent of the adverse parties, and the reply does not argue that such consent can be implied in these circumstances.&nbsp; The statute is clear: this court has no power to stay enforcement.&nbsp; The motion must be denied.&nbsp; The court has no other option.</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in reply appears to concede that this matter is not subject to the mandatory stay provisions but focuses on a brief argument in the moving papers that this court should issue a discretionary stay.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff cites to no statutory authority which would permit the trial court to do so in this circumstance governed by CCP sections 917.1 and 918, as set forth above.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that a stay should be issued here to protect plaintiff from irreparable injury.&nbsp; The court in Sharifpour expressly rejected a similar argument that without a stay the responding parties could suffer prejudice from the judgment being collected, noting that the only question was the correct procedure for obtaining a stay, which procedure required the giving of an undertaking.&nbsp; Sharifpour, at 735.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cases cited by plaintiff involve application of stay provisions to other than money judgments, including the general provision of CCP section 916, which expressly applies, only “[e]xcept as provided in sections 917.1 through 917.9, inclusive,” when section 917.1 clearly applies here.&nbsp; See Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180 (automatic stay applies to stay all further trial court proceedings on causes of action affected by the trial court’s order on an anti-SLAPP motion).&nbsp; In MaJor v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn.&nbsp; (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, the Second District noted, in dicta, that “the plaintiff may request a stay of trial court proceedings while the appeal for denial of the preliminary injunction is pending.”&nbsp; MaJor, at 623-624.&nbsp; &nbsp;The case did not address a judgment or order for the payment of money.&nbsp; The court of appeal in Vineyard Springs Estates v. Superior Court (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 633, did not address the propriety of a stay at all; on the page cited by plaintiff, the court of appeal merely ordered in the disposition of a summary judgment order reviewed on a petition for writ of mandate that, “The stay of proceedings in the trial court is vacated.”&nbsp; Vineyard, at 643.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These cases fail to overcome the statutory limits on the court’s power here, where the stay of a bonded obligation is sought to be extended beyond ten days after the time to appeal expired without the consent of the adverse party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that a stay is necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the court of appeal with respect to the propriety of the sanctions order and to preserve the rights of plaintiff on a serious and controversial question based on a non-merit ruling.&nbsp; This argument appears to apply to the orders dismissing the action, and not on the orders awarding monetary sanctions in connection with discovery motions, which were determined on their merits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The discovery orders were based on conduct taken in connection with the Discovery Act and this court’s discovery orders, specifically, orders in favor of Olympus deeming discovery motions moot in light of the service of belated responses, which were served only after the expense of the motions had been incurred.&nbsp; &nbsp;The orders also include the discovery orders of September 15, 2023, and were based on sanctions awarded in connection plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel having made representations to the parties and the court concerning the availability of plaintiff’s designated expert witness, who had submitted a declaration in opposition to motions for summary judgment, and the conduct of counsel for plaintiff in requiring that the deposition be conducted in New York, instead of California, to accommodate the expert.&nbsp; The motions were determined on their merits based on counsel personally conducting the court ordered deposition, and plaintiff’s counsel is not permitting the examination to proceed as ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff’s arguments, raised for the first time in the reply, that the appeal will determine if the sanctions were improperly awarded due entirely to the conduct of the witness, and not to any conduct of plaintiff or plaintiff’s counsel, are not persuasive to this court, which has carefully examined the evidence concerning the conduct of all parties in connection with the refusal to produce the witness for an in person deposition, the insistence that the witness be deposed overseas, and then in New York, and the conduct of plaintiff’s counsel in the state of New York, after defendant’s counsel had travelled to New York for the deposition.&nbsp; Such conduct by plaintiff’s counsel included limiting the expert witness deposition time to two hours, limiting the scope of inquiry, and refusing to make the witness available the next day for further deposition when the witness said he needed to leave the deposition after 2 hours to treat patients.&nbsp; &nbsp;These findings were clearly a determination on the merits that plaintiff’s counsel repeatedly had violated the court’s discovery order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>To the extent plaintiff in the reply seems to argue that the sanctions orders were improperly made in disregard of the five-year rule, this argument is not an argument concerning the propriety of issuing a stay of enforcement on appeal.</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, as discussed in detail above, a money judgment must be bonded in order to stay its enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also an argument that the other parties will not be harmed by the stay because they are in a superior position as to net worth and insurance coverage, while plaintiff Steger’s obligations are not collectible.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no authority cited under which this “fairness” argument permits the trial court to issue a discretionary stay where there is a bonding requirement.&nbsp; The argument is akin to the prejudice argument rejected in Sharifpour, discussed above.&nbsp; See Sharifpour, at 735.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the alternative seeks an order from the court that any decision on the part of the sanctioned parties not to pay the sanctions is a simple judgment subject to collection in accordance with post-judgment enforcement rules and as such does not constitute willful disobedience in light of the appeal.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This request improperly seeks an advisory ruling when there is no proceeding currently before the court which would require a determination concerning any willful disobedience of an order.&nbsp; The court notes parenthetically that “willful” usually means an intentional and voluntary act.&nbsp; In this sense, the decision by plaintiff’s attorney and/or the plaintiff not to pay the sanctions would be a willful, but not a malicious act.&nbsp; Whether a failure to obey a court order is malicious is irrelevant to any stay of enforcement.</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that if plaintiff continues to avoid satisfying the bonding requirement under CCP section 917.1, and to nevertheless avoid defendants’ efforts to pursue collection under the enforcement of judgment rules, defendants could take up that issue at that time with the court of appeals.&nbsp; The defendants in theory could seek dismissal of the appeal in the court of appeal, but that would be an appellate court issue only.&nbsp; This court agrees that any issue concerning a finding of willful disobedience is not proper before it here.&nbsp; The issue of willful disobedience is irrelevant to any contempt or enforcement of judgment proceedings.</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also argues that once a judgment has been entered, a court may not reconsider it or make changes to the judgment.&nbsp; Hence, this court has no authority to make any rulings “clarifying” its prior sanctions orders, which were entered as final judgments on January 12, 2024.&nbsp; Passavanti v. Williams (1990) 225 Cal. App. 3d 1602, 1606 (“A court may reconsider its order granting or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment has been entered, however, the court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment. It may correct judicial error only through certain limited procedures such as motions for new trial and motions to vacate the judgment.”) See also, Ramon v. Aerospace Corp. (1996, 2nd Dist.) 50 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1237-1238. (“After entry of judgment, a party must use statutory methods to attack the judgment in the trial court or must file an appeal.”)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion accordingly is denied.&nbsp; The motion is denied without prejudice to plaintiff seeking a stay of this matter and/or a stay of the enforcement of the discovery sanctions orders pending appeal from the court of appeal, if appropriate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motion to Tax Costs</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Joint Motion</div><div>Plaintiff Jason Steger has filed “Plaintiff Jason Steger’s Joint Motion to Strike and Disallow in Total (1) Memorandum of Costs Filed by Dr. John Kasher and Dr. James Kao on February 2, 2024; (2) Memorandum of Costs Filed by Olympus America, Inc.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Olympus in opposition to the motion argues that plaintiff improperly has filed a “Joint” motion to tax costs, when the motion is actually two motions, motions to challenge costs claimed in two separate memoranda of costs, claimed by two distinct sets of parties, using only one hearing reservation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant points out that the court has discouraged plaintiff in the past from filing combined motions under only one hearing reservation, cautioning that joint motions should be brought as the proper number of motions, with separate reservations, “to avoid calendar congestion and jumping ahead” of other motions, and to ensure the court collects the filing fees to which it is entitled.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., paras. 5, 6, Exs. D and E].&nbsp; The court again cautions plaintiff to refrain in the future from filing “joint” motions.&nbsp; The court in its discretion will consider the motion as to each memorandum of costs this date, despite this impropriety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Timeliness of Memoranda of Costs</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that the memoranda of costs filed by defendants should each be stricken in their entirety as untimely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff cites, without quoting, CRC Rule 3.1700 (a) (1), which provides:</div><div>“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under subdivision (b)(3), the parties may agree in writing to extend the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum.&nbsp; “In the absence of an agreement, the court may extend the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum...for a period not to exceed 30 days.”</div><div>Plaintiff cites to case law under which it is held that, “The time provisions relating to the filing of a memorandum of costs, while not jurisdictional, are mandatory.”&nbsp; Hydratec, Inc. v.

Plaintiff argues that any memorandum of costs was accordingly due on January 11, 2024, but that Dr. Kasher and Dr. Kao served their memorandum on February 2, 2024, and Olympus served its memorandum on January 25, 2024, beyond the 15-day deadline.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The moving papers do not submit a copy of this notice.&nbsp;

The memorandum served and filed by Olympus on January 25, 2023 and the memorandum served and filed by Dr. Kasher and Dr. Kao on February 2, 2024 both are timely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition filed by Olympus also points out that at the December 22, 2023 hearing, the court ordered the parties to prepare their respective versions of the proposed judgment of dismissal, and to reappear on January 12, 2024 for oral argument regarding the form of the judgment.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The minute order from the December 22, 2023 hearing actually stated that the motions to dismiss were “continued to 01/12/2024,” and that “Each side is ordered to submit a Proposed Judgment.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 12/22/2023, pp. 72, 73].&nbsp; The orders entering dismissal and orders concerning discovery were not signed and filed until January 12, 2024, so any notice of entry of dismissal served on December 27, 2023 could not have given notice of entry of dismissal, as dismissal had not yet been entered.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In fact, a review of what plaintiff evidently relies upon as the notice triggering the 15-day period which was served by Olympus, is entitled “Notice of Ruling Re: Proceedings Held on December 22, 2023,” represents only that the motions to dismiss were “GRANTED.”&nbsp; It does not state that dismissals were ordered or entered, and also expressly states that defendants were “to submit proposed judgments of dismissal by January 12, 2024.&nbsp; [Notice of Ruling filed and served 12/27/2023].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file also shows that defendants then proceeded to submit proposed judgments, and on January 8, 2024, plaintiff filed objections to those proposed judgments and orders and submitted his own proposed judgment.&nbsp; &nbsp;This undermines any argument that the December 27, 2023 notice constituted, under CRC Rule 3.1700 (a) (1) “the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It is clear that the notice under CRC Rule 3.1700 (a) (1), the “mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk,” was made on January 18, 2024, when the clerk filed and served a Notice of Entry of Dismissal in this matter.&nbsp;

Plaintiff argues that plaintiff merged with and into American Express National Bank effective April 1, 2018, that the surviving entity after the merger is American Express National Bank, and that plaintiff intends to enforce the judgment under its true and current name of American Express National Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 673, which provides:</div><div>“(a) An assignee of a right represented by a judgment may become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court which entered the judgment an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) An acknowledgment of assignment of judgment shall contain all of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>(1) The title of the court where the judgment is entered and the cause and number of the action.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) The date of entry of the judgment and of any renewals of the judgment and where entered in the records of the court.</div><div><br></div><div>(3) The name and address of the judgment creditor and name and last known address of the judgment debtor.</div><div><br></div><div>(4) A statement describing the right represented by the judgment that is assigned to the assignee.</div><div><br></div><div>(5) The name and address of the assignee.</div><div><br></div><div>(c) The acknowledgment of assignment of judgment shall be:</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Executed and acknowledged by the judgment creditor or by the prior assignee of record if there is one.</div><div><br></div><div>(d)(1) If an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment purports to be executed or acknowledged by an authorized agent of the judgment creditor or an authorized agent of a prior assignee of record, then documentation sufficient to evidence that authorization shall be filed together with the acknowledgment of assignment of judgment.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an assignee of a right represented by a judgment may also become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court that entered judgment a court order or other documentation that evidences assignment of judgment by operation of law.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no acknowledgment of assignment filed by the moving party, and certainly no document complying with the provisions of subdivisions (b) or (c).&nbsp; No document including the required information has been filed, and no document is submitted which is executed and acknowledged by the judgment creditor or any prior assignee of record.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff submits a declaration of counsel, who is not the judgment creditor, and cannot authenticate or testify to any current status or relationship of plaintiff, which does not include the required information, but states that American Express Centurion Bank merged with American Express National Bank as the surviving entity after merger, and purports to attach a public record document from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approving the merger.&nbsp; [Declaration of Plaintiff’s Counsel, Raluca Rohan, para. 2].&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not an appropriate acknowledgment of assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In addition, although the declaration references an attached Exhibit A in connection with the purported merger, there is no Exhibit A in any of the documents submitted with the motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;As noted above, such a document could not in any case be authenticated by an attorney for the judgment debtor with no facts which would indicate that the attorney has personal knowledge concerning the matters in which the judgment debtor is involved.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To the extent the motion relies on CCP section 673, subdivision&nbsp; (d), the motion fails to submit an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment under subdivision (d)(1), as noted above.&nbsp; To the extent plaintiff intends to rely on subdivision (d)(2), that subdivision requires the filing of “a court order or other documentation that evidences assignment of judgment by operation of law.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no court order filed, and again as noted above, there is no documentation other than a declaration of counsel unaccompanied by any supporting documents that could be construed to constitute evidence of an assignment of judgment “by operation of law.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also does not submit any legal analysis or explanation of what such documentation would include, or explain how the referenced, unattached, document would in any case constitute evidence of an assignment of judgment by operation of law, or under what law.&nbsp; The relief cannot, and will not, be granted on this showing.&nbsp; The motion is denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In addition, the paperwork is confusing, as the motion is brought by attorneys for plaintiff, and by plaintiff, when the paperwork refers to moving party as the “assignee of record,” and “American Express National Bank,” when plaintiff in this action is American Express Centurion Bank, and not an assignee but the purported assignor.&nbsp; [See Decl., para. 2, p. 2: 5-7, (Proposed) Order p.1:23-27].&nbsp; This confusion may be because under subdivision (d), “an assignee of a right represented by a judgment may also become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court that entered judgment a court order or other documentation that evidences assignment of judgment by operation of law.”&nbsp; This subdivision does not appear to excuse the requirement to submit the documentation required under subdivision (b) and (c), and the moving party is not the assignee here, and could not be, because the assignee has not been added as a party to the action, so would have no standing to file paperwork or request relief from this court until it has obtained standing to appear in this case.&nbsp; Finally, as discussed above, there is no documentation submitted that evidences an assignment of judgment by operation of law, as no referenced document is attached, the purported evidence is not in any case properly authenticated, and there is no legal argument explaining the effect of any such evidence.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff moves in the alternative for the court to enter an order permitting plaintiff to amend its pleading to reflect its current name pursuant to CCP section 473.&nbsp; Plaintiff quotes from CCP § 473(a), which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, there is no pleading or proceeding outstanding as to the moving party, as judgment has been entered.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 576 provides:</div><div>“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.”</div><div><br></div><div>Here, relief is not sought “before or after commencement of trial,” or “during the course of the action,” but after judgment has been entered, and after any time for appeal has long run.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, since judgment has been entered, the proper subdivision of CCP § 473 would be subdivision (d), which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For purposes of CCP section 473(d), the term “clerical error” is defined as follows:</div><div>“The controlling principle is that although clerical error may freely be corrected postjudgment, judicial error may be corrected only by normal procedures for attacking a judgment...</div><div><br></div><div>The test which distinguishes clerical error from possible judicial error is simply whether the challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently (which is clerical error) versus <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>advertently (which might be judicial error but is not clerical error). (7Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Judgment, at 68, p. 595.) Unless the challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently, it cannot be changed post judgment under the guise of correction of clerical error.”</div><div>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins.
