Plaintiff was represented by Michael Sloan, of the Law Office of Michael L. Sloan.&nbsp; Defendant was represented by A.J. Glassman, of the Law Offices of A.J. Glassman. At the close of evidence of the plaintiff’s case on October 3, 2023, defendant’s counsel made an oral motion for Judgment/Non-Suit pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) Section 631.8. Pursuant to the defendant’s oral motion, the court asked plaintiff’s counsel whether the plaintiff wanted to reopen his case to provide additional evidence to defend against the CCP Section 631.8 motion. Plaintiff’s counsel reopened his case by calling defendant Saiful Tipu as an adverse witness pursuant to Evidence Code (“EC”) 776. The plaintiff closed his rebuttal case on October 18, 2023.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Thereafter, the court set a hearing for preliminary briefing on the merits of the motion. The court determined that the motion had merit and ordered a full briefing on the merits of the defendants’ motion. In the interim, the court set a briefing schedule and closing argument date. This ruling represents both the court’s ruling on the defendants’ CCP 631.8 motion and the court's statement of decision required pursuant to CCP 631.8(a).)&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>Plaintiffs called the following witnesses at trial: plaintiff Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Alam, Jeff Davani, and defendant Sultan Tipu pursuant to EC 776. Defendant Tipu is now known as Sultan by first name.</div><div><br></div><div>The court will be making credibility findings on this motion.&nbsp; As a result, the court’s ruling on the defendants’ CCP 638.1 motion also will be a de facto decision on the merits as if the court had denied the motion. This unusual procedural posture resulted from the plaintiff calling as witness in plaintiff’s case in chief, Tipu, the defendant, pursuant to EC section 776. This trial tactic allowed the defendant to present defendant’s defense of the case during the presentation of the plaintiff's case given the far-ranging cross examination in which the plaintiff’s counsel engaged when Tipu was on the witness stand.</div><div><br></div><div>THE PARTIES</div><div><br></div><div>PRETRIAL PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND STATUS OF PLEADINGS</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The parties filed no motions in limine.

The court expects the defendant to make a motion for leave to amend the answer to assert a statute of limitations defense pursuant to CCP 343, which the defendant will accomplish by a post-closing argument ex parte application for leave to amend the defendant’s answer to the FAC.</span></div><div><br></div><div>SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS</div><div>The evidence at trial established that in the Fall of 1995, Ali and Tipu's mother was a tenant at the subject property located at 715 N. Jackson Street, Glendale, California 91206. The property is a four-unit apartment building and sometimes herein after will be referred to as “Subject Property” or the “Property.”&nbsp; During this same time frame, Ali was living with Tipu in Tipu's apartment, which was located right next door to the Subject Property. Tipu was visiting his mother, who lived at the Property, one day in early December 1995. During that visit, a representative from the bank knocked on her door and informed her that the Property was foreclosed and that no further rent payment should be made to the landlord/property owner, who was then living upstairs. Tipu inquired about the foreclosure process and what to do if the family was interested in purchasing the subject property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Discussions among Ali and Tipu's family then took place about purchasing the property. According to Tipu, Ali and Tipu agreed that they would purchase the property together as equal partners/owners. Ali testified that he paid $6,000 from his own money to Mr. Davani with the loan application. Tipu gave Ali $7,000 to be used towards the deposit when escrow opened. Tipu testified that he gave Ali $30,000 to be used towards the final down payment at the close of escrow. Mr. Davani was a friend of Ali’s and a real estate agent who assisted Ali and Tipu in purchasing the Property. The owner of the Property was World Savings Bank. The parties opened escrow on the Property on December 27, 1995. The escrow documents and offers and counteroffers showed both Ali and Tipu as purchasers of the Property. See Exhibits 2 and 5.</div><div><br></div><div>The purchase of the Subject Property closed escrow on February 21,1996. There was a deed of trust from the lender and the corporate grant deed both being recorded on February 21,1996. Exhibit 104. The bank provided a 30-year loan at 7.75% interest rate in both Ali and Tipu's names as co-borrowers in the amount of $208,000.00. See Exhibit 5. The grant deed and the first deed of trust were recorded with the LA County Recorder's office in both Ali's name, as an unmarried man, and in Tipu's name, as an unmarried man, both as joint tenants. Exhibits 104 and 105. Both Ali and Tipu were now joint record owners of the Property subject to all the benefits and liabilities that accompany the title.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since Tipu lived next door to the subject property and Ali was unemployed for various reasons, it was agreed between them that Ali would be employed as the property manager, live at the subject property and be responsible for all management duties of the property including collecting all rents, taking care of all maintenance issues and paying all bills from the collected rents. During the time frames when rent was insufficient to cover the mortgage, Tipu contributed funds necessary to make the mortgage payments. The collection of all rents and the payment of all expenses related to the Subject Property was paid from a joint bank account in the names of both Ali and Tipu. Sometime in 2002, after Ali's wife moved to the United States, Ali removed Tipu's name from the joint bank account and added his wife on the account. To date, all rents collected by Ali and all expenses paid by Ali are still from this same joint bank account.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The decision to place Tipu on title was a well-considered family decision which was directed by the parents, and which arose when it was clear that Ali could not qualify for the bank loan because he was unemployed at the time and could not present the bank with W-2 forms or other proof of a source of steady income. The parents decided that Ali’s other brother, Mohammad Alam, was not a good match because these two brothers did not get along. The parents recommended that Tipu be the co-owner because he was more compatible with Ali. Also, the parents wanted to have another relative on title due to Ali’s unstable mental condition, including a bipolar condition, which the parents thought could lead to Ali injudiciously selling or incumbering the Property without their knowledge. The parents were elderly and of limited financial means and depended on the apartment for their residence for the remainder of their lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div>As stated, in 1995, Plaintiff Ali was a tenant at the property next door to the Property. In 1996, the Property) was foreclosed upon and thereafter plaintiff decided to attempt to purchase the Property as part of a family endeavor. Plaintiff obtained the help of a real estate broker, Jeff Davani, to purchase the Property. Davani testified that, after a review of plaintiff’s bank statements, Davani advised plaintiff that he had some financial resources, but that he would need to find a co-signer to help him purchase the Property because Ali was not employed at that time and had no source of income. The bank would not make a loan without a source of steady income for the monthly loan installment payments. Ali then asked his brother, defendant Tipu, who was employed and had a steady source of income, for assistance to obtain the loan. Tipu agreed to help plaintiff purchase the Property by becoming a co-signor on the loan.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Prior to the purchase of the Property in 1996, Ali testified that Ali and Tipu orally agreed that Ali was the 100% owner of the property, and that Tipu was in the transaction solely for the purposes of obtaining the credit for the purchase money loan. Ali testified that the bank supposedly required that Tipu be on title since Tipu was a co-borrower on the mortgage. Ali implied that he did not want to have Tipu on title or on the loan, but that the bank “forced” Tipu to be on title and a cosigner on the bank loan as a requirement for approval of the loan.</div><div><br></div><div>Ali testified that Ali and Tipu further agreed that Ali would pay for everything, including the down-payment, insurance, and the monthly mortgage payments. Ali’s payment of all the expenses on the Property would come from the revenue generated from rental income from the apartment units, including rent paid by the parents, who occupied one of the units.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ali also testified that he and Tipu also agreed that Ali was the sole owner of the Property, and thus Ali was entitled to all rents therefrom, and that, in the future, defendant Tipu would remove his name from the title on the Property. Ali testified that he, in February of 1996, with 100% his own money, made the payment of $51,500.00 as the down payment toward the purchase price of the Property. The Property was acquired by Ali and Tipu for the purchase price of $260,000.00. The balance of the purchase price was secured by a Deed of Trust dated February 26, 1996, in the amount of $208,000.00. Tipu was a co-signer on the loan secured by the Deed of Trust, and, as a result, was placed on title by the mortgage lender as a joint tenant, allegedly at the bank’s insistence.</div><div><br></div><div>On or about February 21, 1996, Escrow closed regarding Ali's and Tipu’s purchase of the Property. The Corporation Grant Deed was recorded on February 21, 1996, transferring title of the Property to Ali and Tipu as joint tenants See Exhibits 104 and 105. From the date of the purchase of the Property in 1996, through the present, Ali paid most of the $ 1,490.14 monthly mortgage payments for the Property, plus all other expenses including taxes, insurance, maintenance, and improvements. However, Tipu did make some of the mortgage payments when Ali fell behind on the payments. After escrow closed in 1996, Ali began to live at the Property and still lives at the Property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The source of the funds for the downpayment is disputed. Ali claims that he paid 100% of the downpayment consisting of an earnest money payment of $6,000.00 upon opening escrow and the remainder of the downpayment totaling $51,500.00 upon the close of escrow, all from his own funds. Ali points to Exhibit 4, which is a copy, not the original, of an escrow trust receipt showing that this amount [the $51,500.00] was received from Ali on February 20, 1996. The receipt does not show the source of the funds, only that Ali presented the funds. Similarly, the escrow statement (Exhibit 5) in the names of both Ali and Tipu, shows an “Initial Deposit” of $51,500.00, but does not indicate any source of the funds such as a bank account, check or cashier’s check.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even though Ali was unemployed at the time of the purchase of the Property, he claimed that he had a bank account containing about $100,000. He testified and presented documents showing bank accounts from the early 1990’s with amounts of about $30,000 and $50,000, but the court excluded the documents related to the bank accounts as inadmissible hearsay and without foundation or authentication. Ali testified that in the early 1990’s he purchased a one-third interest in Tommy’s Burgers, which he managed, for the price of $30,000, which he later sold. He testified that he used those funds to purchase inventory from a warehouse as part of the Dollar Warehouse operations, where he worked as a manager. He testified that he bought the inventory for $30,000 and sold it in January 1994 for $65,000 for a profit of $35,000. Ali did not provide any documents or witnesses who supported or confirmed any of this testimony concerning the source of his funds to pay the entire down payment.</div><div><br></div><div>Tipu testified that he paid $37,000 of the $51,500 downpayment from his own funds. Tipu stated he gave $7,000 to Ali to make the earnest money payment before the closing and paid an additional $30,000 upon the closing of the transaction for a total of $37,000. Tipu testified that the $7,000 payment was from his personal savings. Tipu was gainfully employed at the time. Tipu testified that in early 1996 as the transaction for the purchase of the property was progressing, he borrowed $30,000 as a non-recourse loan from his cousin in Bangladesh, Shamir Shofar, and used family property in Bangladesh as collateral for the loan.&nbsp; Tipu did not provide any documents or witnesses who supported or confirmed any of this testimony concerning the source of the funds to pay for the $37,000 he claims he contributed to the down payment.</div><div><br></div><div>Ali testified that the agreement that he had with Tipu was that Tipu would in the future remove himself from title to the Property such that Ali would be 100% owner of the Property. Supposedly Tipu was only on title to the Property so that Ali would qualify for the loan to purchase the Property with Tipu having no right to title or any other ownership interest. Tipu in testimony denied that he and Ali ever had any such understanding when the Property was purchased.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ali testified that on three separate occasions he demanded that Tipu remove his name from the loan and title to the Property, but Tipu never did. The first demand took place in February 1999. Ali claimed that his oral agreement made in 1995 with Tipu was that once Ali got a job, which allegedly occurred in February 1999, Tipu would remove his name from title and the loan. Ali testified that after he got that job in 1999, he demanded that Tiu remove his name from title and the loan, but Tipu supposedly objected to the demand to avoid a prepayment penalty and did not remove is name from title.</div><div><br></div><div>Ali made another demand in 2005. At that time, Ali testified that he wanted to refinance the loan for the Property to get a better interest rate and again demanded that Tipu remove his name from title and the loan. Tipu supposedly said he would do so but did not remove his name from the title. Again in 2008 Ali claimed that he wanted to refinance the loan to the Property to get a better interest rate. The bank told Ali to get Tipu to quit claim his interest to Ali. Ali provided Tipu with the quit claim deeds for Tipu to sign and presented the quit claim deeds to Tipu at their mosque, but he never signed the quit claim deeds.</div><div><br></div><div>Matters came to a head in July 2019 when Ali demanded that his mother, who was still living in the apartment after Ali’s father’s death in 2002, pay an increased rent. Ali denies that he demanded that his mother pay more rent or that he was threatening his mother with eviction. Tipu testified that when he learned of his brother’s demand for the mother to pay more rent and Ali’s threatened eviction of his mother from her apartment, he intervened and started to collect the rent himself. Tipu also at that time started paying the mortgage to protect his mother from eviction. Ali denied this rendition of events, but he had no explanation for Tipu’s allegedly sudden interest in the management of the property. On July 9, 2020, Tipu filed his lawsuit against Tipu for resulting trust and quiet title.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>(a)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Procedural Issues Regarding CCP Section 631.8</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>By this motion, defendant and cross-complainant Sultan Tipu seeks the entry of judgment in his favor as to the resulting trust and quiet title claims without putting on his case in chief in his defense, following the introduction of all of plaintiff’s evidence in support of the claims set forth in plaintiff’s operative complaint.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Relief is sought pursuant to CCP section 631.8, which provides:</span></div><div>“(a) After a party has completed his presentation of evidence in a trial by the court, the other party, without waiving his right to offer evidence in support of his defense or in rebuttal in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a judgment.

The money was paid by American Motorists deliberately and with full knowledge of all operative factors because of American Motorists' concern that if it failed to settle because of its noncoverage claim, it might be liable for amounts in excess of its policy limit.”</div><div>American Motorists, at 884-885.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal then reviewed the evidence in the case before it and concluded that it did not support a finding of the requisite intent:</div><div><br></div><div>“We are thus brought to the question whether there is in the record substantial evidence of circumstances from which the trial court could rationally conclude that Cowan, by and through his guardian ad litem, was not intended to take the beneficial interest in the money paid. The conclusion is inescapable that there is not. The settlement agreement is not a part of the record, but there is no assertion on the part of any party that it contained any provision for the proceeds of the settlement to be refunded to American Motorists should a court subsequently determine there was no coverage under the policy. The fact that more than $25,000 was paid out of the settlement proceeds for costs, fees and expenses is inconsistent with the possibility there was any such provision contained in the settlement agreement.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;We have little doubt that it was the hope of American Motorists from the outset that it might be able to recoup all or part of the settlement proceeds in the event of a subsequent adjudication of noncoverage. However, the unilateral hope or intention of one party to the transaction could hardly serve as the basis for the imposition of a resulting trust. The stipulation executed by the parties through counsel in which it was recited that American Motorists desired to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds was executed after the settlement agreement was fully executed, approved by the court and paid. Moreover, as previously observed, the stipulation did not constitute an agreement on the part of Cowan to the imposition of a trust upon the settlement proceeds; it was at best a recognition, after the fact, that American Motorists desired such relief.</div><div><br></div><div>In the absence of some express provision in the settlement agreement for the subsequent imposition of a trust on the settlement proceeds should it be adjudicated there was no coverage under the policy or, at the very least, a mutually agreed reservation of rights of some sort, the settlement agreement was a full and final disposition of the disputed claim between American Motorists and Cowan ( Fouratt v. Goodman (1928) 203 Cal. 252, 254 [263 P.2d 533]), and in the absence of evidence of fraud or mistake of a type sufficient to support rescission, the settlement agreement was a bar to recoupment from Cowan.

The presumption can be overcome only by evidence of an agreement or understanding between the parties that the title reflected in the deed is not what the parties intended. (Lucas, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 813, 166 Cal.Rptr. 853, 614 P.2d 285;&nbsp; In re Marriage of Munguia (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 853, 860, 195 Cal.Rptr. 199.) Significantly, “the presumption cannot be overcome solely by tracing the funds used to purchase the property, nor by testimony of an intention not disclosed to the grantee at the time of the execution of the conveyance.” (In re Marriage of Broderick, supra, 209 Cal.App.3d at p. 496, 257 Cal.Rptr. 397; see also Gudelj v.

Nor can the presumption be rebutted by evidence that title was taken in a particular manner merely to obtain a loan. (Cf. In re Marriage of Kahan, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p. 69, 219 Cal.Rptr. 700 [when title was taken by spouses as joint tenants to obtain loan, property was presumptively held in joint tenancy].)</div><div><br></div><div>To overcome this form of title presumption, the evidence of a contrary agreement or understanding must be “clear and convincing.” (Evid.Code, § 662; cf.

Tipu was named in real estate purchase contract as one of two buyers, applied for the loan as purchaser and was placed on deed of trust and grant deed, Tipu argues that Ali and Tipu agreed that they would buy the property as equal partners and that both would be recorded on the loan and title as such, which agreement was not challenged formally for over 26 years until Ali filed this lawsuit. There is evidence that both parties contributed money toward the down payment, and purchase in 1996.&nbsp; There is no evidence that Ali ever claimed sole ownership interest in any legal or formal setting, as evidenced by the fact that both Ali and Tipu reported on tax returns, prepared by same accountant, that they were equal owners of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, Ali argues that prior to the purchase of the property, Ali and Tipu agreed that Ali was the 100% owner, and that Tipu was in the transaction solely for the purpose of obtaining the credit for the purchase money loan, and that in the future Tipu would remove his name from title.&nbsp; Ali argues that he, with his own money, paid $51,500 as a down payment on the property, and Tipu was placed on title by the mortgage lender only because he was a co-signer on the loan.&nbsp; Ali also argues that from the date of the purchase he paid most of the mortgage payments for the property and other expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The court observes that there was evidence submitted concerning a family meeting and an overall intent to share ownership between Ali and Tipu, presumably regardless of the source of the downpayment, to account for mental issues Ali had experienced to prevent Ali from transferring the property in a compromised state, and to safeguard their apartment as the future long-term home of the parents. The nature of the family enterprise surrounding the purchase of the Property gives rise to a reasonable inference that money came from a family source and, in any case, not entirely from Ali. The family’s purpose was to provide a financially secure residence for the elderly parents to live out their remaining years.&nbsp; This issue of Ali’s mental stability was another independent reason to have both Tipu and Ali on title.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>As outlined in American Motorist, and Laing, above, with respect to determining the existence of a resulting trust, the court must evaluate whether, from the evidence presented, an intent appears, or is inferred, that the beneficial interest should not be enjoyed with the legal title.&nbsp; Laing, at 515, American Motorist, at 855.&nbsp; The court must apply the appropriate burden, which is on the party, i.e., Ali, claiming that a resulting trust must be imposed.

On that issue, the court found that Mrs. Fadel, for cultural reasons, knowingly and knowledgeably granted any interest she may have had in the Property to Mr. Fadel as his sole and separate property, and no subsequent writing existed transmuting it to community property.”</div><div>In re Fadel, at 7.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A motion for reconsideration of the order granting relief from the stay was denied.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Appellate Panel on review relied on the “form of title” presumption under which, “the description in a deed as to how title is held presumptively affects the actual ownership of the property,” noting that this common law presumption had been codified in Evidence Code section 662.&nbsp; In re Fadel, at 11.&nbsp; The appellate panel considered the Family Code section 760 general presumption that property acquired during marriage is community property, as well as the provision in the statute that “the affirmative act of specifying a form of ownership in the conveyance of title… removes such property from the more general presumptions.”&nbsp; In re Fadel, at 11.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The appellate panel accordingly held that the property was presumably the separate property of the spouse in whose name title was taken, Mr. Fadel, giving rise to the rebuttable form of title presumption, and placing the burden on Mrs. Fadel to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an agreement or understanding existed between the parties, “that the title reflected in the deed was not what the parties intended.&nbsp; In re Fadel, at 13-14.&nbsp; The appellate panel went on to state the language defendant relies upon here, that the presumption “cannot be rebutted by… ‘evidence that title was taken in a particular way merely to obtain a loan.’”&nbsp; In re Fadel, at 14.&nbsp; This language was a quotation from In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson, 169 Cal.App.4th at 190-191, discussed above.</span></div><div><br></div><div>However, the appellate panel in In re Fadel noted that in that case, the interspousal transfer grant deed already had conveyed all of Mrs. Fadel’s right, title and interest in the property to Mr. Fadel in 2001, and that in 2003, Mr. Fadel obtained a loan, “in his own name” secured by the property, with the recorded deed of trust in that transaction stating that the property used to secure the loan was Mr. Fadel’s sole and separate property.&nbsp; In re Fadel, at 14.&nbsp; As plaintiff argues in the opposition, the case does not stand for the principle quoted, as it did not apply in that case—title was not taken in the manner it was taken to facilitate a loan, as the loan was taken only in Mr. Fadel’s name and secured by property described in the deed of trust as separate property in his name.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quotation from In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson therefore appears to be dicta in the In re Fadel case.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in opposition argues that reliance by defendant on In re Fadel is misplaced because federal Bankruptcy Appellate Panel decisions are not binding precedent regarding state law.&nbsp; The court recognizes that this position is correct and does not consider the decision binding precedent.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also argues that the statement relied upon in In re Fadel, is from In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson, which cited as an example In re Marriage of Kahan (1985) 174 Cal.App. 3d 63, which plaintiff argues, did not make this assertion about obtaining a loan. The court of appeal in In re Marriage of Kahan, in determining whether the community property presumption applied to real property which was originally held as one spouse’s separate property, but deeded to both parties during a loan transaction, focused on the community property presumption:</span></div><div><br></div><div>“Priscilla claims that the court improperly applied the principles of Lucas to these facts, since the property was not actually “acquired” by the parties during marriage but was her own separate property, deeded to both parties only to accommodate the lender.

(In re Marriage of Miller (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 988, 992, 184 Cal.Rptr. 408; In re Marriage of Johnson (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 57, 60, 191 Cal.Rptr. 545.) Furthermore, two courts have recently applied the presumption in the precise case where one spouse makes a transfer of separate property to joint tenancy in order to secure a home equity loan. (In re Marriage of Anderson (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 572, 578, 201 Cal.Rptr. 498; In re Marriage of Neal (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 117, 124, 200 Cal.Rptr. 341, both reversed on other grounds by In re Marriage of Buol, supra, 39 Cal.3d 751, 218 Cal.Rptr. 31, 705 P.2d 354.)”</div><div>In re Marriage of Kahan, at 68-69.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal had also found that in that case the trial court’s finding that there was no agreement between the spouses sufficient to rebut the community property presumption was implied in its conclusion that the property was entirely community property, and that the spouse claiming the exemption had not requested such a finding.&nbsp; &nbsp;In re Marriage of Kahan, at 68-69.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This result appears to be an apt analogy to the showing required in connection with the form of title presumption addressed in In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Anderson.

Robinson and In re Fadel, in an adversary proceeding seeking to avoid and recover the value of an alleged fraudulent transfer of a 50 percent ownership of the debtor in real property to defendant.&nbsp; In that case, the debtor’s mother, Martha, had transferred her 50 percent ownership interest in the subject property to the debtor, Victor, who a year later transferred his interest in the property to his brother, Lavell, via quitclaim deed expressly stating that the transfer was a bona fide gift, with the grantor receiving nothing in return.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The evidence presented in that case at trial was that the family had held a family meeting to address the mother’s health condition and care.&nbsp; The mother was suffering from congestive heart failure and dementia and was a fall risk.&nbsp; She was living at her home, the subject property, following a hospitalization and a one to two week stay in a convalescent home, where she developed bed sores, and the family had gotten together and pulled her back to her home where she wanted to be.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the family meeting, those attending came up with a potential solution to help remedy the financial issues posed by the need for care for the mother, in effect, for Victor and his brother Lavell, who was also living at the subject property, to obtain a loan to help her get 24-hour care and support other needs around the house, based on equity in the property.&nbsp; It was determined that because Victor was the only sibling who was employed at the time, it was decided that he would be the one to try to get the loan.&nbsp; Papers were drawn up, and a quitclaim deed putting the mother’s half of the property into Victor’s name, which were notarized.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Victor was never able to obtain the planned home equity loan because about a week later he had a massive rupture of his colon, from which he almost died, spent 10 days in the hospital, and then was told he could not get the loan unless he was working and could present a current paycheck stub, which he could not do because of his medical emergency.&nbsp; It was decided to hold off on the loan until Victor was back at work getting a paycheck.&nbsp; Victor decided in about June or July of 2010 that he would not be able to obtain the loan, and in November of 2010, the mother passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In June of 2011, Victor transferred the interest in the property “back” to Lavell, which had been discussed at the family meeting, and Victor testified that he had intended to transfer the property back to his brother, never had an intent not to, never considered the property that the mother and Lavell lived in to be his, but always considered the property to be Lavell and his mother’s.&nbsp; Because of those circumstances, Victor had not listed the transfer of the property to Lavell on his bankruptcy schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The bankruptcy court found that despite Victor’s testimony that the purpose of the mother’s transfer was to use Victor’s credit in order to obtain a loan, the trial testimony of the interested parties that their mother did not transfer a beneficial interest in her one-half interest in the property to be credible.&nbsp; Also, such intent was not established by clear and convincing evidence as required under Evidence Code section 662 that Victor’s legal title to a one-half interest in the property “was not full beneficial interest of that one-half interest, which remained in the mother.”&nbsp; In re Sloan, at 8.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The bankruptcy court observed, although the trustee had not argued such, that there were decisions which “make statements that evidence that title was taken to obtain a loan cannot per se rebut” the general presumption of record title.&nbsp;

Olson (1935) 4 Cal.2d 434 and the court of appeal opinion in Rench v. McMillan (1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 872, and concluded that under the facts of those cases, the courts had in fact weighed the evidence that there had been agreement to return record title in connection with a loan transaction, undermining any pronouncement in cases under the subsequently enacted statute that there had been under the common law on which the statute was based, “a per se rule against rebutting general presumption of record title with evidence that title was taken merely to obtain a loan.”&nbsp; In re Sloan, at 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The federal bankruptcy court concluded in the case before it:</div><div>“Accordingly, based upon a review of California Evidence Code 662's plain language, the comments of the California Law Review Commission reflecting the legislative intent behind the statute, the implicit holding of the California Supreme Court in Olson inconsistent with the statement of the per se rule against loans in Brooks &amp; Robinson, and the Olson and Rench cases upon which the statute is based, the court declines to follow the per se rule stated in Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson. There is no legitimacy to the statement of Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson interpreting California Evidence Code § 662, which does not come from the statute, or from the case law of the state's highest court, the California Supreme Court. For the same reasons, the court finds unpersuasive, and declines to follow, the statement made by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in In re Fadel, citing Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson and adopting the per se rule from that case. In re Fadel, 492 B.R. at 14, citing and quoting, In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson, 169 Cal.App.4th at 190…”</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, the court follows the California Supreme Court's decision in Olson, as well as the California Court of Appeal's decision in Rench, both of which necessarily imply that the form of title can be rebutted by evidence that title was taken in a particular manner merely to obtain a loan, as well as the plain language of California Evidence Code § 662. As in Olson and Rench, the court undertakes an evidentiary analysis of whether there was proof of an agreement that legal title only, and not beneficial title, was transferred merely to obtain a loan, but unlike in Olson and Rench, as previously stated, the court determines on the facts in this case that Defendant has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer from Martha to Victor was merely to put Victor on legal title, and that Martha still held the beneficial interest in the Property.”</div><div>In re Sloan, at 11.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This court recognizes that this opinion, which is not published, is similarly subject to plaintiff’s own argument that such a case is not binding on this court, but to be considered only for its persuasive value.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Court notes the reasoning behind In Re Sloan has some persuasive value in difficult factual scenarios such as those presented in that case, and based on the evaluation of Supreme Court common law authority on which the statute was enacted, that the pronouncement in In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson concerning title matters in procurement of a loan should not be viewed as a per se doctrine.&nbsp; There accordingly appears to be some reasonable dispute concerning whether the doctrine stated in that case, i.e., In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson, should be considered a per se bar to the consideration of evidence concerning the way title is taken in connection with a loan transaction, or whether the court should consider and weigh such evidence in its resulting trust intent assessment in the totality of all evidence presented.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Ali also argues that the court of appeal in Estate of Yool (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 867, which this court notes was decided based on the statute, rather than common law, noted that the probate court in that case had ruled that the evidence supported the imposition of a resulting trust in favor of a daughter with respect to property she owned jointly with her mother, where the facts recited in that opinion included evidence that the mother had not intended to take beneficial title to the property, but had “accepted legal title as a mere accommodation to facilitate financing.”&nbsp; Estate of Yool, at 871.&nbsp; The court of appeal did not find that such evidence had been improperly considered or note that it was irrelevant under the doctrine from In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson that the title presumption cannot be rebutted by evidence that title was taken in a particular way merely to obtain a loan, although In re Yool, decided in 2007, was decided well after the decision in In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson in 1985.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal did not directly address in any detail the merits of the probate court’s decision that a resulting trust be recognized in favor of the daughter, or on what basis, but did affirm the probate court’s order below, evidently including the order that the administrator below execute and record a deed quitclaiming any record interest of the deceased mother’s estate in the property to the daughter.&nbsp; Estate of Yool, at 870 and 878.&nbsp; This outcome suggests that there had been no error in the resulting trust determination despite it apparently being based, at least in part, on recognition of offered evidence that the mother had accepted legal title as a mere accommodation to facilitate financing.&nbsp; Estate of Yool, at 871.&nbsp; &nbsp; This result suggests that evidence concerning record title being entered in connection with a loan transaction is not uniformly considered per se immaterial to a resulting trust determination.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>In addition to the authorities cited by both sides, this court recognizes, as was noted in In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson, that the circumstances of knowingly permitting title to be entered in a certain manner to accommodate the understandable requirement of a lender carries great weight with respect to the intention of the parties with respect to the manner in which title is taken at the time of entering into a loan transaction.&nbsp; However, it is clear that in most cases common sense would suggest that a person agreeing to be responsible on a mortgage loan would reasonably expect to have access to the security for the debt and to remain on title for the duration of that debt obligation.&nbsp; The court also notes with concern that the practice of entering into an agreement with a lender to repay a debt based on&nbsp; representations to the lender concerning a co-signer’s credit-worthiness, and a pledge to hold security for repayment of the loan, when the intention is to hold beneficial title in the party who would not otherwise qualify for the loan, an intention undisclosed to the lender, is tantamount&nbsp; to sanctioning a form of fraud on the lender.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>Based on the legal arguments and reasoning supra, the court in this case will consider the evidence concerning the taking of title in the manner taken to obtain a loan to the extent it bears on the court’s assessment of the intent at the time the transaction was entered in connection with the imposition of a resulting trust.&nbsp; &nbsp;The circumstances will not be considered per se irrelevant, but is one factor to be considered, along with other factors, including the commonsense factors discussed above.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>This court also notes that in the authorities cited and relied upon by plaintiff, in weighing the evidence concerning agreements related to loan transactions, courts were generally inclined to afford lesser weight to the testimony of a resulting trust claimant where there was an absence of corroborating evidence supporting the self-serving testimony of the claimant’s intent. In the case at bar, there is absolutely no corroboration of Ali’s testimony concerning intent at formation leading to resulting trust.</span></div><div><br></div><div>In Olson, the California Supreme Court addressed a claim by Milda Olson that at the time she signed a gift deed conveying outright to her former husband, Werner Olson, her share of real property held in joint tenancy by both of them, Werner Olson had assured Milda that once he had properly refinanced the property, he would restore the title to its former status of joint tenancy between them.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court in connection with the evidence submitted by Milda Olson, which consisted only of her uncorroborated testimony, observed:</div><div><br></div><div>“With reference to the real property, we can see no escape for the appellant from the predicament in which she finds herself. The burden was upon her to establish by clear and convincing evidence that a promise was made to her by Werner Olson to subsequently restore the title to its former status and that in reliance upon such promise she executed the deed in question. She was unable to produce the letter which she claimed contained the promise and relied solely upon her own testimony to support her contention. It is apparent that the trial court did not deem this sufficient and found against her. In view of the fact that the only person who could successfully contradict her testimony was dead, the trial court was justified in considering her uncorroborated testimony as weak and unsatisfactory.</div><div>Olson, at 437-438&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Rench, supra, the court of appeal likewise noted with respect to the quality of the evidence presented by the resulting trust claimant, who to overcome the presumption that the holder of legal title owns full beneficial interest in property, must present clear and convincing evidence:&nbsp;</div><div>“The trial court is not bound to accept testimony even when unimpeached, against a presumption or contrary reasonable inference from the other facts in evidence (Huth v. Katz, 30 Cal.2d 605, ——, 184 P.2d 521) and whereas here the only direct evidence of a resulting trust comes from the lips of one whom the court may decide is discredited it certainly cannot be said on appeal that the court was bound to believe him.”</div><div>Rench at 875.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Rench, the subject testimony was not unimpeached, as there had been impeachment of the witness by way of evidence of conviction of a felony, and rehabilitation by proof of his subsequent pardon by the governor.&nbsp; Rench, at 874.&nbsp; It was also argued that there was one piece of documentary evidence to corroborate the testimony, which the court of appeal found was consistent with competing theories with respect to its significance, and the court of appeal concluded, “It was for the trial court to weigh this evidence and judge its effect.”&nbsp; Rench, at 875.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The trial court here will also consider these observations when evaluating and weighing the evidence and whether it constitutes clear and convincing proof.&nbsp; The court finds that Ali has not carried his burden of proof by the clear and convincing standard of proof. As will be discussed in more detail later, Ali’s completely uncorroborated testimony of the intent of the parties in the formation of the alleged resulting test is insufficient and unpersuasive and is contrary to common sense.</div><div><br></div><div>(c)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Evidence Code Section 622</div><div>Defendant also argues that Evidence Code 622 gives rise to a presumption that the facts recited in written instruments are true as between the parties, and in this case, there are two written instruments, the loan, and the grant deed, both of which clearly state that both Ali and Tipu are equal owners of the property as joint tenants.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Evidence Code section 622 provides:</div><div>“The facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest; but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Tipu relies on In re Marriage of Clarke &amp; Akel (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 914, in which, in addressing the argument that the statute should be applied with respect to a premarital agreement in a dissolution proceeding, stated:</div><div>“Evidence Code section 622 is based upon the doctrine of estoppel by contract, i.e., “the principle that parties who have expressed their mutual assent are bound by the contents of the instrument they have signed and may not thereafter claim that its provisions do not express their intentions or understanding.” (City of Santa Cruz v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.

Dunkelman (2005, 2nd Dist.) 133 Cal.App.4th 95, 117 (noting the word “instrument” in the statute “usually refers to a contract,” and questioning whether the statute applied to a medical consent form, particularly where the patient was rushed through the admission process without a real opportunity to read the consent form); Plaza Freeway Ltd. Partnership v. First Mountain Bank (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 616, 625-626 (holding the term “instrument” applies to an estoppel certificate executed by the tenant to a commercial lease agreement).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Ali argues that here there is no written instrument evidencing arms-length negotiations between the parties, only the grant deed from the seller to Ali and Tipu as joint tenants, and that Ali has found no published cases which hold that a grant deed is a written instrument within the meaning of Evidence Code section 622.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ali also argues that such a result, in effect, finding that the conclusive presumption of Evidence Code section 622 applies to such loan and title documents, would undermine the provisions of Evidence Code section 662, which provide that the presumption of title through a grant deed is not conclusive but can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in reply does not address this argument, or offer any case law to the contrary, but essentially repeats the arguments made in the moving papers on this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court is persuaded by the authority and argument advanced by plaintiff Ali that Evidence Code Section 622 does not apply in this situation. The loan agreement does not reflect the results of an arms-length negotiation concerning title between Ali and Tipu, but rather is an agreement with the lender concerning loan terms. In addition, the grant deed does not reflect an agreement between the parties but was, according to Ali, required by the lender. It does not make sense that Evidence Code section 622 would apply to a grant deed, which was signed in conjunction with a separate oral agreement entered with between Ali and Tipu with respect to the effect of that grant deed. Such an agreement was the alleged oral agreement here to take Tipu off title, which understanding concededly was never memorialized in a “written instrument.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hence the conclusive presumption of Evidence Code Section 622 does not apply to the case at bar.

The understanding is not an oral contract, as Plaintiff implies in his complaint and closing argument brief.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes that pursuant to the language in Laing v. Laubach, discussed supra, the imposition of a resulting trust is not subject to the statute of frauds at all. Rather, it is an understanding between the parties about the nature of the transaction at issue to the formation of a resulting trust and is not an oral contract.</div><div><br></div><div>As set forth above, the court of appeal in Laing, in describing the nature of a resulting trust, noted:</div><div>“Such a trust is implied by law to carry out the intention of the parties; it is implied from the facts, and neither written evidence of agreement nor fraud on the part of the trustee is an essential element.&nbsp; The trustee has no duties to perform, no trust to administer, and no purpose to carry out except the single one of holding or conveying according to the beneficiary's demands.)”</div><div>Laing, at 515, citations omitted, emphasis added.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Ali in opposition argues that the statute of frauds does not apply to resulting trusts because they are created by operation of law.&nbsp; As set forth above, CCP section 1971 expressly provides that “No estate or interest in real property, nor any power over or concerning it, or in any manner relating thereto, can be created, granted, assigned, surrendered, or declared, otherwise than by operation of law, or a conveyance or other instrument in writing…”&nbsp; (Emphasis added).</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Ali cites to Martin v.

There is evidence that about this time Mrs. Marshall became saddled with the burden of supporting plaintiff's sister and her family who had recently moved into the Casa Bonita and plaintiff was afraid that his mother “was going to turn my apartment house over to the others”; that in a discussion between the parties, the mother said “she still needed money” and the son decided he would “let her keep it” as he didn't need the money himself; and that the mother told him that she had made provision in case anything happened to her to return the apartment house to him. As to the 1948 incident with Mr. Clark, there is no evidence that Mrs. Marshall repudiated her agreement at that time. Defendants have not directed our attention to any evidence, including that pertinent to the above two incidents, which constrains us to conclude as a matter of law that Mrs. Marshall repudiated her promise to reconvey the property or asserted sole ownership of it, at any time prior to October 1953.”</div><div>Marshall, at 251.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In Strausburg v. Connor (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 398, the court of appeal found that the facts supported a conclusion that appellant, “recognized her obligation continuously until she demanded exclusive possession of the property,” which event occurred within the statute of limitations.&nbsp; Strausburg, at 401.&nbsp; In that case, the facts included mention that before appellant finally demanded exclusive possession, there had been demands both orally and in writing that appellant reconvey, and appellant “always replied she would do so, but” according to respondent, appellant “was always going to do so but never did.”&nbsp; Strausburg, at 400-401.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In Robertson v. Summerlin (1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 62, the court of appeal found that the action had been filed within the statute of limitations, as filed within one month after defendant repudiated the trust and first claimed the subject property as his own.&nbsp; The court of appeal observed:</span></div><div>“Between March 1935, and May 1937, plaintiff frequently asked defendant to reconvey the property to him. She found various excuses to postpone the actual conveyance but at no time asserted her ownership of the property and upon each request agreed to reconvey upon the happening of some future event. Several of these conversations were had in the presence of disinterested witnesses who detailed them during the trial. In May 1937, the defendant for the first time claimed the property as her own and refused to convey it to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Robertson, at 64.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A key aspect of these cases seems to be that there had been evidence or findings that encounters had not been accompanied by an assertion of ownership or an indication that defendant was claiming that there had not been an agreement to hold title contrary to the record title, but that defendant was signaling a lack of hostility and intention to go along with the agreement, which in Robertson, was characterized as an agreement to convey.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The trial court is charged with evaluating the weight and effect of evidence offered to show repudiation and recognition of repudiation.&nbsp; In Airola v. Gorham (1942) 56 Cal.App.2d 42, the court of appeal addressed the issue before it on the statute of limitations in a constructive trust case as follows:</span></div><div>“This being a voluntary constructive trust neither the statute of limitations nor laches would begin to operate until its repudiation was brought home to the beneficiary. (O'Brien v. O'Brien, 50 Cal.App.2d 658, 660 [123 P.2d 877]; Chard v. O'Connell, 48 Cal.App.2d 475, 480 [120 P.2d 125]; England v. Winslow, 196 Cal. 260, 272 [237 P. 542]; Cooney v. Glynn, 157 Cal. 583, 589 [108 P. 506]; Taylor v. Morris, 163 Cal. 717, 725 [127 P. 66].)</div><div><br></div><div>There is evidence of continuing declarations of both Frank and George in recognition of the trust. One witness testified that in 1935 she heard George tell Lucinda: “It won't be long now, Mother, until everything will be straightened up and the property will be deeded back to you.”</div><div><br></div><div>Something is attempted to be made of earlier declarations of Lucinda that the boys had not kept their promise to deed the property back to her. However, the weight and effect of this evidence was for the trial court. The trial court may well have concluded that subsequent promises made to Lucinda satisfied her that her sons had not repudiated their trust and had every intention of carrying it out in good faith.”</div><div>Airola, at 54.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>In this case, the action was filed on July 9, 2020.&nbsp; Four years prior to this would be July of 2016. The court finds that Tipu repudiated the resulting trust, assuming a resulting trust was created, outside the four-year statute of limitations. The repudiation was a combination of Tipu’s words and conduct during the four separate occasions over a twenty-year period that Ali asked and/or demanded that Tipu reconvey title to the Property to Ali.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first demand occurred in 1999. Tipu objected to the demand by his conduct by never getting back to Ali with a reconveyance of title as Ali had demanded, even though Ali says that Tipu said he would reconvey title. Ali made the demand again in 2005 that Tipu reconveys the title to him, but once again Tipu did not reconvey the title. Ali made a third demand in 2008. Again, Tipu did not reconvey the title as per Ali’s demand. In fact, in third instance, the bank told Ali to get Tipu to sign a quit claim deed, which Ali delivered to Tipu at their mosque. However, Tipu refused to sign the quit claim deed to reconvey the title. The court finds that the cumulative effect of Tipu’s never “following up” on the demand to reconvey title is a repudiation by conduct.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Tipu’s version is that on each of the three occasions mentioned above when Ali demanded that Tipu reconvey title, Tipu allegedly said he would reconvey title but never did. This conduct is different in nature from conduct or words by Tipu providing excuses for not reconveying the property. The point is that the cumulative effect on three separate occasions of Tipu not reconveying the Property when Ali demanded that he do so, constituted by 2008 a repudiation of the resulting trust, assuming one was created.&nbsp; The only testimony on this issue is from Ali. Hence, the cause of action for resulting trust accrued in 2008.&nbsp; Four years later would be 2012, so the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court also notes that there was a fourth occasion when Ali in 2016 again demanded that Tipu reconvey the Property to Ali so he could put his wife on title. At this time Tipu objected and again did not convey the title. Ali again testified that Tipu refused to convey the title, and if this event occurred before July 9, 2016, it would also be outside of the statute of limitations.</div><div><br></div><div>However, the court’s ruling that the resulting trust is barred by the statute of limitations is based on cumulative repudiations, which ripened into an actual repudiation in 2008. The four-year CCP 343 statute of limitations ran in 2012. The court rejects the argument of plaintiff that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the family argument erupted in 2019 at which time Tipu “took over” running the property which supposedly was the only time Tipu engaged in any conduct which would indicate his ownership interest in the Property. This “take over” conducted by Tipu of managing the Property and collecting rents allegedly breached the understanding the only Ali could manage the property and collect rents. The court notes that this argument has nothing to do with the understanding regarding title, which is the essence of the resulting trust. Hence, this “take over” conduct by Tipu does not constitute a repudiation. But Tipu’s conduct of refusing to reconvey title is conduct indicating repudiation of the resulting trust.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Prior to 2019 in the late 1990’s and early 2000, Tipu made mortgage payments. Tipu also claimed the interest deductions on his tax returns. Hence, the argument that Tipu passively sat by and never engaged in any conduct to assert his ownership interest until the family argument in 2019 is simply not borne out in the facts. Tipu engaged in conduct to assert his right to “manage” the property by making mortgage payments when Ali was unable to do so.</span></div><div>CREDIBILITY FINDINGS</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, on a motion for judgment under CCP 631.8, it is held that, “[b]because section 631.8 authorizes the trial court to weigh evidence and make findings, the court may refuse to believe witnesses and draw conclusions at odds with expert opinion.”&nbsp; Roth v.

His testimony lacked common sense, made sweeping assertions and was completely uncorroborated in all material matters, especially the intent of the parties when the Property was purchased, and the source of the funds used for the down payment. In other words, when Ali’s testimony is viewed in the totality of all the evidence, the character of his testimony did not conform to common standards of logic, custom and practice of ordinary conduct among reasonable persons in an objective sense of what one would expect in these circumstances. A reasonable person would not place his/her personal credit on the line with a bank without also being on title.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, there are also particular indicia of lack of Ali ’credibility as well. Ali testified in trial through a Bengali interpreter, even though he testified on cross examination that he speaks, reads, and understands English without any problems. In addition, all writings, and documents in the transaction to purchase the Property were written in English, and all witnesses, including Mr. Devani, communicated with Ali in English.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court is cognizant that foreign born individuals who have a strong command of the English language sometimes want court proceedings to be translated for them. However, the court noted that Ali, as a slip of the tongue, sometimes began to respond to translated questions in English. This language conflation reinforced in the court’s mind whether a translator was necessary. It caused the court to conclude that the translator was being used to buttress Ali’s credibility for the court to accept the truthfulness of Ali’s testimony even though it defied common sense because as the “foreigner” Ali had certain understandings of events and statements that otherwise would not be readily apparent to the court or other observers not familiar with the customs and practices of a person from Bangladesh.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Also, Ali represented to the seller, lender, escrow and the title company that he was an unmarried man and was taking title as an unmarried man. Ali in fact was married at the time, so that this statement was untrue. Ali’s explanation that the bank wanted him to state that he was an unmarried man to simplify the transaction does not ring true. So, in essence, Ali was sponsoring a false statement on legal documents. This conduct undermines Ali’s creditability.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There are also numerous inconsistencies in Ali’s testimony on several material matters. In his complaint and in his verified interrogatory answers Ali stated that he had been a tenant at the Property since 1995. At trial he admitted that he was not a tenant at the Property until 1996. In his complaint, Ali stated that the understanding of the intent of he and Tipu which allegedly gives rise to the resulting trust was that Tipu at some point in the future would remove his name from title. At trial, Ali testified that once Ali got a job, Tipu would remove his name from the loan and title. Ali also offered inconsistent testimony about the bank account he opened with Tipu from which he and Tipu would pay for the mortgage, property taxes and maintenance from the revenue from the rent paid by the tenants. See Exhibits 117 and 118.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Ali testified that he and his wife created a rental ledger from 1996 to 2021 for the purposes of the trial. Exhibit 13 The rental ledger was completely inconsistent with Ali’s income and expenses for the Property stated on his tax return. See Exhibits 115 and 116. The differences in the income numbers were significant and are not attributable to minor accounting errors, as Ali testified at trial. Ali also denied at trial that he never missed or was late in making mortgage payments. However, when confronted on cross examination with two bank-generated late payment notices, he still testified he never missed a payment or was late with a payment. See Exhibits 119 and 120.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court also makes its credibility finding of Ali based on the court’s observations of his demeanor on the witness stand. The court finds that Ali is not credible based on EC section 780(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h). The court also notes that Ali has an enhanced financial interest in the outcome of the trial given that, if he sustains his position, he will receive a 100% interest, instead of the 50% interest maintained by Tipu, in the Property, which given current fair market value of the Property most likely would be well over a million dollars. In any event, a 100% interest versus a 50% interest is a significant difference in value revealing Ali’s strong interest in the outcome of the trial.</span></div><div><br></div><div>(2)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Sultan Tipu</div><div>The court finds that Tipu is credible. His testimony had the hallmarks of common sense and consistency. His testimony that his name was on title and the loan documents to facilitate the purchase of the Property makes sense. Ali, in his closing argument brief attacks Tipu’s credibility primarily based on lack of corroboration, inconsistent statements and lack in common sense. The court notes that both Tipu and Ali have little or no corroboration for most of their testimony and recitation of events. It is a credibility contest of “he said versus he said.”&nbsp; Hence, the court is forced to determine what set of facts makes sense from a common sense and objective viewpoint. Tipu’s testimony adheres much more to common sense than Ali’s testimony.</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes that neither Tipu nor Ali have any independent evidence of the source of their funds for the down payment for the Property. The receipt (Exhibit 4) in Ali’s name does not show the source of the funds. Ali’s claims that as an enterprising and intelligent businessman he had $100,000 on hand in his own bank account at the time of the purchase is not credible given his background and total lack of corroboration.&nbsp; Tipu’s version that the source of the funds was from family connections in Bangladesh from his cousin Sultan Shomeer&nbsp; and family property in Bangladesh makes sense in that the entire purchase of the Property was a family enterprise to find secure and affordable housing for the aging parents of Tipu and Ali. Tipu’s alleged inconsistencies relating to the structure of his source of financing from Bangladesh, i.e., a non-recourse loan with family property in Bangladesh securing the loan, or repayment to Tipu of a prior loan, is immaterial when the same cousin is involved in the foreign financing. The point is that Tipu admits that he did not have the funds on hand for the down payment while Ali makes the incredulous statement that he had a bank account with $100,000 on hand for the purchase of the Property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ali’s efforts to undermine Tipu’s credibility based on Tipu’s tax returns for 2014 and 2015 fall short as well. Tipu claimed deductions for rents, interest, and expenses on the Property as did Ali. Both had the right to do so given the joint venture nature of the enterprise for the Property. Both used the same tax preparer. The point is that Tipu taking this “tax posture” on his tax returns pursuant to a tax preparer’s advice, which is different from Ali claiming specific amounts of categories of expenses when the numbers on the tax return which Ali provided to the tax preparer were not accurate in a material way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court also makes its credibility finding of Tipu based on the court’s observations of his demeanor on the witness stand. The court finds that Tipu is credible. The court finds that Ali’s testimony is credible based on EC section 780(a), (b), (c), and (g).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(3)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Jeff Davani</div><div>The court finds that Davani is not credible. When Tipu’s attorney contacted Davani about his testimony on this case pursuant to a trial subpoena issued by plaintiff’s attorney, Davani’s attorney responded that Davani had no recollection of events that occurred “dating back two decades” and that Davani’s memory is impaired due to old age and poor health. See Exhibit 116. In the same email, Davani’s attorney says his representation of Davani was limited to the email in question (Exhibit 116). During Davani’s testimony at trial, he stated that he had spoken to plaintiff’s attorney before he testified in court, but that the discussion was limited to the mechanics of appearing in court to testify. However, in court Davani testified in great detail about the purchase of the Property and that he was assisting Ali with the purchase of the Property because he was a friend of Ali’s.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In other words, Davani had no explanation as to why his memory of events that occurred over two decades was suddenly refreshed other than plaintiff’s attorney somehow refreshing Davani’s memory. For Davani to admit that his memory was refreshed would be to reveal that Plaintiff’s attorney had “prepped” him for his testimony, which of course would have undermined his credibility.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Davani was testifying as a longtime friend of Ali.&nbsp; Due to that friendship, the court discounts Davani’s credibility.&nbsp; The court specifically rejects Davani’s testimony that he reviewed Ali’s bank records before the purchase and concluded that Ali had the financial wherewithal to make the down payment without Tipu’s assistance. The court finds that Davani is not credible on this point. Davani did testify that he told Ali that the bank would require a co-signor on the loan because Ali had no source of income.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Davani could have testified in court consistent with his attorney’s letter (Exhibit 116) that he had no memory of events which occurred over two decades ago. Instead, Davani conveniently testified in detail from a mysteriously refreshed memory to help his friend Ali in this lawsuit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court also makes its credibility finding of Davani based on the court’s observations of his demeanor on the witness stand. The court finds that Davani is not credible based on EC section 780(a), (b), (c), (f) and (h).</div><div><br></div><div>(4)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Mohammad Alam</div><div>The court finds that Alam is not credible. Alam is one of the three other brothers of Ali. The main point of Alam’s testimony was to refute Tipu’s claim that Ali in 2019 wanted to raise the rent on his mother for the apartment and threatened her with eviction if she did not agree to pay the increased rent. Alam testified that he was in contact with his mother in 2019 and that she never informed him of Ali’s threats.&nbsp; He also offered testimony about how rent was paid during the time Tipu stepped in to collect rent and how rent was paid previously, and whether Ali was ever late in paying the mortgage. It is clear that Alam’s testimony was offered to boost Ali’s testimony. The court finds that Alam’s testimony is not credible. Alam’s testimony has limited value in the court’s view because he is a family member taking sides in an emotional family feud.&nbsp; His testimony was also at odds with other less controversial evidence presented.</div><div>The court also makes its credibility finding of Alam based on the court’s observations of his demeanor on the witness stand.

Sullivan. Ali’s completely uncorroborated testimony defied common sense in that no reasonable person would place themselves in legal jeopardy on a bank loan for $208,000 (in 1996 dollars) without also being on title for the property.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In addition, the plaintiff has not overcome the presumption of EC 662 that Tipu has legal and beneficial 50% legal title to the property as it appears on the deed. Plaintiff argues that cases have held that the fact that a party is on the deed to finance the transaction for the purpose of obtaining a bank loan is not dispositive in negating a resulting trust or defeating the presumption of title in EC section 662. Although the “per ser” ruling of In re Marriage of Brooks &amp; Robinson that the need for title if there is a bank loan negated the presumption of EC 662 was weakened by other cases such as Olson v. Olson and other cases, the courts ruled that the bank loan was a factor in the overall consideration of whether the presumption of EC 662 is overcome. The court’s ruling in granting the defendant’s motion, excluding its ruling on the statute of limitations, is based entirely on the finding that Ali is not credible. In other words, the court finds that Tipu is credible, and that Ali is not credible.&nbsp; Based on this credibility ruling alone the court is granting the defendant’s motion.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court also finds that that even if the court were to find Ali credible, the court would find that Ali’s completely uncorroborated testimony standing alone is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of EC 662 or to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof necessary to establish a resulting trust. In other words, Ali’s case suffers from a failure of proof both as to credibility and standard of proof.&nbsp; Ali has not presented clear and convincing evidence of the existence of a resulting trust, and also has not presented clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of EC section 662 that 50% title rests with Tipu as reflected in the deed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court finds that the conclusive presumption that defendant attempts to invoke in EC section 622 does not apply to “legal instruments” which are not a contract. A deed and loan documents are not a “legal instrument” amounting to a contract. See Quintanilla v. Dunkelman. The court finds that there is no written instrument evidencing an arms-length transaction between Ali and Tipu. The court finds that, if the court accepts the defendant’s argument on this issue, it will undermine the provisions of EC section 662 concerning the presumption (not conclusive presumption) of EC section 662.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court finds that the statute of frauds does not apply to the understanding and intention of the parties relating to the foundation needed for a finding of a resulting trust. In addition, the fact that a party may characterize the underlying understanding as “an oral agreement,” such a characterization would not change the result that a resulting trust comes into existence by an operation of law without the need for a writing.&nbsp; See Laing v. Laubach and Martin v. Kehl.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court finds that, in addition to the outcome that the Plaintiff’s case fails as a matter of proof, the cause of action relating to a resulting trust is barred by the four-year “catch all” statute of limitations found in CCP section 343. This statute of limitations applies to causes of action for a resulting trust. See Estate of Yool.&nbsp; The court finds that the statute of limitations began to run in 2008 and expired in 2012 with the lawsuit not being filed until July 9, 2020. See Estate of Yool.&nbsp; Repudiation can occur by conduct by way of evidence showing “hostility” to the notion of a resulting trust.&nbsp; See O’Brien.&nbsp; Tipu’s conduct in refusing to transfer title after Ali demanded it on three separate occasions demonstrates Tipu’s “hostility” and disagreement with the concept of a resulting trust.&nbsp; It is the providence of the court to determine the weight and effect of this evidence.&nbsp; See Airola v. Gorhan.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Since the First Cause of Action for Resulting Trust fails, so does plaintiff’s second cause of action to quiet title in his favor whereby he is seeking a ruling that Ali has 100% title and beneficial title. The ruling of the court is that Ali and Tipu both hold jointly and severally 50% legal and beneficial title.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant has elected to retain the following affirmative defenses of his answer to the First Amended Complaint: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 13.&nbsp; The court finds that defendant does not prevails on the 11th Affirmative defense asserting the presumption EC section 622, facts recited in written instrument. The defendant does not prevail on the other affirmative defenses based on a failure of proof or based in the inapplicability of the affirmative defenses to the facts presented at trial. The court otherwise notes that the affirmative defenses do not come into play (except affirmative defense number eleven) unless the plaintiff has carried his burden of proof, which the court has found Ali has not accomplished.</span></div><div><br></div><div>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The court hereby adopts for its tentative statement of decision all the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the analysis section for its tentative ruling on defendant’s motion for judgment pursuant to CCP section 631.8. In particular, the court’s conclusions of law are contained in the analysis of section of this ruling in favor of the defendant on his motion for judgment and in the above referenced ruling on the defendant’s motion for judgment. The court’s findings of fact for the tentative statement of decision are contained in the court’s credibility findings as to each witness who testified. Hence, the court is adopting defendant’s version of the facts for its tentative statement of decision such that the facts found in the section entitled Summary of Relevant Facts are adopted as the court’s factual findings as to those facts which are consistent with the defendant's version of events. Some portions of the Summary of Relevant Facts contain Plaintiff’s version of events and are identified as such, but the court is not adopting such facts asserted by the plaintiff as the correct and true facts for the case at bar. The court only included those plaintiff’s “facts” to give the proper background information for the analysis section of the court's tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment pursuant to CCP 631.8.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr></span></div>
