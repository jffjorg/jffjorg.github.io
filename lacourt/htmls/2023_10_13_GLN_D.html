The complaint alleges causes of action for strict product liability—defective design, negligence, strict product liability—failure to warn, and strict product liability—defective manufacturing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on February 21, 2023, Department 30 of the Personal Injury court determined that this action was complicated and ordered the case reassigned to this Department.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file also shows that in February of 2023, the parties entered into a Stipulation Re Good Faith Settlement and Mutual Waiver of Indemnity Claims, which was entered as the order of the court and filed on February 21, 2023.&nbsp; On February 24, 2023, plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal of the action with prejudice as to Home Depot only, which was entered as requested the same date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>By this motion, defendant Snow Joe, LLC seeks to compel plaintiff to submit to a medical examination.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 2032.220, any defendant may demand one physical examination of plaintiff “[i]n any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries...”&nbsp; &nbsp;This exam must satisfy two conditions; it must be conducted within 75 miles of the plaintiff’s residence, and it must not include “any diagnostic test or procedure that it painful, protracted, or intrusive.” CCP Section 2032.220(a)(1).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once a demand is served on plaintiff, the plaintiff “shall respond to the demand by a written statement that the examinee will comply with the demand as stated, will comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded physical examination.”&nbsp; CCP section 2032.230(a).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP Section 2032.230(b), such a response shall be served on defendant and the other parties “within twenty days after service of the demand...”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 2032.240:</div><div>“(a) If a plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any objection to the demand.”</div><div><br></div><div>Under subdivision (b):</div><div>“The defendant may move for an order compelling response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the moving papers establish a Second Amended Notice of Independent Medical Examination of Plaintiff with Dr. Michael Gold was served on plaintiff on April 28, 2023 for an examination to take place on June 28, 2023. [Lee Decl., para. 9, Ex. E].&nbsp; &nbsp; Plaintiff on May 11, 2021 served a timely objection to the demand, indicating plaintiff would present herself for the examination, on condition discovery was open, and subject to several enumerated conditions.&nbsp; [Lee Decl., para. 10, Ex. F].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers suggest that the parties met and conferred concerning the conditions included in the objection, including the objection that no mental examination would be allowed, and that there would be only one physical examination conducted in this case.&nbsp; [See Ex. F, paras. 12, 14].&nbsp; The meet and confer indicates that the parties agreed that the neurological expert would conduct an examination of a neurological nature, “as well as of a mental examination to the extent that it would be similar to the “mental status” testing that your neurologist expert Dr. Eskenazi performed when he conducted his IME of Plaintiff.”&nbsp; [Lee Decl., para. 11, Ex. G].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, the parties were unable to reach agreement on plaintiff’s request that defendant agree that the Dr. Gold examination would be the only IME conducted in this case.&nbsp; [Ex. G].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant accordingly seeks an order from this court compelling plaintiff to submit to the medical examination proposed at Dr. Gold’s next available date on October 30, 2023, without the condition that the examination be the only examination in this matter but preserving defendant’s right to seek further examinations based on a showing of good cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This response is appropriate under CCP section 2023.250, which provides:</div><div>“(a) If a defendant who has demanded a physical examination under this article, on receipt of the plaintiff's response to that demand, deems that any modification of the demand, or any refusal to submit to the physical examination is unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order compelling compliance with the demand. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It is undisputed that plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries in this case and is claiming neurological damage.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants have noticed a physical examination, at an office in Santa Monica, and there is no showing this is not within 75 miles of plaintiff’s residence.&nbsp; Although a timely objection was filed, defendant under CCP section 2032.240 (b) and CCP section 2032.250 (a) may file a motion to compel attendance over objection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that what defendant failed to disclose to the court in the moving papers is that plaintiff in fact appeared for her medical examination as noticed on June 28, 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff indicates that since she did not receive notice of cancellation of the examination or a motion to compel examination despite her objections, she assumed her objections and conditions had been found acceptable.&nbsp; [Kayne Decl., para. 5].&nbsp; Upon arrival for the examination, plaintiff was informed by Dr. Gold’s office that the examination had been cancelled and rescheduled.&nbsp; [Kayne Decl., para. 8].&nbsp; Plaintiff appears to argue that she has accordingly appeared for one examination, and so defendant’s motion is improper, as it must establish good cause for plaintiff to appear for a second medical examination.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears from the opposition that no medical examination was in fact conducted on June 28, 2023.&nbsp; This situation is an unfortunate circumstance, as the parties had reached an impasse, but it could have been made clearer that the examination was being cancelled and a motion being filed, or that the examination was being conducted without agreement to the objection concerning the subject examination being the only one permitted.&nbsp; It could have also been made clearer in the moving papers that plaintiff in fact appeared for the June 28, 2023 examination, as this motion was filed on June 29, 2023, after the appearance had already occurred.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, the court does not find that plaintiff is being requested to submit to a second medical examination under the circumstances, when no initial examination was in fact conducted.&nbsp; Even if plaintiff’s appearance at the noticed time and place could constitute submission to one medical examination, there is sufficient good cause to compel the examination established here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff indicates in her opposition that as for any further examination in October, defendant has not filed a demand for such an examination pursuant to CCP section 2032.220.&nbsp; Plaintiff indicates that had such a demand been received, plaintiff would have made an appropriate objection, and if plaintiff’s objections were unwarranted, defendant could have then moved for an order compelling plaintiff’s appearance at that medical examination, and the parties with the court’s assistance could have resolved their disagreements.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that given defendant’s failure to comply with CCP section 2032.220, the motion should be denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What is sought here is compliance with the Second Amended Notice, and its terms, which are set forth verbatim in the Notice and again in the declaration in support of the motion, but on a different date.&nbsp; [See Lee para. 12].&nbsp; As noted above, plaintiff has already filed objections to that notice, and agreed that the only remaining point of contention between the parties is the condition that plaintiff will submit to one and only one medical examination in this matter.&nbsp; The court accordingly orders plaintiff to appear for a continued examination as noticed, and subject to plaintiff’s previously served objections, with the exceptions noted below.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff seems to argue that her objection concerning prohibiting any second medical examination is proper.&nbsp; Plaintiff acknowledges that defendant is entitled to one examination under CCP section 2023.220, which will be the current examination.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both sides also recognize that under CCP section 2032.310 (a), if a second physical examination or mental examination is sought by any party, “the party shall obtain leave of court,” and that under CCP section 2032.320 (a), the court shall grant such a motion “only for good cause shown.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Weil &amp; Brown note in connection with mental and physical exams, the court may order more than one examination, each to be justified by “good cause:”</div><div>“Where plaintiff’s injuries are complex, several exams may be necessary by specialists in different fields.&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of physical or mental exams that may be ordered on a showing of good cause.&nbsp; The good cause requirement checks any potential of harassment of plaintiff.&nbsp; [Shapira v. Sup. Ct. (Sylvestri) (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1249, 1255… (citing text)—second mental examination may be ordered.”&nbsp;</div><div>Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group, 2023 rev.) 8:1558.5 (italics in original).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both sides cite to Shapira, in which the court of appeal vacated a trial court order denying a motion to compel a second mental examination by a different mental specialist, finding that there was no limitation on the number of mental examinations which could be ordered, and directing the trial court to determine if good cause had been established for the second exam.</div><div><br></div><div>There is no motion currently before this court to conduct a second examination, other than the one defendant to which the defendant is entitled to as a matter of right, so the issue of good cause is not before the court with respect to any other examinations.&nbsp; As noted above, even if the motion were to require good cause for the initial examination, the court would have found such good cause has been established given the nature of the injuries plaintiff is claiming, and the fact that no previous examination actually commenced or was conducted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant does not seek a second or third examination by this motion, which relief would require the service of demands for examination on plaintiff, and, if the parties do not stipulate, separate noticed motions showing good cause.&nbsp; Defendant seeks by this motion to obtain an order to preserve its right to request further examinations, and bring further motions, if necessary.&nbsp; Defendant seeks to keep the record clear that defendant is not proceeding with the examination as noticed in agreement with plaintiff’s written objection that, “This will be the only physical examination conducted in this case.”&nbsp; [Ex. F, para. 14].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Given the procedural right to seek further examinations, the court orders the examination noticed by the Second Amended Notice to be conducted on a date certain but the court overrules plaintiff’s objection that the examination will be the only physical examination. The order is without prejudice to plaintiff objecting to, or arguing that, any further examination, if sought, are not warranted by good cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court has also noted that the meet and confer correspondence indicates that the parties have agreed that with respect plaintiff’s written objection that “No mental examination will be allowed,” that the neurological expert will conduct an examination of a neurological nature, “as well as of a mental examination to the extent that it would be similar to the ‘mental status’ testing that [plaintiff’s] neurologist expert Dr. Eskenazi performed when he conducted his IME of Plaintiff.”&nbsp; [Ex. F, para. 12, Ex.

(Padley decl. ¿ 14.) Defendant, however, has not provided any competent and admissible evidence to support this conclusion. For instance, there is no evidence presented that Decedent had a choice of whether Defendant’s staff placed a high-fall-risk sign in Decedent’s room, placed a wristband on Decedent’s wrist, lowered the bed to the lowest possible setting, gave him a call light, and/or placed Decedent’s belongings close to him. Or that a patient has the right to choose what fall precautions will apply to him.</div><div><br></div><div>On the contrary, if Nurse Polanco knew that Decedent was a high fall risk, and that patients in the oncology department could suffer severe injuries from falls given their condition, Nurse Polanco should have activated the bed alarm since preventing Decedent’s fall was a high priority. Whether failing to activate the bed alarm was negligent, is a factual issue to be determined by the trier of fact, and this breach would be obvious to laymen.”</div><div>[Opposition, p. 9:13-25].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As argued in the reply, this is not a case where the standard of properly treating decedent as a patient with a fall risk at a particular level would be obvious to a layperson, and simply setting out the argument concerning when a bed alarm should be activated, without reference to any standard in the industry, or expert to explain it, would not permit the trier of fact to fairly disregard the expert testimony presented by defendant.&nbsp; Similarly, the implied argument that a patient should not have a right to choose what fall protocols apply to him is also beyond common knowledge in a hospital setting in an oncology unit, and expert testimony is appropriately offered by defendant, and no expert evidence to submitted by plaintiffs to refute the experts’ opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The cases in which matters are sufficiently obvious to a layperson and where an expert’s opinions can be disregarded include cases such as Westbrooks v.

We conclude that the expert testimony and photographs regarding the size and shape of the crack do not create a triable issue whether there was a substantial risk of injury.”</div><div>Caloroso, at 928.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This situation does not appear to be such a case, or one in which this court can as a matter of law determine that no expert testimony is warranted.&nbsp; As argued in the reply, this case deals with the medical decision making done by medical professionals in the context of complicated medical care.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs have accordingly failed to show that defendant has not met its initial burden of production to shift the burden to plaintiffs and have also failed to raise triable issues of material fact on the issue of breach of the standard of care.&nbsp; Defendant has shown that plaintiffs cannot establish this essential element of their second cause of action for medical malpractice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Negligence—Premises Liability</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion also argues that plaintiffs will be unable to establish their first cause of action for negligence based on premises liability.</span></div><div><br></div><div>A premises liability cause of action will lie where the following elements are established: Defendant owned, leased, occupied or controlled the property; defendant was negligent in the use or maintenance of the property, plaintiff was harmed, and defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.&nbsp; CACI 1000.</div><div><br></div><div>Civil Code § 1714(a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Accordingly, it is recognized that every landowner has a duty to maintain property in his possession or control in a reasonably safe condition.&nbsp; Ann M. v.

The motion to strike was granted in part, but the order was stayed.&nbsp; Plaintiffs were ordered to file a noticed motion seeking an order to permit plaintiffs to proceed anonymously, addressing the appropriate standards as set forth in Department of Fair Housing v. Superior Court (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 105.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal in Department of Fair Housing set forth the proper procedure to be followed:</div><div>“Procedurally, because a hearing is required, a party who wants to proceed anonymously will file the initial complaint or petition conditionally under a pseudonym and then move for an order granting permission to proceed that way. If the request is granted, the initial pleading can remain. If pseudonym use is denied, the pleading must be amended to state the party's true name.”</div><div>Department of Fair Housing, at 111, n. 1.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A motion to permit plaintiffs to proceed using pseudonyms is now scheduled for hearing on January 12, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file also shows that on September 9, 2023, after the filing of this motion on August 8, 2023, defendant Maria Raquenel Portillo Jimenez (Portillo), as cross-complainant, filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint, which identifies cross-defendants as Andrade Sanchez, with the remaining cross-defendants identified by Doe and Roe designations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>The filing of the First Amended Cross-Complaint renders the motion to seal moot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant and cross-complainant Portillo brings this motion to seal, indicating it is brought out of deference to the current posture of the litigation, where plaintiffs are proceeding anonymously as “Jane Does,” and are seeking to obtain an order permitting them to do so.&nbsp; As noted above, there has not yet been an order obtained concerning whether plaintiffs will be permitted to proceed anonymously or will be required to disclose their identities in the public record of the court files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant indicates that the documents affiliated with the cross-complaint, a Request for Judicial Notice, the cross-complaint, summons, demand for jury trial and notice of posting jury fees all refer to plaintiffs and cross-defendants by name, and also necessarily contain other information that could be used to identify the Jane Does.&nbsp; A review of the FACC on file shows that the Roe cross-defendants are the mothers and fathers of the Doe parties, and that disclosure of their sur-names and identifying information would likely provide information which would jeopardize the anonymous status of the plaintiffs, if they are ultimately permitted to proceed anonymously.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that the situation with the cross-complaint has been addressed without the need for a sealing order, by the filing of the FACC which uses the Doe and Roe designations.&nbsp; As suggested in Department of Fair Housing, above, if plaintiffs are ultimately not permitted to proceed anonymously, cross-complainant would be permitted leave to amend the cross-complaint to name the parties.</div><div><br></div><div>The demand for jury trial filed on August 7, 2023, which included redactions, has similarly been superseded by the filing on September 1, 2023 of a demand for jury trial which does not include redactions or identifying information, but also uses the Doe and Roe designations.&nbsp; &nbsp;The motion to seal accordingly is taken off calendar as moot.&nbsp; The demand for jury trial filed on August 7, 2023 is ordered stricken.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Request for Judicial Notice filed on August 7, 2023, with various redactions, does not appear to be relevant to any currently pending motion filed by cross-complainant.&nbsp; The Request for Judicial Notice accordingly is ordered stricken.&nbsp; There will be no need for a sealing order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The summons referred to by cross-complainant, filed on August 7, 2023, also includes redacted material concerning the identity of some of the cross-defendants.&nbsp; The summons is ordered stricken, without prejudice to cross-complainant filing a summons without redaction and without identifying information not included as was successfully done in the First Amended Cross-Complaint and the amended Demand for Jury Trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court does not locate in the file a notice of posting jury fees, so such a document is not addressed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes that it has previously returned to the cross-complainant all documents lodged conditionally under seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>RULING:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>UNOPPOSED Supplemental Verified Application of Caroline Whitlock for Admission Pro Hac Vice is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Court finds that the verified application complies with all requirements of CRC Rule 9.40 and that the applicant has provided sufficient proof of service on the State Bar and payment of the requisite fee.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion to Seal Judicial Notice, Cross-Complaint, Summons of Cross-Complaint, Demand for Jury is DENIED AS MOOT.&nbsp;</div><div>The Court notes the filing of a First Amended Cross-Complaint on September 1, 2023, which names the Cross-Defendants sought by the motion to be identified in a document under seal.

The sanctions also include 2 hours in each motion to prepare for and attend the hearing, when all four motions will be heard together.&nbsp; This attorney time is reduced to 1 hour which 1 hour covers the attorney appearance to all 4 motions.&nbsp; The sanctions will be reduced accordingly, as follows: 1 hour attorney time is deducted from each of the motions reducing the attorney fees for each motion from $990.00 to $770.00 for each motion with $880.00 awarded on the motion to compel special interrogatories for attendance at the hearing on all 4 motions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No opposition]</div><div>Defendant Mohave Transportation Insurance Company’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff Angela Mendoza’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff Angela Mendoza is ordered to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories—General, Set No. One, without objection, within 10 days.</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:&nbsp;

(Kwan v. Mercedes–Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371.) It is also consistent with the Department of Consumer Affairs' regulations which interpret the Act to protect “any individual to whom the vehicle is transferred during the duration of a written warranty.” (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 16, § 3396.1, subd. (g).)</div><div><br></div><div>Addressing the final step in statutory construction which applies reason, practicality, and common sense to the language in question (Halbert's Lumber, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1239, 8 Cal.Rptr.2d 298), BMW argues the Legislature could not have intended to grant protection to every used car with a balance remaining on the new car warranty because of the economic impact on consumers. Specifically, BMW maintains “[t]he subsequent owner would have the benefit of all of Song–Beverly's generous presumptions, without having undertaken the same risks as the purchaser of a really new car. Further, while the subsequent (perhaps third or fourth in the line of owners) will receive the benefit of these presumptions, the manufacturer will find it tremendously more difficult to raise defenses under Song–Beverly—such as the defense that the owner used the vehicle unreasonably—because it will be harder to trace multiple owners and determine their use or abuse of the vehicle.” BMW contends the increased costs will result in higher car prices or the shortening of warranties to the statutory minimum. It argues “[t]hese alternatives would inevitably result in a manifest decline in trade and commerce in this state, creating great inconvenience for consumers. It is impossible that the legislature intended this highly intractable result.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We acknowledge manufacturers such as BMW incur costs in honoring express warranties to service and repair the cars they sell in this state. We also presume the decision to offer a warranty of a specified length involves weighing the benefit of increased sales against the cost of providing service and repair for the effective duration of the warranty. It may be the equation factors in the impact of resale during the warranty period. However, as noted by BMW, manufacturers are free to change the terms of express warranties they offer. The Act merely reflects the Legislature's intent to make car manufacturers live up to their express warranties, whatever the duration of coverage.</div><div>Jensen, at 126-127, footnote omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As pointed out in the opposition, this holding by the Third District court of appeal in Jensen, that the Song-Beverly Act applies to cars sold with a balance remaining on the new motor vehicle warranty, including used cars, has been upheld and followed in decades of cases, and California consumers have been reassured that vehicle manufacturers had to honor their express warranties, even those accompanying used vehicles.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant relies on the Fourth District court of appeal’s 2022 decision in Rodriguez v.

We conclude it does not and that the phrase functions instead as a catchall for sales of essentially new vehicles where the applicable warranty was issued with the sale.”</div><div>Rodriguez, at 215, italics in the original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal in Rodriguez considered the plain language of the statute and concluded that the definition of new vehicle does not extend to used vehicles, other than a narrow class of vehicles—those previously driven, but basically new, in effect, not previously sold.&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 220.&nbsp; The conclusion was based on an analysis of the language and the nature or demonstrator vehicles:</span></div><div>“Plaintiffs argue the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” describes their truck because it still had a balance remaining on an express warranty from the manufacturer—the limited powertrain warranty—when Pacific Auto Center sold it to them. FCA argues the phrase qualifies dealer-owned cars and demonstrators and thus refers to vehicles that, like those two types of vehicles, have not been previously sold and are sold with new or full warranties. FCA argues plaintiffs' interpretation is at odds with the rest of the Act's definition of “new motor vehicles.” While we acknowledge that in isolation the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” could arguably refer to any car sold with a manufacturer's warranty still in force, we agree with FCA that context clearly requires a more narrow interpretation. Context is a fundamental aspect of statutory interpretation, and here it's key to discerning the phrase's meaning. (Kirzhner, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 972, 266 Cal.Rptr.3d 346, 470 P.3d 56 [“We do not consider statutory language in isolation; instead, we examine the entire statute to construe the words in context”].)</div><div><br></div><div>To begin with, the phrase appears in a definition of new motor vehicles. That fact alone strongly suggests the Legislature did not intend the phrase to refer to used (i.e., previously sold) vehicles. But, more importantly, the phrase is preceded by “a dealer-owned vehicle and demonstrator,” which comprise a specific and narrow class of vehicles. Though they have not been previously sold to a consumer, demonstrators and dealer-owned cars are used in the sense that they will have been driven for various purposes before sale. As such, they will necessarily have more miles on their odometers than the typical vehicle in a dealer's new car inventory. What makes these vehicles unique is that even though they aren't technically new, manufacturers (or their dealer-representatives) treat them as such upon sale by providing the same type of manufacturer's warranty that accompanies new cars.</div><div>In other words, demonstrators and dealer-owned vehicles comprise a narrow category of basically new vehicles—they have never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express warranties. Given this context, we think the most natural interpretation of the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” is that it, too, refers to vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.</div><div>Rodriguez, at 219-220, italics in original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal also addressed certain questions raised by interpreting the phrase to include vehicles with a manufacturer warranty remaining, such as, for example, whether a buyer who purchases a used car with only a few miles remaining on the original warranty would be entitled to the same protections as the original buyer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rodriguez, at 221.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court also considered the Act as a whole, and other references to used or previously owned products:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></span></div><div>“Our examination of the entire Act yields two additional reasons for concluding the phrase doesn't cover subsequent sales of vehicles with unexpired manufacturer's warranties. First, the Act defines “express warranty” as any “written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good pursuant to which the manufacturer ... undertakes to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the consumer good ....” (§ 1791.2, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) In plaintiffs' case, the limited powertrain warranty did not “aris[e] out of” the sale, it transferred to plaintiffs by operation of law along with title to the truck. The warranty arose from the initial sale to the truck's first buyer.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, as part of the Motor Vehicle Warranty Adjustment Programs (§§ 1795.90-1795.93), the Act requires manufacturers to notify all “consumers” of any warranty adjustments regarding safety or emissions-related recalls and defines “consumer” as “any person to whom the motor vehicle is transferred during the duration of an express warranty.” (§ 1795.90, subd. (a), italics added.) This definition of “consumer” indicates the Legislature is aware of the distinction between warranties that arise out of a sale and those that transfer to subsequent purchasers as a result of a sale. The lack of reference to transferred warranties in the definition of “new motor vehicle” suggests the Legislature made a deliberate choice not to include sales of used vehicles accompanied by unexpired express warranties.</div><div><br></div><div>Based on all of these textual reasons, we conclude the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” unambiguously refers to cars that come with a new or full express warranty.”</div><div>Rodriguez, at 222, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court of appeal characterized the issue as one of first impression: “no California court has addressed whether a used car purchased from a retail seller unaffiliated with the manufacturer qualifies as a ‘new motor vehicle’ simply because there is some balance remaining on the manufacturer’s warranty.”&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 223.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court distinguished the Jensen case on the ground that factually the case involved a vehicle which had been represented to have been previously used as a demonstrator but had not in fact been used as a demonstrator, as the result of which the dealership leasing the vehicle to Jensen gave her a warranty “on top” of the miles already on the odometer.&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 223-224.&nbsp; The court of appeal reasoned that the Jensen case reached its conclusion when the manufacturer tried to use the fact that the vehicle had never actually been a demonstrator to its advantage. The Rodriguez court of appeal indicated that Jensen was “easily distinguishable,” because it involved “a lease by a manufacturer-affiliated dealer who issued a full new car warranty along with the lease.”&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 223, italics in the original.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal concluded:</span></div><div>“Having examined the statutory provision, its place within the Act as a whole, and its legislative history, we conclude the phrase “other motor vehicles sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” refers to cars sold with a full warranty, not to previously sold cars accompanied by some balance of the original warranty.’</div><div>Rodriguez, at 225.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, according to the Standing Order and the order of the Supreme Court granting review, pursuant to the current posture of Rodriguez being reviewed by the California Supreme Court, this court has discretion to consider Rodriguez persuasive, and to consider it conflicting precedent, and, to the extent there is a conflict, choose between the conflicting decisions, pursuant to Auto Equity Sales.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that Jensen should be treated as the&nbsp; controlling precedent, as it captures the remedial spirit and pro-consumer impetus of the Act, while Rodriguez essentially overlooks&nbsp; long-standing precedent protecting consumers of used vehicles sold with a remaining balance of a manufacturer’s new warranty, and that a finding for Rodriguez would essentially marginalize a class of consumers on the basis of their inability to afford a new vehicle, which is inconsistent with the remedial purpose of Song-Veverly.&nbsp; &nbsp; The opposition also argues that Jensen’s interpretation of the Act’s “new motor vehicle” provision and the “other vehicles” language is rooted in public policy and reflects the Legislature’s intent.&nbsp; Jensen at 128.&nbsp; It also appears that Jensen’s conclusions concerning the definition of new vehicle for purposes of application of the Song-Beverly Act was broader than suggested by Rodriguez, creating a conflict between the analysis and conclusions in the two cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also argues that under both Jensen and Rodriguez, the definition of “new” as applied by the case law would apply to dealer owned commercial/occupation fleet vehicles, and that the facts of this case present a strong likelihood that plaintiff’s vehicle was in fact such a vehicle.&nbsp; This assertion is not currently alleged in the complaint, and the court will consider the argument only, if necessary, in connection with whether leave to amend will be necessary or permitted.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it appears that the situation here is distinguishable from the concerns raised in Rodriguez.&nbsp; However, to the extent Jensen’s conclusions concerning the definition of new vehicle for purposes of application of the Song-Beverly Act was broader than suggested by Rodriguez, creating a conflict between the analysis and conclusions in the two cases, as set forth above, under Auto Equity Sales, “the court exercising inferior jurisdiction can and must make a choice between the conflicting decisions.”&nbsp; Auto Equity Sales, at 456.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>This court has carefully reviewed the analysis of both Jensen, and Rodriguez, as well as the language of the statutory provision, and the competing treatment in each decision of the overall provisions in consumer protection law, and the legislative history.&nbsp; The court has also noted the court of appeal concession in Rodriguez that in the statute itself the operative plain language could refer to any car sold with a manufacturer’s warranty in force.&nbsp; The court has also considered the consumer protection focus of the Jensen court, and its conclusion that its definition is consistent with the Song-Beverly Act’s purpose as a remedial measure.&nbsp; It appears that a new interpretation of the statute after many years of the industry and consumers operating under a contrary interpretation should be best addressed by the legislature.&nbsp; This court at this juncture accordingly opts to apply the analysis set forth in Jensen, finding that the reasoning is sound.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Defendant also argues that the second cause of action for breach of implied warranty is barred because the Song-Beverly Act does not support implied warranty claims against a manufacturer for used cars, as such claims require privity, which requires that defendant and plaintiff be in adjoining links of the distribution chain.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that plaintiff does not allege that he bought the vehicle from defendant Ford, or even an authorized dealer, but that plaintiff bought the vehicle from a dealer plaintiff does not identify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Again, this does not appear from the face of the pleading, and there does not appear to be any authority cited under which there is an affirmative pleading requirement to allege from whom the vehicle was purchased or leased, when the alleged basis of the claim is the warranty.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion also concedes that privity may not be a barrier to a Song-Beverly claim in certain circumstances, but that the exceptions are limited.&nbsp; However, defendant does not set forth any authority concerning the exceptions, or whether an exception is required to be affirmatively alleged in a pleading.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that case law interpreting implied warranties is irrelevant for express warranty claims, specifically, that applying the express provisions of the Song-Beverly Act, not general implied warranty authorities, Section 1792 requires manufacturers to provide implied warranties to “new” consumer goods, without providing a special statutory definition of that term, while the refund or replace provisions set forth the special definition set forth above, which includes vehicles sold with a balance on the original manufacturer’s warranty, and this specific definition overrides any commonly understood definition applied to undefined terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal in Jensen rejected arguments similar to those raised by defendant here with respect to the implied warranty recognized in Song-Beverly Act actions.&nbsp; Jensen, at 126 (“the more specific definition found in the current section 1793.22 governs the more general definition found in section 1791,” citation omitted); Jensen, at 128 (“the Act applies to new motor manufacturers who make express warranties. (§§ 1791.2 and 1793.2.)&nbsp; There is no privity requirement.”); see also Kiluk v.
